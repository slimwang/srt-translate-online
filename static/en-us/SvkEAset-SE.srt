1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,385
Okay.

2
00:00:00,387 --> 00:00:05,065
Let's look at negative powers of ten. Okay, remember, zero is neither positive

3
00:00:05,077 --> 00:00:09,195
nor negative. But, my first negative power would be 10 to the negative 1, then I

4
00:00:09,207 --> 00:00:12,425
have 10 to the negative 2, or 10 to the negative 3. I know 10 to the 0 is 1,

5
00:00:12,527 --> 00:00:17,165
because anything to the 0 power is 1. For negative exponents, remember, I take

6
00:00:17,177 --> 00:00:22,689
the reciprocal of the number. So, I have 1 10th to the 1, or 1 10th. For 10 to

7
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:29,716
the negative 2, I have 1 10th squared, or 1 10th times 1 10th, which is 100th.

8
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:37,014
For 10 to the negative 3, I have the reciprocal of 10, because the exponent's

9
00:00:37,026 --> 00:00:44,316
negative. And it becomes a three. 1 10th cubed is just 1 10th times 1 10th times

10
00:00:44,328 --> 00:00:51,567
1 10th, or 1 1000th. So, I have 1, I have 1 10th. 1 10th is the same thing as

11
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:59,047
the decimal point 1 because the 1 is in the tenth spot. 1 100th here, it's 01.

12
00:00:59,156 --> 00:01:04,346
because the 1 is in the hundredth's place. And then, I have 1 1000th. I know

13
00:01:04,358 --> 00:01:07,200
it's 1 1000th because the 1 is in the thousandth space.
