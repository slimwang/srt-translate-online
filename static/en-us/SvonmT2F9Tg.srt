1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,570
Ticket type. Are they buying VIP or general admission?

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,620
>> Yep. Maybe number of tickets purchased, or I guess

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,390
you can infer that based off of ticket type. Yeah

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:08,580
>> Let's not make them do that.

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,370
>> Maybe the purchase source, cause they

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,740
care where most of their stuff's coming from?

7
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:13,740
>> Sure. Sure.

8
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,000
>> But yeah, you can keep modifying this, like, Save As, do a

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,780
couple different reports showing different data if

10
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,040
you had a lot of different fields.

11
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,320
>> Okay, so should I save this now?

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,210
>> So yeah, let's save it for now. but we want to

13
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:25,730
keep going.

14
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,170
>> So what we're doing here basically we're, our goal is

15
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:33,170
to make this, this you know gauge this little odometer looking thing.

16
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,310
>> Mm-hm. But, as long as we're making this report, we're just, kind

17
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,470
of, figuring out all of the information that might be relevant to convey.

18
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,000
>> Right.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,580
>> Okay.
