1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,190
Jake did you work this one out?

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:02,719
>> Yeah, I did.

3
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:04,860
I'll walk you through it.

4
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,860
To open the database I'm
going to call idb.open.

5
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,960
Passing in Witter is the name,
one is the version number.

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,020
And now I'm going to write my
upgrade function to set it all up.

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,990
Since I'm on version one, I'm not going
to do the whole switch statement thing.

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,370
I'll introduce a version
two if I have to.

9
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,570
To set up the database,

10
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:26,230
I'm going to create an object store
named witters with a key path of id.

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,510
That means it will treat the id
property of objects in the store

12
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,400
as the primary key.

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,840
I'm also going to create an index on
the store called by-date which indexes

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,730
on the time property of stored objects.

15
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,570
Over in the browser, I'm going to use
force update, reload the page, and

16
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,590
now in the resources panel,
I can see the new witters database,

17
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,210
along with the witters store and
the by-date index.

18
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,620
Now, we need to get
items into the store.

19
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,510
I'm going to start by creating a read
write transaction for the witters store.

20
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:58,840
Then I'll get hold of the store.

21
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,610
And then loop through these messages and
put each one into the store.

22
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,738
Back to the browser, I reload the page
and then the resources panel,

23
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,871
I can see messages in the database.
