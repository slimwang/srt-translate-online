1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,750
To drill down for a minute into this question of data transport ability.

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:10,090
This is sometimes called serialization in Java, or marshaling, or even pickling.

3
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:14,590
Some of the differences that might arrive have to do with bit order. Yes,

4
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:19,170
some machines order the bits from high order to low order in different orders.

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,390
Byte orders within a word. Different character sets that are used. Alignment,

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,850
that is, whether, particular pieces of data are aligned on word boundaries or

7
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:34,080
byte boundaries. Okay? And then the whole question of word length. Now we have,

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,740
of course, 64-bit, words, but other machines are only 32-bits. And,

9
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:44,590
of course there are, uses, of, data storage in which we wish to use

10
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:49,740
less than a full word. Even after these, differences are resolved there's still

11
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:54,010
the question of how the various pieces of some complex data are,

12
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:59,080
are, are organized. Okay? Must they be kept in a certain order? Can they be,

13
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:04,560
can they be shuffled around in order to compact them? These days,

14
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,763
many, approaches to data representation include self-definition. That is,

15
00:01:09,763 --> 00:01:11,781
not only are you communicating with data, but

16
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:14,732
you're communicating at a description of the data. That,

17
00:01:14,732 --> 00:01:19,950
can then be decoded at the other end. Fortunately, various, standards have,

18
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,180
arisen to address these kinds of questions. Internet standard x680 is one, and

19
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:30,660
then on the commercial side Google has developed the idea of protocol buffers.

20
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,590
Which are descriptions of data.

21
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:37,400
Which then can be incorporated into your applications for

22
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,160
communication among the pieces and interpretation at either end by an API.
