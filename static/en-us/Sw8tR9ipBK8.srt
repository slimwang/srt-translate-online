00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,840
Let's start with an informal definition of software architecture. It is

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,143
the organization or the breakdown of the system in to component subsystems or

3
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:14,410
modules. Architecture is almost universally done in layers.

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,900
That is, there's a most abstract version, and

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,600
then the components of the abstract version are broken down into sub-components,

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,820
subsystems and so on, until we get to a level, a low enough level where things

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,670
can actually be implemented. So, for architectures as we mentioned a second ago,

8
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,940
often also make use of a stereotypical architectural styles and

9
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,920
we'll be looking into those styles in this lesson.
