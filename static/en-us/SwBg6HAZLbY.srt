1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,358
So the quiz said to change the width and
the height to be wrap content.

2
00:00:03,358 --> 00:00:07,258
Now these device don't have to
match every single time, so

3
00:00:07,258 --> 00:00:12,329
I can set one to be wrap content and the
other to be a fixed value like 150dp.

4
00:00:12,329 --> 00:00:14,740
And then you see it update here.

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:19,200
And then we see that happily
the text view size has now shrunk to

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,220
fit the content inside of it.

7
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:26,010
So, its only as wide and tall as
the happy birthday text inside of it.

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:26,610
Great.
So

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,590
now the second part of the quiz
was to change the text that it's

10
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,670
a lot longer than just one line of text.

11
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,530
We want it to go to two lines
of text on the device here.

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,080
Let's change the text inside
that quotation marks here.

13
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,326
I'm going to pick
the Happy Birthday song.

14
00:00:42,326 --> 00:00:48,714
So happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you,

15
00:00:48,714 --> 00:00:55,571
happy birthday dear Jennie,
happy birthday to you.

16
00:00:55,571 --> 00:00:58,396
Jennie's our teammate,
who keeps us on track and

17
00:00:58,396 --> 00:01:01,771
makes sure that we're shipping
this course to you on time.

18
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:04,206
Okay, so
now we see that the text view, and

19
00:01:04,206 --> 00:01:08,610
just marked by this great background,
has now expanded in height because now

20
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,450
there's more text inside
of this text view.

21
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:12,360
That's pretty cool.

22
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,480
It did that automatically without
having to change the width manually.
