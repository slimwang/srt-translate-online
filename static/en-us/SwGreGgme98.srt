1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,370
Complete mediation actually comes about,
or we have that,

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,140
because of one other thing
the operating system does.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,250
So at user level,
we have what we call virtual resources.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,290
We don't have physical resources.

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,200
There is no way for
user code to actually name or be able to

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,660
target a physical resource, or
ask for a physical resource.

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,580
There you have only virtual resources,
and the operating system actually

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,250
gives you an API in how those
virtual resources can be used.

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:36,150
An example of this is that for
storing persistent data, we have file

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:41,800
abstraction, or virtual resource for
storing persistent data is a file.

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,760
So you don't access a disk lock.

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,970
The operating system does disk IO, and
schedule requests to read the blocks,

13
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,700
and services interrupts,
and things like that.

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,495
It can interact through
the disk controller.

15
00:00:55,495 --> 00:00:57,711
Through those instructions
we're talking about.

16
00:00:57,711 --> 00:01:00,141
But you cannot from user space.

17
00:01:00,141 --> 00:01:04,299
You can only ask for
access to files either opening them or

18
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:06,960
reading them or writing them.

19
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,810
And things like that.

20
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,190
So at the user level,

21
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,770
we don't have ways of directly
talking to the disk controller,

22
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:19,740
the low level hardware functions
that operating system has access to.

23
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,050
We only have these virtual resources.

24
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:26,520
As a result of that, remember virtual
resources are what the name says.

25
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,290
They are not the real resources,

26
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,400
they have to be implemented
using physical resource.

27
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,990
The file has to be implemented
with a bunch of disc locks

28
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,908
where the file data is stored.

29
00:01:36,908 --> 00:01:41,370
So the virtual resource has to be
translated to physical handles or

30
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,560
resources.

31
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,570
For example, buffers or
file data is stored on things like that.

32
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,750
And this translation is done,

33
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,710
from virtual to physical, implementation
is done by the operating system.

34
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:57,390
If you want to access a disc block or
a phase of memory,

35
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,400
you have to start with
either a file descriptor, or

36
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,560
you start with a logical address we're
talking about, or the virtual address.

37
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,220
And the translation from
virtual to physical

38
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,520
is the first step before you
can get to the physical.

39
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,320
Only the operating system
knows how to do that.

40
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,180
Or has the metadata, or has the control
information, that can be used for

41
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,320
this translation.

42
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,010
So this level of sort of indirection
that we add where you have

43
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:30,360
one kind of namespace and the underlying
resources have a different namespace.

44
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,890
And the translation can only be
done by the operating system, or

45
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,095
the trusted computing base.

46
00:02:36,095 --> 00:02:39,170
Well that helps you get
complete mediation,

47
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:42,230
because you first need to go
have the translation done.

48
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:45,250
Okay, then you have to go to
the trusted computing base,

49
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,970
so the complete mediation gets
implemented right then and there,

50
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,050
because you're coming to it, and
asking for a physical resource.

51
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,820
So it could be the reference monitor.

52
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,480
It can check at that point,

53
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,780
that whatever that you are asking for,
do you have access to it?
