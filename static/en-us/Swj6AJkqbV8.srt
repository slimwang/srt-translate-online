1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,280
There are two fundamentally
different ways to create and

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,500
store images and this affects how
you deploy images responsibly.

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,040
Raster and vector.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,050
Raster images, photographs and

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,040
other images represented as a grid
of individual dots of color.

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,500
Raster images might
come from a camera or

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,520
a scanner, or
be created with the HTML canvas element.

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,620
Vector images, images such as logos and
line art, which can be defined

9
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:35,020
as a set of curves, lines, shapes,
fill colors and gradients.

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,790
Vector images can be created with
programs like Adobe Illustrator or

11
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:44,290
Inkscape, or
from using a vector format such as SVG.

12
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:48,560
SVG makes it possible to include
responsive vector graphics in a web

13
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,520
page, and
we'll talk more about this format later.

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,710
The advantage of vector file formats
over raster file formats is that

15
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,000
the browser can render
a vector image at any size.

16
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:04,030
After all, vector formats describe
the geometry of the image.

17
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,830
How it's constructed from lines,
curves, and colors and

18
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,920
so on, not individual dots of color.

19
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,340
Let's see what happens
when we resize this page.

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,100
Now, that's an SVG image on
the right and a PNG on the left, and

21
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,720
you can see as the size increases, the
PNG is looking to start a little blurry,

22
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,450
whereas the SVG is perfect at any size.
