1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,730
What's the answer? If B is the resigner,

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,820
we don't really care about the other column anymore.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:06,610
>> Mhm.

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,690
>> Then what's going to happen is A is mixing between resigning and holding.

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:09,934
>> Yap.

6
00:00:09,934 --> 00:00:12,320
>> And probability P is a probability of being a holder,

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,090
so whatever P, whenever that event happens it gets ten, and

8
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,950
whenever one the opposite of it happens it gets minus five,

9
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:24,710
so I want to say ten p plus one minus p five.

10
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:25,430
>> Okay,

11
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,190
is that your.

12
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:26,950
>> Let me try that again.

13
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:27,850
>> Is that your final answer?

14
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,370
>> Ten p. Well I could simplify it.

15
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,340
>> Okay. Well then say it to me again. I'll write it

16
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,281
out here so it's easy for you to see. Okay and that is.

17
00:00:36,281 --> 00:00:37,130
>> My answer?

18
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,500
>> That's fair. Do you want to simplify it? You don't have to.

19
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,550
>> Sure, let me simplify it, so it's a minus minus

20
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,230
p five and a ten p so that's fifteen P minus one.

21
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,110
>> Minus what?

22
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,010
>> One.

23
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:48,890
>> Minus what?

24
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:49,750
>> Five.

25
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,690
>> Uhun,

26
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,010
there you go. Thank you.

27
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,560
>> That's correct. We would obviously accept either

28
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,500
answer or any combination of those letters. That, [LAUGH]

29
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,530
>> No, I think I might have to do this quiz over actually.

30
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,210
>> No, not the one. I'm talking about either 15 p minus

31
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,250
five or ten p minus one minus p times five. Or ten

32
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,570
p plus one minus p times minus five. Or any other combination

33
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,370
that we can get push car to actually Bothered to, you know.

34
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:12,610
>> Check.

35
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,680
>> Im, Implement or check. Okay. Well, that was pretty good. And this,

36
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,510
of course, is exactly the expected profit. As you put it, P

37
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:23,150
times A as a holder and P times or P percentage 1

38
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,070
minus P percentage A chooses to be a resigner. And so it's

39
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,720
just the weighted average between those two values. So, Kent, let me

40
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,720
just double check that. So, if P is 0, that means it

41
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,800
never holds, it means it always resigns and it gets -5, so

42
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,880
that's right and if P is 1, means it always holds, so

43
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,560
it should get a +10. And 15 -5 is 10. So, boom!

44
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,580
>> Yeah,

45
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,570
it works. You used math there, very good. Okay, what about B?

46
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,660
>> B. So the same story, except on the seer side.

47
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,231
>> Mm-hm.

48
00:01:49,231 --> 00:01:51,280
>> So yeah, I might need that space again.

49
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,620
So 5, oh I see, right, minus 5 times p.

50
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,271
>> Mm-hm.

51
00:01:56,271 --> 00:01:58,200
>> Plus 5 times 1 minus p.

52
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,000
>> Mm-hm. If we simplify that we get.

53
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:06,840
>> There's a minus 5 and another minus 5. So we get minus 10 p.

54
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,889
>> Mm-hm. Plus 1.

55
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:10,800
>> Plus what?

56
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,690
>> Plus 5.

57
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,200
>> There you go. See you learned. Okay you want to check it?

58
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,870
>> yeah. Oh, that's a good idea. So again if P is 1, then that

59
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,950
means you're always which should be the minus 5 and if we put in a 1

60
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,990
there, we get 5 minus 10 is minus 5. And if P is 0, that

61
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:33,090
means that we're always a resigner, and we should get a 5 for that. And yeah,

62
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,530
so we zero out the negative 10 and we get the 5.

63
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,140
>> Exactly.

64
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,940
>> Now, it's not clear to me why we're playing this game. Oh, it is clear to

65
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,350
me why we're playing this game, because we

66
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,460
want to figure out something about. Strategy that is mixed.

67
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:44,910
>> Right.

68
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,160
>> So this is how well a mixed strategy does, but

69
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,270
not against another mixed strategy.

70
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,950
This is against two deterministic strategies.

71
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,340
>> But is it, Michael? But is it? So

72
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,670
>> I'm going to, oh, okay.

73
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,770
>> I'm going to notice something here, which is that you,

74
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,930
as you astutely pointed out earlier, we have two functions. Of P or to

75
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,200
equations of P, and by the way, do you know what they are? They're lines.

76
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,720
>> Sure, because it's just a, it's linear in P, so that's what linear means.

77
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,070
>> Right, so what would happen you, do you

78
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,810
think if we were to actually draw these lines?

79
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,480
>> I think we'd have two lines.

80
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,730
>> Yes, and what would those two lines

81
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,350
look like? Let's take a look, shall we?

82
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:20,830
>> Sure.
