00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,240
Here, the answer is 3 times the 6 root of a squared b to the 5th c to the 4th,

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,923
all divided by b squared, c squared. That's amazing algebra work, if you got

3
00:00:09,923 --> 00:00:13,510
any of that correct. Just like in our last problem, we want to increase the

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:17,986
power of each of these factors, so that way they're divisible by 6. This means

5
00:00:17,986 --> 00:00:21,570
we need to change a to the 4th and to a to the 6th, b to the 7th, and to b to

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:27,595
the 12th, and c to the 8th, and c to the 12th, as well. This means we need to

7
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:32,113
multiply it by 6th root of a squared b to the 5th, c to the 4th. We know this,

8
00:00:32,113 --> 00:00:35,772
since a to the 4th times a squared is a to the 6th, b to the 7th times b to the

9
00:00:35,772 --> 00:00:42,338
5th is b to the 12th. And c to the 8th times c to the 4th is c to the 12th. We

10
00:00:42,338 --> 00:00:47,324
multiply our numerators together, leaving 3a in front of our radical. Next, we

11
00:00:47,324 --> 00:00:52,138
simplify our denominator as a, b squared, c squared. We just divide each of

12
00:00:52,138 --> 00:00:56,645
these powers by 6. And finally, we reduce a power of a, since a divided by a

13
00:00:56,645 --> 00:01:02,879
equals 1. This leaves us with our final answer. And notice that a denominator

14
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,412
does not contain a 6 root anymore. Great work.
