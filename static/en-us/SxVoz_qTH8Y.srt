Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:03,330
In this lesson,

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,530
we'll discuss the problem of finding a
maximum matching and a bipartite graph.

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,520
A problem intimately related to
finding a maximum flow in a network.

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,570
Indeed, our initial algorithm will
come form a reduction to maximum flow.

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,430
And at first maximum bipartite matching
might just seem like a special case.

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,900
As we examine the problem
more carefully however,

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,460
we'll see some special structure.

9
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,490
And eventually, we'll use this
insight to create a better algorithm.
