00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,558
Its inverse will only intersect x equals 4 one time. The relationship between

2
00:00:05,558 --> 00:00:09,157
the reflection of the function and the line, x equals 4, will be the same as

3
00:00:09,157 --> 00:00:14,613
the relationship between the original function and the line y equals 4.
