00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,110
In this introductory lecture,

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:05,360
we will provide a very high-level view of operating systems.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,280
We will explain what is an operating system and

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,010
what is the role that it plays in computer systems.

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,010
Then we'll look at some of the key components of operating systems,

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,300
design principles, and organizational structures.

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,010
The following lectures in this class will provide you with

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,350
a much more in-depth understanding of what any of the terms and

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,650
mechanisms that come up during this lesson actually are.

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,410
In simplest terms, an operating system is a piece of software that abstracts and

11
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:36,430
arbitrates the underlying hardware system.

12
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,545
And in this context, abstract means to,

13
00:00:38,545 --> 00:00:41,490
to simplify what the hardware actually looks like.

14
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:47,520
And arbitrate, it means to manage, to oversee, to control the hardware use.

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,860
We will see throughout this course that operating system support a number of

16
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,980
abstractions and arbitration mechanisms for

17
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,541
the various types of hardware components in computer systems.
