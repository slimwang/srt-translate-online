1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,250
We know that the natural numbers start
with one and increase by ones from there.

2
00:00:05,362 --> 00:00:11,425
So there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on.
Continuing to count up forever, and we

3
00:00:11,437 --> 00:00:16,675
know that the whole numbers are all of
these numbers plus zero. So if we were to

4
00:00:16,687 --> 00:00:22,060
list all of the whole numbers in ascending
numbers they would be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

5
00:00:22,072 --> 00:00:27,755
etcetera. So that means that every natural
number is a whole number, which is the

6
00:00:27,767 --> 00:00:33,935
second choice here and the last choice is
also true because almost all of the whole

7
00:00:33,947 --> 00:00:38,205
numbers are natural numbers but zero is
not a natural number.
