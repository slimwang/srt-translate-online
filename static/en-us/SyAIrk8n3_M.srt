Same question, for now using a Gaussian kernel.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,880
So this time around I'm actually using a Gaussian, and the question for

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:12,120
you to now, try to answer is, what would be the output,

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,560
if I applied cross-correlation with a Gaussian kernel, and convolution.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,820
Please choose the right box.
