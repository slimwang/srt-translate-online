00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,985
Okay. For this next question, draw the t distribution. Do that first. Next,

2
00:00:04,985 --> 00:00:09,799
place t critical on the distribution. Put it in its proper location. Shade in

3
00:00:09,799 --> 00:00:14,015
the critical region. Finally, place t on the t distribution. Make sure you have

4
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:17,844
all four of these completed before we move to the next slide. Does t fall in

5
00:00:17,844 --> 00:00:19,949
the critical region? Yes or no?
