00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,588
A researcher found a relationship between the number of hours spent playing

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,201
violent video games per week and the level of aggression shown by adolescent

3
00:00:09,213 --> 00:00:13,345
males. This is measured by the aggression scale, which is someone's

4
00:00:13,357 --> 00:00:17,749
self-reported measure of aggressive behavior. More hours spent playing

5
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:23,305
corresponded with a higher aggression score. Given this information, what can we

6
00:00:23,317 --> 00:00:24,127
say is true?
