Try simplifying this complex fraction. Write your numerator here, and your

00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,190
denominator here. Good luck. I'll also give you a caution. Here, we have m plus

00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:14,410
5, and here we have m plus 2. Notice that this is not multiplication. So m plus

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,623
5 is 1 factor, and m plus 2 is another.
