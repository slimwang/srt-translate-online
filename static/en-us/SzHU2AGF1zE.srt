1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,470
Now the only two options out of the four
that the UI probably wouldn't be

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,140
is a photos or maps application.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,360
Rather, it would be a really bad
way to browse photos or maps.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,590
The one or ones you guessed were likely
influenced by the apps you currently

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,610
use or used to use.

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:23,000
You see the boxes as individual events
and the circles as the creator or

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,170
owner of the meeting you
might have set a calendar.

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,770
Or maybe a person and their name.

9
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,600
The point of the matter is that you
derived a lot of information about

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,260
the user interface based
on how it was arranged.
