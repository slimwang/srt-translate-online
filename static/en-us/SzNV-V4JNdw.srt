00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,376
So why would I have you enter all those numbers for long division? Are we only

2
00:00:04,376 --> 00:00:08,667
concerned about the answer? Well, no. Math is about reasoning and we can use

3
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:12,985
that reasoning in new situations like here. We'll use our understanding of

4
00:00:12,985 --> 00:00:17,531
dividing numbers to divide polynomials. To divide x plus 5 into x squared plus 7

5
00:00:17,531 --> 00:00:21,700
x plus 10, we're going to start with these first two terms. I want to think

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:27,076
about the expression that I could put here to multiply by x to get x squared. In

7
00:00:27,076 --> 00:00:33,603
other words, I'm taking x squared and dividing it by x. That variable must be x.

8
00:00:33,603 --> 00:00:39,502
Next, we multiply x by x and positive 5, and we get x squared plus 5x . This

9
00:00:39,502 --> 00:00:45,252
step was very similar to multiplying 2 times 4 to get the 8. Now that we're

10
00:00:45,252 --> 00:00:49,095
here, we want to subtract. So I want to subtract this entire amount or

11
00:00:49,095 --> 00:00:53,599
expression. This is really a negative 1 times each of these quantities. So we

12
00:00:53,599 --> 00:00:57,974
want to make sure that we change both of the signs. When I subtract the amount

13
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:02,447
I'll have negative x squared and negative 5x. Both of the signs change. X

14
00:01:02,447 --> 00:01:07,798
squared minus x squared equals 0, and 7x minus 5x equals 2x. Next we bring down

15
00:01:07,798 --> 00:01:12,746
the ten to continue the next step of our long division problem. Now I want you

16
00:01:12,746 --> 00:01:17,677
to try that same process again. You're going to divide x plus 5 into 2x plus 10.

17
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:22,615
What number would go here? And then when you multiply this number by x plus 5,

18
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:27,884
what two expressions do you get here? Then you're going to subtract this

19
00:01:27,884 --> 00:01:31,959
quantity, and put in your final answers down here.
