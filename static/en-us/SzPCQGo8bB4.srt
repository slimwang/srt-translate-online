1
00:00:00,146 --> 00:00:04,140
A method like this is sometimes
referred to as a Call Back Method.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,029
We configure the button so that it
will call back when an event occurs.

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,456
We're not changing the code in
the button we're just leveraging it's

4
00:00:11,456 --> 00:00:12,265
architecture.

5
00:00:12,265 --> 00:00:14,948
It was designed to call
back the controller.

6
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:17,722
We're going to be seeing this
pattern a lot in UI Kit.

7
00:00:17,722 --> 00:00:22,085
We interact with our view objects so
that they reach back and

8
00:00:22,085 --> 00:00:24,363
contact our control objects.

9
00:00:24,363 --> 00:00:28,159
We see it here with actions, and
we'll see it later with delegates.

10
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:28,979
In general,

11
00:00:28,979 --> 00:00:33,384
actions are method indications from
views back to view controllers.

12
00:00:33,384 --> 00:00:37,665
Outlets on the other hand, are
indications in the opposite direction,

13
00:00:37,665 --> 00:00:40,907
allowing method indication
from controller to view.

14
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:45,211
Next up, we'll transition back to
building our apps using Storyboard and

15
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:49,856
now, hopefully you can see storyboard as
a tool made to accomplish the very goals

16
00:00:49,856 --> 00:00:51,715
that we just worked out in code.
