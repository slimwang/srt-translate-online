00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now, some people like manipulating trees

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and some people like a more--sort of formal--mathematical notation.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So if you're one of those, I'm going to give you another way to think about

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
whether or not we have a solution;

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and let's start with a problem-solving

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
where a plan consists of a straight line sequence.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And we said one way to decide if this is a plan that satisfies the goal

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
is to say, "Is the end state a goal state?"

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If we want to be more formal and write that out mathematically,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
what we can say is--what this plan represents

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
is--we started in the start state,

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and then we transitioned

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
to the state that is the result of applying the action

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
of going from A to S, to that start state;

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and then we applied to that, the result of starting in that intermediate state

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and applying the action of going from S to F.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And if that resulting state is an element of the set of Goals,

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
then this plan is valid; this plan gives us a solution.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And so that's a mathematical formulation of what it means for this plan to be a Goal.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Now, in stochastic partially observable worlds,

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
the equations are a little bit more complicated.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Instead of just having S Prime is a result of applying some action to the initial state,

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
we're dealing with belief states, rather than individual states.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And what we say is our new belief state

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:59,000
is the result of updating what we get from predicting what our action will do;

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and then updating it, based on our observation, O, of the world.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So the prediction step is when we start off in a belief state;

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
we look at the action, we look at each possible result of the action--

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
because they're stochastic--to each possible member of the belief state,

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and so that gives us a larger belief state;

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and then we update that belief state by taking account of the observation--

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and that will give us a smaller--or same size--belief state.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And now, that gives us the new state.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Now, we can use this to predict and update cycle

35
00:02:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to keep track of where we are in a belief state.
