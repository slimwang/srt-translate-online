1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,380
Now let's remember, the whole concept of convolution and

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:08,270
gradients, again, recall that convolution is basically taking our,

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:11,800
kernel, involving with the input to get a new image.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,150
So this is [INAUDIBLE] of convolution, we'll now need to ask the question,

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,810
what happens if I take this convolution formulation and

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,810
just do a derivative of this in x, of course, we would do it separately for y,

7
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,190
if I was to do a, derivative of this,

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,670
basically means that I would have derivative of the convolution.

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,300
To help us, let say if D is the kernel to compute the derivatives, and

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,520
H is the kernel for smoothing.

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,215
So basically, what we're kind of saying is,

12
00:00:38,215 --> 00:00:42,450
dell of the x could actually become now a operation because we

13
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,990
have actually represented basically that as a kernel to compute derivatives, and

14
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:51,341
H is a kernel, for smoothing, we can rewrite this formulation as, so

15
00:00:51,341 --> 00:00:57,600
again, if D and H are known, we could basically now define the derivative and

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,560
smoothing operation as one formulation, D, convolved with, H convolved with F.

17
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:11,590
Of course, remembering our understanding of the basic properties of convolution,

18
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:15,420
we could actually do a derivative of the kernel, and then

19
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,210
just apply the convolution of the kernel itself directly to the input image.

20
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,010
So we could actually now not just have to do, this process and

21
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:28,890
then come up with the derivative, I could take any kernel and

22
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:34,030
keep it in my storage as a new kernel that basically has a derivative itself,

23
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,230
and use that and apply directly to the image.

24
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,390
So this actually becomes an interesting way of looking at things, and

25
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,130
again, it's widely used in how we do types of image processing,

26
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,940
types of techniques to extract gradients.
