1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In our case, there is a single assertion, which could be placed in the loop body

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
to catch these kinds of errors, and actually an assertion which could remain in the code.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It is an assertion that captures the relationship between the variables tag.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What is the correct assertion? Is it assert quote and not tag? Or quote or not tag?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Or tag or not quote? Or is it assert tag and not quote?
