When we compute lighting at vertices and interpolate like this, it's called

2
00:00:04,024 --> 00:00:09,104
Gouraud shading. Named after Henri Gouraud. Unfortunately our eyes are very good

3
00:00:09,104 --> 00:00:13,376
at picking out places where the rate of shading changes. Our visual system will

4
00:00:13,376 --> 00:00:16,978
even perceive creases. Which are called Mach bands. To avoid this problem, we'd

5
00:00:16,978 --> 00:00:21,096
like to compute the lighting more frequently. One way to do this is to increase

6
00:00:21,096 --> 00:00:23,504
the number of triangles making up the surface.
