1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,800
In addition to choosing
major breakpoints,

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,490
where layout changes significantly,

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,240
it's also helpful to add minor
breakpoints to make some small changes.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,930
For example, between major breakpoints,
it may be helpful to adjust margins and

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,820
paddings on an element.

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:22,570
Or to increase the font size to make
things, a little bit easier to read and

7
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,670
feel more natural in the layout.

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:30,800
In this case let's boost the font, when
the viewport width is between 400 and

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,910
550 pixels,
where our break point kicks in.

10
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,300
I'll also separate the low and
high temperature, so

11
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:43,150
that they're not on the same line and
make the weather icons bigger as well.

12
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:47,490
Let's switch to the source and
I'll add a media query that's applied,

13
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:53,220
when the viewport is between 450 and
550 pixels.

14
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,800
It ups the base font,
changes the low and

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,890
high temperature to be inline block,
and increases the icon size.

16
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,099
I'll save the file, and
then take a look in the browser.

17
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:08,560
Sure enough, my icons are now bigger,
my fonts are now bigger, and

18
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,980
everything looks like I expect it to.

19
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,570
In this before and after, you can
see how things have really changed.

20
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:20,080
The icons are much bigger,
the font sizes have also changed, and

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,800
the minimum and maximum temperatures are
now shown in a slightly different way.

22
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,850
For larger view ports I want to limit
the maximum width of the forecast page.

23
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:33,820
Panel, so that it doesn't consume
the entire view port as it gets wider.

24
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:39,010
I already have a link style sheet
with min-width query of 700 pixels.

25
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,940
So in there, I just need to
set some margins and padding.

26
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,230
Let's take a look.

27
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:48,430
I'll set the width to 700 pixels,
and set margin left and

28
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,440
margin right to auto.

29
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,430
I'll come back to Chrome, hit Refresh,
and now we've got what I want.

30
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,180
There you have it.

31
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,440
You can use minor break points,
to adjust the little things and

32
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,420
really make things shine.
