Wow, Chris, that's a really tough order of operations problem. But, if you got

2
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:09,869
the answer of negative 88, great job. The first thing that we want to do when we

3
00:00:09,881 --> 00:00:15,083
look at an order of operation problem is to do the innermost parentheses first.

4
00:00:15,196 --> 00:00:19,967
I can see right here, there is the innermost parentheses of 6 minus 6 squared.

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,775
So the first thing I'm going to do is calculate 6 minus 6 squared. 6 squared is

6
00:00:24,787 --> 00:00:30,124
36, so I have 6 minus 36. And of course, 6 minus 36 gives me a negative 30. It's

7
00:00:30,136 --> 00:00:35,531
important when doing these order of operation problems that you write down all

8
00:00:35,543 --> 00:00:40,782
of the operations that you have not yet performed. So I'm going to copy down the

9
00:00:40,794 --> 00:00:46,868
rest of the problem. So for this first step, I simply evaluated what was in the

10
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:53,338
innermost parentheses, which 6 minus 36 is negative 30. Now I'm working in the

11
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:59,275
brackets and I know that I have to do my powers or my exponents first. So

12
00:00:59,287 --> 00:01:05,250
negative 5 squared is negative 25 and 6 squared is 36. Now that I've evaluated

13
00:01:05,262 --> 00:01:09,804
all my exponents or powers, the next thing I want to do is my multiplication.

14
00:01:09,908 --> 00:01:14,274
When I do my multiplication, it's a good idea to work from the left to the

15
00:01:14,286 --> 00:01:19,004
right. I'm still working in these brackets. So, the two multiplications that I

16
00:01:19,016 --> 00:01:24,213
have to do are negative 25 times negative 2, which gives me positive 50. I leave

17
00:01:24,225 --> 00:01:29,541
the minus 36 and the other multiplication that I have to do is negative 1 times

18
00:01:29,553 --> 00:01:34,459
negative 30 which gives me positive 30. Now that I have finished all the

19
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:39,558
exponents, multiplication, and division within my brackets, now I can do my

20
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:45,875
addition and my subtraction. 50 minus 36 is 14, and then, I can add the 14 and

21
00:01:45,887 --> 00:01:53,187
the 30. 14 plus 30 gives me 44. The last thing I need to do is this last

22
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:59,644
operation, which is multiplication. Negative two times 44 gives me negative 88.
