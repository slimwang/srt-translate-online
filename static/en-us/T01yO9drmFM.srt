Developmental psychologists study how we change from the cradle to the grave.

00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,295
When psychology was a new science, there was a great debate. This is called the

3
00:00:08,295 --> 00:00:12,416
nature vs nurture debate. Some psychologists believe that we were born a blank

4
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:15,602
slate, or the Latin term âtable rasa.â This means that our environment

5
00:00:15,602 --> 00:00:21,559
completely dictates who we are. Environment is everything with nurture. And

6
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:26,585
then some psychologists believe that it's nature. Or as they like to say, the

7
00:00:26,585 --> 00:00:30,224
world within the skin. So, on the nature side, it's everything that we're born

8
00:00:30,224 --> 00:00:34,237
with, like our genetics that determine who we are. However, today we know that

9
00:00:34,237 --> 00:00:38,966
who we are is a function of both nature and nurture. It's a really complex

10
00:00:38,966 --> 00:00:42,294
interplay of these two things, and we can rarely separate the two when trying

11
00:00:42,294 --> 00:00:45,569
to explain different aspects of development.
