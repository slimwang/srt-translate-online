00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,050
Okay, Michael, so I pulled up this webpage. We

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,570
will provide a link to it, on our own webpages.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,290
And you'll notice there's a really nice copyright here, and

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,010
this is all free to use. So I'm not, I'm

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,780
not doing anything wrong here. They're going to use Independent Components

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:18,700
Analysis, as a way of recovering, original sounds. So, here

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,500
you see that I've clicked onto a police car. Somebody

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,900
talking in a commercial and, let's say, this dude here.

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,840
And, what it's going to do is it's going to, generate

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,280
sounds from each of these three sources that are all

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,480
independently generated. And, it's going to mix them. So if I

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,900
click on these icons here, of these microphones. See, these

13
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,590
look just like what I drew before. You'll be

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,727
able to hear each of their sounds combined together. So

15
00:00:44,727 --> 00:00:48,081
I'm going to put my microphone very close to it so

16
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:52,066
you can hear it. [SOUND] [FOREIGN] And here is another

17
00:00:52,066 --> 00:00:56,903
one of the microphones. [SOUND]

18
00:00:56,903 --> 00:01:00,570
[FOREIGN]

19
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,000
Okay, so, Michael, could you hear that?

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,670
>> Yes.

21
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,350
>> Okay. So, what I did is, I played two of the, the, the

22
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,280
mix sounds together. And, you know, to

23
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,910
the untrained ear, they sound very much alike.

24
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:13,560
But I think the, the most important thing is, all three of these sounds are

25
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,270
over on top of one another, and as human beings we actually do a pretty

26
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,140
good job on being able to focus on one of them,

27
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,470
because I don't know, we're designed to do that. But machines have

28
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,510
historically had a terrible time of doing this. And independent components

29
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,830
analysis was the first sort of generic algorithm that was able to

30
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,565
solve this. So, we're going to use ICA now to separate the

31
00:01:31,565 --> 00:01:36,150
sound sources. And as you see, we get these little gramaphone things.

32
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,940
And I'm going to play, each one of these and see if

33
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,440
they did a good job of separating those into the original sources.

34
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:48,190
[FOREIGN] The guardians

35
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:53,180
of the electronic stock market NASDAQ

36
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:58,026
who have been burned by past ethics questions are. [SOUND] Okay,

37
00:01:58,026 --> 00:02:02,668
so wasn't that kind of cool

38
00:02:02,668 --> 00:02:07,480
Michael? I mean we, we took these completely mixed up sounds and

39
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,370
we were able to recover the original, by using independent components analysis.

40
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,010
>> That's fascinating. I don't still

41
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,530
understand what it's doing, but its pretty

42
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,710
neat that it could do that, because it sounded pretty mixed up to me.

43
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,240
>> Well it was, it was in fact each

44
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,180
one of these three sources, that we eventually heard

45
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,980
were in fact arbitrarily, linearly, combined into each of

46
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,620
these separate microphones. And there's really sort of no way

47
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,830
in which you'd be able to recover the original sounds, because, there's

48
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,090
no reason for you to be able to do that. But people

49
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,610
do it all the time. And now with something like independent components

50
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,440
analysis, you can also do it. And the reason it works with

51
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,590
independent components analysis. And that fundamental

52
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,310
assumption that it's making, is that

53
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,060
whatever is generating in these cases

54
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,440
these sounds, the sources, are statistically

55
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,560
independent of one another. Which happens to be true in that case.

56
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,489
And they're combined together in a way that is a linear combination.

57
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,540
Now there's a lot a details here. And again

58
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,400
when you read the materials you see exactly how independent

59
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,160
components analysis works. But, intuitively all it's doing is taking

60
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,010
this particular model, and by using mutual information directly to

61
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,450
find things that are independent of one another, while

62
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:18,200
not losing any information, from the observables, it's able to

63
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,090
reconstruct these sounds. And it's able to do this incredibly

64
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,980
quickly, and incredibly well. Under a large number of conditions.
