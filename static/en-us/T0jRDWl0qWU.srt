1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,719
Our last activity includes a mock
list of contacts in a recycler view.

2
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:08,839
And we'll be adding a touch
selector to these list items, so

3
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:13,349
that when you click them, they turn a
different color and react to your touch.

4
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:15,309
By responding to a user's touch,

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,600
selectors provide important
interactive feedback.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,650
So even though adding touch selectors
is just a small visual detail,

7
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:25,649
it enhances the overall user experience.

8
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:29,619
Now that was the final state of the app,
but the starter code you've been

9
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:33,649
doesn't include selectors, so
when you click it, nothing happens.

10
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:36,449
So let's go in and
build a touch selector.

11
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,459
To create a touch selector, we'll be
creating a new drawable resource,

12
00:00:40,459 --> 00:00:43,628
which is basically something
that can be drawn on screen,

13
00:00:43,628 --> 00:00:47,009
in this case a colored background for
the selected list item.

14
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:51,237
To create a new drawable,
I'll right click on our res folder and

15
00:00:51,237 --> 00:00:54,066
select create new Android resource file.

16
00:00:54,066 --> 00:00:58,540
Then it'll prompt for the resource type,
which is a Drawable in this case.

17
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:02,909
And you want to make sure that the root
element for this drawable is a selector.

18
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:06,049
And I'll give this a name,
list_item_selector,

19
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:07,590
no qualifiers necessary.

20
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,689
So then click OK, great.

21
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,399
Then we should get this empty selector
file, which I'll add some to-dos to.

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,680
Ok, so here's our starting
selector code and to-do's.

23
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,829
First we created a new drawable
resource named list_item_selector and

24
00:01:20,828 --> 00:01:23,189
choosing selector as the root element.

25
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:25,469
The next thing we'll need
to do is add items for

26
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:27,959
the different touch
states of our list items.

27
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:30,379
This will be kind of similar
to creating a style.

28
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:32,250
First, let's open an item tag.

29
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,489
Each item will include two properties.

30
00:01:34,489 --> 00:01:36,530
The first is a drawable property.

31
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,049
This property will be the color
background for a selected item.

32
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:42,459
And I'll have this be
our primary light color.

33
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:45,819
The second will be a state property,
of which there are three main ones for

34
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:47,019
clicked items.

35
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:49,001
The first is state_pressed.

36
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:52,979
When state_pressed equals true,
that means an item has been pressed on.

37
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,005
The next two states I'll
add are state_activated and

38
00:01:56,004 --> 00:01:59,890
state_selected, also both
true when an item is touched.

39
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,195
And by including all
three of these states,

40
00:02:02,195 --> 00:02:05,447
you cover all scenarios when
a user has clicked on a list item.

41
00:02:05,447 --> 00:02:08,659
And these will all have the same
drawable background color.

42
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:12,756
Then we also have to include one more
item for the default unselected state.

43
00:02:12,756 --> 00:02:16,685
This will be an item with Android's
default background_light color.

44
00:02:16,685 --> 00:02:20,664
There's no need to specify a state for
this one, since it will be a default.

45
00:02:20,664 --> 00:02:23,394
And these four items
complete our selector.

46
00:02:23,395 --> 00:02:26,225
Now we just need to apply
this to the list items.

47
00:02:26,224 --> 00:02:29,364
So let's go to
the selector_list_item layout code.

48
00:02:29,365 --> 00:02:31,435
Each list item is a linear layout.

49
00:02:31,435 --> 00:02:34,134
And we just need to set the touch
selector we just created

50
00:02:34,134 --> 00:02:36,519
to the background
property of this layout.

51
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,040
We refer to our list item
selector by saying @drawable/

52
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:43,079
the name of our selector and that's it.

53
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,530
Let's save this and
run it to see if it worked.

54
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:49,324
Now if we go to our Touch Selectors
activity, we can click on each of these

55
00:02:49,324 --> 00:02:52,564
and it should be highlighted in
our color, primary light color.

56
00:02:52,564 --> 00:02:54,914
And we can see that our
touch selector works.

57
00:02:54,914 --> 00:02:57,834
It highlights each of these
items as I click on them.

58
00:02:57,835 --> 00:03:00,365
Next it will be your
turn to implement this.

59
00:03:00,365 --> 00:03:01,844
And then you'll be
done building this app.
