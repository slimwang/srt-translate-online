1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,230
Again quickly reviewing because
this is so key to what follows.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,850
US healthcare is highly uncoordinated
because so many specialized physicians

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,800
are involved in the care of patients
with multiple chronic diseases.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,079
One reason is that we have
such a small percentage,

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,369
only around 12% of
primary care physicians.

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,028
Other countries, such as Australia,
France and Canada,

7
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:28,730
have around 50% of
primary care physicians.

8
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,470
The resulting problems
are not theoretical.

9
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,352
The more physicians they see, 4 or
more versus 1 to 2 physicians,

10
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:40,816
more chronic disease patients
report being seen by a physician

11
00:00:40,816 --> 00:00:44,230
with an incomplete or missing record.

12
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,370
There's similar data for medical errors.
