1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,150
I added fields to my Set Time object.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:03,840
>> Great.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,220
>> I added the tab so I can see it here, and I have

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,750
clicked in, and I am ready. I'm

5
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,340
going to start entering some records. Sound good?

6
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,190
>> Sounds good.

7
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,620
>> Alright. What time shall our first band play at?

8
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,020
Oh, I mean what stage should our first band play at?

9
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:17,020
>>

10
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,027
[LAUGH]

11
00:00:18,027 --> 00:00:22,300
let's put it at the Udacity stage. And I know that I can go

12
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,840
into the page layout thing and add those other fields if I wanted but.

13
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,500
>> Right.

14
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:25,620
>> Not.

15
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,010
>> Yup.

16
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,860
>> Too concerned right now. Okay. And, what band should be playing?

17
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,300
>> Search for something. See if they what

18
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,380
about code? There's gotta be a code band.

19
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,750
>> Code Against the Machines, what about that?

20
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,185
>> Code Against the Machines for sure

21
00:00:41,185 --> 00:00:42,700
[LAUGH].

22
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,400
Right and save. So this is our set time record.

23
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:47,760
>> Right

24
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,960
>> For code against the machine, playing the Udacity stage.

25
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,320
>> Right. So we can see how it links to both the stage and the band.

26
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,460
>> Okay, so let's see what happens if I actually click on Udacity

27
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,710
stage. So this is the stage record, and yeah it's not showing me

28
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,470
any of the bands that are playing here. Which is unfortunately, because I

29
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,540
would love it to. It feels like it should be showing me that.

30
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,780
>> So it should be

31
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,610
showing you that, and it could be showing you

32
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,310
that. How do you think you could add it there?
