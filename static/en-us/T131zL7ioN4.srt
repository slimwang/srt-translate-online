00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,540
Here's the Syntax. There's only one statement in the language.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:07,500
It's a statement which is a constraint. The constraint has a couple of

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,030
keywords in it, and a couple of expressions. The first keyword is context.

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:20,170
And it's followed by an identifier. That identifier gives a name to the context.

5
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:25,030
The context is where you are in a diagram. Usually this means a class, so

6
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,770
it's the name of a class. It might be the name of a particular method in

7
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:33,860
a class. Then there comes another keyword which is the kind of constraint, and

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,159
we'll see that there's three kinds of constraints. One is invariance,

9
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:42,550
one is pre, preconditions, and one is post conditions. And then comes a Boolean

10
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:47,720
expression, which is the actual constraint that the statement is expressing.

11
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:53,790
From what I've just said you can infer correctly that OCL constraints

12
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,940
are inherently connected with UML class model diagrams, and

13
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,590
you probably will have already developed the class model diagram. And

14
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:07,389
then gone into details by specifying the details with the OCL constraints
