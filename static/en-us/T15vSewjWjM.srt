This is Brian the Brain. He's going to help me show you what the brain's made

2
00:00:03,738 --> 00:00:07,986
of The Cerebrum is the uppermost portion of the brain. It's also the largest

3
00:00:07,986 --> 00:00:11,933
part of the brain, covering about 2 3rd of the whole brain mass. And it's

4
00:00:11,933 --> 00:00:17,598
divided into two main hemispheres. Now, the outer layer of the Cerebrum is

5
00:00:17,598 --> 00:00:23,770
called the Cerebral Cortex. Interestingly, it's only about 1 10th or 1 5th of

6
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:28,491
an inch thick. However, even though it's really small, this is where much of

7
00:00:28,491 --> 00:00:34,355
our human thoughts, planning, perception, and consciousness take place. The

8
00:00:34,355 --> 00:00:37,820
Frontal Lobe, in the front of the brain, of course, makes up about 1 3rd of the

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:44,040
area of the Cerebral Cortex. It's best known for its role in attention, working

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,135
memory, impulse control, being creative, and also abstract reasoning and

11
00:00:48,135 --> 00:00:53,930
thinking. It's what really makes us human. Because it's the youngest part of

12
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,395
our brain, this is why children and teenagers can act more impulsively than

13
00:00:57,395 --> 00:01:02,290
adults. Their frontal lobes aren't fully developed. It isn't around until 20

14
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:07,718
years old or so, before the frontal lobe is fully developed. One important area

15
00:01:07,718 --> 00:01:12,554
of the frontal lobe is the primary motor cortex. This is in this area of the

16
00:01:12,554 --> 00:01:17,429
frontal lobe. It's pretty cool how this was discovered. A German psychologist

17
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:20,540
in the 1860s notice that when he was caring for injured soldiers, he would

18
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:25,255
touch the surface of this area of the brain. And he found that a soldiers body

19
00:01:25,255 --> 00:01:30,280
would actually twitch on the opposite side. So, say he touched the right side.

20
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,590
The left side of the soldier's body would twitch. From this and other research,

21
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,662
we now know that different parts of the cortex are responsible for different

22
00:01:37,662 --> 00:01:41,991
functions. All of the parts of our body that we can move have a dedicated

23
00:01:41,991 --> 00:01:47,307
region of the motor cortex that is activated when we move our body parts. For

24
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:50,847
example, we have a region for our fingers, one for our wrists, one for our

25
00:01:50,847 --> 00:01:54,950
lips, one for our legs and more. You get the picture.
