1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
So the first statement here is obviously not true. We have not even talked about time.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,460
We have just pondered the existence of an algorithm for the halting problem

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,180
or more specifically, the non-existence of such an algorithm, and that is exactly what we have shown.

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,300
We have shown that there's no algorithm that solves the halting problem

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:21,490
if we allow that algorithm to be given any program and any input, but of course,

6
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:28,560
there are specific programs for which we can use algorithms to decide if they will go into loops or not

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,509
and this is for example one technique that is used in automated software testing.

8
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:36,260
It's not that there can be an algorithm that solves the halting problem

9
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:42,390
for specific cases or specific programs, the halting problem cannot be solved for the general case.

10
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,950
So if say you have an algorithm that can solve the halting problem for any program,

11
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,700
any input that you throw at it, that cannot be the case, but for specific,

12
00:00:51,700 --> 99:59:59,999
special cases, we haven't shown anything so far.
