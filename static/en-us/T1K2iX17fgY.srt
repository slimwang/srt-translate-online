00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,220
At last, we're ready to apply a model.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,430
As you know from other courses you may have taken,

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,320
there are many options to choose from.

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,170
For example, neural networks, kernel density estimators, or

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,310
KDEs, linear regression, or polynomial regression.

6
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,640
Before telling you about which model I chose,

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,860
why don't you tell us which model you would choose and why.

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,150
It could be one of the models I mentioned or a completely different model.

9
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,390
Why don't you share your thoughts with your fellow students in the forum post

10
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,630
that we have linked to in the instructor comments below?
