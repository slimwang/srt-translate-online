00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here's a pretty good answer.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We definitely want to match single words and then you can possibly have 1 hypen

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and then you can have more letters if you like.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This regular expression definitely matches well-liked.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It also matches html--maybe the h, t, and m will match the first part,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and the l will match the second part.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It definitely rejects a-b-c and a--b.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
However, 1 problem with this regular expression is that it does not accept

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
single letter words like "a" or "i".

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
To see why, just look at these 2 plus signs.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This requires 1 or more letters here and 1 or more letters there,

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That's at least 2 letters.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We might be tempted to fix it up by making 1 of these a star,

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
but now we mistakenly accept things like just "-a".

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
No letters here, the hypen, and then some more letters--

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
well, that didn't work.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What if I try to make the other one a star?

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Well, dual problem--now we'll mistakenly accept things like "a-".

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Well, this is a bit of a challenge.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What we really want is for this hypen and the second word to be grouped together,

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and either they're both there or they're not.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's as if I really want this question mark to apply to both the hyphen

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and also the [a - z]+.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We don't know how to do that yet, but you'll get a chance after we've learned how

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,891
to fix this up in the homework.
