00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,690
Okay, here are some two by two problems.

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:03,960
Two by two matrix problems.

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:09,070
The situation is somewhat similar,
but not exactly similar.

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:15,090
Once again, we're given A, B, C, and D
is unknown, and we're given six choices,

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:20,860
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and we are to pick
one of these choices and put it in D.

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:26,020
What is different here however is that,
this time it is not just that A is to B

7
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:30,560
as C is to D but
also A is to C as at B is to D.

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,490
That's why it's a two by two matrix.

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,050
So it's not just the horizontal
relationship that counts but

10
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,200
it's also the vertical
relationship that counts.
