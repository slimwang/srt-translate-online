00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,260
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:05,120
Now let's actually start looking at
some very interesting advanced concepts.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,900
Recall when we started talking
about computational photography.

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,060
One of the things we talked about
is we have an illuminated scene.

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,230
We want to take this illuminated
scene through a set of optics and

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,330
processing devices to be able to
capture and generate an image and

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,630
that image was basically rendered in
concepts of using things like pixels.

8
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,960
But during that whole process
I talked about the fact that

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,030
we want to be able to capture and
model the rays of light.

10
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,220
Which is the primitive
that we want to capture,

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:36,740
one of the things now we want to do is
look at the concept of light fields.

12
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:41,090
The concept of light fields basically
says at, at any point in a scene

13
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:45,140
you can put a camera and capture
all information about that scene.

14
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,710
And from the three dimensional
light that actually points and

15
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,500
captured at the scene is what
we're trying to capture.

16
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,338
So, in the concept of light feed,
what we're going to do, basically,

17
00:00:53,338 --> 00:00:54,556
is look at that whole concept.

18
00:00:54,556 --> 00:00:58,521
And see how we can actually capture
light at any point and generate

19
00:00:58,521 --> 00:01:03,008
newer forms of cameras that actually
let us have all of this information.

20
00:01:03,008 --> 00:01:07,502
That after we have captured the images,
we can generate novel views from, and

21
00:01:07,502 --> 00:01:09,900
perhaps get to the pixels
a little later.
