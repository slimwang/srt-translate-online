00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,960
For this course we've provided a web app
that has a build script to compile it,

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,390
and some tests to run.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,090
In order to run this app, your server
will need to have a particular version

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:14,330
of node.js, and additional packages to
be able to build and run the tests.

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,280
Without some automation
to make this faster,

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,130
it would take an unreasonable
amount of time to install it on

7
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:23,000
each development system and production
server you might have, this is why we've

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,740
decided to create a golden image,
we'll use Packer to do that.

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,690
Packer can create golden images for
different build targets, for

10
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:34,320
example, VirtualBox and VMware, for
use on your workstation, and also for

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,455
cloud providers,
like Google Compute Engine, Amazon AWS,

12
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:41,170
DigitalOcean, and Microsoft Azure.

13
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,250
So you can run the exact same
operating system, libraries, and

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,040
everything else no matter where
you might be deploying your app.

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,000
Once this image is built, you'll
be able to use Vagrant to bring up

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,810
a virtual machine on your own computer
from that image, share a folder with it,

17
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,560
connect to it, see the app running, and

18
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,540
then change the app if you wish,
then build and run tests on it.

19
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,100
First, let's talk more about Packer,
how does it work?
