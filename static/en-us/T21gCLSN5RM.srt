1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,810
So, given the input series of examples, and the background knowledge,

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:09,195
this is the final concept definition for [UNKNOWN] that this particular

3
00:00:09,195 --> 00:00:13,454
[UNKNOWN] agent will learn. Notice, that there are no must support lengths here,

4
00:00:13,454 --> 00:00:16,650
because input [UNKNOWN] of examples did not require them.

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,920
Now it is also, that we did not generalize this bricks into something else, or

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,180
further generalize these blocks into something else,

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,520
because there was no background knowledge to do that.

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,070
So the result of learning here, depends not just on the input examples, but

9
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:35,160
on the background knowledge that the AI agent has. This method of incremental

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,390
concept learning differs quite a bit from some of these standard algorithms in

11
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,800
machine learning. Often in machine learning, the AI agent is a given

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,570
a large number of examples to begin with and the learning begins with those

13
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,700
large number of examples where the number of examples could be in thousands or

14
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,700
millions or more. When you have a large number of examples to begin with,

15
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:00,360
then one can apply statistical machine learning methods to find patterns of

16
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,319
regularity in the input data. But if the number of examples is very small,

17
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:10,280
and if the examples come one at a time, the learning is incremental.

18
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,450
Then it becomes harder to apply those statistical methods to detect patterns of

19
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:20,040
the [INAUDIBLE] input data. Instead, in that case, the algorithm must make

20
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,980
use of its background knowledge to decide what to learn and how to learn it.
