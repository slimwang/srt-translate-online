1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
One of the best strategies is to try abstraction.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Instead of dealing with every single possible state of the game,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
we can take similar states and deal with them as if they were the same.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
For example, in poker one abstraction that works pretty well is to eliminate the suits.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
If no player is trying to get a flush, then we can treat all four Aces as if they were identical

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
rather than treating the four of them as being different

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and similarly with all the other face values.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Another thing we can do is lump similar cards together.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Rather than saying that 2, 3, 4, and 5 are all different values,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
if I know that I'm holding a pair of 10s then I can think of the other players' cards

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
as being equal to 10, lower than 10, or higher than 10.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Otherwise, lump the same.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Similarly, I can lump bets together.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Rather than thinking of every dollar amount of a bet from $1 to the upper limit,

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I can lump the bets into small, medium, and large.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Then finally another way to do abstraction is rather than considering every possible deal

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
of all the cards, I can just consider a small subset of the deals

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
to do Monte Carlo sampling over the possible deals,

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
rather than considering them all.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This approach extensive games can handle quite a lot

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
in terms of dealing with uncertainty, dealing with partial observability,

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
dealing with multiple agents, stochastic, sequential, dynamic.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But there's a few things they can't handle very well.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
They aren't very good at unknown actions.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We need to know what all the actions are for either player before we can define the game.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Game theory doesn't deal very well with continuous actions,

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
because we have this matrix-like form.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It doesn't deal very well with irrational opponents.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We can know that we're going to do the best we possibly can against a rational opponent,

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
but it doesn't tell us how to exploit our opponent's weakness

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
if he turns out to be irrational.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Then finally, it doesn't deal with unknown utilities.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If we don't know what it is we're trying to optimize,

34
00:02:07,000 --> 99:59:59,999
game theory isn't going to tell us how to do it.
