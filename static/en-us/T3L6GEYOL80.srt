00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,517
And the answer is no. Even without multiplying in another linear factor, we can

2
00:00:04,517 --> 00:00:09,343
multiply other numbers in. For example, if I multiplied in a factor of 3, we

3
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:14,185
would still only have zeroes at 2, 3, and 4. Multiplying in a constant term,

4
00:00:14,185 --> 00:00:15,979
doesn't change the linear factors.
