00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Just as a note, one of the interesting things about getting customers is--

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I happen to draw the funnel that says awareness, interest, consideration,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and purchase, but here's just a heads up.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
In your funnel, in your physical channel, you might decide the steps are slightly different.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Now you feel locked in to calling them awareness, interest, consideration and purchase,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
just realize that you need to modify these to what your real cycle is and you will only kind of

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
learn that as you watch customers get from being aware of your product to purchase.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Use this as a template but don't think that there's anything magic about this.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It's just a proxy.
