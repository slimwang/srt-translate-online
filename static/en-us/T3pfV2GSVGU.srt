00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,380
So let us now see how the AI agent may go about building an explanation.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,530
Why this particular object is an instance of this cup?

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,670
So this what the robot wants to prove, the object is a cup.

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:17,060
And this what the robot know about the object. Object has a bottom,

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,930
the bottom is flat, the object is made of porcelain and so on and so forth.

6
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:25,380
So the question then becomes, how might the AI agent embodied in the robot, go

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,130
about using its prior knowledge, in order to be able to build this explanation?

8
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,780
But another way, what prior knowledge should the AI agent have, so that it can,

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,140
in fact, build this explanation?
