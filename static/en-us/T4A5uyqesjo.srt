1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And the answer shall be 0.5.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And this is a nontrivial question.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's do the truth table.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So, for flip-1, we have the outcomes of heads, heads, tails, tails.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
For flip-2, heads and tails and heads and tails.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
These are all possible outcomes.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And we know for the fair coin each outcome was equally likely.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That is, exactly one quarter.
