1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,310
So we have this equation written in slope intercept form now, which is great.

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:08,519
But it's kind of yucky looking. At least, if you're me, and fractions aren't

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,024
necessarily your favorite thing. There is however, yet another form of a linear

4
00:00:13,024 --> 00:00:17,178
equation that we can use to rewrite this, and maybe make it look a little bit

5
00:00:17,178 --> 00:00:21,753
more pleasing. And that is called the general form of, of linear equation. We

6
00:00:21,753 --> 00:00:26,873
can rate a general form of the general form proven to your equations as Ax plus

7
00:00:26,873 --> 00:00:31,916
By equals C where A, B and C are all constants. In addition to this, we have one

8
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:37,068
more little requirement. One thing that's not allowed is for A and B to both be

9
00:00:37,068 --> 00:00:42,137
equal to 0. If that was the case of course, this term would be 0. And this term

10
00:00:42,137 --> 00:00:46,027
would be 0 as well. So we would just end up with the equation 0 plus 0 equals 0

11
00:00:46,027 --> 00:00:50,122
which maybe true but isn't a linear equation because there are no variables in

12
00:00:50,122 --> 00:00:54,031
it. What the general form does then, is basically shift everything on the

13
00:00:54,031 --> 00:00:57,874
variable to one set of the equation and shift all the constant terms to the

14
00:00:57,874 --> 00:01:02,095
other side of the equation and then of course combine whatever constant you have

15
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:06,466
into one number. So let's play around with this. Since the coefficient in form

16
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:10,706
of y doesn't have to be 1, it can be some other constant in general form. Let's

17
00:01:10,706 --> 00:01:14,695
get rid of these fraction. What I'd like you to do then is to multiply both

18
00:01:14,695 --> 00:01:18,849
sides of these equation by some number so that there are no more fractional

19
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:23,484
coefficients or constant terms. Try however, to make this number you multiply

20
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:27,516
both sides by the smallest number that you could use to get rid of the

21
00:01:27,516 --> 00:01:28,250
fractions.
