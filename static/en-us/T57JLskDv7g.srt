1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The next concept I want to talk about

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
is the concept of a pareto optimal outcome.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So, this is talking about outcomes rather than strategies.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The strategies are in the margins.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The outcomes are in the matrix, and the pareto optimal outcome

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
is one where there's no other outcome

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
that all players would prefer.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And this is named after the economist Pareto.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What I want you to answer is

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
is there a pareto optimal outcome in this game?

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Is there an outcome such that

12
00:00:32,000 --> 99:59:59,999
there's no other outcome that all players would prefer?
