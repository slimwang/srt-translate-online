00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,385
For this quiz you'll be making this
slider, well, slide back and forth.

2
00:00:04,385 --> 00:00:09,750
And just for reference, I'm calling
this gray box that's moving a toggle,

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,390
while the whole thing
is called a slider.

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,320
Let me show you what
the code looks like.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,760
Like with the last event listeners quiz,

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,730
you can actually use either
JavaScript or jQuery.

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,050
The differences are minimal,

8
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,060
though you'll see me walk through my
solution with vanilla JavaScript.

9
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,350
Take a look through at.js to
see how the slider works.

10
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,930
It's pretty straightforward.

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:36,140
The crux of it being two methods,
ToggleTracker.addMovement and slide.

12
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,920
You'll want to call slide whenever
you want to animate a new position

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,480
of the toggle.

14
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,300
I also recommend using
requestAnimationFrame with it.

15
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,860
And that'll give you nice performance.

16
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,370
You can see that slide uses
transform translateX to move

17
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:56,300
the toggle some x position away
from its original origin, and

18
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:01,610
slide determines that distance by
using toggleTracker.getTtranslateX.

19
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:05,040
Back to toggletracker.addMovement.

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,320
It expects an x position
to get passed to it.

21
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,100
This exposition represents the current
exposition of either the finger,

22
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,920
as in a touch of ent, or
a mouse on the screen.

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,010
You want to call addMovement
whenever a new touch starts pr

24
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,958
a touch move event occurs.

25
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:27,122
And likewise, you'll want to call it for
a mouse down or mouse move.

26
00:01:27,122 --> 00:01:29,660
It's going to be your job
to use the event listener

27
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,670
to find this exposition that
gets passed to atMovement.

28
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,780
In the end, all you'll need to do is set
the correct event handlers on the toggle

29
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,419
in the window so that both touch
dragging and mouse striking work.

30
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,857
Here's where your code should go inside
the attachEventListeners function.

31
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,700
You'll know you've done it right when,

32
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,330
well, the toggle is sliding back and
forth.

33
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,130
Make sure you test on mobile.

34
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,600
And if you're having a hard time,

35
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,735
make sure you read the comments in the
code because I left you a lot of hints.

36
00:01:59,735 --> 00:02:02,910
Okay, well check the instructor notes
for more information and good luck.
