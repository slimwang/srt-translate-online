1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,840
And the answer here is no. So a non-deterministic RAM.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:10,090
If it's running the same cod on the same input, it will always return the same solution

3
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:14,110
because this if better function here, although we don't know what it's going to do.

4
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,740
It still behaves in a consistent way and this is actually quite important

5
00:00:17,740 --> 99:59:59,999
because non-determinism is not the same thing as randomness.
