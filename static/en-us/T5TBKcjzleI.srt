If you put this data in order, you have 38,150, 41,290, 48,670, 53,160, 57,320,

2
00:00:11,232 --> 00:00:19,288
and 500,000. And then if we cancel out the first and last, second to first,

3
00:00:19,288 --> 00:00:24,334
second to last. We can't cross out these two, then we're left with nothing. Or

4
00:00:24,334 --> 00:00:28,621
we could include both of them, but we can't have two medians. So in that case we

5
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:32,800
take the number exactly in the middle of these two. What is this number? Put

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,795
your answer here.
