1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,520
Alright.
Welcome back to computer vision.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,070
Today we're going to continue.

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,870
Well actually we just
introduced tracking and

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,510
now we're actually going to do some.

5
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,960
So, remember last time

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,680
we talked about the difference
between detecting and tracking.

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,230
Detecting, we have some operator and
we just find or

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,430
whatever our target is in every frame.

9
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:23,040
In tracking, we're going to predict
a new location of an object.

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,560
Or the, the expected distribution
location of an object using estimated

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,890
dynamics, so somehow we're estimating
the velocity, accelerations, whatever.

12
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,070
And then we're going to update based
upon the measurements that we take.

13
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,500
So that's sort of the shall we say
the intuitive way of describing it.

14
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,760
What we're going to do this lesson,
the next lesson, the lesson after that,

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,510
the le, I don't know.

16
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,970
Probably for the next eight or
seven, 12 years or so.

17
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:50,000
What we're going to do is, we're
going to make this, much more formal.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,800
And basically,
tracking as a form of inference.

19
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,020
And what we mean by that is, we're
going to have some state of the objects.

20
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,210
Some state we're trying to estimate.

21
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,320
We're going to call that x.

22
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,780
That's the parameters we care about.

23
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,550
But we don't actually know that.

24
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,540
So we refer to that as being hidden.

25
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,030
And we have a sensor.

26
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,680
Typically, it's going to be a camera for
the stuff we're talking about.

27
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,140
And what it's doing,
it's taking some measurements.

28
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,990
It's, it's measuring, like, our raw
detections that we're doing before.

29
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:18,230
And we're going to refer to
those as noisy observations

30
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,140
of whatever the underlying
state actually was.

31
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,500
The system that we're assuming is
that every time step t, the state,

32
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,030
the underlying state changes
from x of t minus 1 to x of t.

33
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,210
So here we have x of
t minus 1 to x of t.

34
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,230
And then at time t,
we get a new observation.

35
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,420
We get a new measurement.

36
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,260
And our goal, your mission,
should you choose to accept it,

37
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:46,680
is to recover the most likely state,
time t.

38
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,650
Now I was thinking about that,
its actually, that's not quite right.

39
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:57,250
What you want to do is you really want
to estimate not the most likely state.

40
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:01,270
I'm going to cross that out and
say the distribution or density.

41
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:05,870
So, if I have the density, that is I, I
have some belief about where x might be,

42
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:10,280
I can tell you the most likely place
that would be the highest probability.

43
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,000
I can tell you the average guess.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,950
That would be the expected value but

45
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,390
the idea is that we're
going to have a density.

46
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,580
And, so your goal is to recover or

47
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:23,360
estimate this distribution given first
of all everything you've seen so far.

48
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,910
Right?
So you've been taking measurements all

49
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,230
along since last Tuesday.

50
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,960
Where is this thing now?

51
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,690
And the other thing that was given
to you was some knowledge or

52
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:36,200
some model of the state dynamics,
that is how this thing moves.

53
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,930
Then you may have to estimate some of
the parameters but you may know that

54
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,610
you know, I'm, I'm going to assume that
this thing has a particular velocity and

55
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,500
the acceleration is just some noise.

56
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,335
That would be a, a model that
you're going to assume is known.
