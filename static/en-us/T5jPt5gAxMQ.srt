00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,240
This is one of the fun things about
neural networks because you have

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,070
this general framework and

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:09,560
lots of small building blocks that
you can assemble in that framework.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,810
You can explore lots
of ideas quickly and

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,320
come up with interesting model
architectures for your problem.

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,130
Next, we're going to look at how to
handle text as an input to a deep model.
