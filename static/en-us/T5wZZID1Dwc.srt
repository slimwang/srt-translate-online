00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,709
Direct variation means that two amounts are related such that if one increases,

2
00:00:04,709 --> 00:00:09,756
the other increases. Or, if one decreases, the other decreases as well. This

3
00:00:09,756 --> 00:00:13,530
makes sense in terms of working for an hourly wage and earning money. If you

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,272
work less hours, you earn less money. The second type of variation is inverse

5
00:00:18,272 --> 00:00:22,452
variation. If you work more hours, the amount of free time that you would have

6
00:00:22,452 --> 00:00:27,481
would decrease. Notice here, one quantity is increasing but the other one would

7
00:00:27,481 --> 00:00:31,436
be Decreasing. We could also have the relationship reversed, we could work less

8
00:00:31,436 --> 00:00:35,025
hours, which means we would have more free time. In the rest of this lesson

9
00:00:35,025 --> 00:00:39,120
we're going to use our knowledge of direct variation and inverse variation to

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,976
solve some problems. But before we get there, let's see if you understand the

11
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,343
difference between the two.
