00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Norvig] And the answer is that E is dependent on A.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
That much is fairly obvious.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
But it's also dependent on B.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Now, why is that?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
E is dependent on A because if the earthquake did occur,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
then it's more likely that the alarm would go off.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
On the other hand, E is also dependent on B

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
because if a burglary occurred, then that would explain why the alarm is going off,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and it would mean that the earthquake is less likely.
