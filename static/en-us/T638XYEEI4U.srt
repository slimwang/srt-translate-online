1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,200
We've seen this before during
Harris Corner Detection.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,387
The answer is when lambda one and
lambda two are both fairly large and

3
00:00:08,387 --> 00:00:12,947
of a comparable magnitude, it means
that there are multiple gradients in

4
00:00:12,947 --> 00:00:17,750
the same region that can be used to
locate the gradient direction correctly.

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,168
>> Right, you remember this picture
here, where we take a look and we say,

6
00:00:21,168 --> 00:00:24,600
well, if both of our eigenvalues
are small, then this is a flat region.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,580
There's not much.

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,370
If only one of the eigenvalues is big,
then that's not good,

9
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,300
and here,
lambda 1 lambda 2 is in the order.

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,120
If we make them lambda 1
always being the biggest one,

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,050
then, then of course lambda
2 is bigger than lambda 1.

12
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,000
But the idea was that we were only
in a corner if both lambda 1 and

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,220
lambda 2 were kind of large, all right?

14
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,590
And remember, we said that we could,

15
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:52,510
we didn't have any decent corners here
in the blank area that was in the sky?

16
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,700
Well, guess what?

17
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,940
You can't really tell the motion either,
right?

18
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:02,520
Likewise, we said it wasn't a good
corner if you were along an edge

19
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,630
because the corner could slide along
that edge, and we wouldn't where it is.

20
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,890
Well, movement happened along
the direction of the edge, and

21
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,720
we wouldn't know how it moved.

22
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,900
So, where do we, where can we
estimate motion really well?

23
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,640
Well, we can mo, estimate it really
well in this textured region.

24
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,960
Basically the same constraint that we
had on the Harris corners namely to have

25
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,880
to have the gradients varying over
the window and that's indicated by

26
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,640
having two reasonably large eigenvalues
of that second moment matrix.

27
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,620
That's the same thing that
applies to motion estimation.
