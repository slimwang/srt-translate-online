1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,590
The distribution of public keys is often
done through a certificate authority

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:05,780
or CA.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,340
Alice sends a public key to the CA.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,900
The CA verifies Alice's identification,
and

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:17,640
then creates a certificate of Alice's
public key and sends it to Alice.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,780
The certificate contains time of
creation, validity period, and

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,100
the ID of Alice, and the public key.

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,870
And, it is signed using
a CA's public key.

9
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:34,480
Alice can then send this
certificate to any user, say Bob.

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,950
Or, Alice can publish it so
that any user can get it.

11
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:43,640
It is assumed that all users
have the CAs public key, and

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,080
therefore a user, say Bob,
can use the CAs public key

13
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,230
to verify the certificate and
obtain Alice's public key.

14
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,020
Likewise, Bob can get his
certificate and send it to Alice so

15
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,540
that Alice has Bob's public key.
