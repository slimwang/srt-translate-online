1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now, the last piece in understanding customer segments is

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
understanding their pains.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We've been talking about all the wonderful stuff that we do for them

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
that makes them happy.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What are the things that we could get rid of that actually is kind of like

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
they've been walking around with an arrow through their head,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and they've just kind of accepted that for a while, but when you come about

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
you could say, "Hey, we could solve these problems for you?"

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Well, let's see what kind of problems we could solve.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Is there something your customers find too costly?

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Again, is it about time, and it costs too much?

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This is essentially the flip version of the gains.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The pains are what could we solve for these customers that they hate?

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Is there something about their product or service that's underperforming?

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's missing features. It's too slow.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It doesn't work well. It's bugging.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And what are the main difficulties and challenges?

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
One of the interesting things is that entrepreneurs come back and say,

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
"Yes, the customer said this was a real pain."

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
"Our product really solves these problems."

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Well, one of the things you need to know is was this like problem #47 on their list?

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Or is this in the top 3?

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Because most human beings, whether they're in corporations or even at home,

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
tend to only worry about the top 3 or 5,

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
so when you find out that this solves a pain,

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
the question you need to ask is in context, well,

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
what are the other pains you have?

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And you really want to understand their top 10, top 20,

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and then to find out you're #32 or 47 I wouldn't be celebrating,

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
but I actually would be asking, "Well, wait a minute."

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
"Is there any way that our product or service could actually solve

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
anything in the top 5?"

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And if not, maybe you're in the wrong customer segment,

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and so you want to understand what's keeping your customer awake at night?

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Or maybe conversely, maybe you want to keep them awake at night,

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
but you want to figure out what are their big issues, concerns, and worries?

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And then finally, the last piece is what are the barriers to adopt your product?

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Is it it costs too much up front?

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Maybe you have a pricing issue to decide later.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Gee, it takes a long time to learn, or we're happy with what we have,

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and it's kind of okay, and what makes your customers feel bad?

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Frustrations, annoyances, et cetera,

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
and what do they fear?

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Financial or social risks, what could go wrong, et cetera.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You need to understand all of this.
