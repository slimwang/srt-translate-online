1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
As with any devil's guide, you should of course not do what's in here,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
but you should do the exact opposite.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This means you should go and fix the problem not the symptom,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
understand what your program should do, and finally to proceed systematically.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Let me come up with a quiz here--before you apply fix, what is it you should do--

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
understand what the problem is, understand what the code should do, or/and

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
be able to predict how the fix would address the problem.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Over to you.
