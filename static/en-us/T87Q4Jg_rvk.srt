00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,810
From these individual QRDA files,
popHealth aggregates and

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,210
summarizes quality metrics.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:12,890
Here, for example, are 500 patients
from a 10 provider practice,

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:16,860
in which, individual physicians
could be using different EMRs.

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,570
This practice might be under
an outcome based contract,

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:24,320
where their revenue is tied to meeting
goals, for these quality metrics.

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,190
Here, they're doing well on
smoking screening, but not so well

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:34,800
on weight screening, particularly for
adults in the 18 to 64 group.

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,920
This points out the need to identify the
right group of patients for each metric.

10
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,120
For example, you would not normally
perform screening mammograms on men for

11
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,520
breast cancer.

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,000
And the recommendations for

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,980
this screening are increasingly pointing
to a specific age range for women.

14
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,760
Note that in recognition of this key
point, the numerator, typically,

15
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,580
the number of patients who's care
met criteria is in green for

16
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,959
each metric, while the denominator,

17
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,860
the applicable target patient group for
the metric is in blue.
