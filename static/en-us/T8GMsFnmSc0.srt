00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:06,320
Bootstrapping can really,
really test your soul in a lot of ways.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,270
You have to have a thick,
thick skin because

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,590
people are going to tell you that
what you're doing isn't valuable or

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,780
they're not going to see your
perspective, so you have to have

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,600
resolute belief in your core goal for
you to be successful in this space.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,430
Bootstrapping is often looked at as or
it can be looked at as you're crazy or

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,830
that's never going to work or
how could anybody find value in that.

8
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,610
You'll hear a lot of naysayers and I
think it's overcoming the mental games,

9
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:40,420
both externally and internally,
that are what makes bootstrapping hard.

10
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,950
You can't listen to the negative
voices that are are telling you

11
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:44,580
you can't do it.

12
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,670
If you've started off with
the belief that you can,

13
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,470
test that theory all the way through.

14
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:49,230
You owe it to yourself.
