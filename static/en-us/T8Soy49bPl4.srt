00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,600
Now this code is almost identical to the code you've written prior to actually

00:00:03,612 --> 00:00:07,175
determine whether or not two rectangles intersect. Effectively we test the top

00:00:07,187 --> 00:00:10,675
left, bottom and right boundaries of each rectangles together to determine

4
00:00:10,687 --> 00:00:12,350
whether or not they're intersecting.
