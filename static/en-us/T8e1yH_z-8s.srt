00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,695
The last area we're going to discuss in regards to memory, is what's known as

2
00:00:03,695 --> 00:00:08,640
Long-term Potentiation. Long-term Potentiation is the strengthening of a

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,928
synaptic connection that happens when the synapse of one neuron repeatedly

4
00:00:12,928 --> 00:00:19,140
fires and excites. Excites another neuron. Much of the work on the study on

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,074
long-term potentiation came from Hebb. Now, you should recall Hebb's law from

6
00:00:23,074 --> 00:00:27,716
our lesson on the brain. Neurons that fire together, wire together. Another

7
00:00:27,716 --> 00:00:31,559
researcher, Kandel, discovered that even as sea slug was able to create a

8
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:38,203
long-term memory. This was found by how the sea slug reacted to a shock. So,

9
00:00:38,203 --> 00:00:41,924
what he did was administered a shock to the tail of the sea slug, and the sea

10
00:00:41,924 --> 00:00:46,995
slug had a defensive response. When he did this only one time, the defensive

11
00:00:46,995 --> 00:00:51,910
posture lasted about ten minutes. However, if you did this four to five times

12
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:56,525
in close succession, the sea slug had the same defensive response that lasted

13
00:00:56,525 --> 00:01:02,911
for days after the shocks. Which shows the sea slug created a long term memory,

14
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:08,456
since its response lasted for days. Kandel quoted that conversion from short to

15
00:01:08,456 --> 00:01:14,070
long term memory storage requires spaced repetition. This goes along with the

16
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,142
idea that practice makes perfect, even in snails. So, from research such as

17
00:01:18,142 --> 00:01:21,418
this, we can see again the importance of neurons firing together and wiring

18
00:01:21,418 --> 00:01:26,340
together, and the result that changes in our brain and our behavior. Other

19
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,494
research by Kandel showed how particular genes getting turned on in the nucleus

20
00:01:30,494 --> 00:01:36,128
of a cell can signal neural structures to grow which is neurogenesis. But this

21
00:01:36,128 --> 00:01:40,953
only happens during long term memory not during short term memory. Amazingly

22
00:01:40,953 --> 00:01:44,797
what this means is that every time we learn something that's long term it's

23
00:01:44,797 --> 00:01:50,474
because our brain has actually changed. So, if you remember what we're talking

24
00:01:50,474 --> 00:01:53,594
about right now in this lesson, next week, that means that your brain has

25
00:01:53,594 --> 00:01:57,078
officially formed new neural connections which are the basis for your memory of

26
00:01:57,078 --> 00:02:02,222
this lesson. So you can officially say that your udacity psychology class

27
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:04,330
physically changed your brain.
