Let's say that we have some real number a, that is nonnegative. As in, a is just

2
00:00:04,835 --> 00:00:09,284
not negative. It's either zero or it's positive. What then can we say the

3
00:00:09,284 --> 00:00:13,818
absolute value of a is equal to? And if make a negative, if we multiply a by

4
00:00:13,818 --> 00:00:17,501
negative 1, then what is the absolute value of that number?
