00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,750
As this figure suggests,
the device space is extremely vaporous.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,190
Device spaces come in
all sorts of shapes and

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:10,450
sizes, with a lot of variability
in their hardware architecture,

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,010
in the type of functionality
that they provide,

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:17,640
in the interfaces that applications
use to interact with them.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,240
So in order to simply our discussion
in this lesson, we'll point out the key

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:29,340
features of a device that enable the
integration of devices into a system.

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,010
Any device can be abstracted to
have the following set of features.

9
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,110
Any device will have a set of
control registers that can be

10
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,340
accessed by the CPU and
that permit the CPU device interactions.

11
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,670
These are typically divided
into command registers that

12
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,570
the CPU uses to control what
exactly the device will be doing.

13
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,000
Data registers that
are in some way used for

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,620
the CPU to control the data
transfers in and out of the device.

15
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,990
And then also some status registers
that are used by the CPU to find out

16
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,210
exactly what's happening on the device.

17
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,440
Internally, the device will incorporate
all other device-specific logic.

18
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,110
This will include a microcontroller,
and that's like the device CPU.

19
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,550
This is what controls all of
the operations that actually take

20
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,585
place on the device.

21
00:01:15,585 --> 00:01:17,830
It may be influenced by the CPU, but

22
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,500
the microcontroller will make sure
what things happen versus not.

23
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,830
Then there's some amount of on device
memory, any other types of processing

24
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,360
clauses, special chips, special
hardware that's needed on the device.

25
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,370
Like for instance,
you convert analog to digital signals

26
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:38,460
to actually interact with the network
medium, with the physical medium.

27
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,780
Whether it's optics or, or
copper, whatever else, so

28
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,920
all of those chips will
be part of the device.
