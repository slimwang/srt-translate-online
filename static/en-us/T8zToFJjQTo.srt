1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,880
FHIR solutions are built from a set of
modular components called resources.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,800
The FHIR resources are a subset of RIM,
essentially the most important and

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,820
most commonly used data constructs,
organized and categorized as shown here.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,811
I suggest you visit the resources
section of the FHIR website to

5
00:00:22,811 --> 00:00:26,144
further explore this
key element of FHIR.

6
00:00:26,144 --> 00:00:30,782
These resources can easily be assembled
into working systems that more quickly

7
00:00:30,782 --> 00:00:34,810
and easily solve real world clinical and
administrative problems.

8
00:00:36,025 --> 00:00:41,490
FHIR is suitable for a wide
variety of contexts as shown here.

9
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,243
This might include mobile phone apps,
cloud communications,

10
00:00:45,243 --> 00:00:48,717
EHR based data sharing,
server communication in large and

11
00:00:48,717 --> 00:00:53,440
institutional health care provider
settings and other environments.

12
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,520
The key is the use of FHIR resource
tags in the underlying data structures.

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,930
The interaction between the systems and

14
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:07,270
the databases is via restful APIs
which are relatively easy and

15
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:12,010
fast to implement, further facilitating
innovation and development.

16
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,500
As we discussed earlier,

17
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,450
a similar web-services approach was
specified by Healthy Decisions.

18
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,590
The web-services paradigm is
increasingly seen as the best vehicle

19
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,480
for developing and more rapidly
deploying interoperability solutions and

20
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,340
even analytic routines, and

21
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,470
services such as those required for
clinical decision support.

22
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,350
This is an important trend that
I strongly encourage you to

23
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,470
follow over time.
