1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,840
So this leads us into the question of why should we be studying cameras and

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,590
computational photography?

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:09,950
One, these days, cameras are extremely pervasive.

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,730
Almost everyone has a camera.

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,620
All of you who are taking this class,

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,140
most probably have one, if not more than one camera.

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:22,470
They're in form of a smartphone or perhaps an advanced camera like a instant,

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,510
you know, instant camera or a handheld small camera, or even perhaps an SLR.

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,060
Of course, in our environment, cameras are everywhere.

10
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,890
They're getting to be smaller, ubiquitous.

11
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,515
And of course, we all know the stories about how many cameras are there

12
00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:41,690
in perhaps things like security and other types of domains.

13
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:46,630
One thing that is true within all of this, and that is that as cameras get

14
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:52,400
smaller, there has always been a real significant improvement in optics.

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,260
And the applied field of optics has really kind of gotten more advanced, and

16
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,960
what newer kind of optics we can produce.

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,090
So of course, there has been improvements in devices and optics.

18
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:07,680
Of course, these sensors are getting cheaper and cheaper, too.

19
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,190
In fact, better, cheaper sensors like CCD and

20
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:15,750
CMOS are available, and essentially electronics is evolving as a field, too.

21
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,140
When we cover sensors, we'll talk about those advances, too.
