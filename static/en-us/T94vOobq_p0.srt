1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,171
So there's only one really important and

2
00:00:03,171 --> 00:00:07,055
interesting thing about this
equation and here it is.

3
00:00:07,055 --> 00:00:11,274
Notice the Z value of the point.

4
00:00:11,274 --> 00:00:13,933
So this is written in a funny way,
right?

5
00:00:13,933 --> 00:00:16,056
This is Z of x, y.

6
00:00:16,056 --> 00:00:16,609
What does that mean?

7
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:20,551
That means, if I'm at some point x,
y, remember that's a ray in space.

8
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:21,751
Right?
Z in the,

9
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:26,204
in accordance to my camera
is the depth of that point.

10
00:00:26,204 --> 00:00:32,043
You'll notice that this thing is made up
of two terms, the A term and the B term.

11
00:00:32,043 --> 00:00:34,889
The A term has the translation in it.

12
00:00:34,889 --> 00:00:37,251
The B term has the rotation in it.

13
00:00:37,251 --> 00:00:42,075
The depth is only in the A term,
the translation term.

14
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:46,011
Why?
Think about motion that happens.

15
00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:50,950
If you remember, a projective
camera just has rays out in space.

16
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,406
And you can think of the rays as
going out till they hit something and

17
00:00:54,406 --> 00:00:55,405
they stop, okay?

18
00:00:55,405 --> 00:00:59,027
Now, if I rotate those rays.

19
00:00:59,027 --> 00:01:00,896
In fact, maybe I can draw this.

20
00:01:00,896 --> 00:01:03,613
So here's my point and
here's a whole bunch of rays.

21
00:01:03,613 --> 00:01:07,827
So let's suppose here's my image
plane for frame one, okay?

22
00:01:07,827 --> 00:01:14,149
If I rotate some angle, so
my image plane will now be there.

23
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:17,782
So before this ray was hitting
at that point on the plane and

24
00:01:17,782 --> 00:01:20,615
now it's hitting at this
point on the plane.

25
00:01:20,615 --> 00:01:23,605
So, if before it was in the middle,
now it's to the right-hand side.

26
00:01:23,605 --> 00:01:24,238
Okay, fine.

27
00:01:24,238 --> 00:01:29,384
Notice I didn't tell you how far the
rays went, because as the image plane

28
00:01:29,384 --> 00:01:34,787
rotates and it cuts through the rays,
it doesn't matter how far the rays go.

29
00:01:34,787 --> 00:01:41,934
So the depth has no impact on the amount
of motion that you see as you rotate,

30
00:01:41,934 --> 00:01:46,031
but if I translate
the depth matters a lot.

31
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:47,900
Remember, the whole
thing about the moon?

32
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,684
Right?

33
00:01:48,684 --> 00:01:50,037
That the moon seems to follow you?

34
00:01:50,037 --> 00:01:51,964
And we're going to
demonstrate this right now.

35
00:01:51,964 --> 00:01:55,354
So now get out your rulers
on the screen, right?

36
00:01:55,354 --> 00:01:57,351
I'm going to take a step to the right,
like that.

37
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:58,953
Okay?

38
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:04,003
So the amount of motion that you
saw is whatever it is, all right?

39
00:02:04,003 --> 00:02:06,824
Now, I take the same size step.

40
00:02:06,824 --> 00:02:09,419
Megan, did I move in more of the field?

41
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,496
Did I move much further across the field
than I did when I was in the back?

42
00:02:12,496 --> 00:02:13,506
Megan's going yes.

43
00:02:13,506 --> 00:02:16,741
In other words, the amount of motion you
get, this is called motion parallax.

44
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:18,152
It is a function of the depth.

45
00:02:18,152 --> 00:02:22,936
So that really dorky demonstration
is why the Z value is

46
00:02:22,936 --> 00:02:27,619
only in the term that has
the translation component.

47
00:02:27,619 --> 00:02:29,115
If you don't translate,

48
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:32,518
the depth doesn't matter in
terms of how much things move.

49
00:02:32,518 --> 00:02:37,493
That's why we talked about when
you build panoramas from rotation,

50
00:02:37,493 --> 00:02:39,388
I can just map the planes.

51
00:02:39,388 --> 00:02:42,911
I can map the, the rays, because it
didn't matter what the depth was.

52
00:02:42,911 --> 00:02:44,676
This is the general motion model.

53
00:02:44,676 --> 00:02:47,033
I, I hope this was not too pedantic.

54
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:51,160
I like tying back the stuff we're doing
now with the, the stuff we did before.
