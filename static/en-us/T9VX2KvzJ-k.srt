1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,957
So, we found that the standard error is 0.024, but we still need our interval

2
00:00:05,957 --> 00:00:12,348
estimate. Let's say that we want a 95% confidence interval, abbreviated CI, for

3
00:00:12,348 --> 00:00:16,570
short. I'm going to put our standard error of the mean over here. And I really

4
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:22,420
should make this capital N, since it's the population, and n is the sample size

5
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:28,139
20. Based on the results from our sample mean, which was 0.13, then the true

6
00:00:28,139 --> 00:00:34,327
population mean, if everyone has access to this musical lesson will be somewhere

7
00:00:34,327 --> 00:00:40,557
around 0.13. And within 95% confidence interval, we're assuming that this sample

8
00:00:40,557 --> 00:00:46,227
mean is one of the 95% of sample means that will be around the true population

9
00:00:46,227 --> 00:00:52,973
mean. We're going to call the true population Mu sub I. I for intervention. So,

10
00:00:52,973 --> 00:00:59,173
this means that if this sample mean is within this 95% of Mu sub I, then Mu sub

11
00:00:59,173 --> 00:01:05,203
I, then Mu sub I is can be here or here. See how that sample mean is on the

12
00:01:05,203 --> 00:01:11,644
lower bound of that 95%. Whereas here, the sample mean is on the upper bound of

13
00:01:11,644 --> 00:01:16,668
that 95%. So if Mu sub I can either be here or here, in this interval

14
00:01:16,668 --> 00:01:22,980
surrounding 0.13, then this is our confidence interval. What are these values?

15
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:28,334
So, this value here should be what? And this value here should be what?
