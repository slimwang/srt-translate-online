The answer is, sometimes it will not remove enough friends. Let's trace through

2
00:00:04,574 --> 00:00:08,060
an example and talk about why. For this John example, in the for loop we start

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:13,530
with i is 0, i is less than the number of friends. The friend at position 0

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:19,040
doesn't like John, so we remove that friend. And now the indexes of the friends

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:28,926
change. Whereas before this was 0, 1, 2, 3. Now, it's 0, 1, 2. So we'll check

6
00:00:28,926 --> 00:00:33,614
if the friend at position 1 likes John back. The person at position 1 is

7
00:00:33,614 --> 00:00:37,684
Jamesha, and Jamesha does like John back. So we skip over this, and come back

8
00:00:37,684 --> 00:00:42,637
up to the top of the loop. Now i is 2. So we check if friend 2 likes John back,

9
00:00:42,637 --> 00:00:46,684
friend 2 does like John back so we'll come back up to the top of the loop

10
00:00:46,684 --> 00:00:50,944
skipping the remove step and now i is 3 which is now less than the number of

11
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:59,259
friends so we're done but Maria never got removed. After removing TJ, Maria's

12
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:04,670
index went from 1 to 0, but the counter in the loop went from 0 to 1. So we

13
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,564
never checked whether Maria should be removed or not. This code will sometimes

14
00:01:08,564 --> 00:01:11,680
skip friends and not check if they should be removed.
