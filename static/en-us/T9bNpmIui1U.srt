1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,590
We're progressing toward
the learning health system.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,710
As a result of the federal efforts
we'll discuss in lesson two,

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,090
electronic record adoption
levels are very high.

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:14,120
And the focus is now shifting
to the next challenge,

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,240
the inability of the hundreds
of systems in use to share data.

6
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,730
The term for this is interoperability.

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,200
And we'll discuss it in
more detail in lesson 5B.

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,910
We'll place particular
emphasis on a new approach

9
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,510
that is rapidly gaining traction, and

10
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:36,170
that appears to provide a long-sought
practical solution to interoperability.

11
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,640
It's called Fast Healthcare
Interoperability Resources, or

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,274
FHIR, F-H-I-R.

13
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:47,710
Through FHIR, access is provided by
web services such as rest API's.

14
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:52,050
And health care data is packaged
in the JSON or XML formats.

15
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,340
Or to use widely on the internet and
by other industries.
