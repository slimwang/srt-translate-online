00:00:00,132 --> 00:00:04,229
In the last question in the last homework of the

2
00:00:04,229 --> 00:00:07,929
course, we were asked to just define a web page

3
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:10,481
that uses some HTML and JavaScript. So if you

4
00:00:10,481 --> 00:00:13,805
ran it, you got this default, this comes in a

5
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:16,613
placeholder text that we gave you and we invite

6
00:00:16,613 --> 00:00:18,950
you to use some creativity and have fun with your

7
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,781
brother. Someone who knew just that. So I

8
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:25,296
wasn’t very creative. I adapted the code

9
00:00:25,296 --> 00:00:27,668
from a website you may have heard of called

10
00:00:27,668 --> 00:00:31,345
searchwithpeter.info to match the context of our

11
00:00:31,345 --> 00:00:33,048
web browser and also to add a bit of JavaScript

12
00:00:33,048 --> 00:00:35,764
that will work in a JavaScript interpreter. And the

13
00:00:35,764 --> 00:00:39,723
result of that, I used a header, some paragraph

14
00:00:39,723 --> 00:00:44,158
tags, a link, an image, I used strong to make that

15
00:00:44,158 --> 00:00:47,073
bigger and this was generated by JavaScript

16
00:00:47,073 --> 00:00:50,977
execution, which isn’t very complicated. Udacity

17
00:00:50,977 --> 00:00:53,697
equals true if Udacity write it out and some

18
00:00:53,697 --> 00:00:55,522
of the P tags as we are going to interpret

19
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,867
it which is what we did in question two.
