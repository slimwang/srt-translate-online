1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,770
As a startup it can be challenging
to set your marketing goals.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,520
You don't want to waste your time
on things that you'll do nothing

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,610
with later.

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,420
This is why setting your goals is so
important.

5
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,290
Consider this.

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,940
>> Please tell me which
way to go from here.

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,290
>> That depends a good deal
on where you want to go.

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,670
>> I don't care much where.

9
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,920
>> Then it doesn't much
matter which way to go.

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,792
You're sure enough to get somewhere,
if only you walk long enough.

11
00:00:29,792 --> 00:00:32,750
>> You need goals that are realistic and
attainable.

12
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,310
It's fun to spend a few minutes
thinking about your vision and

13
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,990
high level goals, like to be the most
visible brand of the industry.

14
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:42,480
Or, make sure every potential
user wants to talk about our app.

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,750
But as a startup, you probably don't
have enough time to spend full weeks on

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,450
wording your high level goals.

17
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,300
You'll want to jump into
your actionable objectives.

18
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,758
I want you to take this opportunity to
quickly draft two actionable marketing

19
00:00:53,758 --> 00:00:55,043
goals for your own app idea.

20
00:00:55,043 --> 00:00:59,400
There is no right or wrong answer here,
but we still encourage you to try it.

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,330
If you don't have your own app,
help Lauren and

22
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,300
me by drafting two actionable
marketing goals for Embarkment.
