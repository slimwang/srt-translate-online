00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,004
All we need to do here is substitute this expression into the slot for n and the

2
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:10,109
equation for p. Once we've done that, we just distribute multiplication by c to

3
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:14,931
the two terms in the parentheses here. And that gives us a final answer of p

4
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:18,373
equals negative 200 c squared plus 18,000 c minus m.
