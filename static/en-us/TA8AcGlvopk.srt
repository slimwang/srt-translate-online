1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,000
So, now let's look at what methods
we can come up that actually makes

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,070
our future detection invariant to scale.

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:10,430
Let's take the same examples
of these two shapes.

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,120
Again, you can tell that they
are the same, just scaled up.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,840
And of course,
I kind of look at this window.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,890
It basically says that this is an edge.

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,660
Of course, when I look at this window,
it comes across as a corner.

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,690
So one thing I can do now is start
looking at different regions.

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,790
So, basically,
consider this region a circle, and

10
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,610
they start looking at different
sizes around the same point.

11
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,830
So, in essence,
what I'm doing now is I'm zooming out.

12
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,580
I'm kind of wanting to look at
the same region but from farther away,

13
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,790
which actually would start making
this object start smaller.

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,220
So I try out another region, a circle.

15
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,230
Well no, that doesn't work.

16
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,260
Let me try out, at the same point,
another larger one.

17
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,460
And if I keep going and let's say I
get to this scale, all of a sudden,

18
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,000
this detector is going to
fire this to be a point.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,780
That's a corner, just like this.

20
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,072
So in essence,
by scaling up my detector regions,

21
00:01:00,072 --> 00:01:04,590
I can actually accomplish exactly
what this one is doing and in essence

22
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:09,590
what that comes out to is now I would
actually have scaling variant matching.

23
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,700
So, in this basic idea here is the
region of corresponding sizes will look

24
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,300
the same in both images, as long
as I can come up with that scale.

25
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,415
So this does require a little bit of,

26
00:01:19,415 --> 00:01:23,646
kind of coming up with the process that
lets me find the right size of the new

27
00:01:23,646 --> 00:01:26,870
region that would let me
compare this scale to this one.
