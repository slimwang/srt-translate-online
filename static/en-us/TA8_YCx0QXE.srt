00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:04,480
We learned how to use free tools to
understand what people will search when

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,190
searching for a solution.

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,920
Now let's think about
the places either virtual or

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,310
physical that potential customers
will be exposed to your business.

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,650
These places are the path to get

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,690
We call them distribution channels.

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,080
For Coca-Cola, a distribution channel
can be a grocery store or a restaurant.

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,950
Usually for consumer packaged goods,

00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:31,320
retail, distributors,
e-commerce websites, things like that.

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,760
Now for your app, it'll probably be one
of the app stores, or a website, or

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,870
even a creative partnership
you can think of.

12
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,010
So on that note,
let's talk about partnerships.
