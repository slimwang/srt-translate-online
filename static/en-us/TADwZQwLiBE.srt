1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,710
Pods can be created using
pod configuration files.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,480
Let's take a moment to explore
the model of pod configuration file.

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,560
There are a few things to notice here,

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,730
you'll see that our pod is made up
of one container, the monolith.

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,580
You can also see that we're passing
a few arguments to the container

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,100
when it starts up.

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,000
Lastly, we're open up port 80 for
HTTP traffic, and

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,350
port 81 for our health checks.

9
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,710
Create the monolith pod using kubectl.

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,890
Let's examine our pods.

11
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:33,750
We'll use a kubectl get pods command
to list all the pods running in

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,650
the default namespace.

13
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,050
It may take a few seconds before
the monolith pod is up and

14
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,780
running, as a monolith
container image needs to be

15
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,360
pulled from the doca hub
before we can run it.

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,810
Used the kubectl describe command to get
more information about the monolith pod.

17
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,220
You'll see a lot of information
about the monolith pod,

18
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,810
including the product IP address and
the event log.

19
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,120
This information will come in
handy when troubleshooting.

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,790
As you can see kubernetes makes it easy
to create pods by describing them in

21
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,510
configuration pods and

22
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,450
viewing information about
them while they're running.

23
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:08,370
At this point you have the ability to
create all the pods your deployment

24
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:08,960
requires.
