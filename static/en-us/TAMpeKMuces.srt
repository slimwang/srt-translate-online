00:00:00,168 --> 00:00:01,459
Awesome work.

2
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:04,661
The solution videos in this class
will be pretty short since the actual

3
00:00:04,661 --> 00:00:07,550
solutions are all in the course code for
you to read on your own.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,580
I do want to show you one thing though,
and

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,010
that's the importance of making sure you
don't put stuff in the render callback

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,890
that you don't want
called 60 times a second.

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,020
Let's say we accidentally put
initStars inside the render callback.

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,360
Any guesses on what's going to happen?

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,970
Let's give it a try.

10
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,070
Whoa, warp speed initiated or something.

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,230
So what's happening here is the position
of the star is being recalculated

12
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,640
every single frame.

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,140
Remember, be careful about what
you put in the render callback.
