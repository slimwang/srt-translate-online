1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,259
Now that we've explored how
to display points on the map,

2
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:05,629
we can give the user more
information about those points.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,550
Info windows are pop-up displays
which are shown at a given location,

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,560
either with or without a marker.

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,228
They're great for giving contexts,
such as text describing a location,

6
00:00:16,228 --> 00:00:18,849
or showing images related to it.

7
00:00:18,849 --> 00:00:22,429
Creating an info window works
very similarly to the marker

8
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:25,949
in that we'll use an object and
several basic parameters.

9
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:29,910
Creating a new info window instance only
requires that we put some content into

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,730
the info window, a string or
a pre-defined set of elements.

11
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:39,079
The info window though, unlike
the marker, won't open automatically.

12
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:42,339
We need to add one more thing to
tell it when and where to open.

13
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:44,740
We're adding an event listener so

14
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,800
that the info window only opens
when we click on the market.

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,950
Within the event listener,
we'll call the info window.open method.

16
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,240
Passing in the map on which to open, and

17
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,590
optionally, the marker
on which to anchor it.

18
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:01,740
If we didn't pass in a marker,
we would need to give the info window

19
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,120
a position property so
that it has a place to open.

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,587
So if we click on the marker,
we can see our lonely info window.

21
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,108
But we want to show a whole
bunch of locations.

22
00:01:12,108 --> 00:01:15,207
We don't want to show
the user just one house.

23
00:01:15,207 --> 00:01:18,959
I'm going to delete our single
point marker and info window.

24
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,719
So here we've created an array of
objects with some listing titles, and

25
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:25,599
a bunch of lat longs in
the initialize function, so

26
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,899
that we have all of the information
we need in the browser.

27
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,609
In your own projects,
we'd recommend using a database, and

28
00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:33,780
serving the information to your site.

29
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,710
There are a bunch of features of
the API that allow you to easily render

30
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:39,119
large amounts of data onto your map.

31
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,150
You can read more about them in
the link, in the instructor notes.

32
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,800
For now,
since we only have a few points,

33
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,980
we're just going to keep
the data in the browser.

34
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,760
Now instead of creating one marker,

35
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,609
we'll make a whole bunch of
them out of this information.

36
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:54,290
We'll add a blank marker array globally,
since we'll have only one of these for

37
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,201
the listings in our site.

38
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:01,106
Then we'll loop through the locations
we created in order to create one

39
00:02:01,106 --> 00:02:02,632
marker per location.

40
00:02:02,632 --> 00:02:07,591
We'll keep each newly created marker
instance in the markers array to keep

41
00:02:07,591 --> 00:02:08,900
them organized.

42
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,210
Now, we want an info window to appear
when any one of the markers is clicked,

43
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,240
and we want the content
to reflect that marker.

44
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,740
So we'll add an on click
event to each marker.

45
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,110
We'll make a separate function,

46
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,640
passing in the marker that was clicked,
which is, this.

47
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:26,909
And the info window that we
created on initialize here.

48
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:29,460
This function is essentially
going to tell the info window to

49
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:34,140
open at that marker, and populate with
information specific to that marker.

50
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:36,500
We'll create this function below.

51
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,090
Each time one of our
listing markers is clicked,

52
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,370
this populate info window
function is going to be called.

53
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,730
Essentially, all this is doing is
setting the content of the info window

54
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:50,959
to the marker's title, and
opening the info window on that marker.

55
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:56,469
Finally, we may have listings that
are outside the initial zoom area and

56
00:02:56,469 --> 00:03:00,073
we want to be able to adjust the
boundaries of the map to fit everything

57
00:03:00,073 --> 00:03:01,245
that we want the user to see.

58
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:05,669
So we'll create a new
lat long bounds instance

59
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:09,149
which captures the southwest and
northeast corners of the view port.

60
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:13,639
Then we'll extend it for
every marker that we make.

61
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:17,780
And finally, we'll tell the map
to fit itself to those bounds.

62
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,430
Voila, we have a very
basic listings app.

63
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,710
If I click each marker,

64
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,310
a brief description of the listing
shows above that marker.

65
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,849
Once you can do that, there's
a crazy number of things you can do.

66
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:34,699
Change your markers to be custom icons,
put images, links,

67
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:37,069
and other information into
the info windows, and more.

68
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:41,500
If I wanted to, I could change all of my
markers to be pictures of Ajays head.

69
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:46,109
But on a serious note, let's make one
more improvement before we move on
