1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:05,640
For the visualization, countries and player were encoding along the x axis.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,570
Time encoded along the y axis.

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,920
Goals Scored was encoded by the size of the circles.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,510
And the Top Scorer was encoded by color hue, which was yellow.

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,290
And now, let's see on the graphic.

6
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,210
We can see that time is encoded along the y axis.

7
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,460
Country and player is encoded along the x axis.

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,620
The number of goals is encoded by the size of the circles,

9
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,270
indicated by this legend and

10
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:32,630
the top score is indicated by color hue, which in this case is yellow.

11
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,910
Now I know this might seem trivial, but these were deliberate choices.

12
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,920
The person who designed this graphic,

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,380
thought very carefully about the most important variables.

14
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,320
And how to place them in the graphic, and represent them visually.
