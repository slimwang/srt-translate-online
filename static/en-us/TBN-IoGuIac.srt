00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,360
Now the fire projectile from one awesome robot, towards the other evil robot,

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,744
we have take into account just a teeny bit of math. Firstly, for mouse input,

3
00:00:07,744 --> 00:00:11,335
we need to find the directional vector that represents a line from the robot

4
00:00:11,335 --> 00:00:16,572
location to the mouse cursor in game space. To do this, we simply subtract the

5
00:00:16,572 --> 00:00:21,080
mouse position from the robot position, giving us an unnormalized vector. We

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,915
can normalize this vector and use it to define the velocity path for the

7
00:00:24,915 --> 00:00:28,689
projectile, fill in the code, as specified.
