1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,630
The answer is the first and the third.

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,440
The first is just
the Frobenius-Hall theorem, and

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,610
in fact this condition is equivalent
to there being a perfect matching.

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:13,760
A vertex cover of size L always exists,
just pick L.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,030
Remember that the vertex cover
is just an upper bound, so

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,940
this does not imply that
there's a perfect matching.

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:25,409
Lastly, if there is a matching that
admits an alternating Hamiltonian cycle,

8
00:00:25,409 --> 00:00:30,222
then there have to be half as many
matched edges as there are vertices,

9
00:00:30,222 --> 00:00:31,791
which is the size of L.

10
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:34,194
Note that the implication
does not work the other way.

11
00:00:34,194 --> 00:00:37,395
There are plenty of perfect matchings
that don't admit alternating

12
00:00:37,395 --> 00:00:38,450
Hamiltonian cycles.
