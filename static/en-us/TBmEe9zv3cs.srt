1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:06,086
A squared minus 2a minus 3 divided by the quantity, a squared plus a minus 1 is

2
00:00:06,086 --> 00:00:11,166
correct. I hope these are getting easier. We know the LCD must be a times a

3
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:16,428
minus 1. Since these are the only factors that appear in our denominators. We

4
00:00:16,428 --> 00:00:21,888
multiply the fraction by the LCD divided by the LCD, so we really multiply each

5
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:26,887
of these terms by the number a times a minus 1. For our first term the a is

6
00:00:26,887 --> 00:00:31,978
reduced to 1. So we're left with a plus 3 times a minus 1. For the second term

7
00:00:31,978 --> 00:00:37,395
the a minus 1s cancel, leaving us with negative 4 times a. And this is why you

8
00:00:37,395 --> 00:00:41,288
want to be really careful to pay attention to this sign. We have negative 4 a

9
00:00:41,288 --> 00:00:46,656
not positive 4 a, and in our denominator we're left with a times a which is a

10
00:00:46,656 --> 00:00:51,420
squared, and 1 times a minus 1. We add that as our second term in the

11
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:57,120
denominator. If we multiply these two together we'll get a squared plus 2a minus

12
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,281
3. Our denominator just has the terms a squared plus 1 a minus 1 we combine our

13
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:07,471
like terms to get negative 2a for our numerator. Now, we definitely want to try

14
00:01:07,471 --> 00:01:12,531
to see if we can simplify this more, but I know I can't. I can't find factors of

15
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:17,749
negative 1 that sum to positive 1, so we're really done. The numerator can be

16
00:01:17,749 --> 00:01:21,844
factored, but again this doesn't help us out, since we can't cancel a factor

17
00:01:21,844 --> 00:01:27,053
that appears here with one that appears here. This is our final answer.
