1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,380
In fact, the t-statistic I gave you is the one that we get when we do a

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,870
hypothesis test for the plane flight distance versus cost that we talked about

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:13,820
earlier. When we do linear regression in R, the statistical program that I've

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:18,700
briefly mentioned before, this is the output. Usually, you'll do software to do

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:23,760
any type of hypothesis test. Whether it's on a sample mean or two sample means

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,050
or the correlation coefficient or the slope, or whatever. The important thing

7
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,369
is that you understand the meaning of the software output. Here you see the t

8
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:38,540
value for this slope is pretty big, 5.77, the same value I gave you earlier,

9
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:43,220
and the p-value is pretty small. There are three stars by it, indicating that

10
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,510
the p-value is small enough to reject the null. Here are the significance

11
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:52,950
codes, which list the alpha levels. We see that three stars means we can reject

12
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:58,270
the null at the significance level of point 0.001. Since this slop is

13
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:02,990
significant, we know there's a true relationship between the distance traveled

14
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:08,160
and the cost of the ticket. Note that we can also conduct a hypothesis test on

15
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,220
the Y intercept, and in this case we see that's its not significant. The p

16
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:18,250
value is pretty high at 0.2 and there are no starts by it. This means that

17
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:25,840
we're not totally sure that the true intercept is at 161.38775. However, in

18
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,930
many cases, the estimate for the intercept is not of interest to researchers.

19
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:36,841
One reason is that this value could have no meaning in real life. Because x

20
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:43,010
equals 0 may not be realistic. For example, the price of iPods at the year zero

21
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,070
AD. iPods weren't even invented back then.
