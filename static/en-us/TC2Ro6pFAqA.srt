00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,650
This first ones incorrect. As n increase the standard error decreases. With a

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:09,742
greater sample size we have less error. The t-distribution does approach a

3
00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:13,838
normal distribution. And as it approaches a normal distribution it gets

4
00:00:13,838 --> 00:00:20,993
skinnier in the tails. And also, as n increases, then s approaches sigma.
