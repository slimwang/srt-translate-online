1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,130
>> All right. Now, you might get a misleading impression

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,460
from what I just presented there, because I did this

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,010
sort of odd trick that's not really very kosher. Specifically,

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,520
when I gave the example of a teacher asking questions

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,270
to to lead the learner to a particular hypothesis, I

6
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,310
allowed the teacher to ask any possible question in the

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,570
universe of possible questions. Right, so the teacher could construct

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,790
a question, and in this particular case, that, that specifically

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,700
had a yes answer for the target hypothesis. And a no

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,790
answer everywhere else. And that just simply doesn't happen in any

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,130
realistic learning questions. So we need to think a little bit

12
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,810
more about the question of what happens when the teacher is

13
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,250
constrained with respect to the kinds of queries that it can

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,310
suggest. So I'm going to, I'm going to set up classic computational learning

15
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,560
theory hypothesis class, and we'll go through some examples about what

16
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,830
happens when the teacher's constrained in this way. So let's imagine that

17
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,760
our input space is basically k-bit inputs,

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,685
so x1 through xk, and the hypothesis class

19
00:00:58,685 --> 00:01:02,900
[INAUDIBLE] and literals or their negation. So here's

20
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,690
a, here's a concrete example. Here's a hypothesis

21
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:11,460
that is in this set. X1 and x3 and not x5. We're going to connect together

22
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,200
some of these variables, not necessarily all of

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,830
them. And some of them can be negated.

24
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:19,920
And, it's all the connectors have to be ands. All right, so Charles, let's make

25
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,430
sure that that you understand this. So

26
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,340
let's let's look at, some inputs. Alright. So

27
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,670
let's say our input is this. X1 is 0. x2 is 1. x3 is 0.

28
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:34,240
x4 is 1. x5 is 1. What is this formula going to evaluate in this case?

29
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,960
>> Okay so, a 0 is false and 1 is true I assume, because,

30
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,910
that's what we do in these things. X2 and x4 don't matter. I just

31
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:44,200
have to look at x1, x3, and x5. So, x1 had

32
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,260
better be true, and it isn't, so I already know the answer.

33
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:52,880
>> It's false. Very good. All right, let's let's try a couple more of these.

34
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,130
>> Okay. So, I would do the same thing I did

35
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,450
before. I would look at x1, x3, and x5. So in

36
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,900
this case, x1, cleverly, I've noticed this 1 so, that doesn't

37
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,760
give me the answer right away because you're an evil teacher.

38
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,190
x3 is also 1 but x5 is 1, and according to

39
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,930
the hypothesis it has to be 0 for this to be true,

40
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,300
so 0. I can do the same kind of thing for the

41
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,050
third line, so x1 is true like it needs to be, but

42
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,470
x3 is false instead of being true so also 0. And

43
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,170
then in the bottom, let's see. X1 is true, which it needs

44
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,510
to be. X3 is true, which it needs to be, and X5

45
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,420
is false, which it needs to be, so the output is 1.

46
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,940
>> Very good.

47
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,690
>> All right. I got it.
