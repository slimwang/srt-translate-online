00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,150
Real machines have memory hierarchies.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,350
That means, that between a processor and

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:09,720
a primary storage device like a disk,
there are layers of memory in between.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,190
And as you get closer to the processor,

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,500
those memories get faster but
also smaller.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,550
Now the difference in all of the size,
latency, and

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,700
bandwidth between successive levels,
might be an order of magnitude.

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,810
Unfortunately, our usual model of
an algorithm doesn't distinguish

9
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,560
between the size and
speed of these different memories.

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,380
Yet, if you want to achieve high
performance, and you know you do, then

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,410
you need to design your algorithms to
take advantage of the memory hierarchy.

12
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,540
Now, sometimes the hardware or operating
system can manage these memories for

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,230
you, automatically.

14
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,190
But using these memories
optimally is hard.

15
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,760
So try as they might,

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,800
these automatic schemes can't
completely solve the problem for you.

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,120
And that means the onus is on you
to work your algorithmic magic.

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,250
This lesson is designed
to help you get started.
