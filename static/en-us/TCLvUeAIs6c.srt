00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,648
Alright.

2
00:00:00,654 --> 00:00:05,137
Let's look at some exponent patterns now, to figure out what goes on with other

3
00:00:05,149 --> 00:00:09,481
types of exponents. We've seen them increase. Well, what happens when they

4
00:00:09,493 --> 00:00:14,063
decrease? Okay. Here, I have 3 cubed, which is really just 3 times 3 times 3, or

5
00:00:14,075 --> 00:00:18,594
27. Here, I have 3 squared, which is 3 times 3, or 9. And then here, I just have

6
00:00:18,606 --> 00:00:23,080
3. Based on this pattern, what do you think 3 to the 0 would equal? Think about

7
00:00:23,092 --> 00:00:26,915
what's happening to our answer as we go down. You can put your answer in this

8
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:27,350
box here.
