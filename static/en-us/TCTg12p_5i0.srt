1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,760
Now this course isn't about vagrant or
virtual machines.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,280
That was just some overhead
work you needed to accomplish

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,720
to get to this point.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,930
You're now logged into a Linux box.

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,920
Whenever you get to this prompt,
I want you to ignore all of that

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,270
virtual machines and
vagrant stuff as much as possible.

7
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,800
Yes technically this computer is
just a virtual machine sitting on

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,000
your computer.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But that's not too different than what
you'll be doing as you start setting up

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,820
your own web servers.

11
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,570
Most likely you'll be given
a virtual machine from a service

12
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,010
provider like Amazon.

13
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,540
And you're log in to it via SSH.

14
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,590
This experience is pretty much the same
as what you have configured now

15
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,240
on your computer.

16
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,670
You are remotely connected to
a completely different computer.

17
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:41,990
What does that mean?

18
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,040
You can do anything
here on this machine.

19
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,500
And it will have no lasting
impact on your personal computer.

20
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,510
Remember, this is an entirely
different computer.

21
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:51,720
You can turn it off.

22
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,840
Throw it away.

23
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,590
Rebuild it any time you want.

24
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,300
So I want you to have no fear
when SSHed into that computer.

25
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,640
You will not break
anything on your computer.

26
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,970
Now, let's get comfortable with this new
computer, your Linux virtual machine.

27
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,720
And see how it organizes all of
the files you'll be working with.
