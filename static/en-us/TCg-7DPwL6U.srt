1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,660
Here's something to ponder.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:06,590
Can you use algorithmic parallelism to
go faster without increasing power?

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:11,050
For the sake of argument, let's consider
an algorithm in the work span model.

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:14,780
Now suppose Brent's theorem holds,
provided you run it at some base clock

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,620
frequency on a PRAM type
machine with p cores.

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,270
Now you suppose you slowed down
the clock by a factor of sigma.

7
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:23,720
Let me give you an example.

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,080
Suppose the initial base frequency
was 1 GHz and sigma is 2.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,710
And the new frequency is F over sigma or
500 MHz.

10
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,050
Ok, so that's what sigma means.

11
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,500
Now, a frequency change also means
the power per core goes down.

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,900
From the dynamic power equation,

13
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,930
it should go down by
a factor of sigma cubed.

14
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,870
Put another way,
you can actually use sigma cubed

15
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:51,380
more processing cores without
increasing the overall system power.

16
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,690
That's assuming constant power is 0.

17
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:58,940
So, my analytical question for you is
what value of sigma should you use?

18
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,380
I want you to type your answer
symbolically in this box,

19
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,879
in terms of W, D, P, and
numerical constants.
