1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,270
So what I want you to do now,
in a simple piece of code

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,600
given two gray scale images where
we have two images a left image and

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,890
a right image,
we'll provide that to you.

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:13,450
Can you actually now just
generate a simple anaglyph image.

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:18,290
Given again a left image, a right image
can you generate an image that once

6
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:22,560
when seen through this
A anaglyph glass set here,

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,220
which basically has again cyan and
red, would let you see that image.

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:32,600
Again important points to remember,
this is a red cyan glass set,

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,710
so you have to generate
an image that works with this.

10
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,360
So here is a simple code
I want you to now ex,

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,350
experiment with to create
an anaglyph stereo image.

12
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,460
Again, something that could be viewed
by a small set of glasses like this.

13
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,810
We've done the precursor stuff,

14
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:52,410
we basically loaded np and
computer vision open cv2 kit.

15
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,700
Basically if you have this function
which takes a left image and

16
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:59,300
a right image and now you want to be
able to create a red-cyan anaglyph

17
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,300
basically using two images.

18
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,260
To help you do this, we, of course,
have set up this two different images.

19
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,250
There's a left flowers and a right
flowers both of them are grayscale.

20
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,750
We can actually just do this
to show them and of course,

21
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:16,180
when you run this function it should be
able to now create an anaglyph image.

22
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,930
So here basically is just a simple
code that you have to write

23
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,440
taking the left image and the right
image to generate an anaglyph image,

24
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,830
which would then, of course, when you
test run, will give you the result.

25
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,150
Please write that code and
then test it and submit it.
