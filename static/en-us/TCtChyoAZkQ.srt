1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,918
We definitely don't want to conduct that many t-tests but we can use the same

2
00:00:03,918 --> 00:00:09,291
ideas underlying t-tests to compare three or more samples. Remember with

3
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:13,507
t-tests, the decision of whether or not two samples are significantly different

4
00:00:13,507 --> 00:00:18,986
is a function of the distance that they are apart from each other. And the

5
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:23,896
variability of each sample, which we call the standard error. Remember that we

6
00:00:23,896 --> 00:00:28,717
found this with the pooled variance. When we compare three or more samples, we

7
00:00:28,717 --> 00:00:33,546
can do almost the same thing. We have some kind of distance or variability

8
00:00:33,546 --> 00:00:38,943
between means in the numerator, and some kind of error in the denominator.

9
00:00:38,943 --> 00:00:43,194
Let's focus on the numerator for a sec. How can we compare three or more

10
00:00:43,194 --> 00:00:48,319
samples? Read each of these options carefully, and as a hint, think back to how

11
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:54,271
you learned to calculate the standard deviation in lesson four. And the

12
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:58,957
rationale for using the standard deviation as the measure of variability for a

13
00:00:58,957 --> 00:01:04,282
sample. Also, in this case, total mean is the mean of all values in all the

14
00:01:04,282 --> 00:01:05,915
samples.
