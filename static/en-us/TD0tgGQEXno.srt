00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:04,430
Another type of analysis tool that you
could run in your code is called static

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:05,580
analysis.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,670
Static analysis is a process
that is performed on a project

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:09,820
without running it.

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,400
So it's actually analyzing
the source code and

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,570
sometimes also some build artifacts.

7
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,900
While it doesn't find bugs of
the same way that unit testing does,

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,120
it helps find out some other
dimension of the quality of the code.

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,030
For example, it can find issues
with spacing, code duplications and

10
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,300
other complexity issues with your code.

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,070
Static analysis could take a significant
amount of time for larger projects, so

12
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,620
it's often run in
parallel with unit tests.

13
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,140
And it usually isn't something that's
going to block the delivery pipeline.

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,540
One popular free open source tool for

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,100
doing static analysis,
that also supports a lot of languages,

16
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,760
is called sonarQube and
we'll be looking into this next.

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,860
So let's learn a little
bit more about sonarQube.
