00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:05,700
Now I want to show all of you a classic example of a pinhole photograph.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,560
Here is one and

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,050
you notice that very interesting things are happening in this one.

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,650
All lines are straight.

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,570
There is no form of distortion.

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:22,320
Also if you look at it, the whole image is, has infinite depth.

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,290
That has everything is in focus.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,060
This is a pinhole where there is no lens whatsoever.

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:33,540
Basically somebody built a box, put a small hole in it,

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,500
and put a film or a censor on the other end and generated this image.

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,430
Actually it looks pretty nice.

12
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,962
And basically what's important is there is no form of blurring,

13
00:00:42,962 --> 00:00:46,060
no de-focus artifacts, and each and

14
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,140
every line if you were to draw it, would appear completely straight.

15
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,180
Of course when we start going over from pinhole cameras,

16
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,820
we'll notice that we will be compromising on these types of

17
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,450
perfect capabilities that a pinhole camera might have.
