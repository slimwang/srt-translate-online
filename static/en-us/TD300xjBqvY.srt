1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So in this problem set, we're going to try to plot the trajectory of the spaceship

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
by creating functions for its acceleration and its trajectory.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We'll start it out with some helpful information. We'll set the step size to 1 second.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I told you the mass of the earth and giving you the gravitational constant,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
which you might recognize as G from the equations in other videos.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We've also already created arrays for you for position and velocity, which right now

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
are filled with zeros and set the initial position and the initial velocity of the spacecraft.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Now, I'm going to remind you of some information that you've already learned

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
that's going to be especially helpful for this problem.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We talked earlier about the equation for the gravitational force between two objects

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
that's what this little g here next to the F for force stands for gravity.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This big G in the equation is this gravitational constant that we've given you in the code

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
that's multiplied by the mass of the earth and the mass of the spacecraft

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and this is divided by the distance between the earth and the spacecraft squared.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Now, this d with a hat over it represents a unit vector that any given vector

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
has a unit vector associated with it.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This unit vector, which is denoted by this hat over top of it,

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
is equal to the original vector itself divided by that vector's magnitude.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So this d with a hat over it up here shows us that the gravitational force

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
has this magnitude and is pointing in this direction,

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
which is a line pointing from the earth out to the spaceship.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Now, if you look back at the code for a second, you'll see that this function that we're asking

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
of you to find is actually for acceleration not for force,

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
but we know that force and acceleration are very intimately related by Newton's second law,

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
which is that force equals mass times acceleration.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This means in the case that we're considering right now we can find the acceleration of the spaceship

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
by simply taking the equation for force that we just read out and dividing by the mass of the spaceship,

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
which leaves us with this expression right here.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Your job is to translate this equation into an expression in Python for acceleration

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and then to use that expression along with the information we've given you in a

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Forward Euler Method to describe the position and velocity of the spaceship at any given timestep.
