I'll start with the jQuery object, the dollar sign, and I'll pass in the string,

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,270
li, to grab a jQuery collection of all the list elements.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,490
I'll check my answer with console.log and I'll open up the console.

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,730
You might see a lot of errors here like we're seeing here but don't worry,

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,240
you can just pretty much ignore those.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,620
Up here, we can see the jQuery collection returned from line five of our

00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,190
program, which, this is on line five.

00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,030
So, I will open it up, and we can see the DOM elements that we are expecting.
