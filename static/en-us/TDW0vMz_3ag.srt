00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,460
>> Okay Michael, so I'm going to see if you understood that fire hose

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,840
of words that I threw at you by giving you a quick quiz.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,680
>> Thanks.

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,010
>> Yeah, you're welcome. So, what I have down in the middle here is

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,420
a bunch of phrases that might describe

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,770
PCA, might describe ICA, might describe both

7
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:20,190
of them or might describe neither. Okay? And what I want you to do

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:25,250
is check off under PCA each one of these that applies. And check off

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,620
under ICA each one of these that applies. Okay. Does that make sense?

10
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,330
>> Sure.

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,770
>> Okay. Go.
