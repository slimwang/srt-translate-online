00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,296
Our critical numbers tell us how to separate the number line into different

2
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:08,824
regions or different intervals for us to test, using this inequality. So check

3
00:00:08,824 --> 00:00:13,244
each of those three regions that are separated by these critical numbers, and

4
00:00:13,244 --> 00:00:17,757
also check the critical numbers themselves in the inequality. And then figure

5
00:00:17,757 --> 00:00:22,071
out for which intervals values of x satisfy this inequality. I'd like you to

6
00:00:22,071 --> 00:00:24,945
write these intervals as inequalities, however.
