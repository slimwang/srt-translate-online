1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,040
This is a radiance map now
of the image we captured.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:09,430
What basically comes out now is we're
no longer in the range of 0 to 255.

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:13,640
This output basically shows
that this image now has a range

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,390
from 0.6215 to 12, 871 intensity.

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,020
All of the dark blue colors that
you see are close to this one.

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,830
All of the bright red, and of course,
when you're seeing the bright red

7
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,480
here and you actually notice that
there's a little bit of yellow because

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,680
as you notice in the image, this was
kind of getting very bright too, but

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,010
you see a lot of detail and
there's kind of really bright spots.

10
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:34,950
They're out there.

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,470
Of course, now we need to study how
we're going to take this radiance map

12
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,570
and create an image.

13
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,600
Before we go there,
we also need to think a little bit about

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,760
what kinds of file formats we can
use to save images like this.

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,220
Now that radiance image I showed you,
right, needs to be stored somewhere.

16
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,740
So far, we've been only as
interested in trying to say, okay,

17
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:56,050
I'm going to have 8 bits per red,
8 bits per green and 8 bits for blue.

18
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:01,110
Well, now we need a newer form
of an image, 32 bits per pixel,

19
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,910
because now we want to actually create
8 bits of additional information.

20
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:09,355
This is 24 bits, 8 bits per color,
so we're going to add an exponent.

21
00:01:09,355 --> 00:01:11,270
Math works out the following way.

22
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,210
Basically, what it means is now,
if I have an RGB value of 145, 215, 87,

23
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:19,300
I'm going to actually
add another exponent

24
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:24,500
number here and what this exponent
basically does is take the RGB values,

25
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,255
multiplies with the 2, raise 2,
the difference of 149 minus 128.

26
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:34,900
One-twenty-eight was, again, remember
the 20 to 256 or 255, that white part.

27
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,380
Of course, and
this gives us values much bigger than 0

28
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:43,190
to 255 just by adding this
8 bit of information.

29
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,230
Of course, the other way is also there.

30
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:50,480
Rather than take this value, I can
subtract the 103, this information,

31
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:56,220
from 128 and this is this value here and
now I have much smaller numbers.

32
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:02,240
So now this allows us go from very small
numbers all the way up to larger numbers

33
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,720
and, of course, this format can be used
to save an image like this into a file.

34
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,960
This is a proposed representation
of a file format from Ward.

35
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,650
There are many other similar formats.

36
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,775
I do encourage you to look at
radiance map formats on the web.
