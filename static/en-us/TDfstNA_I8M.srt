1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,370
So to actually figure this out
we're going to need to check these

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,570
two conditions.

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:09,790
So we might actually find it useful to
check each one of them individually.

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,941
So here's the sum of the alphas, and
here's the sum of the alphas squared.

5
00:00:13,941 --> 00:00:14,661
>> Okay.

6
00:00:14,661 --> 00:00:16,470
>> So how are we going to start
filling some of these in?

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,600
Are there any of these cases
that we actually know what

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,040
the sums are going to be?

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,940
>> Yeah, two of them I think.

10
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,690
>> Okay.
>> At least.

11
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,830
Well, let's go ahead and get
the easiest one out of the way first.

12
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,720
So I think that's number, well actually
I think two of them are equally easy.

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,800
Let's do number five.

14
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,380
>> Great.
>> So we know that that's going to be

15
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,965
infinite, the sequence will be
infinite because it's a constant.

16
00:00:36,965 --> 00:00:38,795
>> Yep.
>> And we also know the square of which

17
00:00:38,795 --> 00:00:41,365
is just another constant,
and that's non-zero, so

18
00:00:41,365 --> 00:00:42,595
it's also going to be infinite.

19
00:00:42,595 --> 00:00:44,385
>> So what does that tell us
about this learning rate?

20
00:00:44,385 --> 00:00:47,705
>> It says if your learning rate
doesn't get smaller over time,

21
00:00:47,705 --> 00:00:49,705
then you're never going to convert.

22
00:00:49,705 --> 00:00:50,221
>> That's right.

23
00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:52,983
So this one, this learning rate, doesn't
work as far as the theorem's concerned?

24
00:00:52,983 --> 00:00:53,740
>> Right.

25
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:54,959
>> You said there was another easy one.

26
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:59,052
>> So number two I think is easy because
you told me last time that that one

27
00:00:59,052 --> 00:00:59,556
works.

28
00:00:59,556 --> 00:01:03,380
>> [LAUGH] Yeah I guess that's
a reasonable way to do it.

29
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,770
Do you recognize this, the sum of these?

30
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:09,570
Do you know what this is called if you
sum up alpha to this sort of form?

31
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,580
>> Isn't it a geometric series or
is it harmonic?

32
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,160
Which one is it?

33
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,817
>> Harmonic.

34
00:01:13,817 --> 00:01:17,024
>> [SOUND] Yeah, that's right.

35
00:01:17,024 --> 00:01:21,484
That's our harmonic sequence and
the sum of this up to T acts a lot

36
00:01:21,484 --> 00:01:26,330
like log of T, so if T goes to infinity,
we do get infinity there.

37
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:30,600
>> Okay, and we also know that
the square of it is less than infinity,

38
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,850
because you told me so last time.

39
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,830
>> Yeah, though that's again,
not the greatest reason.

40
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:37,241
It turns out that any time that
the power that we're raising,

41
00:01:37,241 --> 00:01:41,571
the T to in the denominator is bigger
than one, it's going to converge, and so

42
00:01:41,571 --> 00:01:45,425
that gives us both of these boxes,
right, because it's the same thing.

43
00:01:45,425 --> 00:01:46,510
>> Mm-hm.

44
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,886
>> This problem in particular,
this one it does, it converges,

45
00:01:49,886 --> 00:01:52,827
the value that it converges
to is really interesting.

46
00:01:52,827 --> 00:01:57,599
I don't know if you know this, but
if you sum up the infinite sequence

47
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:00,988
of 1 over T squared,
you get pi squared over 6.

48
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:02,580
>> Oh, right, yes, that's obvious.

49
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,010
>> No, it's not obvious.

50
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:04,940
>> Well, explain it to me then.

51
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,160
>> I can't, it's bizarre.

52
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,430
It's like, where's the pi?

53
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,258
Where's the pi?

54
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:09,830
I want some pi.

55
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,508
>> I ate it.

56
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:11,291
>> All right.

57
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:15,280
So this problem was known
as the Basel problem, and

58
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,780
for hundreds of years people didn't
really know how to solve it,

59
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:22,590
and Euler worked on it and solved it,
but he didn't solve it validly,

60
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,420
he eventually came back and
solved it right.

61
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,530
But it is,
it's kind of a remarkable thing.

62
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,590
Pi's come up when you're doing areas
of circles and things like that,

63
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:33,060
there's no circle here, so it's kind of
interesting that you get a pi squared.

64
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,347
>> Or r squared, right?

65
00:02:34,347 --> 00:02:36,124
Pi r squared
>> [LAUGH] Pi r squared

66
00:02:36,124 --> 00:02:36,820
>> Let's hear it.

67
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,450
>> Sure, but
the pi's not squared, it's weird.

68
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,830
>> I agree it's weird.

69
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,970
I mean, I think I vaguely remember
this from calc two or something.

70
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:48,017
>> Cool, alright, well anyways, so
that's just sort of a fun thing that

71
00:02:48,017 --> 00:02:52,340
I find to be fun, but the point is that,
so let's look at the first row here.

72
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,903
If we square T squared, we get T to the
fourth, which is bigger than 1 over T,

73
00:02:56,903 --> 00:02:59,095
so that one's also going to converge.

74
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,997
So what does that give us
in terms of answers here?

75
00:03:00,997 --> 00:03:02,031
>> No and yes.

76
00:03:02,031 --> 00:03:04,267
>> Exactly, right, it's because
we need it to be infinity and

77
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,330
then less than infinity.

78
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,360
One of these boxes we've
actually figured out,

79
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,300
because this 1 over T to the 1/2 or the
square root of T, if you square that,

80
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,040
that's 1 over T, so this squared
box has to be the same as this one.

81
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,460
So that's infinity, and
actually that tells us the answer for

82
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,590
this one even before we
figure out the rest.

83
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,290
>> Yeah, I guess so, but you gave
the answer away a long time ago.

84
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,520
>> How so?

85
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,757
>> Because you said that if
the exponent was greater than 1,

86
00:03:27,757 --> 00:03:32,069
then it would converge and if it was
less than 1, then it would not converge.

87
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:35,653
So I can just look at the numbers or
the exponent for number three and

88
00:03:35,653 --> 00:03:38,096
number four, and
I already know the answer.

89
00:03:38,096 --> 00:03:39,454
>> So let’s just fill them in then.

90
00:03:39,454 --> 00:03:40,555
Go ahead, what do you got?

91
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:42,480
>> Okay, well, let’s see.

92
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,350
If the exponent is greater than 1,
then it will converge.

93
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,170
Less than infinity, that's true for
neither 2/3 or 1/2.

94
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,630
>> So these are infinities?

95
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,930
>> Right, and you just have to square
them and ask the same question.

96
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,250
>> Good.
So we squared this one,

97
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,100
and that gets us 1 over T,
which also has an infinity.

98
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,520
>> Right.
>> And you square this one and

99
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,420
you get 1 over T to the 4/3,

100
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:08,070
which is bigger than one, so
that one should converge.

101
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:08,661
>> Right.
>> So

102
00:04:08,661 --> 00:04:12,090
interestingly this one works,
this one works, and this one doesn't.

103
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:12,590
>> Right.
