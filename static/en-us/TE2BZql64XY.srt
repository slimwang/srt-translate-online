1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,959
Now let's say that you live in a city where it rains a lot, all day every day.

2
00:00:04,959 --> 00:00:09,626
So, in this case, we're not going to have frequency here, we're going to have

3
00:00:09,626 --> 00:00:14,852
precipitation. And it rains about the same amount, and the average rainfall is

4
00:00:14,852 --> 00:00:20,343
about the same every month. So, we can just summarize our distribution with a

5
00:00:20,343 --> 00:00:26,177
line, and then we have what we call a uniform distribution. So where does the

6
00:00:26,177 --> 00:00:29,249
mode occur here, or, is there no mode?
