1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,280
So in the last quiz,
you saw one example of an aggregation,

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,450
a database operation that summarises
multiple rows into a single row.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,860
Counting up the number of
gorillas in the animals table,

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,510
was a count aggregation.

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,060
It takes several rows,
each representing one gorilla, and

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,980
turns them into one gorilla
representing the count.

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,080
Any time we want to compute a single
result from a set of values,

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,530
that's an aggregation.

9
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,430
Here are some of the most common
aggregation functions in SQL.

10
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,120
Count is different from the other ones,
in that it takes values of any type, and

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,870
returns a number.

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,130
Most of the other aggregations
only work on numbers.

13
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,850
For instance, you can't the average
of a column of string values,

14
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,310
because only numbers have an average.

15
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,880
We'll see a lot more about
aggregations in the next lesson.
