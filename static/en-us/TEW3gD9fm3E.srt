1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
For this problem we have the same clique function,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
but instead of counting how many units of time it takes to execute clique(4),

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
we're going to write a more general function that calculates

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
how many units of time it takes to execute clique(n) as a function of n.
