1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,855
Now let's quickly check your
understanding of client IDs.

2
00:00:02,855 --> 00:00:06,090
Suppose you wrote an application
called Chocolate Chooser,

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,649
that implements a chocolate API and
points API.

4
00:00:08,649 --> 00:00:12,880
The app ID for
Chocolate Chooser is cho-cho-413, and

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,000
the client ID is 612 abcd.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,798
Now suppose somebody else comes along
and writes an application called

7
00:00:18,798 --> 00:00:22,162
Meta Menu, that uses JavaScript
to access the chocolate API.

8
00:00:22,162 --> 00:00:27,962
Their App ID is meta-m-1025 and
their Client ID is 2317efgh.

9
00:00:27,962 --> 00:00:30,941
Now, you'd like to allow
them to access the API, so

10
00:00:30,941 --> 00:00:35,347
down here fill in the code that will go
into the Chocolate Chooser application

11
00:00:35,347 --> 00:00:39,110
to authorize the Meta Menu
application to use the Chocolate API.
