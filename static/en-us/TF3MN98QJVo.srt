1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
Our program is divided into several parts.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,170
As you move through each part,

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,850
you'll learn a specific skill set in the

4
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,589
classroom and then complete a project

5
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:09,540
designed to help you put that skill set to work.

6
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,900
In your first week, if you're

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:13,620
entering the program as a true beginner,

8
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,509
we'll start by writing lots of simple

9
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:17,490
programming statements and Swift - Apple’s

10
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,960
programming language for building

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,300
iOS apps. We’ll finish up part 1 with

12
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,730
a set of coding challenges.

13
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,199
If you're coming to us with some experience in

14
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,269
programming, we’ll start off with a crash

15
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:29,609
course in Swift syntex and quickly move

16
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:31,560
on to building your first app. Silly sounds.

17
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,899
We encourage you to make this path

18
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:36,590
into your own personal journey.

19
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:37,440
Skip ahead to courses that are especially

20
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,540
interesting to you, return to review

21
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,950
material that was especially challenging.
