What if we just want to print the first sentence of the book, including the

2
00:00:02,976 --> 00:00:06,988
period at the end? What method would you use to print just a piece of a string,

3
00:00:06,988 --> 00:00:13,512
not the whole thing? And at what index does the first sentence end? Here's the

4
00:00:13,512 --> 00:00:15,943
text from Alice in Wonderland that we gave you, or at least the first couple of

5
00:00:15,943 --> 00:00:21,224
sentences. We could sit here and count to find exactly how many characters come

6
00:00:21,224 --> 00:00:28,065
before the period. Or we could use the methods we already know. Implement to

7
00:00:28,065 --> 00:00:33,038
get first sentence method. If it's working it should return this. If you're not

8
00:00:33,038 --> 00:00:36,932
sure what methods to use to get started, you'll have the link to the fact

00:00:36,932 --> 00:00:38,570
sheet.
