00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The correct answer is that we're sending the wrong content type header.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
If you look at the program we're using, we still have

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
this line in here which says content type to text plain.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
If we get rid of this line, I'll comment it out, save this file--

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
so we got rid of that line, and when I reload my browser--

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
aha--now our form is as we expected.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That's because in Google App engine the default content type is text HTML,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
which tells the browser that it's receiving HTML and it should interpret it as such,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
our text is then interpreted as HTML.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
When it was sent as text plain, it was interpreted as plain text,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and the browser showed everything we sent back,

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
you know--angled brackets and all.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Now--let's see if this form behaves the same way as our old one did.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's working just as it did before, except the difference this time

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
is the HTML is served by our live web application running on our machine

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
instead of just a plain text file.
