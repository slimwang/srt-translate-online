Today, we'll talk about constraint propagation, another very drawn out purpose

00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:09,240
method. Constraint propagation is a mechanism of influence where the agent

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,860
assign values to variables to satisfy certain conditions called constraints.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,950
It is a very common method in knowledge-based AI, and there are a number of

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,460
different topics, such as planning, understanding, natural language processing,

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:26,200
visual spatial reasoning. Today, we'll start by defining constraint propagation.

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,410
Then we'll see how it helps agents makes sense of the world around it.

8
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:34,000
Our examples will come mostly from understand natural language sentences,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,230
as well as visual scenes.

10
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,600
Finally, we'll talk about some advanced issues of constraint propagation.
