1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,780
Here, g of f of 1 equals negative 2, and g of f of x equals 3x squared minus 6x

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:11,810
plus 1. Great solving, if you got these two right. For this first problem,

3
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:17,792
we'll start by finding the f of 1. We need to find the output, when the input

4
00:00:17,792 --> 00:00:23,749
for f is 1. So letting x equal 1 here, and here, we'll have a new expression. 1

5
00:00:23,749 --> 00:00:27,635
squared equals 1, negative 2 times 1 is negaitive 2 and then we'll have

6
00:00:27,635 --> 00:00:33,933
positive 2 on the end. Summing these together we get a final output of positive

7
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:41,094
1. So, we know the output is 1 when x equals 1 for f. So, we can replace f of 1

8
00:00:41,094 --> 00:00:47,228
with it's value, 1. Now we just need to find the g of 1. Plugging in 1 in for x

9
00:00:47,228 --> 00:00:54,649
here, will get 3 times 1 minus 5, so that equals negative 2. This is how we

10
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:59,750
find g of f of 1. Now to find g of f of x we're going to take f of x this

11
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:07,660
entire function and we're going to plug it in for this x here. Remember f of x

12
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:14,378
is going to be the input for g. So wherever we see x for g we replace that with

13
00:01:14,378 --> 00:01:22,852
x squared minus two x plus 2. We distribute the positive 3 to get 3 x squared

14
00:01:22,852 --> 00:01:29,510
minus 6x plus 6. Then we just combine the like terms on the end, to get 3x

15
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:33,710
squared minus 6x plus 1, g of f of x.
