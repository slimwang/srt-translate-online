1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,480
We're not quite to getting icon packs
into Sunshine but we are far enough

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,070
along to replace our current icons
with ones loaded with Glide.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,880
Copy in the new getArt URL for weather
condition utility method, the new URL

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,420
string, and our dimension for the
default notification, large icon size.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,340
Then, update the DetailFragment and
the ForecastAdapter used for

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,090
the forecast fragment.

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,670
Don't forget about the adjust view
balance attribute for the XML files.

8
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,250
But before we use gray scale icons for

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,970
the future dates, let's update it so
that all days use the colorized icons.

10
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,610
Don't forget about our notification,
we want pretty icons for everything.
