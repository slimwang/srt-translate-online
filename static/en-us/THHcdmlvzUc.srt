00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,237
Whenever we start to factor an expression like this, we should always take out

2
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:08,353
the greatest common factor first. Factoring out a one in this case, will not

3
00:00:08,353 --> 00:00:12,629
change our equation. So, we need to learn something else in order to solve this

00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:13,190
problem.
