1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:06,920
This hyperbola was centered at 4,2, has an a value of 2, and a b value of 4.

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:12,826
Nice thinking if you got these correct. Now, the key is that y squared comes

3
00:00:12,826 --> 00:00:19,064
first, so this means our hyperbola will open up and down. Remember, too, that k

4
00:00:19,064 --> 00:00:25,260
is this value, and h is this value. H is always with x, and k is always with y.

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,600
So, our center is really at positive 4 and positive 2. We take the opposite

6
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,940
signs of the terms in the parentheses. To get the value of a, we just take the

7
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,650
square root of 4, since it's underneath the x squared term. The square foot of

8
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:44,307
4 equals 2. And to get the value of b, we take the square root of 16, which

9
00:00:44,307 --> 00:00:50,430
equals 4. We start by graphing the ellipse. The ellipse is centered at 4, 2.

10
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,988
So, we go 4 units right, and 2 units up vertically. Now we need to go a and b,

11
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:59,960
we need to find the four other points on the ellipse. From the center we move 2

12
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,251
units in the x direction, and we move 4 units in the y direction. 2 is for a,

13
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:10,549
and 4 is for b. Remember that a is always associated with the x squared term,

14
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:16,070
this square root of 4 here. And b is always associated with the y squared term.

15
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:20,266
In this case, the square root of 16. Now, we're ready to draw in our dash

16
00:01:20,266 --> 00:01:25,458
rectangle and the two diagonals, so we can draw our hyperbola. We need to keep

17
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:29,230
in mind that our ellipse is going to open up and down, since y comes first.

18
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:33,362
It's the positive term. So, we're going to cut our ellipse and them flip these

19
00:01:33,362 --> 00:01:38,403
two ends outward. When we do that, we get our entire hyperbola. Now, let's make

20
00:01:38,403 --> 00:01:43,247
sure this whole picture makes sense. Our hyperbola is centered at 4,2 and then

21
00:01:43,247 --> 00:01:49,829
we moved 2 units horizontally for our rectangle, an 4 units vertically.
