00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,200
A computer game is like any
other creative endeavor,

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,180
it takes a lot of effort and it's hard
to know exactly when you're finished.

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,210
You may have heard of the 80/20 rule for
software development,

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:15,960
that 80% of the effort goes to
completing the last 20% of the features.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,200
That's true for games too, to an extent,
but there's another factor.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,360
Good games have more than just lots of
features, they also need good gameplay.

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,980
While Future Creep blows a lot of
development schedules, with games,

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,190
it's less a matter of
adding features and

9
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:35,030
more about making sure the features
are tuned so the game is actually fun.

10
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,980
In a way, it's like painting or writing.

11
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,800
You're always tempted to
tweak some character stat or

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,740
rearrange those two sentences.

13
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,650
Does this change make things clearer?

14
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,520
Do I need to rethink how
I present this piece?

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,800
Games aren't like other software.

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,710
They're not necessarily function driven,
right?

17
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,490
They're meant to entertain and
engage and

18
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,520
these are fundamentally
subjective goals.

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,720
So, you may find yourself near the end
of a game project, making less and

20
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,990
less progress towards the finish line.

21
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,340
Don't be surprised and
don't let it discourage you.

22
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,070
You're doing what every creative
person on the planet does,

23
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:15,490
which is second guess yourself and
tweak and edit and revisit and change.

24
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,280
And just like those creative people,

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,450
you're going to eventually decide you're
satisfied with the final product.

26
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,830
And after all that work,

27
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,850
there's nothing quite like the feeling
of actually releasing your game.
