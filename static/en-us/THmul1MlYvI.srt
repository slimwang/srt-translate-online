My name is Lewis Kaneshiro.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:03,460
I build courses here at Udacity and

3
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,890
I've used version control in different forms for about four years now.

4
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,570
Version control makes me more of a risk taker in the sense that

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:15,510
I'm able to explore pretty significant changes in the code base.

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,590
Architecture differences at,

7
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:21,640
at a very low level without fear of breaking the entire project.

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,900
and, and, and freaking out, you know, for

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,580
lack of a better word, to try to make it work again.

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:32,570
And so, without version control the way I looked at code was as soon as it

11
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,520
was working, I would make very small iterative changes.

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,160
Whereas with version control I, I'm able to rethink the entire code base or, or

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,700
rethink parts of them that quite honestly I wouldn't have approached or

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,780
even touched for fear of breaking it.

15
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,460
So, in general big picture the things I really like about version control is

16
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,400
really this idea of exploration.

17
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,220
Without version control I feel that developing as a programmer is,

18
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:02,090
is taking little baby steps of making a program incrementally better.

19
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:07,056
Whereas with version control you can explore such a large space of, of,

20
00:01:07,056 --> 00:01:10,440
of things to try, and you can do that easily without really

21
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,730
worrying about having to go back and fix a project that's that's broken.

22
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,550
So I feel version control has made me a better programmer because it

23
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:23,540
allows me to explore deep concepts, deep architectural concepts within

24
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,320
programs that I wouldn't be able to explore easily and

25
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,248
more efficiently if I was not using version control.
