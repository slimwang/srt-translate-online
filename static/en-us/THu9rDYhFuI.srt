Looking at the demo, you should have noticed that when you pull the red box to

2
00:00:03,831 --> 00:00:07,490
be closer to you, suddenly you can't see it through the yellow object. You can

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,845
see the ground playing grid through the red object, but the red object has

4
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:15,560
disappeared. Which of these is true for this picture? More than one answer can

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,332
be correct. The red object is rendered after the yellow object. Blending has

6
00:00:19,332 --> 00:00:23,820
been turned off for the yellow object. The yellow object was not drawn to the

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,563
Z-buffer. The red object is closer to the eye than the yellow one.
