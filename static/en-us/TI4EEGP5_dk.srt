1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,210
The Context Management Specification,
CMS, began at Duke University

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:11,000
as the Clinical Context Object Workshop,
or CCOW.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,790
It seeks to facilitate the integration
of diverse applications

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,470
at the point of use.

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:21,200
It does this by managing issues
such as the identity of a patient

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,410
the user wants to view or
update via these applications.

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,380
The identity of the user who
wants to access the applications.

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,310
A moment in time around
which temporal data displays

9
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:36,150
should be centered by
the applications and

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:41,210
a particular patient encounter
that the user wants to review.

11
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,770
The details are highly technical, but
you can get the general idea from this

12
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:50,470
illustration where several applications
from different vendors are all centered

13
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:54,330
around the same patient, at the same
time, for the same clinician.

14
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,190
This is an ambitious but
potentially very important effort.

15
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,110
Since clinicians commonly complain
about the time and effort involved to

16
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:07,180
use many different systems that work in
different ways to manage their patients.

17
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,810
Before moving on,

18
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,370
I want to mention an interesting feature
of the SMART on FHIR app platform.

19
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,800
This is called launch parameters.

20
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:23,110
These provide some of the same
services as anticipated in CMS,

21
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,920
as providers, patients, and
other users move about among FHIR apps.

22
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,880
As shown here, these include
the identity of the patient,

23
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:37,320
the current encounter being viewed,
links to other resource instances of

24
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,220
interest with this patient, and even the
reason why the app is being launched.

25
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:48,150
Here is an example of
a JSON-formatted version

26
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,660
of one of the simplest FHIR resources,
the patient.

27
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,569
It contains the basic demographic
information, such as name,

28
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:01,293
birthdate and
the provider taking care of the patient.

29
00:02:01,293 --> 00:02:05,857
It also contains a patient ID that can
be used to unambiguously retrieve other

30
00:02:05,857 --> 00:02:08,000
clinical information.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,508
Look a bit more carefully and

32
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:13,775
you'll see that this patient is
actually our old friend, Marla.
