1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,900
In a lot of databases, we're talking
about unique entities out in the world,

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:10,520
like individual people or locations, or
email accounts, cities, or gorillas.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,680
If something is unique,
there can't be two of them.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,910
So for instance, names aren't unique,
not even full names.

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,470
There are a lot of people in
the world named Jennifer Smith.

6
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,810
But a particular person named Jennifer
Smith is still a unique individual.

7
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,710
You wouldn't want to give one
person another person's grades, or

8
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,780
their parking tickets,
just because they share the same name.

9
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:38,550
Whenever we want to unambiguously relate
a row of one table to a row of another,

10
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,950
to see they are about the same person or
thing out in the world.

11
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,560
We have to have a unique value
to talk about that thing.

12
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,970
In the cutest animals database, we used
a numerical ID for each animal picture,

13
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,080
which we used to relate
the votes table to it.

14
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,080
That's a pretty common choice.

15
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,070
Just make up a unique number for
your database.

16
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,880
It's so common that most database
systems can do it for you.

17
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:07,900
User IDs, comment IDs on forums and
so on, are all examples of this.

18
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,820
In database terminology, a column and

19
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:14,540
a table that uniquely identifies rows on
that table, can be called a primary key.

20
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:19,430
Sometimes the world gives us
a natural primary key for a table.

21
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:23,000
For instance, if you have a table of
countries and their capital cities,

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,550
you can be confident that there
aren't two countries named France.

23
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,993
So in that case, you can safely use
the name of the country as a key.

24
00:01:29,993 --> 00:01:33,451
You don't have to call
it country number 29.

25
00:01:33,451 --> 00:01:37,000
But you have to make sure
that a key really is unique.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,980
For instance, in the US,

27
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,880
there are several states with
a city named Springfield.

28
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,830
There's Springfield,
Massachusetts, Springfield,

29
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,400
Illinois, and a whole bunch of others.

30
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,160
So it's obvious that the name
Springfield isn't unique by itself.

31
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,330
Now, you might be tempted to think
that city plus state is unique, but

32
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,410
it turns out that
that's not true either.

33
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:59,310
In the state of Wisconsin, there are
five different towns named Springfield,

34
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,910
and there are three in New Jersey,
and two in Texas.

35
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:03,850
Doh!

36
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,010
And that's why most countries
use postal codes, or

37
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,139
what we call zip codes in the US.

38
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:11,607
Just like saying that somebody
is player number three or

39
00:02:11,607 --> 00:02:15,660
user 1,723, instead of using their name.

40
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,230
Using a made up number like 54028,
or 54659,

41
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:24,030
instead of Springfield,
Wisconsin, guarantees uniqueness.
