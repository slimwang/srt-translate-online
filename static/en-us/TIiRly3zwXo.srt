00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,010
So as I introduce to you this whole amazing concept of

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,440
computational photography, I feel it's important for

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,530
me to also give you a little bit for broader overview of this discipline.

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,150
So in this lecture I'll introduce to you what computational photography is and

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:17,350
how it relates to the broader discipline of photography itself.

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,030
as, as you know all of us have cameras nowadays.

7
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,130
And there is just a pervasiveness of cameras out there.

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,660
And that changes how we think about photography, and

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,410
computational photography has a lot to do with it.

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,340
So, in this lecture while looking at the frameworks we have looked at

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,420
previously, we are also going to look at the discipline at a little bit

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,580
of a distance.

13
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,030
And, I'm going to try to showcase why it's important for

14
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,870
us to study disciplines like computational photography.
