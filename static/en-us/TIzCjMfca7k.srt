Thanks for that example Susan. Now it's explicit memory that really requires us

2
00:00:03,945 --> 00:00:08,170
to have ability to retrieve information. For example, you're going to need to

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,635
retrieve what you've learned from this lesson to pass the problem set to the

4
00:00:11,635 --> 00:00:16,308
exam. However, there's often times that we don't encode the information

5
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:21,380
properly. Or we don't store it properly so it can't be retrieved. And as we're

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,368
going to see, sometimes people will retrieve information that's incorrect. This

7
00:00:25,368 --> 00:00:29,370
is termed False Memories. Now, false memories are memories of events that never

8
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:34,010
actually happened. Elizabeth Loftus is a pioneer in the research on false

9
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:38,658
memories. One study she did was had participants listen to a fictitious story

10
00:00:38,658 --> 00:00:44,328
of being lost in a shopping mall. A family member of the participant would

11
00:00:44,328 --> 00:00:48,090
describe this event to them, and 25% of the participants remembered being lost

12
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:54,568
in a shopping mall. Even though that never actually happened. So what does this

13
00:00:54,568 --> 00:00:55,500
tell us about memory?
