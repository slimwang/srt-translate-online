1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,050
We started with an input to SAT,

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:07,020
and that is going to be a lean formula with n variables

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,740
and these are going to be as always x₁, x₂ and so on until you reach xn.

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,400
And we are also going to specify the number of clauses

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,290
and I'm just going to use the letter m here

6
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,200
so we're going to say we have m clauses

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,100
and I'm also going to give them names

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:27,320
so I'm going to call them C₁, C₂ and so on until you reach Cm.

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:33,210
We're now going to construct a graph that represents or encodes this Boolean Formula here

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,120
and we are going to do this just as we have done before.

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,730
So, this part here is going to represent X₁.

12
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:45,720
This part over here is going to represent X₂ and so on and this one here Xn.

13
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:51,320
Now, the question of course is how long these parts for each X need to be,

14
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,660
and that depends on the number of clauses

15
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,150
because we're going to attach clauses to the variables here.

16
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,340
In order to make this safe, we should construct this part

17
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,790
so that we have m of these edge crossings here

18
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:08,590
because then we know that for each clause we have an edge

19
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,610
where we can attach that clause to.

20
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,010
Now, if we have m of these crossings here

21
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:20,770
this means that we have m+1 of these groups of three vertices here

22
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:27,070
so we have 3(m+1) vertices in this part here

23
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:30,400
and then we have one more vertex here, one more vertex here

24
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,090
so +2 if we extended like this, and this holds true for all of the other parts here as well.

25
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,320
Now, for each clause but of course also going to add a vertex like so

26
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,090
and again this vertex here is going to represent clause 1

27
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:49,940
this vertex here is going to represent clause 2 and so until we get to clause m.

28
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,640
My first question for you is

29
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,770
how many vertices are we using to represent the variables

30
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,460
so to represent x₁, x₂ and so on until we get to xn

31
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,550
and I would like you to enter this as four numbers

32
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:05,950
and so it's going to be some number times n plus some number times m

33
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:12,520
plus some number times mn plus possibly some constant.

34
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,280
Please give me these four numbers here

35
00:02:14,280 --> 99:59:59,999
to correctly count the number of vertices that we have here to represent variables.
