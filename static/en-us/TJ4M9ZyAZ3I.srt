1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This question is simply crying out for recursion.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We're given a recursive formula for the Stirling numbers,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:18,000
which is S(n, k) = kS(n - 1, k) + S(n - 1, k - 1).

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What we need to think about, though, is the base case,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
which isn't given. When do we stop?

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Well, if we have some objects, and we want to split them up,

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
if we have more piles that we're going to split them in,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
some pile will be empty. That's not allowed.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That means that if we have more piles--

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
piles is the k and object is the n--

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
if we have more piles than objects, we want to return 0. We can't do it.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That's one case.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If we look at our formula, we need to stop in other cases as well.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We can't just return 0 all the time, because then our sum will be 0.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What happens when these two values are the same?

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Well, if the two values are the same.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
If n equals k, then how many ways are there of splitting up the objects into

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
the same number of piles as there are objects? Well, there's just one way.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The other case we need to consider or we can consider, is if k is 1.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What if we want to split the objects up into 1 pile?

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Well, there is only one way to do that, so we can return 1 there as well.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Now to look at the code, I'm just going to code those two conditions.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
If we have fewer objects than piles, then there are no ways to arrange the objects.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
If we have the same number of objects as piles or if we have just one pile,

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
then there's one way to do that.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
If we're in neither of those cases, then we're going to return the formula that we were given--

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
the recursive formula.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That completes the Stirling number part of the question.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
For the Bell numbers we just need to sum the Stirling numbers for k equals 1 up to n as stated.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We need a variable to keep track of the total that we're going to return,

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and then we need to step through the values of key from 1 up to n.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
For k in the range 1 up to n + 1.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Don't forget the +1 on the end, because range stops one before the second input number.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Then we just need to add the Stirling number n, k.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Finally, we need to return the total.
