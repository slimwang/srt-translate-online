00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,110
A packet filtering firewall
is relatively simple.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,650
It basically applies a list
of rules to match the IP or

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,330
TCP header of a packet, and
based on the rules match,

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,150
the firewall will then decide to
forward or discard the packet.

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,120
Here are examples of IP or

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,860
TCP header information that a firewall
can use to filter a packet.

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,670
Source IP address, where the packet's
from, destination IP address,

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,480
where a packet's going to.

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,800
Source and destination transport level
address, this means the transport level

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,290
port number, which defines
applications such as SNMP or HTTP.

11
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,850
Basically, this tells what
application the packet belongs to.

12
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,350
For example, is it for
email or web traffic?

13
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,440
IP protocol field.

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,320
This defines the transport protocol,
such as TCP, UDP, or ICMP.

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,320
Interface, for firewall with three or

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,090
more ports, which interface of
the firewall the packet came from, or

17
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,270
which interface of the firewall
the packet is going to.

18
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,950
This is useful when there are multiple
ports in the interface network

19
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,560
that are quite different
security policies.

20
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,660
A packet filtering firewall is
typically set up as a list of

21
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:11,060
rules based on matches to
fields in the IP or TCP header.

22
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,990
If there's a match to one of the rules,

23
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,580
that rule is invoked to determine
whether to forward or discard a packet.

24
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,050
If there's no match to any rule,
then a default action must be taken.

25
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,120
There are two default policies.

26
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,010
The default discard policy means that if
there's no rule that matches the packet,

27
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,830
then the packet will be discarded.

28
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:34,270
This is a more secure or
conservative policy

29
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:39,030
because it provides more control about
what traffic is allowed to the network.

30
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,460
On the other hand, it can be a hindrance
to users who see that some traffic

31
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:47,490
are not allowed, and they have to tell
the system admin to enable the traffic.

32
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,790
The alternative is the default
forward policy, which means that

33
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,670
if there's no rule that matches
the packet, the packet is allowed.

34
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,090
Compared with the default
discard policy,

35
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:01,300
this policy is more user friendly,
but it's less secure.

36
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,170
The security admin
must react to each new

37
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,410
security threat add
rules to the firewall.
