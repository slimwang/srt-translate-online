00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,486
I'm going to use red to represent wrong and green to represent correct. If it

2
00:00:05,486 --> 00:00:09,840
turns out the null is true, and there's no significant difference. But we

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,437
reject the null, that's making the wrong statistical decision. However, if the

4
00:00:14,437 --> 00:00:18,154
null is true, and then we decide based on the result of our sample, that we're

5
00:00:18,154 --> 00:00:23,826
going to retain the null. Then we made the correct decision. Similarly if the

6
00:00:23,826 --> 00:00:29,883
null is false, and then we reject it, we've also made the correct decision. But

7
00:00:29,883 --> 00:00:34,382
if the null is false and the treatment actually did have an affect. But we

8
00:00:34,382 --> 00:00:39,112
assumed otherwise, then we're making the wrong decision. It's always possible

9
00:00:39,112 --> 00:00:44,440
to make the wrong decision. But we minimize our chances of doing so, when we

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,111
have a large enough sample size. When we randomize our sample, and when we

11
00:00:49,111 --> 00:00:54,290
implement proper experimental controls. If we reject the null when the null is

12
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:59,896
actually true, and we conclude that there was a treatment effect. We commit a

13
00:00:59,896 --> 00:01:04,861
type I error. I'm writing in Roman numerals. And if we fail to reject the null

14
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:09,415
even though it's false, this is called a type II error.
