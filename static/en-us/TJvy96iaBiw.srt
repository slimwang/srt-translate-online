00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,160
Whenever faced with a new technology or

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,090
library, I always like to interactively explore it.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,090
Whether that be in a in my terminal or the console in a webpage.

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:14,150
I find that having immediate feedback, and in the case of the Chrome developer

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:19,168
tools method auto-complete, greatly increases the speed in which I can learn.

6
00:00:19,168 --> 00:00:24,660
Again go into the top menu bar in the upper-right of the window,

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,702
scrolling down to the Tools sub-menu, and then opening up the Developer Tools,

8
00:00:30,702 --> 00:00:35,440
or Cmd+Option+I, we'll see a split pane.

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,270
In this case, we have the HTML of the page,

10
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,880
the JavaScript console, and the visual display of that page.

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,370
We are fortunate that we're learning about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and

12
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:53,850
D3 since we can access and inspect all the code used to construct a web page.

13
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,260
Simply by opening the browser's console or looking at the source.

14
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,230
If we would like to look at the raw source file, we can click on the menu again,

15
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:08,270
go back to Tools, and simply click View Source to see the textural content of

16
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,020
the page without any of the other Chrome tools.

17
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:16,320
When we request from udacity.com the course and the exact HTML

18
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,110
page we get returned the HTML source content which the web browser then parses.

19
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,220
Well it looks like the HTML source displayed in the web console of

20
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,090
the developer tools is actually the DOM representation of the HTML

21
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,060
source file I just showed you.

22
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,720
Notice as you hover over specific elements they get

23
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,580
highlighted in the visual display of the corresponding visual element.
