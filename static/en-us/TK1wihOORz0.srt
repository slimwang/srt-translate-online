1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,520
To review the different firewall types,
let's do a quiz.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,810
Here, please mark each statement as
either T for true or F for False.

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:09,720
The first statement.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,420
A packet filtering firewall
is typically configured

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,270
to filter packets going
in both directions.

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,300
The second statement.

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,680
A prime disadvantage of
an application-level gateway

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,050
is the additional processing
overhead on each connection.

9
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,040
The third statement.

10
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,970
A packet filtering firewall can decide
if the current packet is allowed

11
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,200
based on another packet
that it has just examined.

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,250
The fourth statement.

13
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,130
A stateful inspection firewall
needs to keep track of information

14
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,880
of an active connection in order
to decide the current packet.

15
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,340
Please mark each statement as
either T for true of F for false.
