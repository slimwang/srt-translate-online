00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,674
If we divide this entire left side of the equation by 3, then we just get rid of

2
00:00:04,674 --> 00:00:09,341
this coefficient in front of the parentheses and we end up with x plus 2. Over

3
00:00:09,341 --> 00:00:14,064
here, things get a little bit more complicated. Since we're dividing the whole

4
00:00:14,064 --> 00:00:18,276
side by 3, we have to divide each term by 3. 12 over 3 is 4 and negative 2x

5
00:00:18,276 --> 00:00:20,517
divided by 3 gives us minus 2 3rds x.
