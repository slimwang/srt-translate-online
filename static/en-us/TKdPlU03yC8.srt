00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,080
In this lesson, I hope to be able to cover aspects of how we can actually now

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,530
start looking at neighborhoods of pixels to help us do, among other things, like

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,230
smoothing of an image, to be able to extract more information from an image, or

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,760
just be able to enhance the image quality.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,800
The two things I want to be able to cover in this lecture is one,

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,950
I'm going to talk about how we can smooth an image by using a neighborhood of

7
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,870
pixels on an image.

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,850
And also I'm going to specifically talk about an application of this,

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:32,450
which is using median filtering to be able to among other things,

10
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,220
remove errors and smooth out an image.

11
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,530
Median filtering will be another instance of a method where we would be

12
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:42,080
looking at a neighborhood and running a statistical process on that

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,760
neighborhood to create a, a newer rendition of an image.

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,540
And again, this will go towards enhancing as how we can do filtering an image at

15
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,980
processing to be able to help us extract content from images.
