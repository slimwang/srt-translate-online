1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,298
So, what we learned from the last quiz is
that, when you have a negative exponent,

2
00:00:04,298 --> 00:00:07,753
you can rewrite whatever term you're
dealing with, so that we're instead,

3
00:00:07,753 --> 00:00:12,426
dividing by that factor inside the term.
So, negative exponents are actually veiled

4
00:00:12,426 --> 00:00:17,435
ways of writing division into our term.
The way we know what we're dividing by, is

5
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:21,490
to find the factor with a negative
exponent, which is just y^-2, in this

6
00:00:21,502 --> 00:00:25,870
case. And we move it underneath the
factors of the positive exponents to make

7
00:00:25,882 --> 00:00:29,899
it the denominator of the term. So, on the
right side of the equation where we've

8
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:34,725
moved it, it's now in the denominator. And
we've also changed the power of the base

9
00:00:34,737 --> 00:00:39,290
to be positive instead of negative. So, we
flip the sign of an exponent from negative

10
00:00:39,302 --> 00:00:43,615
to positive or from positive to negative.
We need to move the factor or the base

11
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:48,600
number that the exponent is applied to, to
the opposite side of the fraction. If it's

12
00:00:48,612 --> 00:00:52,021
in the top, it needs to move to the bottom
and if it's in the bottom, it needs to

13
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:57,192
move to the top, and we also flip the sign
of the exponent. So here, we change from

14
00:00:57,192 --> 00:01:01,476
negative to positive. So basically, if we
have some number, let's call it x and it's

15
00:01:01,476 --> 00:01:07,115
taken to a negative power, let's say,
that's -a, where a could be any number, or

16
00:01:07,127 --> 00:01:11,409
really any expression. Then, this is equal
to 1/x^a.

17
00:01:11,412 --> 00:01:16,988
So again, we multiply the exponent of a
number by -1. We need to switch which part

18
00:01:16,988 --> 00:01:22,098
of the fraction the factor it belongs to
is part of. I know that what's on the left

19
00:01:22,098 --> 00:01:27,214
side here doesn't look like a fraction,
but this is actually secretly x^-a/1.

20
00:01:27,214 --> 00:01:30,716
So, anything that doesn't look like it's
part of a fraction is actually in the

21
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:33,541
numerator of your fraction, where the
denominator is 1.
