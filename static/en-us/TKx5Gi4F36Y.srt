1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,540
Another option you have for
paid marketing is to directly buy

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,440
ad space from websites, or
more easily, from ad networks.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,630
There are some websites who can sell
you their ad real estate directly.

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:16,250
But in most cases, you'll use an ad
network or an ad exchange platform

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,930
to buy ad space and target your
audience in the most relevant websites.

6
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:25,090
These networks are using today's
technological platforms that allow both

7
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:30,180
advertisers and publishers to optimize
their buy or sell, accordingly.

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,340
These platforms are called DSP and SSP.

9
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,760
Demand side platform and
supply side platform.

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,890
A demand side platform allows
advertisers to engage in transparent

11
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,400
automated media buying across multiple
sources using unified targeting,

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,320
data, optimization, and reporting.

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,470
The platform helps the ad buyer
to aggregate all this data and

14
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,799
find the most ideal impressions for
a campaign.

15
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,620
A supply side platform helps
web publishers automate and

16
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,220
optimize the selling of
their online media space.

17
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,900
