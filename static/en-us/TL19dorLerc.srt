00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,194
We work with numbers, so of course, what are we going to do next? Let's work

2
00:00:04,194 --> 00:00:08,533
with variables. The variable just holds the place of a number. So this x could

3
00:00:08,533 --> 00:00:12,937
just be like my 10. Here's another rectangle to represent this expression. One

4
00:00:12,937 --> 00:00:16,993
side or one factor is x, and the other factor is x plus 2. The sides of this

5
00:00:16,993 --> 00:00:21,477
rectangle represent the factors in this expression. Factors are simply numbers

6
00:00:21,477 --> 00:00:26,385
that are multiplied together. Here's the first number x and here's the second

7
00:00:26,385 --> 00:00:31,197
number x plus 2. We know each of these is just a number because x represents a

8
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:36,177
number. So, here's one number this would be a different number. Using what we

9
00:00:36,177 --> 00:00:39,538
saw before, what do you think each of these areas are?
