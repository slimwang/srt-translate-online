00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,009
When you think of
assessments in education,

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:04,460
you probably think of what we
call summative assessments.

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,110
These are things like tests and quizzes
that occur at the end of some learning

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,320
process, to see whether or not you
learned the material by some deadline.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,120
And you take the assessment, you find
out if you passed or failed, and

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,130
you move forward either way.

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,270
But wouldn't it be great to find out
while you're learning if you're learning

8
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:18,390
the material well enough?

9
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,320
That's where formative
assessment comes in.

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,515
Formative assessment is assessment while
you're learning some new material.

11
00:00:23,515 --> 00:00:24,566
And it's really powerful,

12
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:27,710
because it more authentically mimics
the way we learn in the real world.

13
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,050
When you're learning to walk or talk,

14
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,900
what you're really doing is trying
lots of things every single minute and

15
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,420
getting immediate feedback on whether or
not you did it correctly.

16
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,460
That's formative assessment.

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,390
It's assessment while you're
trying to learn something.

18
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,050
So formative assessment
is very powerful, and

19
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,540
I would say it's
universally a good idea.

20
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,920
The difficulty is it's very difficult
to do in a regular classroom.

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,910
When you have one teacher and
20 or 30 students,

22
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,440
how do you have that one
teacher give all those students

23
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,560
individual feedback on what they're
doing wrong all at the same time?

24
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,530
It just can't be done.

25
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,676
And a college classroom
is even more difficult.

26
00:00:56,676 --> 00:00:59,221
You have one professor and
200 or 300 students.

27
00:00:59,221 --> 00:01:01,801
How can they give 200 students
feedback all at the same time?

28
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:03,500
It's just not possible.

29
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,420
That's why we talk about this in
an educational technology class.

30
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,720
Educational technology
can help us with that.

31
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,880
Educational technology can develop tools
to give students individual feedback on

32
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,220
what they're doing
while they're doing it.

33
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,070
We can use artificial intelligence
to give every single student

34
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,610
some individualized feedback on what
they did wrong on that latest iteration

35
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,650
all at the same time, even if everyone
is doing something different.

36
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,460
So that's why we talk
about it in this class.

37
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,840
So in this lesson, we'll talk about
what formative assessment is,

38
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,070
why it's powerful, and

39
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,710
how we can develop educational
technologies that help facilitate it.
