1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So to make this work out, we'll just make a little contract with ourselves.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's assume that when we're interpreting JavaScript and we come across a call to write

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
we'll just figure out what the argument is--that will be some string--

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and we'll append it to a special "javascript--space--output" variable

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
that we'll store in the global environment.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Global because you could call write from anywhere.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Everyone has to be able to see it.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So here is our glorious JavaScript interpreter, or at least the parts of it that you

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
haven't already written.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We're given the abstract syntax tree, which contains a list of JavaScript elements.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The first thing we do is make a global environment.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Global environments have no parent pointers.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This would be a parent pointer, but instead it's none.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We're going to start it out with the variable "javascript--space--output",

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
mapping to the empty string.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Then for every element in the embedded JavaScript code,

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
we evaluate that element--you've already seen how to do that--in the global environment.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This might make changes to it over time through calls to environment update.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
At the end of the day, the string we return is, well, we have the global environment

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
right here.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We get its 1th element, which is this mapping, and we get out the current value

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
of "javascript output," which hopefully has changed.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So it's quiz time.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You've seen our assumption, and we've written out the code for the JavaScript interpreter,

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
at least at the top level.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Here I've written 3 sentences.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We could rename "javascript--space--output" to anything as long as we're consistent.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
"Javascript--space--output" is a good choice because it has a space in it,

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and "javascript--space--output" starts empty, mapping to the empty string

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
to support 0 calls to write.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Multiple, multiple choice--check each one of these that's true.
