1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,855
All we need to do is factor the right hand side of the equation. You can leave

2
00:00:04,855 --> 00:00:10,120
the left hand side exactly the same. Keep that leading coefficient and recognize

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,928
that x squared plus 2x plus 1 is just equal to x plus 1 squared. So if our final

4
00:00:14,928 --> 00:00:19,141
equation is y plus 13 equals 3 times the quantity x plus 1 squared.
