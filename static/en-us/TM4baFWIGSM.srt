1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,490
So the date command is for telling time.

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,070
It has a whole lot of options but

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:09,840
if you just say date,
you'll get the current date and time.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,550
The expr command is a simple calculator.

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:18,370
The name stands for expression,
as in evaluate an arithmetic expression.

6
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,000
And so this command will add 2 and
2 and get 4.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,270
Echo is just the shells name for
the print statement.

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,540
It just repeats back whatever
you give it, like an echo.

9
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:34,830
Uname prints out the operating system's
name for itself, here that's Linux.

10
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,420
You can get a lot more information
with uname-a, by the way.

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,800
Hostname prints out the computer's
own name for itself.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,010
And here that's the name of
the vagrant VM you're running in.

13
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,320
Now host is pretty
different from host name.

14
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,380
It looks up a name in the DNS or

15
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,740
domain name service to find out its IP
address and also other information.

16
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:02,340
Here you can see it gives
an IP address for udacity.com.

17
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,910
And it also tells you that
Udacity's mail is handled by Gmail.

18
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:11,190
Technically it's only giving one of many
IP addresses that handle traffic for

19
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:15,090
Udacity, but it's more or
less Udacity's IP address.

20
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,070
Now bash--version

21
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:22,090
tells you what version number of
the bash shell you have installed.

22
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,810
It also gives you
the copyright information.

23
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,044
A lot of programs have some
sort of version command,

24
00:01:28,044 --> 00:01:32,560
often with an option like --version or
dash capital V.

25
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,852
Like here's python.

26
00:01:33,852 --> 00:01:37,630
Python -V tells us Python 2.7.6 and

27
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,440
the history command tells you all
the commands you've run previously.
