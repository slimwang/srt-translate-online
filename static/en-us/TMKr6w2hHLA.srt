1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,290
Let's summarize now
the implications of CAPM.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,450
Let's start first with the equation.

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:10,430
So the CAPM tells us that the expected
return on our portfolio is the veta

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:14,680
of the portfolio times the return on
the market plus alpha of the portfolio.

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,900
The first point, an important point,
is that alpha is random, and

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,870
the expected value of alpha is zero.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,600
So that excludes alpha from our
toolbox of ways to make money.

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,170
What's left?

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:33,380
So the only way we can beat the market
now is by cleverly choosing beta, so

10
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:38,130
that when the market is going up,
we choose a positive beta, and

11
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,620
when a markets going down we choose
a lower or even negative beta.

12
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,420
So CAPM says the only way we can beat
the market is with high beta and

13
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,600
up markets and
low beta and down markets.

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,360
The only problem with that is
the efficient markets hypothesis.

15
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,980
We haven't covered that yet,
but it's coming soon.

16
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:56,550
But anyways,

17
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,210
the efficient markets hypothesis
says you can't predict the market.

18
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,110
So, these avenues are not
available to you, either.

19
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:10,210
So, all these things taken together
say that you can't beat the market.

20
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:14,400
If the capital assets pricing model
is true, we can't beat the market.

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,080
Now, I don't believe that, and

22
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,786
this whole course is about ways that
you can potentially beat the market.

23
00:01:21,786 --> 00:01:24,100
So, we're going to get
to those eventually,

24
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,690
but we had to present
the capital assets pricing model

25
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,110
as a framework in which to
consider all these other things.
