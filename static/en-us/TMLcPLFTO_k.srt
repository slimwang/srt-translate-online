1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,970
So let's recap the code we have at the end

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:06,590
of unit two. So we defined a procedure, get_next_target, that

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:10,050
would take a page, search for the first linked target

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,310
on that page, return that as the value of URL.

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,470
That would be the first output, and also return the

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,600
position where the end of the quote is so we

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,580
know how to continue. And then we define the procedure

8
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,680
print all_links that keeps going as long as we can.

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,560
As long as there are more URLs on the page. It

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,640
will find the next target. Store these in the variables URL and

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,580
endpos to keep track of the location end of string. If

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,620
there is a URL, what we did was just print it out

13
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,990
and then we update with the page to keep going. What

14
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:45,100
we want to do to change this is instead of just printing out

15
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,350
each URL as we find it, we want to collect the URLs. We

16
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,090
want to have a way to use the URLs so we can use

17
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,110
them to keep crawling to find new

18
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:57,040
pages. The structure we've been learning about this

19
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,270
unit is the way to do that. What we want to do is keep all the

20
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,780
URLs in a list. At the end of this procedure, instead of printing the links

21
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,700
as we go, we want to have a list of all the links that we found.

22
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,690
So this is what the current print_all_links procedure does.

23
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,900
It takes the page as its input and its output

24
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,950
is nothing. It doesn't return anything. All it does

25
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,720
is do some work, prints out all these links. But

26
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,560
we can't actually use them at the end, because

27
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,990
it doesn't return anything. So what we want to do is

28
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,228
change this. Instead of print_all_links, what we want is to

29
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:35,280
get_all_links. We want to actually have the links in a way

30
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,890
that we can use them. So what we want,

31
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,720
instead of printing all links is to actually get the

32
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,390
links. So we'll change the name of our procedure

33
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,400
to get_all_links. And instead of outputting none, what we want to

34
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,190
do is output a list of links. And that

35
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,340
should be the list that corresponds to the things that

36
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,640
we were printing before, but now instead of just

37
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,070
printing them, we want to output them as a list.
