00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,939
Mean-shift is a method that's easiest
introduced, when we do segmentation.

2
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:09,590
The idea is, in Mean-shift, is to
find the modes of a distribution, or

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:10,710
of a probability density.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,840
So, you remember, the modes are sort of,
the peaked areas, and

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,340
here's the basic underlying assumption.

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,370
The assumption is, I've got a bunch of
samples, that have been drawn from some

7
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,430
probability distribution function,
and you want to find the modes.

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,790
So, there's this beautiful couple of
beautiful examples out there on the Web,

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,610
feel free to steal whichever
one you want, I stole this one.

10
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:32,850
So, here we have a set of particles, and
they're just drawn from some density.

11
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,940
And probably,
if I were to ask you where's the mode?

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,460
You'd probably, say,
that it's somewhere around here.

13
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,170
'Kay, and the goal is for
the system to find that on it's own.

14
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,890
So, here we have, and again,
we have our sample, so

15
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,290
let's put down a region, okay?

16
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,470
It's called a Region of interest.

17
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:51,405
Now, we're not going to talk about,
the size of that region just yet, or

18
00:00:51,405 --> 00:00:52,295
its shape.

19
00:00:52,295 --> 00:00:53,815
We'll talk about that,
a little bit later.

20
00:00:53,815 --> 00:00:57,555
It's going to be a Gaussian, but, for
now, it's just going to be a circle.

21
00:00:57,555 --> 00:01:00,315
So, we have this region, and
we calculate, okay, of all of

22
00:01:00,315 --> 00:01:04,805
the points in that circle, where is
the mean, that's, or the center of mass?

23
00:01:04,805 --> 00:01:06,805
And we say, oh,
it's not right in the middle, and

24
00:01:06,805 --> 00:01:10,815
that difference between them,
that's called the Mean Shift vector, so

25
00:01:10,815 --> 00:01:13,680
this is called the Mean Shift algorithm.

26
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,830
Amazing huh?

27
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,470
And so, what do you do with
the Mean Shift vector?

28
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,591
Well, you shift the mean,
and there it go.

29
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:21,850
[NOISE] Perfect.

30
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:22,406
Okay?

31
00:01:22,406 --> 00:01:23,640
What do we do?

32
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,070
We do it again.

33
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,300
Okay?
Here's where we are.

34
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,020
Here's the, the weighted mean of the,
the new samples.

35
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,440
There's our Mean Shift vector.

36
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,150
What do we do?

37
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,215
We shift it again.

38
00:01:33,215 --> 00:01:35,807
[NOISE] And we do it one more time.

39
00:01:35,807 --> 00:01:38,698
There it is, oh,
we're getting close now.

40
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:41,140
Small Mean Shift vector, shift, and

41
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,950
then finally, guess what,
we are in the right spot.
