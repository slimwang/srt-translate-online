00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,750
What are the learning outcomes of this course? At the conclusion of this class,

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:09,200
you will be able to do three primary things. First, you'll be able to design,

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,370
implement and evaluate and describe knowledge-based AIs. The design and

4
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,680
description of knowledge-based AI agent is really the first learning goal.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,640
In order to be able to design an agent,

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,770
you need knowledge of the methods of knowledge-based AI. Second, you will also

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,700
be able to use these strategies to address practical problems. This learning

8
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,275
outcome addresses the second learning goal, where you will be able to

9
00:00:32,275 --> 00:00:37,408
[INAUDIBLE] the relationship between AI agents and real world problems. Third,

10
00:00:37,408 --> 00:00:41,860
you'll also be able to use the design of knowledge-based AI agents to reflect on

11
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,570
human cognition and vice versa. This addresses the fourth learning goal.
