Welcome to the Udacity and Twitter course real time analytics with Apache Storm.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,530
I'm Lewis, and I build courses here at Udacity.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,580
>> And I'm Karthik, I'm Engineering Manager and Tech Lead for Storm at Twitter.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,500
Storm is a real time infrastructure for

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,420
easily expressing your real time analytic techniques.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,920
It is heavily used by Twitter for all real time analytics.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,990
>> Storm is fairly simple, can be used with any programming language, and

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,370
as our hackathon participants discovered, it's really fun.

9
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:32,180
In this course you'll be exploring Storm topologies, implementing data spouts

10
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:37,400
and processing data bolts by connecting to the real live Twitter garden hose.

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,670
And in your final project you'll be calculating worldwide top trending

12
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,140
hashtags and displaying tweets that contain these hashtags,

13
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,690
using the interactive data visualization library, D3.

14
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,660
Thanks for joining this class.

15
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:50,965
Let's get started with Apache Storm.
