1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,573
So we're in great shape right now. We just came up with another strategy to

2
00:00:03,573 --> 00:00:08,728
help us solve some problems using logarithms. As you might have guessed, this

3
00:00:08,728 --> 00:00:13,000
is called the quotient property, and yes. If it works for natural logs, then it

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,025
also works for logs of any other base. The quotient property says that if we

5
00:00:18,025 --> 00:00:23,301
have log base a of A over B. Then that's equal to log base a of A minus log

6
00:00:23,301 --> 00:00:29,326
base a of B. And again, this works for any base a that we can plug in. So let's

7
00:00:29,326 --> 00:00:34,828
use the quotient property, but in reverse to find this. Log base 2 of 24 minus

8
00:00:34,828 --> 00:00:40,040
log base 2 of 3. First, write this as a single log expression, log base 2 of

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,709
some number. And then tell me what that's equal to, just as a number.
