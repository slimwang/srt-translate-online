00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,030
Congratulations on finishing lesson one.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,080
In the next lesson,

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,430
we will learn how to add a lot of different visual items to our app.

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,120
These include buttons and images.

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,450
We will discuss how to place these buttons at a precise location on the phone.

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,680
We will also figure out how to show and

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,680
hide some text fields based on user input.

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:26,200
While doing all of this, we will learn about a design pattern called NVC.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,040
This is used to make apps.

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:28,920
See you in the next lesson.
