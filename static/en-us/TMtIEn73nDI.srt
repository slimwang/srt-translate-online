00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,370
Here's an illustration of
the workflow of intrusion detection

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,620
as well as the main components of
an intrusion detection system.

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,010
The input on an IDS is
data that describes

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,630
activities on systems and network.

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:20,370
The data is processed by the data
processor to extract activity records.

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,440
They are important for
security analysis this activity data

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,730
needs to be analyzed by
the detection engine.

8
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,790
The detection engine uses detection
models that have been already

9
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:38,260
constructed for the ideas that is
these models are stored with ideas.

10
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:42,072
If a detection rule determines
that there is an intrusion.

11
00:00:42,072 --> 00:00:45,140
The IDS produces an alert.

12
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:49,210
The decision engine then
decides the appropriate action

13
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,625
according to decision table.

14
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:54,812
For example, this can be a response
that automatically blocks

15
00:00:54,812 --> 00:01:00,000
a network connection or report that
is sent to the security admin.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,550
Again, for the IDS to work properly,
we'll assume that system

17
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:09,940
activities are observable and are
captured in the input data to the ideas.

18
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:15,000
And when detection models are applied
to the activity data, normal and

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,500
intrusive activities
have distinct evidence.
