1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,900
So the error suggests that the system or the

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,689
program, it can not find the file specified. You

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:10,100
know, that's really interesting because at one point we

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,520
were able to find all of the files. In fact

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,520
we printed out all of the file names. Okay,

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,830
let's continue to read the error. It says that the

7
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,025
error is in line 9, and it's happening around

8
00:00:21,025 --> 00:00:25,650
os.rename. This makes me wonder if the program is actually

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,560
looking at the right folder when it's trying to rename the files. So going back

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,090
to our program, I know there is this function called os.getcwd.

11
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,150
CWD stands for Current Working Directory. Let me see if that inner variable

12
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:45,030
and print it. And I will comment everything else out for the time being.

13
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,080
Let me Save, and Run.

14
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,240
It seems that the programs Current Working Directory is

15
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,200
this folder called OOP, which resides in the C drive.

16
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,750
And if I go back to my program, I know

17
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,700
that my files or my photos are inside this folder

18
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,680
called prank, which is inside OOP which resides in the

19
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,780
C drive. No wonder the program can't find any of

20
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,470
the files. It's looking inside OOP. Meanwhile, all of the

21
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,450
files are inside prank. To fix this, I can use

22
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,910
the change directory function. And with this function I can

23
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,410
ask the program to look at the folder where my

24
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,900
files actually reside, which is this folder right here. So

25
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,440
I'm going to copy that, and I'm going to paste it here.

26
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,760
And then let me uncomment some of the lines

27
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,590
I'd commented out before. Towards the end of the function,

28
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,030
I will change the path back to how I found

29
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,560
it. Let me Save, and Run the program one more

30
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,830
time. Hm, the program didn't quite throw an error

31
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,340
this time. But now I want to check to see if

32
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,570
the files have actually been renamed. So here we are

33
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,130
back at our folder, and you'll notice that the names

34
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,810
of the files don't have any numbers any more.

35
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,080
They've been renamed. And if I zoom out a

36
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,540
little bit, you'll notice that the photos will reveal

37
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,788
a secret message, which is that the keys are

38
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:14,820
in the closet behind the shoebox. All right, it

39
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,510
seemed like our program worked. Now, before we finish

40
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,630
this project, my final recommendation in terms of improving

41
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,390
it, is to add a print statement each time

42
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,430
we change the name of a file. So here I am printing

43
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,474
the old name of the file, and here is its new name.
