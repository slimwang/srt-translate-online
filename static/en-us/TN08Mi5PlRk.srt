00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,910
Another major difference
between Android security and

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:06,890
iOS security is code signing.

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,970
Android takes a very
different approach from iOS.

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:13,940
In particular,
all apps are self-signed by developers.

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:19,170
A developer can create his own
power key, self sign it to create

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,030
a certificate for its public key and
then use that key to sign his apps.

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:29,200
In other words, third party Android apps
are not signed by a central authority.

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,950
There's no vetting process for
third party app developers.

9
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,398
This means that anybody can
become an Android app developer,

10
00:00:36,398 --> 00:00:40,970
self-sign its apps and
upload it to Android Play Store.

11
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:46,768
So, if code signing is not used to make
sure that apps are from the vetted or

12
00:00:46,768 --> 00:00:49,860
verified developer, what is it used for?

13
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,250
Code signing is used for
making sure updates for

14
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,400
an app are coming from
the same developer.

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,520
In addition,
code signing is used to manage

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,069
the trust relationship between apps,
so that they can share code and data.
