1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,930
Here's my solution.

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:05,870
I started with the original problem and
decided first to eliminate

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:11,200
this pesky free variable, x3, which
wasn't constrained to be nonnegative.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,000
From this equality constraint,
I know that x3 = x- 1 and

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,900
substituting that into the objective
function then gives me

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,630
that I need to minimize 4x1- 2x2.

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,560
There's some other constant out here,
but

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,220
that's not going to effect my choice for
the optimum value for x.

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,140
So, I can simply drop that.

10
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,660
We end up with 3x1 in
the inequality constraint.

11
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:42,750
And the -2 from this side,
increases the bound on the side to 7.

12
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,390
The equality constraint
goes away altogether,

13
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,200
with the elimination of the variable.

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,523
Now I need to turn this
inequality into an equality, so

15
00:00:51,523 --> 00:00:54,420
I introduce a new slack variable, x3.

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,590
And then lastly, I just need to negate
the coefficients in the objective

17
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,700
function to convert the minimization
problem to a maximization problem.
