1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,870
Let us first consider a simpler sentence. So

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,530
consider the sentence Ashok made pancakes for David with a griddle.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,420
I'm sure you understood the meaning of this sentence almost immediately. But

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,626
what did you understand? What is the meaning of meaning? We can do several

5
00:00:14,626 --> 00:00:19,100
different kinds of analysis on this sentence. We can do lexical analysis,

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,710
which will categorize each of these words into different lexical categories. For

7
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:28,390
example, Ashok is a noun, made is a verb, pancakes is a noun, and so on. We can

8
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:32,840
do syntactic analysis. In terms of the structure of this particular sentence.

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,998
So, you might say Ashok is a non phrase. Made pancakes for David with a griddle

10
00:00:36,998 --> 00:00:41,480
is a verb phrase. And this particular verb phrase itself has sub phrases in it.

11
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,690
Or we can do semantic analysis on this, and say that Ashok was the agent.

12
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,550
Made was the action. Pancakes were the object that got made. David was

13
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:54,002
the beneficiary. Griddle was the instrument. The knowledge base here as

14
00:00:54,002 --> 00:00:58,400
oppose to understanding stories like this. Semantic analysis is at a forefront.

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:04,060
Syntactic analysis and lexicon analysis will serve semantic analysis. So

16
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,980
here are some of the semantic categories in terms of which we can classify

17
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:13,260
the different words in the sentence. So Ashok is an agent, made is an action or

18
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,420
verb in the lexical sense, pancakes are the thematic objects,

19
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,630
the things that are getting made and so on. The frame for representing

20
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:25,480
understanding of this sentence has the verb of the action make, the agent Ashok,

21
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,260
and so on just like we just discussed. This then is the meaning of meaning. This

22
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,370
is what the agent understands when it understands the meaning of this sentence.

23
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,830
This is perhaps also what you understand when you understand the meaning of

24
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,940
this sentence. How do we know that you understood the meaning of this sentence?

25
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,670
Well, we know that because I can ask you some questions and you can draw

26
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,200
the right kind of inferences from it. So for example, given this sentence,

27
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,720
I can ask you, well who ate the pancakes? And you might be able to say,

28
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,140
well David ate the pancakes because Ashok made the pancakes for David.

29
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:03,100
Notice that this information about who ate the pancakes was not present in this

30
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,530
particular sentence. This is an inference you're drawing. This is a very similar

31
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,240
to what we had encountered earlier when we had sentence like Ashok ate a frog.

32
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,380
At that time too, we'd ask questions like, well, was Ashok happy at the end?

33
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:21,050
And the frame had some default values which said Ashok was probably happy.

34
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,240
Or, was the frog dead at the end, and the frame for

35
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,290
eating had some default value which said that the frog was dead at the end?

36
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:33,160
So according to this theory, the meaning lies in the inferences we can draw from

37
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,410
it. You understand the meaning of this if you can draw the right inferences. You

38
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,530
do not understand the meaning of this if you cannot draw the right inferences or

39
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:44,180
if you can draw only the wrong inferences. This frame representation of

40
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,920
the meaning of this particular sentence allows you to draw the right inferences.

41
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,470
Given the action make here, the thematic role pertains to the relationship of

42
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,360
various words in the sentence. To this particular action of making.

43
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,796
Ashok is the agent, David is the beneficiary, and so

44
00:02:59,796 --> 00:03:03,360
on. So far we are describing meaning of this sentence, and how we

45
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,850
can capture that meaning in this frame. We have not yet described the process by

46
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:12,390
which this knowledge is extracted out of that sentence. The extraction of

47
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,780
the meaning of this sentence is exactly the topic that we will discuss next.
