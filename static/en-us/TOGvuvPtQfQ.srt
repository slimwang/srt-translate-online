00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,142
I'd like us to just go through a couple more examples using factoring by

2
00:00:04,142 --> 00:00:08,932
grouping with higher order polynomials. I know this isn't really that different

3
00:00:08,932 --> 00:00:13,342
from factoring quadratic polynomials, but I think it's worth it to get some

4
00:00:13,342 --> 00:00:18,174
practice. How would you factor 4x cubed minus 12x squared plus 2x minus 6? Make

5
00:00:18,174 --> 00:00:21,944
sure that at the end you check the factors you've multiplied together to see if

6
00:00:21,944 --> 00:00:24,173
any of them have common factors within them.
