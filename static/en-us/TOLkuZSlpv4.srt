00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,363
The rule that we just came up with in the last quiz for figuring out graphically

2
00:00:04,363 --> 00:00:08,404
whether or not a curve is a function is called the vertical line test. So

3
00:00:08,404 --> 00:00:12,992
remember, according to the vertical line test, we can tell that a curve is a

4
00:00:12,992 --> 00:00:17,210
function if there is no vertical line that we can draw anywhere on the

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:22,276
coordinate plane that intersects that curve at more than one point. So, using

6
00:00:22,276 --> 00:00:26,765
your newfound understanding of the vertical line test, which of the five curves

7
00:00:26,765 --> 00:00:31,002
over here are functions? So, please check off as many as you think are, in fact,

8
00:00:31,002 --> 00:00:31,647
functions.
