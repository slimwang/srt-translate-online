00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,240
As you can imagine, since data science is being deployed

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,090
in such a wide range of fields, data scientists use

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,710
many different tools, depending on the task at hand. One

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,630
of the most versatile and ubiquitous is a Python package called

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,780
Pandas, which we'll use in order to handle and manipulate

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,210
data during this course. You might wonder why we'll be using

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,860
Pandas, as opposed to another tool. Pandas allows us to

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,790
structure and manipulate our data in ways that are particularly well-suited

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:30,400
for data analysis. If you happen to be familiar with the scripting language, R,

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,020
Pandas takes a lot of the best elements from R and implements them in Python.
