1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Well, I did say this was a bit of a trick.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
If you look carefully at this regular expression, it requires words that are at least two letters long,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
a through z followed by one or more a through z at least two.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So, we actually don't match a. We match quick and brown and then there's nothing in here.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We just return a two-element list.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We have questions like this, because I want you to be confident in your own answer

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and not necessarily trust the structure of the problem that's given to you.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This particular phrase a quick brown comes from the sentence,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
"A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog,"

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
used commonly because it typically involves all of the letters in the English alphabet

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
giving you a chance to see what each one looks like if you're testing out a font or what not.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So here is my quick brown fox, and it's jumping over a lazy dog,

13
00:00:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and we will say that this sentence labels both of them.
