1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,860
The answers are, yes, the monkey has the bananas. No, the box is not at C,

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:11,570
it's been pushed to B. Yes, the monkey is at B. Yes, the bananas are at B.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,580
No, the height of the monkey is not

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,330
high, because he climbed down. Which meant that the

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,600
effect was, that is at height, low. But

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,790
yes, the height of the bananas is high according

7
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:29,660
to these definitions. Now you would think, once the

8
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,840
monkey grasps the bananas and climbed down that the height

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,600
of the bananas should be low. But if we look

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,170
at the up rate of climb down, it doesn't say

11
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,750
that. It refers to the monkey. But it, it doesn't

12
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,200
refer to anything that the monkey is holding. because that

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,710
kind of thing is difficult to express in the language

14
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,873
of classical planning. So you could say, that's a weakness

15
00:00:50,873 --> 00:00:52,670
in the definition of climb down.
