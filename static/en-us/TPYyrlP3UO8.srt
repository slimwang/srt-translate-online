00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,670
It is also important to look at how the component frameworks differ in as far as

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,390
their support for variability is concerned.

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,460
Recall that one of the key advantages of components and their late

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,390
finding is the fact that there's some flexibility provided to their customer.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,080
As far as Java and

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,970
CLI are concerned, they use a single virtual machine for all platforms.

7
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,570
Many languages can generate byte codes that target those particular platforms.

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,390
COM also supports many languages, but on Microsoft platforms only.

9
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,600
CORBA supports, supports multiple languages, but each of the,

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,200
each of the languages must its own IDL binding.

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,610
Each platform must also have an object request broker

12
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,190
running on that particular platform.
