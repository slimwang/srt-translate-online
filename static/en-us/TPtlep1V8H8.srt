00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,410
So what is a knowledge representation? The collage on this

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:08,900
screen shows several knowledge representations that AI has developed. In each

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:14,830
knowledge representation there is a language. That language has a vocabulary.

4
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,910
Then, in addition to that language, in that knowledge representation there's

5
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:23,710
some content. The content of some knowledge. Let's take an example with which

6
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:28,500
you're probably already familiar. Consider the Newton's second law of motion.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,960
So I can represent it as f is equal to m a. This is a knowledge representation.

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,280
A very simple knowledge representation, in which there are two things.

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,650
There is a language of algebraic equations, y s equal to b x, for

10
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:47,220
example. And then there is the content of our knowledge of

11
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:51,240
Newton's second law of motion, force equals mass times acceleration.

12
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,380
So the knowledge representation has two things, once again.

13
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:01,440
The language, which has its vocabulary. For example, this sign of equality. And

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,340
the content that goes into that representation expressed in that language.

15
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,180
Let us not worry too much about all of the representations in

16
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,110
this collage right now, we'll get to them later. The idea here is to

17
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:19,460
simply show that AI has developed not one, but many knowledge representations.

18
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:23,880
Each representation has its own affordances and its own constraints.
