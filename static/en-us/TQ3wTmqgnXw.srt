00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,710
The next step is going to be extracting those images from the data sets.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,259
It will create a new local directory to directories notMNIST_large, and which

3
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:11,820
is the training data.

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,890
It's a, you know, very noisy, not very clean.

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:20,220
There is a smaller data sets, which is notMNIST_small, which is going to be the

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,560
test data. And that data has been verified by hand, and so itâ€™s a little

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,939
cleaner than the training data. Each of those directories have 10 sub

8
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:35,550
directories, one for each letter. And, you know, you should take a look and convince

9
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,550
yourself that you have the right kind of data that you can actually see it.

10
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,550
It's good to be able to visualize it in your notebook. You can use IPython.display

11
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,899
to display an image and convince yourself that you've got things

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,550
downloaded properly.
