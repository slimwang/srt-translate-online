00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,692
So once again we need a new kind of number classification, one that goes beyond

2
00:00:04,692 --> 00:00:09,524
just imaginary numbers and just real numbers. You can see I've drawn a new giant

3
00:00:09,524 --> 00:00:14,276
rectangle around both of those families of numbers and labeled it with the name

4
00:00:14,276 --> 00:00:18,825
complex numbers. So examining our new diagram, can you tell me which of the

5
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:24,117
following statements are true? All real numbers are complex. All complex numbers

6
00:00:24,117 --> 00:00:29,236
are real. All imaginary numbers are complex. All complex numbers are imaginary.

7
00:00:29,236 --> 00:00:34,323
All real numbers are imaginary, or all imaginary numbers are real. Please check

8
00:00:34,323 --> 00:00:39,062
off as many of these as you think are true. Be careful in remembering how our

9
00:00:39,062 --> 00:00:43,984
diagram works. In particular, how do you tell if one set of numbers is a subset

10
00:00:43,984 --> 00:00:45,000
of another set?
