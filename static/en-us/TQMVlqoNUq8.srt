The code for this one is pretty short overall. You get the cylinder's axis, get

2
00:00:03,777 --> 00:00:07,205
the length from it. And then get the center by taking the average of the two

3
00:00:07,205 --> 00:00:10,375
point's locations. Notice that this is the one time where we actually add two

4
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:13,350
points together to get the center point between them. If you're up for a

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,397
challenge, try this exercise again, but delete the MakeLengthAngleAxisTransform

6
00:00:17,397 --> 00:00:20,722
method and write it yourself. I was going to make this the assignment

7
00:00:20,722 --> 00:00:24,037
originally, but after taking a few hours myself fighting JavaScript and some

8
00:00:24,037 --> 00:00:26,209
cross product headaches, I decided against it.
