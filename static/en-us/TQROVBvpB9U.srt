I know this has seemed pretty easy so far, but there's something else that's

2
00:00:04,356 --> 00:00:08,889
really interesting about 1/4. I can represent 1/4 in other ways. Like if I had a

3
00:00:08,901 --> 00:00:13,257
clock. So, if I start on the hour, I could go 15 minutes. I could go another 15

4
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:17,873
minutes, I could go another 15 minutes, and I could go another 15. I know an

5
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:23,790
hour is 60 minutes so I just need to go 1/4 of that way. So, 1/4 is going to be

6
00:00:23,802 --> 00:00:29,666
one 15-minute period. This is 1/4 of my one hour. 1/4 could also represent part

7
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:35,433
of an area of a square. Here's a square, notice that I split the square up into

8
00:00:35,445 --> 00:00:40,865
4 parts. If I shade one of those parts, I have 1 out of 4 or 1/4. Notice that in

9
00:00:40,877 --> 00:00:45,035
both cases, I split up my whole part into 4 equal pieces. I split the square up

10
00:00:45,047 --> 00:00:48,975
into 4 equal pieces and I split my hour up into 4 15-minute time intervals.

11
00:00:49,072 --> 00:00:53,345
What's really important is that we always create equally sized pieces. What's

12
00:00:53,357 --> 00:00:57,175
also interesting is that I could have actually split up my square a bit

13
00:00:57,187 --> 00:01:02,234
differently, I could have drawn this. So, if I shaded in this area, I know that

14
00:01:02,246 --> 00:01:06,035
I'd have 1/4 or 1 out of 4 equally divided pieces.
