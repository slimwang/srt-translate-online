00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's assume we have two different ways to lose weight,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and we want to figure out which one is the most effective.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We have 10,000 people who received Treatment A. Their average loss is 10 pounds.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The standard deviation of their loss is also 10 pounds.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Let's consider a second treatment, Treatment B.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We also applied it to 10,000 people. Our average loss in this case was 20 pounds.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And we also have a standard deviation of 20 pounds.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Our null hypothesis of course is that weight loss from Treatment A equals

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
the average weight loss from Treatment B.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Our alternative hypothesis is if we are perhaps the providers of Treatment B

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
is that WB is greater than WA or alternatively that the difference is positive.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 99:59:59,999
With a 5% allowable false positive rate, which hypothesis do we choose to accept?
