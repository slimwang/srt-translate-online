1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,230
So after that detour about URIs,
let's get back to the task at hand.

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:10,480
Opening a map, we'll be creating
the intent that opens this map,

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,210
so here's where that
code will get called.

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,429
Let's start with the address
of Google's headquarters.

5
00:00:16,429 --> 00:00:19,242
We'll need to convert
this address to a GOURI.

6
00:00:19,242 --> 00:00:24,130
A properly composed
Android GO URI consist of

7
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:28,829
the geo scheme, a latitude and
longitude, and optional

8
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:32,890
query parameters to indicate the street
address or business, and the zoom level.

9
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:36,559
It's important to note that if
there is a query parameters for

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:42,670
our street address or business,
the lat long path must be 0,0.

11
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:47,644
Here is a geo URI that shows the city of
Antwerp in Belgium with a zoom factor of

12
00:00:47,643 --> 00:00:48,128
10.

13
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:51,530
There are a couple of
ways to build the URI.

14
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:58,240
One way is to use URI.parse in
an inline string concatenation.

15
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:04,120
But it's less error prone to use
URI.builder to create our URI.

16
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,150
It's a bit more code,

17
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:10,880
but as the URI gets more complex, the
builder pattern makes it more readable.

18
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:13,469
Next we can create an intent
with that address URI, but

19
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:15,989
we shouldn't try to call
start activity just yet.

20
00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:20,637
It's important to check to see if
the device can handle the request.

21
00:01:20,637 --> 00:01:25,474
It's possible there is no map app
installed to handle this intent.

22
00:01:25,474 --> 00:01:30,309
resolveActivity ensures some app on the
device is able to handle this intent.

23
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:34,480
So when we run the app,
we can see our map comes up.
