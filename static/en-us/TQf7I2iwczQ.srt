00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,500
So that's the end of this section
about messaging on Android Auto.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,380
As you can see, the fundamentals of
your application remain the same, but

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,710
you added some simple extensions
to your notification objects

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,590
to get Android Auto features.

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:16,280
This concept of extending notifications
is very common on Android and

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,330
is similar to how the extensions
work for Android Wear as well.

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,290
Android Auto provided all
the speech recognition for you.

8
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,780
So, you just need to do
something with the text string.

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,370
And it takes care of speaking
to the user as well.

10
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:32,020
We also covered some of the important
things to know about extending existing

11
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,030
messaging apps.

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,790
So if you really have an app you
should be ready to extend it for Auto.

13
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,300
In the next lesson, we're going to talk
about how to add Android Auto Support

14
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,920
to your existing music app.

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,060
So let's go try that.

16
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,141
I'll see you then.

17
00:00:45,141 --> 00:00:45,950
