And the answer here is that greedy chooses 20 vertices. Why is that?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Well first of all, greedy will choose the 8 vertices that I added down here because

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
they have the largest number of edges attached to them, which is this one, this one,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
this one, you get the picture. So we'll choose 8 vertices down here. And then

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
after that the whole bottom part here of the network will be covered so it will then

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
proceed as it did before. It will choose these 12 here.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So that makes a total of 20 vertices.
