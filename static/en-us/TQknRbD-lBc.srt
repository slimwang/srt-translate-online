1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,440
Okay, let's see if we
understand the issue here.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:08,020
We already have two histograms,
one that gives us the probability that

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,910
an observes Hue value is from
a skin pixel, and other capturing

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,570
the probability distribution
of it not being a skin pixel.

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,530
Now along comes a pixel whose
hue value lies somewhere here.

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,230
Say this corresponds to bin value six.

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:28,070
Using this, we can find out the bin
heights or corresponding probabilities.

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:33,080
Lets say that the probability that this
value came from a skin pixel is 0.5.

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,470
And that it came from
a non skin pixel at 0.1.

10
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,660
Okay, now that you have these two values

11
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,740
can you decide whether x came
from a skin pixel or not?

12
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,480
In general is this condition sufficient?

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,420
That is I'd say that x is a skin pixel

14
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,390
if P(x) given skin is greater
than P(x) given not skin.

15
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,290
How about this deceptively similar but
different condition.

16
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:02,320
That is P skin given x is
greater than P not skin given x.

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,645
While we're at it,
let's throw in a couple more choices.

18
00:01:05,645 --> 00:01:08,190
P(x) given skin times P of skin

19
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:12,900
is greater than P(x) given
not skin times P of not skin.

20
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,795
Is that sufficient?

21
00:01:13,795 --> 00:01:15,820
How 'bout this last one?

22
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:22,050
P skin given x times P(x) is greater
than P not skin given x times P(x).

23
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:26,400
Select the condition or conditions
that you think you can use to decide

24
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,730
whether a skin pixel is
being seen given a value x
