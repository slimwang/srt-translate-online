00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,980
Let's talk now, more specifically, about processes.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:07,590
And, we'll start first by understanding, what is a process?

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,370
To do this, recall that one of the roles of

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:15,680
the operating system is to manage the hardware on behalf of applications.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,390
An application is a program that's on disk, in flash memory, even in the cloud.

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,620
But it's not executing, it's a static entity.

7
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,370
Here, for instance,

8
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,530
in this picture, we have some application that's stored on disk.

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:34,300
Once an application is launched, it's loaded in memory here, and

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,300
it starts executing.

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,300
Then it becomes a process.

12
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,420
So a process is an active entity.

13
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,740
If the same program is launched more than once,

14
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,140
then multiple processes will be created.

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,760
These processes will executing the same program, but

16
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,240
potentially will have very different state.

17
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,640
In fact, very likely they will have very different state.

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,450
For instance, a process can be one instance of the word editor program.

19
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,890
Here, you're displaying some notes from a previous lecture.

20
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,357
And perhaps you're just reviewing it, you're not really modifying this.

21
00:01:07,357 --> 00:01:10,430
And then you can have a second process, another instance of

22
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,600
the exact same word editor program to take notes from this lecture.

23
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,230
Given that we just started, this probably doesn't have many notes,

24
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:23,300
so it has relatively small state, and it may have some unsaved edits.

25
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:29,210
So, process therefore represents the execution state of an active application.

26
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,830
It doesn't mean necessarily that it's running.

27
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:37,310
It may be waiting on input like user input to type in certain notes.

28
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:41,380
Or it may be waiting for another process that's currently running on the CPU,

29
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,510
in case there's just one CPU in the system.
