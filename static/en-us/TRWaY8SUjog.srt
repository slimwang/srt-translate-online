00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:03,763
So here's the same function as the function that we had for calculating the area

00:00:03,763 --> 00:00:07,582
of Grant's fun room, except I've removed the domain restriction, and therefore

3
00:00:07,582 --> 00:00:12,002
also removed the range restriction. So the first question I have for you about

4
00:00:12,002 --> 00:00:17,020
this entire graph is, what is the domain of f of x? Please write your answer

00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,574
interval notation.
