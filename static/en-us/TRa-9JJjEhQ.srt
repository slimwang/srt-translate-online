1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:05,600
So I want you to fill out this report card, which says, how well is

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,930
AFS doing as a secure system. And I want you to think about

3
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:15,870
some of the challenges that a secure system

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,890
has to face. The first one is mutual suspicion.

5
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:26,010
Meaning can I trust the server. Can the server trust the client? Can I trust my

6
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,950
fellow users in the community? Is that challenge

7
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,759
addressed by AFS? I want you to give a

8
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,290
binary answer, yes or no. The second attribute I

9
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:39,630
want you to evaluate the Andrew file system on

10
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,920
is whether the users are protected from the system,

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,290
or in other words, can the system do something

12
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,280
bad to the users? So that's the second attribute

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,270
I want you to evaluate. Once again, a binary

14
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,380
answer, yes or no. And the third attribute is confinement of resource

15
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:01,500
usage. In other words, does the system ensure that no

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,380
particular user can overuse resources available

17
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:11,420
in the system. The resources could be network bandwidth and so on. Again, binary

18
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:16,645
answer. The fourth thing that I want you to evaluate the AFS system is

19
00:01:16,645 --> 00:01:20,420
on authentication. Whether it provides authentication in

20
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,370
both ways. Both authenticating the server to

21
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:28,560
the client and the client to the server. The last attribute is the integrity of

22
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,660
the server itself, meaning can the server be compromised in any fashion. That is

23
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:38,170
the last attribute I want you to evaluate. Once again binary answer, yes or no.
