00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
If you consider an independent set versus a vertex cover,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
what you have is the following.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
If you have the smallest possible vertex cover, that means you have selected

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,500
a minimum number of vertices so that each edge is next to at least one of those vertices.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,000
If you were to remove those vertices from a graph, then no edges would remain

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,500
because every edge is connected to at least one of those vertices of the vertex cover,

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,000
so what remains is always an independent set.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And since you've selected the smallest possible vertex cover,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
so the smallest number of vertices you need to remove,

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,500
what remains must be the largest set or a largest set of independent vertices.

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,000
And now that discovery is, of course, really great news for Alice,

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
but it's also even better news for Carol whose smile gets a bit bigger,

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,500
and, of course, also Bob because what they have now found out is this:

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,000
clique and independent set are really closely connected.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So if Bob discovers a good--or if any of them discovers a good algorithm for clique,

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,500
then they have not only solved "clique" but also "independent set."

17
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,000
So if just one of those two problems is solvable in polynomial time

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,300
or, in other words, if just one of those two problems turns out to be tractable,

19
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,500
then the other problem will be tractable as well.

20
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,500
And now we have also connected vertex cover to independent set

21
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,500
because we've basically figured out that finding the largest possible independent set

22
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:35,500
for a graph is almost the same as looking for the smallest possible vertex cover.

23
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:40,000
This also means that if you can find the smallest possible vertex cover,

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
then you have found the largest possible independent set

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
which we already know, through transforming the graph, lets you find

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
the largest possible clique.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So, actually, we can also draw this connection here

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
because we already know about these two connections.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What they have discovered is something that is commonly known as a reduction.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And we'll get more deeply into that in the next unit.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What a reduction is is basically a transformation between two problems

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
so that if you find out that one of them is tractable,

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
then the other one is tractable as well.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So now the big question is, for clique, vertex cover, and independent set,

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
are those three problems tractable--in which case

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Alice, Bob, and Carol would really keep smiling--

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
or will it turn out that all of these problems are intractable--in which case

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Bob, Alice, and Carol would tend to be rather unhappy?

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So which one is it going to be?

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Are all three going to end up very happy, are all three going to end up very sad,

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
or is there maybe something in between?

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You can find out how that story continues in our next unit

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
of our Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Plus, in the next unit, I will also tell you how you could quickly win a million dollars.
