00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And there are many ways to do it. Here's how I chose to do it.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I go through the ranks, and then for each r in the ranks,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I check to see if the ranks has a count of exactly n of those,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
so count is one of the methods that exists on lists.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We can ask a list to count how many times it has an element.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If that's equal to n, then return that element.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And if not, then just return none.
