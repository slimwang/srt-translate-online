1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,030
The next thing we need to do is get an
emulator ready to run the code within.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,119
Go to Tools > Android and
start the AVD manager.

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,270
Now select Create a Virtual Device and

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,970
you can select a phone
model to use here.

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,840
I'm going to pick a Galaxy Nexus
since it's an older device

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,210
with a smaller display and

7
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,870
smaller memory footprint that will work
on my small laptop display easily.

8
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,521
Click next and
then select Lollipop API 21.

9
00:00:22,521 --> 00:00:25,100
Although, any newer APIs
will also work as well.

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,910
Make sure you pick one with
Google APIs since that is required for

11
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,200
Android auto support.

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,090
If you pick the X86 simulator, and

13
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:35,190
have the HAXM driver installed,
the emulator will also run a lot faster.

14
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,170
Click next.

15
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,197
In the scale section, you may need to
play with the settings to make sure

16
00:00:39,197 --> 00:00:41,270
the emulator fits on your screen.

17
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,380
Otherwise, leave
the defaults as they are and

18
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,130
click finish to to create the AVD.

19
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,180
Now, you have a list of
emulators available.

20
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,900
So select the one we just created and
click the play button to start it up.

21
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,100
Once the emulator is ready,
you can unlock it.

22
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,470
Now we need to install
the Audio Simulator.

23
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:00,020
This app uses the same API's as
the Real Android Audio Head Unit so

24
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,140
we can see how our app will work
without having to sit outside in a car.

25
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,570
You can also do this on a hand
held device if you'd like.

26
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,020
It's actually downloaded
as part of the SDK manager

27
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,900
just like we did it earlier for
messaging.

28
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,690
So let's go to Tools >
Android SDK Manager.

29
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,411
If we scroll down to the bottom in
the Extras category, you should see that

30
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:21,120
it's installed here from when we used it
previously for Android Auto Messaging.

31
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,130
So let's close the SDK Manager.

32
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,730
Once you've got that package installed,

33
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:28,750
now we need to find the media simulator
APK in the Android SDK directory.

34
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,866
In this case my SDK's in
~/Library/Android/sdk and now,

35
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:36,190
we need to change some into
the extras/google/simulators directory.

36
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:40,130
And in here you can see
the media-browser-simulator.apk file.

37
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,250
So let's install that to out
emulator with adb install.

38
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,460
And that's now ready
to go in our emulator.

39
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,360
Now, we need to build and install
our code to the running emulator.

40
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,450
So click on the green icon here,
which does it all for us.

41
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,140
Now, we select the emulator and hit OK.

42
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,130
Now, it's installing to the emulator.

43
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,599
Once it's done, your app will
start running on the emulator.

44
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:02,020
Note that it's just running the default
activity included with the sample.

45
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,460
But you can't see a music
playback interface yet.

46
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,610
This is because we don't provide a UI,
just service.

47
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:11,038
Let's go to the home screen on the
emulator and find the media simulator.

48
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,652
Let's go to the list of apps and you can
see here there's a media simulator, so

49
00:02:14,652 --> 00:02:15,986
click the icon to launch it.

50
00:02:15,986 --> 00:02:18,415
You'll notice that the app
needs to run in landscape mode.

51
00:02:18,415 --> 00:02:19,885
So rotate the emulator.

52
00:02:19,885 --> 00:02:22,108
Typically, you can press Ctrl + F11 or

53
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:25,295
Ctrl + Fn + F11 to make
this happen like so.

54
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:27,355
Now, you can select your
media app from the list.

55
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,715
There may be others installed
on the phone as well.

56
00:02:29,715 --> 00:02:32,682
Here's their app, click on it,
and as you can see here,

57
00:02:32,682 --> 00:02:35,902
the songs we had coded into
the sample are available here and

58
00:02:35,902 --> 00:02:38,152
we can select one to
start playing it back.

59
00:02:38,152 --> 00:02:40,202
Voila, music!

60
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:44,302
We now have built a super simple Android
media application, congratulations!
