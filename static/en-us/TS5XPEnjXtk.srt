to a chapter from my textbook,

00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,460

A link to purchase it at a discount
is in the instructor's notes.

00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,410
I also strongly suggest you
subscribe to E-Health Beat,

00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:20,760
a free, daily e-newsletter published
by the California Health Foundation.

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,380
Just reviewing it each day will give you
a good understanding of what's happening

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,470
in health care and health informatics.

8
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,250
There are also some other suggested
blogs and newsletters I recommend you

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:36,080
refer or subscribe to, in order to
enrich your learning experience.

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,820
You can find this
information in the text or

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,430
in the instructor's notes on this page.

12
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,960
And it will also be collected
in the course materials page.

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,880
Now let's get started.
