00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Here is my solution. It's a fairly straightforward brute force search.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
First, I wrote a function that return if a number r is a primitive root.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
A loop through all the possible exponents to see if the result has been seen before in our set s.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If it has, we return False. If no repeats were found, we return True.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Using is<u>primitive</u>root, we then loop through all the possible options,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
checking if it's a primitive root and appending it to our list.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
When we've looped through all the possible options, we return our list.
