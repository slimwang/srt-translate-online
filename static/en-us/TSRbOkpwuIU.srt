00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,890
Investing in single founders is
something that most investors don't like

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,030
to do.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,620
They're used to investing in
teams of two's, or three, or

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:14,180
more because they believe that you
need multiple skills, market and

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,080
complementary skill set in order to
drive an early stage startup forward.

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,070
There are exceptions of course, and
it happens more than once or twice.

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,990
But for the large part, my big advice
I like to give entrepreneurs is find

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,770
a co-founder that you want
to go to war with, right,

9
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:35,250
that you want to actually do this
impossible thing called a startup.

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,480
Someone that compliments you,
that you really want to go with for

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,720
multiple years to come.
