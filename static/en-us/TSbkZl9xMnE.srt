Simplifying variables underneath a radical works the same way as it does for

2
00:00:03,882 --> 00:00:08,534
factors, or just numbers. We'll look at simplifying the cubed root of x to the

3
00:00:08,534 --> 00:00:12,882
fourth times y to the sixth. Keep in mind that these variables actually

4
00:00:12,882 --> 00:00:17,890
represent numbers, like x could equal 2 and y could be 3. Our rules for these

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,245
won't change, we'll still apply the product rule if we can, and we can only

6
00:00:21,245 --> 00:00:26,601
remove factors if they repeat three times. For example, we can split this up

7
00:00:26,601 --> 00:00:32,231
into the cube root of x times x times x times x. These four xs are the same as

8
00:00:32,231 --> 00:00:36,902
x to the fourth. Similarly, our second radical will have the cube root of y to

9
00:00:36,902 --> 00:00:41,128
the sixth. Since our x variable repeats three times, we you can pull one of

10
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:44,314
them out, we can also pull out one y from these three, and one y from these

11
00:00:44,314 --> 00:00:50,234
three. This x however is a little bit lonely, it doesn't have three of itself,

12
00:00:50,234 --> 00:00:56,110
so we leave it inside the cube root. So our final answer is x times y squared

13
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:01,400
time the cube root of x. So in order to simplify any radical we want to take

14
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,656
the radican and split it up into its factors. If a factor appears the same

15
00:01:06,656 --> 00:01:10,500
number of times as the index of the root, then that means we can pull one of it

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,895
out. That was why we could pull out one x, one y and one y. We multiply all

17
00:01:16,895 --> 00:01:20,738
those factors together and leave any single or lonely factors inside of the

18
00:01:20,738 --> 00:01:24,823
radical. This will give us our final answer.
