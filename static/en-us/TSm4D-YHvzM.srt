00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,467
Let's assume that to get a good grade, we need a good memory. That means that we

2
00:00:05,479 --> 00:00:10,909
have to do everything we can to boost our memory. Therefore, we might look at a

3
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:16,563
bunch of different factors that influence memory. If we're doing a real research

4
00:00:16,575 --> 00:00:21,983
study, we want to make sure that these factors really do positively influence

5
00:00:21,995 --> 00:00:27,835
memory. But we can't analyze the relationship between these and memory without

6
00:00:27,847 --> 00:00:33,595
having a clear definition and way of measuring memory. So, how would you measure

7
00:00:33,607 --> 00:00:39,005
memory? There is no right or wrong answer. The purpose of this is just to get

8
00:00:39,017 --> 00:00:39,935
you thinking.
