00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,443
>> The value at which the frequency is highest is called the mode. And this

2
00:00:04,443 --> 00:00:09,500
certainly works in describing the distribution. In the case of a histogram, the

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,214
mode would be this bin right here, and this bin right here. The most common

4
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:19,113
value is the mode. And, in this case, we can't see individual values, but we can

5
00:00:19,113 --> 00:00:23,884
see that most of the values rest within this bin. So, the mode occurs here, and

6
00:00:23,884 --> 00:00:29,035
here. The value in the middle of the distribution is called the median. And this

7
00:00:29,035 --> 00:00:34,046
would also work. We'll go more into depth later. And finally, the average is a

8
00:00:34,046 --> 00:00:39,357
statistic that rests at a specific spot in the middle of the distribution. We're

9
00:00:39,357 --> 00:00:44,702
going to elaborate on this in this lesson. The value where the frequency is the

10
00:00:44,702 --> 00:00:49,854
lowest, in this case, it's right here. And it looks to be about 72 or 75. And

11
00:00:49,854 --> 00:00:55,498
this most definitely would not represent the whole distribution where there are

12
00:00:55,498 --> 00:01:00,860
a lot of scores here, more towards 50. And the biggest value on the x-axis,

13
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:06,834
again, that's here at about 75. Here, probably the biggest value is somewhere

14
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:12,840
around 90. And that doesn't represent the whole distribution so let's ignore

15
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,250
these two. But we know that the mode, median, and average can all help describe

16
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:23,027
the distributions. They each have strengths and weaknesses, and we'll explore

17
00:01:23,027 --> 00:01:25,112
all of these throughout this lesson.
