00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now it's time once again for you to show your understanding of this forwards and backwards.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I've got a relatively simple grammar up here in the upper left,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
but it's a grammar that couldn't be captured by any regular expression so it can't be that bad.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
P goes to open P close or P goes to nothing.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You could imagine drawing the epsilon there.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Our input is the four character string open open close close.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I said before that we'd need to annotate each of our parsing states,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and I have eight of them shown here with information about which state they came from,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
what the from position was, what the starting position was.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What I'd like you to do is fill in each one of these blanks

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
with a single number corresponding to the chart position that this state conceptually starts at.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Another way to think about that is let's say that we're in a particular state like this one--

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
P goes to dot open P close.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
How many tokens must there have been beforehand for this to possibly make sense.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We know we're in chart position one, but here it looks as if there's nothing in our past.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 99:59:59,999
How man hidden things would there have to be in our past for this to work out?
