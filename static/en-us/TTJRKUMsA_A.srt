1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,490
In this lesson we will talk about
distributed file systems and

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:07,020
about some of the design decisions
that are available in this space.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,130
We will describe what are the specific
decisions made for NFS,

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,750
which is a popular example of
a distributed file system.

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,950
And we will also look
at a research paper,

6
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,870
Caching in
the Sprite Network File System.

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,940
This paper is useful because
it has a lot of information

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,470
why certain decisions were made
in the Sprite file system.

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,870
One thing you should have in mind is
that all of the discussion in this

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,049
lesson will focus on
distributed file systems.

11
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:34,700
The methods that we will
talk about generalize to

12
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,280
other types of distributed services.
