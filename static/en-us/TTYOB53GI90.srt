1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here is my result.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I construct an omega matrix of size 3 x 3, and initially I set the top left corner to 1.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Then the vector xi, I set very first value to init. Everything else is 0.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Now come the important additions for the first move and the second move.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Both times I do exactly what I told you before.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
For the two involved variables, I add a +1 on the main diagonal and a -1 off-diagonal.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Same over here.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Then I subtract move and add it 1 row later, and the same with move2 and move2 over here.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Look very carefully. This is exactly what I told you about.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm going to draw this graphically.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I begin with a matrix like this. I then add this guy and then this guy.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
As far as the vector is concerned, I start with this, add this guy, and finally this guy.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Then these two together are being combined down here

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
where I compute the inverse of omega multiplied with xi.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That gives me the vector of res, and res is being output using those "show" command

16
00:01:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and returned from the procedure.
