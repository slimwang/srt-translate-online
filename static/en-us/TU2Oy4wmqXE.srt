1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We now have two coins--one fair coin for which the probability of heads is 0.5,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and a loaded coin for which the probability of heads is 1.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This might be a coin where heads is on both sides.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We now pick a coin at random with 0.5 chance,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and we don't quite know which coin we've picked,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
but we do flip this coin, and we see "heads.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What is the probability that this is the loaded coin?

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We now flip this coin again (the same coin), and we see "heads" again for a second time.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
What is now the probability that this is the loaded coin?
