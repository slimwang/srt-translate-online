1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,990
As Moore put it out, correlation can help us decide

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:07,910
which variables are related. But even correlation coefficients can be deceptive

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,650
if you're not careful. Plotting your data is the best way

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,860
to help you understand it and it can lead you to

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:16,472
key insights. Let's consider another data set that comes with the

6
00:00:16,472 --> 00:00:20,410
alr3 package. You'll need to install this package first and then

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,870
make sure you load it. The data set that we're going to

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,680
load is called the Mitchell Data Set. The Mitchell Data Set

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,430
contains soil temperatures from Mitchell, Nebraska.

10
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,210
And they were collected by Kenneth

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,380
G Hubbard from 1976 to 1992. By working with this data set,

12
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,900
we'll see how correlation can be somewhat deceptive. So, for your first

13
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,560
task, I want you to create a scatter plot of temperature versus months.
