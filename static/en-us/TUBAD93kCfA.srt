00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Dave:] Can you tell us more about what does it mean for software to be opensource?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
[Asa Dotzler:] For software to be opensource it means a couple of things.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
First, it means that the actual underlying source code to the piece of software is freely available,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
that people can acquire that from a website or off of a DVD or in some other form

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and see the underlying source code that makes up that program.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But that's actually insufficient, because opensource also requires

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
that not only can people see it but they can do what they want with it.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
They can take that piece of software, make modifications to it,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
develop their own products based on top of that.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
There are different licenses that opensource software operates under

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
that have different requirements and responsibilities for those who take that source code

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and make modifications to it.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
At Mozilla with the Firefox browser, our license is called the Mozilla Public License,

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and it says you're free to take the source code to Firefox and go build your own browser with it.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You can do whatever you want to that source code and you can turn it into Walmart-Fox,

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
if you're Walmart and wanted to.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
There's no requirement that you pay us for that, that you have any involvement with Mozilla.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
But if you make changes that improve the software that you got from Mozilla,

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
you have to return those changes.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
If you take a feature and you make it faster or you add a new feature,

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
making the browser more capable,

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
you're free to ship that and under your own brand for whatever your own business model is,

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
but you have to return those changes.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This allows Mozilla to take the work that you've done, reincorporate it into Firefox

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and ship a new version that's as good as the version you shipped.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Different licenses behave in different ways.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Our license is pretty generous in that it says you can take our product

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and combine it with other products,

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and you don't have to disclose any of your proprietary information.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You only have to return to the Mozilla Project the pieces of our code that you altered.
