00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,030
The next type of analysis
we'll discuss is aggregation.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,410
This method simply means calculating
a value across a group or

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,130
dimension and
is commonly used in data analysis.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,420
For example,
you may want to aggregate sales data for

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,180
a sales person by month, adding all
the sales closed for each month.

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,190
Then, you may want to
aggregate across dimensions,

7
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,330
such as sales by month
per sales territory.

8
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,510
In this scenario, you could calculate
the sales per month for each sales

9
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:33,010
person, and then add the sales per month
for all salespeople in the region.

10
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,810
Aggregation is often done in
reporting to be able to slice and

11
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:42,330
dice information, to help managers
make decision and view performance.

12
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:47,080
For example, you may start with the
total sales per year during an analysis.

13
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,340
You can refine this to sales per
quarter, then later specify a region or

14
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,490
a particular sales person.
