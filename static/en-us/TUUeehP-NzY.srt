1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,300
Now we consider what our approximation
algorithm might have returned.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,040
Recall that the optimum value for
a Hamiltonian cycle is 6.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,970
The approximation algorithm begins
by building a minimum spanning

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,280
tree for the graph.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,800
Perhaps it chooses a star, like so.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,600
Then, preferring lowest index vertices,

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,717
a depth first traversal
would produce this cycle.

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,650
First, we go from 1 to 2.

9
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,910
Then the next step would
take us back to 1.

10
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,280
So we skip that and go to 3.

11
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,320
The next step would take us back to 1.

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,230
So we skip that and go to 4.

13
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,510
And so on and so
forth until the cycle is completed.

14
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:39,860
Notice that every edge followed in this
cycle is a red one, except the first and

15
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:40,960
the last.

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,010
Hence, the cost is two time six
minus two for a total of ten.

17
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,180
The ration then is ten over six,
but there wasn't

18
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,050
anything special about the fact that
we were using six vertices here.

19
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,010
We can form an analogous graph for
any n, but

20
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,500
in the lighter edges
be the union of a star

21
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,590
in a cycle around the non-center
vertices, all other edges can be heavy.

22
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,590
My question to you then is how bad does
the approximation algorithm get for

23
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,220
100 vertices?

24
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,740
Give your answer in this box.

25
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,650
Remember that the lighter edges
are the ones that go from the center

26
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,270
out to the perimeter plus the cycle
of edges around the perimeter.
