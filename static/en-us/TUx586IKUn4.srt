00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,265
My sincere congratulations to you. You've just finished working through one of

2
00:00:04,265 --> 00:00:08,500
the most difficult areas of interactive 3-D graphics. Between transforms and

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,635
materials, you've learned two critical elements of the field. You can create and

4
00:00:12,635 --> 00:00:16,426
display 3-D objects in your own virtual worlds. I think of this point in the

5
00:00:16,426 --> 00:00:19,808
course as the top of the roller coaster ride. That slow part where you come to

6
00:00:19,808 --> 00:00:24,160
the top of the rise and the tracks ahead come into view. With these basics down

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,700
we can now explore areas that will let you create even richer scenes and

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,013
applications. It's going to be a wild ride.
