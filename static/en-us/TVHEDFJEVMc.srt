00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,150
Just like we did for the hero of
Icicles, add in the ability for

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,890
GigaGal to move left and
right based on arrow key input.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,720
Check out the to-do's
in the course code,

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,710
to first add some constants that
define how fast GigaGal moves.

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,570
Then add onto her update method,
so that you can detect left and

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,210
right key presses and
actually move GigaGal back and forth.
