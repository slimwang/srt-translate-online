00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,117
What is the P value? We can't use the T table. We can use the T table for an

2
00:00:01,117 --> 00:00:03,206
interval estimate for our P value but we can't use it to find the exact P

3
00:00:03,206 --> 00:00:15,544
value. Since our sample has 8 values, we have 7 degrees of freedom. And out T

4
00:00:15,544 --> 00:00:22,629
statistic is in between 0.896 and 1.119. That means the upper tail of our P

5
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:29,778
value would be between 0.15 and 0.20. And so, at the lower tail of our p value

6
00:00:29,778 --> 00:00:35,756
which means that our total p value would be between 0.3 0.15 plus 0.15, and

7
00:00:35,756 --> 00:00:43,960
0.4. 0.2 plus 0.2. But we don't need to be able to do it by hand or with a

8
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,396
table. Because these days, we can use software. There's a website called graph

9
00:00:48,396 --> 00:00:53,230
pad. The link is below. And use that to calculate what this p value is, and you

10
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:58,101
should find that it's between 0.3 and 0.4. Navigate to statistical

11
00:00:58,101 --> 00:01:02,188
distributions and interpreting p-values, and then based on the fact that we're

12
00:01:02,188 --> 00:01:08,670
doing a two-tailed test, and we know our t-test statistic, figure out the rest.

13
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,818
What did you get for the two-tailed p value? Is this statistically significant,

14
00:01:12,818 --> 00:01:17,844
or not statistically significant? And that's because of which of these options.

15
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:20,453
Therefore, what's our decision?
