1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,620
All right, it's your turn now.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,700
You're going to add Parallax Scrolling
at half the primary scroll

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,090
speed to the landscape phone view.

4
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,830
It's going to look something like that.

5
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:13,220
In layout-land/fragment_main.xml you're
going to rename appbar to parallax_bar,

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,980
just like I did in this little lecture.

7
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,240
And then in ForecastFragment you're
going to add an onScrollListener to our

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:19,929
Recyclerview.

9
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,330
And then in the onScrollListener,
you're going to change the translation

10
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,440
y of the parallax bar in
response to changes in scrolling.

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,840
Now, we're scrolling at half speed, so

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,160
you'll want to change the translation
by half of the scroll deltas.

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,030
And of course, you'll want to make
sure that you limit the deltas to

14
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,830
approximately the negative
height of your view.

15
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,370
Finally clear all your onScroll
Listeners in onDestroy, very easy to do.
