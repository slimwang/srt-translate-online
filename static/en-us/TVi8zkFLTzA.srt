00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,720
The lowest common denominator for these three fractions would be p minus 1 times

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:11,156
p minus 2 times p plus 3, fantastic work for finding that one. First we factor

3
00:00:11,156 --> 00:00:16,239
this denominator to p minus 2 times p minus 1, we find factors of 2 that sum to

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:21,455
negative 3. For our second denominator, we find factors of negative 6 that sum

5
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:25,921
to positive 2, which are positive 3 and negative 2. Once our denominators have

6
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:30,660
been factored, we're ready to use our factor tree. So we have p minus 1 times p

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,273
minus 2 times p plus 3. This is our lowest common denominator.
