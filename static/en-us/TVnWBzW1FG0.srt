Thanks for working on that problem, I hope you enjoyed having a little space to

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,353
experiment. That's really what I love most about coding. That moment when you

3
00:00:06,353 --> 00:00:09,600
realize you understand enough that you can start to design your own challenges.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,543
And just try it out. In the next lesson, we'll start talking about how to

5
00:00:12,543 --> 00:00:16,783
structure your code from scratch. And create packages. So you can share your

6
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:20,098
code more easily. I think it will go a long way towards freeing you from the

7
00:00:20,098 --> 00:00:24,990
Udacity IDE. So you can start coding projects that you invent yourself, and not

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,080
just the ones that we set up for you. See you after the problem sets.
