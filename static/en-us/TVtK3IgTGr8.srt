00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,060
Let's take a look at what we've done inside a redraw meme.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,430
First things first, we need to draw the image.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,270
We check to see if the image exists by making sure it's not null, and

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:13,460
then we use context.draw image to draw the image inside the canvas.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,329
Then we start creating our text attributes.

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:20,780
Just like before, we set a font, we align it to center, we set the strokes to

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,840
black with a width of three, and then set the fills to white.

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,390
At this point,

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,790
we could start drawing text, which is exactly what we start doing here.

10
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,880
We want to make sure we have a top line and

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,640
if we do, we draw the fill text first and then the stroke text.

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,110
Notice that we're using the same canvas.width over two trick that we did before.

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,360
This makes sure that the text shows up at the center of the Then we

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,980
do the same thing with the bottom text.

15
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,840
The only difference between the top text and the bottom text is the y position.

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,570
Here we have y position at 40 pixels which is towards the top.

17
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,820
And then for the y position at the bottom, we're going to select the canvas

18
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,480
height and then just subtract 20 pixels from it.

19
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,360
Remember, the canvas height here is going to be a big number, but

20
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,060
the y coordinates get bigger the farther down you go.

21
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,160
So this makes sense.

22
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,770
This makes us 20 pixels above the bottom of the canvas.

23
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,360
And with that, we should be good to go.

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,360
Let's take a look.

25
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,470
Okay, I've got the meme generator over here.

26
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:13,570
Let's go ahead and open a file.

27
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,890
And I've got myself as the background.

28
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,360
I'll set the top text to CAM BE LIKE.

29
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,940
And let's say the bottom text is going to say, I don't know, CANVAS IS AWESOME.

30
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,330
Let's go ahead and hit save, and see if that works.

31
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,000
And yeah, we've got our image to save.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,260
I will right click, save image as, and put it on the desktop.

33
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,950
And with that, we've got our simple meme maker.
