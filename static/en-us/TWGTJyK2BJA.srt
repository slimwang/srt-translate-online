00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,440
To understand semantic networks as a knowledge representation,

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,370
let us take an example. This is an example that we saw in a previous lesson.

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,800
This is A is to B as C is to D, and we have to pick one of the six choices at

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,480
the bottom that will go in D. How will we represent our knowledge of A,

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,700
B, C and the six choices at the bottom? Let us begin with A and B.

6
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,940
We'll try to build semantics networks that can represent our knowledge of A and

7
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,940
B. Inside A is a circle, I'll label it x. Also inside

8
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,950
x is a diamond, I'll label it y. Here is a black dot, I'll label it z.

9
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:48,230
We can similarly label the objects in B. So inside A are three objects, x, y,

10
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:53,200
and z. So the first thing we need to do in order to build a semantic network for

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,420
representing our knowledge of A is to represent the object. So I have the object

12
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,110
x, the object y, the object z, standing for the circle, the diamond and

13
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:07,750
the black dot. Now that we have represented the objects in A, we want to

14
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:12,900
represent the relationships between these objects. So I have the objects x, y,

15
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,850
z, and we'll try to represent the relationship between them by having

16
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:23,490
links between the nodes representing the objects. These links can be labeled. So

17
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:30,560
I may say that y is inside x because that is the relationship in the image A.

18
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,400
Similarly I may say that z is above y because z is above y in the image A.

19
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:45,280
I may also say that z is above x because z is above x in image A. In this way,

20
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,790
a semantic network representation of the image A captures both the objects and

21
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:54,100
the relationship between the objects. We can do exactly the same thing for

22
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,940
the image B. The objects and the relationships between them,

23
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:05,120
y is above x. Now that we have represented our knowledge of image A and

24
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:11,000
our knowledge of image B we want to capture somehow the knowledge of

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,310
the transformation from A to B because recall, A is to B as C is to D.

26
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,920
So we want to capture the relationship between A and B. The transformation from

27
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,860
A to B. To do that, to capture the transformation from A to B,

28
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,930
we'll start building links between the objects in A and the objects in B.

29
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:35,560
Now, for x and y they are straightforward for z, but there is no z in b.

30
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,840
So we'll have a dummy node here in b and we will see how we can label the link

31
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:46,200
here so that we can capture the idea that z doesn't occur in B. So we might say

32
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:52,450
that x is unchanged because x the circle here is the same as the circle here.

33
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:56,260
Y on the other hand has expanded. It was a small diamond here and

34
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,770
it's a much bigger diamond there. Z, the black dot, has disappeared all

35
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:05,190
together, so, we have, let's say, it's deleted, it's not there at B at all.

36
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:10,100
I hope you can see from this example how we constructed a semantic network for

37
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,870
the relationship between the images A and B. There were three parts to it.

38
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:19,400
The first part dealt with the objects in A and the object in B.

39
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,990
The second dealt with the relationships between the objects in A and

40
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,040
the relationship with the objects in B.

41
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,690
The third party dealt with the relationships between the objects in A and

42
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,045
the relationships between the objects in B. In principle, we can

43
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:37,090
construct semantic networks for much more complicated images, not just A and B.

44
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:41,520
Here is another example of a semantic network for another set of images.

45
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,490
Once again, we have the objects and the relationships. And then the relationship

46
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,290
between the objects in the first image and that in the second image.
