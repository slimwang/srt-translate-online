1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,559
One interesting therapeutic potential that you are conducting, one of your

2
00:00:03,559 --> 00:00:07,110
studies, is the use of psilocybin in the treatment of nicotine dependence which

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:12,458
seems kind of counterintuitive. Could you talk a little bit about that study?

4
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:18,010
>> Yes, yes. So back in the 1950s and 60s there, were several studies done

5
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:25,249
primarily with LSD and treatment of alcoholism. And those studies were done in

6
00:00:25,249 --> 00:00:30,109
a way that is very difficult to interpret the validity of their results,

7
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:33,546
according to our own.

8
00:00:33,546 --> 00:00:35,272
>> Their methodology?

9
00:00:35,272 --> 00:00:40,183
>> Partly methodology, partly how they handle the data. So, given the experience

10
00:00:40,183 --> 00:00:44,152
we had with patients at Johns Hopkins we thought we would put together an

11
00:00:44,152 --> 00:00:49,826
intervention to look at addictions. We picked cigarette smoking, because we

12
00:00:49,826 --> 00:00:54,310
though it was a interesting form of addiction. In some ways, it's a pure

13
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:58,654
addition. It's, it's unencumbered by the kind of social and physiological

14
00:00:58,654 --> 00:01:04,331
consequences you have with severe alcoholism, for instance. Or, or heroine

15
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:10,728
addiction or cocaine addiction. Yet it's, it's the most pernicious form of

16
00:01:10,728 --> 00:01:17,743
addiction that we have worldwide. And people who are dependent on tobacco, you

17
00:01:17,743 --> 00:01:23,650
can ask them. It's, it's not an easy drug to, to quit. So we've, we've mounted

18
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:28,910
a, a pilot study. We've enrolled about 15 people to date, and the results look

19
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:34,033
very promising. We don't have a control group, but the results we're seeing to

20
00:01:34,033 --> 00:01:37,939
date is that the great majority of our people are entirely abstinence from

21
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:43,684
cigarette smoking. So, how does this work? What? How does it, one single

22
00:01:43,684 --> 00:01:47,908
session or, in this case, two or three sessions with psilocybin get people to

23
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:53,714
quit smoking? Well, it's embedded, this psilocybin session is embedded in the

24
00:01:53,714 --> 00:02:00,318
context of a cognitive behavioral therapy for cigarette smoking cessation. So

25
00:02:00,318 --> 00:02:04,980
prior to the psilocybin session, people learn about cognitive behavioral

26
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,642
approaches for smoking, they end up charting the number of cigarettes they

27
00:02:09,642 --> 00:02:14,526
take, they rate their urges, their cravings, they note the situation under

28
00:02:14,526 --> 00:02:19,188
which they smoke, they look at the reflexive and kind of habitual pattern in

29
00:02:19,188 --> 00:02:28,785
which they reach for a cigarette. So we're introducing a level of mindfulness

30
00:02:28,785 --> 00:02:33,510
into their cigarette smoking that then when combined with this psilocybin

31
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:39,550
session. And for reasons we don't fully understand, it really result in people

32
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:45,735
being able to walk away from their addiction. What people will very often

33
00:02:45,735 --> 00:02:54,909
report is a transformed relationship to smoking. Before the psilocybin session

34
00:02:54,909 --> 00:03:00,733
smoking it held a saliency for them that was much larger than their ability to

35
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:06,922
cope with. They were addicted, they knew they were addicted, they couldn't stop

36
00:03:06,922 --> 00:03:13,596
their cravings, they were hooked. And with the expansive form of consciousness

37
00:03:13,596 --> 00:03:18,524
that can come about with psilocybin, and when the intentionality is brought

38
00:03:18,524 --> 00:03:23,452
into the session to really deeply look and heal people walk away from that

39
00:03:23,452 --> 00:03:32,240
session with this renewed sense of self efficacy. Realizing that their, their

40
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:37,600
autonomous beings that they can watch moods and cravings and habitual patterns

41
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:45,340
come up into their field of consciousness but they can choose not to act on it.

42
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,942
So, it's not a magic bullet. It doesn't take away the cravings. It doesn't take

43
00:03:49,942 --> 00:03:55,318
away the habitual tendency to maybe want a cigarette. But they can reframe it

44
00:03:55,318 --> 00:04:00,544
in a way that, for many of them, seems really quite magical. It's, like, oh,

45
00:04:00,544 --> 00:04:05,000
you know? It's, it's like Dorothy and the, and her shoes in the Wizard of Oz.

46
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,696
She didn't know she had been wearing them the whole time.

47
00:04:07,696 --> 00:04:08,384
>> Right, right.

48
00:04:08,384 --> 00:04:12,826
>> And, and it's that sense of efficacy that people come away with. We think,

49
00:04:12,826 --> 00:04:17,512
mechanistically, it might have to do with increased enhancement of executive

50
00:04:17,512 --> 00:04:25,900
function. That's kind of a catchphrase for a how we can organize our cognitions

51
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:33,530
and behaviors, you know, if in real time. So, that's what we have today. We're

52
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:39,484
ready to initiate a control clinical trial. It's a very interesting area.

53
00:04:39,484 --> 00:04:40,193
>> It is.

54
00:04:40,193 --> 00:04:45,850
>> And it won't be restricted of course, ultimately to nicotine. There's no reason

55
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:50,134
this couldn't be an approach for any addictive disorder, but more than that

56
00:04:50,134 --> 00:04:55,760
Probably any form of radical behavior change. So there, there are real

57
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,261
fascinating implications here.

58
00:04:58,261 --> 00:05:02,440
>> And these are small clinical trials being conducted around the United States?

59
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,112
>> Well, right now, all we have is this one pilot trial, and it's an uncontrolled

60
00:05:07,112 --> 00:05:14,300
pilot trial at Johns Hopkins. But the results are, are so promising, that they

61
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:19,305
really call for a controlled clinical trial, and what I suspect is that once we

62
00:05:19,305 --> 00:05:24,156
go ahead and report this kind of work, there'll be other, probably academic

63
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:32,340
sites will come in and start doing more research. But we actually need to do

64
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,695
the research, because these compounds have been so demonized, culturally, and

65
00:05:36,695 --> 00:05:42,486
within the medical and the treatment community. The first impulse is, this

66
00:05:42,486 --> 00:05:45,520
doesn't make any sense. It sounds crazy.

67
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,793
>> Right, right. Well, thank you so much, Roland Griffiths, for your time today.

68
00:05:48,793 --> 00:05:48,991
>> Yeah.

69
00:05:48,991 --> 00:05:49,953
>> We really appreciate it.
