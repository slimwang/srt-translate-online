00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,160
So think about these special occasions you really like to celebrate. New Years

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,168
Eve, your birthday or just going to a nice restaurant with your friends. So

3
00:00:09,168 --> 00:00:13,626
your food comes along, you know, maybe turkey, mashed potatoes, gravey. You eat

4
00:00:13,626 --> 00:00:20,565
it up, it's very good and you get full. Okay then dessert comes along. You know

5
00:00:20,565 --> 00:00:27,226
apple pie, pecan pie, ice cream, whatever. And all of a sudden you have room

6
00:00:27,226 --> 00:00:31,699
for that, so what's going on is your brain has, sends different signals, for

7
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:38,580
savory like the turkey and sweet like the pecan pie. So you maybe full for the

8
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,890
savory stuff but you still have room for that sweet pecan pie.
