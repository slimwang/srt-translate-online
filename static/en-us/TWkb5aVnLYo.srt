1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,200
When thinking about
creating a community,

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,086
I want you to think about why someone
would want to join your community.

3
00:00:07,086 --> 00:00:10,980
One of the reasons people join
communities is because they enjoy it.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,150
If people are internally motivated,
you'll see more long term,

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,450
sustainable relationships made.

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,910
There's also the goal of creating
a community that has a good balance

7
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,830
between people enjoying or
having fun in your community, but

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,520
also getting use out of it.

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,890
Let's hear from Amir and

10
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,980
Telly on other tips on how to
engage with your community.

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,998
>> So, a community is a group of people,
who share the same mission or

12
00:00:35,998 --> 00:00:40,480
passion and have the same goal,
want to achieve the same goal.

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,030
A community could be anything from,
a physical community.

14
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,664
People come and meet and talk about
something all the way to an online

15
00:00:47,664 --> 00:00:50,679
community, and
we see a lot of these happening lately.

16
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:54,805
So, first of all you need to understand
what is the need, what is the mission?

17
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:58,140
A community is a part,
is a group of the mission, so

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,100
if you have a mission that needs
a community, that needs the scale.

19
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,580
Then that's a good hint,
that you need a community.

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,090
It's also really, a way for
you to achieve something.

21
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,289
So think about,
what do I want to achieve?

22
00:01:11,289 --> 00:01:16,310
And if I can use other people's passion,
to get what I want to achieve.

23
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,080
Just know that it needs to
be a joint passion, right?

24
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,350
You need to work with them
towards a joined goal.

25
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,200
So, first of all,
you need to be very engaged with them.

26
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,870
They're volunteers.

27
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,040
They're passionate about what your
trying to solve, but you always need to

28
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,230
engage, be transparent, tell them
we found this bug, we're fixing it.

29
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,560
Make them feel that they
are part of the process.

30
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,470
In order to build a value for
your community,

31
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,830
you need to come up with three things,
which I think are very important for

32
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:45,910
every member of the community.

33
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:50,470
Growth, fun, and belonging.

34
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:55,292
So, if you analyze what
are the aspects of your community that

35
00:01:55,292 --> 00:01:59,849
contribute to the members growth,
fun, and belonging.

36
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:04,363
These are the three things that will
create the value for your members and

37
00:02:04,363 --> 00:02:05,400
maintain them.

38
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,400
Not every start up needs
an online community.

39
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:13,530
Many startups are just about
a user interaction, right?

40
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,890
Mint is an amazing app, but
it doesn't need a community.

41
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,400
It has interaction,
which is simple and intuitive, and

42
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,960
does not require community.

43
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,370
There are other startups,

44
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:29,050
lately that really rely on
a community to be successful.

45
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,490
Sometimes they rely on two
communities to be successful, and

46
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,700
it's really important, and
it provides you with a scale,

47
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,670
that you don't have if you
don't have this community.

48
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:44,075
So a lot of the startups need social
interaction, a lot of the market places.

49
00:02:44,075 --> 00:02:47,450
These are types of start ups
that really need a community.

50
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,830
When you want to seed interaction,

51
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:55,390
when you have interaction imbedded into
the app that requires a lot of people.

52
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,210
So good examples for companies
that need community are Uber for

53
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,030
example, a community of drivers.

54
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,140
A Messenger would be a good example.

55
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,878
Google, of course we have a big
community of world developer community.

56
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:14,080
A place where you have a marketplace
would be a good example.

57
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,600
So a good way to get people to join
a community is have a good goal.

58
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,800
If the goal would be I
want to make money for

59
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,640
myself, that's probably not a goal where
you can get a lot of people to join you.

60
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,160
Right?

61
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,714
But getting people educated all
over the world is an amazing goal.

62
00:03:28,714 --> 00:03:31,442
And you can really get people inspired.

63
00:03:31,442 --> 00:03:35,060
And very engaged with this type of goal.

64
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,097
A community of one person or
two people is probably boring, and

65
00:03:38,097 --> 00:03:39,601
it's not really a community.

66
00:03:39,601 --> 00:03:42,970
You need to have critical mass
in order to start a community.

67
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,724
There's a process called seeding,
where you have a call to action, or

68
00:03:47,724 --> 00:03:51,776
you hack into other communities
to seed your own community.

69
00:03:51,776 --> 00:03:52,790
So think of it.

70
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,300
There's many ways to create to
do the seeding of the community.

71
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,630
One of the things would be to go to
another community, and say hey guys,

72
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,630
we're opening a new community,
why don't you join us?

73
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:06,130
Another way is to go through,
social channels.

74
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,789
And talk about your passion,
about the mission and

75
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:12,094
get people excited about them.

76
00:04:12,094 --> 00:04:16,959
I've seen startups that just have a
coffee, and talked about certain topic.

77
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,130
Before they even started a community,
they just say hey guys if

78
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,820
your interested in this topic,
come to mission.

79
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,272
A street in San Francisco.

80
00:04:26,272 --> 00:04:28,570
Have some coffee with us and
we'll talk about this.

81
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:32,151
Once you get people excited and engaged,
you can create a online community or

82
00:04:32,151 --> 00:04:33,760
an offline community out of that.

83
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,970
The way to grow a community
from a small community or

84
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:42,960
a big community, is to think about
the value for the members, right?

85
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,810
How can, creating a bigger community
will add more value to the members?

86
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,080
Some people call it the K factor,
the virality.

87
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,301
You need to think about what
incentives are there, for

88
00:04:56,301 --> 00:05:00,166
people inside the community to
add more people to the community.

89
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,803
Right?
What is the incentive, what's in it for

90
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,452
them, to grow the community.

91
00:05:04,452 --> 00:05:07,176
Some communities don't
feel like growing, right?

92
00:05:07,176 --> 00:05:11,828
Some communities say hey I want to keep
my community size small because I know

93
00:05:11,828 --> 00:05:12,927
everybody here.

94
00:05:12,927 --> 00:05:14,691
And that could be amazing, right?

95
00:05:14,691 --> 00:05:16,977
A lot of our,
Google developer communities,

96
00:05:16,977 --> 00:05:18,742
are small because of that, right?

97
00:05:18,742 --> 00:05:22,945
They don't want ten thousand
people in which they don't know.

98
00:05:22,945 --> 00:05:26,359
But if you want to grow and
if you want to scale, you'll need to

99
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:30,376
build incentives, to get people
excited about growing the community.

100
00:05:30,376 --> 00:05:33,980
Okay, I think the key things with
running a good community is treating

101
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,150
your community well.

102
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:42,040
Being communicative transparent, having
a joint mission that is passionate for

103
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,140
you, and passionate for the community.

104
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,120
Keep fostering a community.

105
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,760
Make sure that you maintain the
community, that people don't drop off.

106
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,498
A big mistakes that I see startups do,
is they create a community but

107
00:05:54,498 --> 00:05:56,970
they don't invest in the community.

108
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,170
So I think investing in
the community is very important.

109
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,810
Take the fun very seriously.

110
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,010
Take the growth very seriously.

111
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,880
Take the belonging very seriously.

112
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,010
And always think of how
do I invest in these, and

113
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,880
how do I maintain my community.

114
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,860
A community is something
very precious and

115
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,390
if you don't invest in it, it will die.

116
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,340
And getting in the community
the second time,

117
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,970
is like getting someone to fall
in love with you the second time.

118
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,520
It’s really hard.

119
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,910
So, investment and continue and
maintain your community.

120
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,770
So, when I joined develop
relations on Google,

121
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,880
I was tasked to create a Google
developer communities.

122
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,880
These are communities of developers
that meets on a monthly or

123
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,280
quarterly basis to
talk about technology.

124
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,484
So the first thing I did was,
to source community leaders.

125
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:45,666
So I came, and I tried to find good
speakers, where people are passionate

126
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:49,730
about communities and just say,
hey, I'm starting this community.

127
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:56,310
The mission is to empower people through
technology, you want to join me?

128
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,430
Most of them said no.

129
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,620
Some of them said yes.

130
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,360
Those are those who wanted to
actually work with me, and

131
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,250
to create this community.

132
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,100
Join me, and we just had coffee, and

133
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,190
we talked about how do
we create the community?

134
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,640
So they started creating
their own community, but

135
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,350
the key was to maintain them, right?

136
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,780
To keep them passionate.

137
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:19,670
So every month I just went to the best
restaurant I could find in the area,

138
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,760
gathered them together and
just talked about cool stuff.

139
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,760
So I created a meta community,
of my community leaders.

140
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,172
They felt that they're empowered.

141
00:07:27,172 --> 00:07:30,669
They felt that they're amongst people
that are very passionate about

142
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:33,046
these things, and
they feel that they belong.

143
00:07:33,046 --> 00:07:36,279
So I actually managed to get
them excited about building

144
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:38,380
communities for me.

145
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,872
>> Yeah, so community management.

146
00:07:40,872 --> 00:07:47,960
I think, first and foremost it's about,
really understanding your users, and

147
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:53,030
what they need, and how to connect them
in ways that are meaningful to them.

148
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,540
So for us,

149
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,700
a lot of it was understanding that we
need the moderator in every community.

150
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,690
So, we went and did that.

151
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,626
Or understanding that we needed
very specific guidelines,

152
00:08:03,626 --> 00:08:07,481
because this is a community, it's about
sharing and people get confused about

153
00:08:07,481 --> 00:08:11,125
what is sharing, what isn't sharing,
what kind of things can you share?

154
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,400
And we kind of learned that
from our community and

155
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,630
from our users as they
were doing these things.

156
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,598
Sometimes we thought, oh, this is okay,
but then we got [INAUDIBLE] from

157
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,750
the community saying,
that actually offended me.

158
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,705
So you kind of learn it over time,
and you define the guidelines.

159
00:08:23,705 --> 00:08:27,105
And we realize that it's very necessary
to have community guidelines,

160
00:08:27,105 --> 00:08:29,063
that kind of explaining exactly why and.

161
00:08:29,063 --> 00:08:34,049
Once you have those, people will
respect that and abide by that.

162
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:37,058
So if they do something that's kind of
wrong and you kind of tell him,

163
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:40,380
oh it's on the guidelines, so they're
okay, and they're not offended by it.

164
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,979
The role of a moderator is just
making sure that everybody sticks by

165
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:47,965
the guidelines, so if they try to
pull something that's irrelevant, or

166
00:08:47,965 --> 00:08:50,561
not family friendly,
