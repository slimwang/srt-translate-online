1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,750
Another goal of the internet was distributed management.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,390
And there are many examples where distributed management

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,920
has played out. In addressing, we have routing

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,440
registries. For example, in North America we have

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,860
ARIN, or the American Registry for Internet Numbers.

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,230
And in Europe that same organization is called

7
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,390
RIPE. DNS allows each independent organization to manage

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,210
its own names and BGP allows each independently

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,000
operated network to configure its own routing policy.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,200
This means that no single entity needs to be

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,140
in charge and thus allows for organic growth

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,250
and stable management. On the downside, the internet has

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,730
no single owner or responsible party. And as

14
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,220
Clark said, some of the most significant problems with

15
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,860
the internet relate to the lack of sufficient tools

16
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,230
for distributed management, especially in the area of routing.

17
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,620
In such a network where management is distributed

18
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,300
it can often be very difficult to figure

19
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,650
out who or what is causing a problem

20
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,720
and worse, local action such as misconfiguration in a

21
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,930
single local network can have global effects. The

22
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,180
other three design goals that Clark discusses are

23
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,270
cost effectiveness, ease of attachment, and accountability. It's

24
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,400
reasonable to argue that the network design is fairly

25
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,590
cost effective as is and current trends are

26
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,920
aiming to exploit redundancy even more. For example, we

27
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,900
will learn about content distributions and distributed web

28
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,750
caches that aim to achieve better cost effectiveness for

29
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,880
distributing content to users. Ease of attachment was

30
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,290
arguably a huge success. IP is essentially plug and

31
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,100
play. Anything with a working IP stack can

32
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,570
connect to the internet. There's a really important lesson

33
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,610
here, which is that if one lowers the

34
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,100
barrier to innovation, people will get creative about

35
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,190
the types of devices and applications that can

36
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,225
run on top of the internet. Additionally, the narrow

37
00:01:52,225 --> 00:01:54,620
waist of IP allows the network to run

38
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,650
on a wide variety of physical layers ranging from

39
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,510
fiber, to cable, to wireless and so forth.

40
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:05,570
Accountability, or the ability to essentially bill, was mentioned

41
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:09,870
in some of the early papers on TCP/IP but it really wasn't prioritized.

42
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,150
Datagram networks can make accounting really

43
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,940
tricky. Phone networks had a much easier

44
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,440
time figuring out how to bill users. Payments and billing on the internet

45
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,710
are much less precise and we'll talk about these more in later lectures.
