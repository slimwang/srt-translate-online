1
00:00:04,936 --> 00:00:07,330
Why can we access array properties?

2
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,060
What's so special about arrays?

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,270
>> Arrays are actually special kinds of objects in JavaScript.

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,540
In fact, this is a nice transition.

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,747
Let's get into objects.

6
00:00:18,747 --> 00:00:22,093
>> Dude, dude, oh, dude.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,860
My hands are like handy.

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,860
>> Yes they are.

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,670
And while you're staring at your hands, I'm going to be a professional.

10
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,410
>> Okay.

11
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,670
What I mean is hands are like objects because,

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,240
they can hold information and do things.

13
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:38,830
>> True.

14
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,050
That is an analogy.

15
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,860
>> Objects in JavaScript can be declared and defined in a few different ways.

16
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,430
And all of them are different than the way Python defines classes and

17
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,670
objects, because there are no classes in JavaScript.

18
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,790
>> Let's repeat that.

19
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,630
JavaScript doesn't include classes, just objects.

20
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,350
There are ways to mimic classes in some respects, but

21
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,170
they're still just objects.

22
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,180
>> Right.

23
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,910
And this has some pretty interesting implications.

24
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,650
Check out the instructor notes for more information.

25
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,045
Let's start defining objects with object literal notation.

26
00:01:14,045 --> 00:01:18,440
In object literal notation, we'll use the same var syntax as we had before.

27
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,210
Then we'll give the object a name, then an equal sign.

28
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,220
And then the object is going to be defined within these curly braces.

29
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,700
These curly braces indicate that you're using object literal notation.

30
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,730
>> Let's define an object for my biography.

31
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,910
Then inside the curly braces,

32
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,930
we can define the object's properties using key value pairs.

33
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:44,660
I'll create a property called name and save my name as the value.

34
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:50,320
I'll do the same for age, this time using the number 32, my age.

35
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,860
>> Notice that we surrounded the properties with quotation marks,

36
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,120
because they're strings and there's a comma between the two key value pairs.

37
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,820
>> thanks.

38
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,410
But we can say whatever we want here.

39
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:07,360
We could even save an array in our object.

40
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,479
For instance, I want to add skills to my biography.

41
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,030
So let's take Cameron's skills from up here and

42
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,330
add it to my biography down here.

43
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,340
>> Is that because you're jealous?

44
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,700
>> Eh, maybe.

45
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,580
>> This is pretty straightforward.

46
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,790
To access these properties later, just as we did with the array length,

47
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,120
we simply add .property after the object name.

48
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,440
So if I wanted to appended James' name to the page, all I'd need to

49
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:38,120
do is access the bio.name property to pull James' name out of his bio object.

50
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,380
Then, I'll go ahead and append it to the page, come over here, hit refresh.

51
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,710
We can see that we've got James on our page now.

52
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:46,920
>> Nice.

53
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,090
Let's give our students a shot.
