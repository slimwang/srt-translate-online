Use a variable to store value that you need later. Every variable has a name.

00:00:06,232 --> 00:00:12,327
Here's how I like to think about variables. A parking space is a great example

3
00:00:12,327 --> 00:00:18,280
of a variable. That's where you can store a value here, the car, so that it's

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:27,440
there when you need it later. This particular variable has the name JO53. We

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,280
want to remember that name. And you need that name if you want to find your car

6
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,560
later. Now, look at this variable. That's a real Java variable. It also has a

7
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:43,750
name. And when you later want to use use the object. That when you use the name

8
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:49,649
again. So the name is one of the important aspects of declaring a variable.
