1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
My feeling was that this was the most promising.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I couldn't figure out how to fill in one digit at a time and make that work,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
because if we had something like the word EVEN, and we fill in 1 digit,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and we have, say, 8V8N, I didn't figure out how to make sense of that.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We have this mixture of some letters that are filled in and some that aren't.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
That didn't work for me.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This approach, one big formula--yes,

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
we could figure out a way to make one big formula,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
but the problem is I don't think that would be any faster,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
because it would take eval a long time because it would be a very long formula.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This approach I think is the most promising, so let's talk about it.
