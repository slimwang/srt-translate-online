00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
One of the really interesting developments about this class

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
is this whole customer development process.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It says you start with your business model canvas hypotheses,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and in fact, what you really do is you blow up the canvas,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and you actually post it to the wall, and you use yellow stickies,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
no pens or pencils allowed, because you are going to get most of them wrong.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
But you're going to make it visible, and you will actually begin

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
to construct your hypotheses, and the next thing you'll do

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
is look at them and go "Hey, there aren't any facts in this room."

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
"Let's get out of the building and talk to customers and partners, inventors,

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and we'll learn how to do this with some rigor, with a process."

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Not just randomly getting out, but actually design experiments,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
run tests, get data, and more importantly, get some insight,

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and the customer development process is kind of interesting.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The customer development process is actually

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
a 4-step process.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The first step is customer discovery.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This is where you construct your hypotheses,

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and you get out of the building and start testing your assumption

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
about whether other people have the same problem or need you think they have.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And then you're going to do customer validation and actually see

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
if your proposed solution actually matches

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
what you think the customer problem was.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This test between problem and solution and your features and customers

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
is actually sometimes called product market fit.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That's what you're out testing, and this is what we call

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
the search for the business model.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But now instead of randomly doing this by hiring and firing sales execs

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and trying to make numbers that really are just random guesses

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
we're actually going to have you get out as early as possible

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and test some of these primary assumptions.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
One of the interesting things on the bottom of this diagram

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
that we'll talk about is something called a pivot,

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and the pivot is what will save your job.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Once you find this repeatable and scalable business model

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
then you go into the execution phase of customer development,

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and that's about creating end user demand and scale

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
called customer creation and then building the organizations

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
to actually build your company for scale

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
by transitioning from customer development into a functional organization

41
00:02:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that's oriented for constant and rapid execution.
