00:00:00,055 --> 00:00:02,800
So let's dive in and talk about Parallel Optimization Patterns.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,396
Now in the supplentary material, you'll find pointers to a fantastic couple of papers by

3
00:00:07,396 --> 00:00:09,961
John Stratton and colleagues at the University of Illinois.

4
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:15,250
One is titled, "Optimization and Architecture Effects on GPU Computing and Workload Performance,"

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,580
and it was published in the Innovative Parallel Computing Conference in 2012.

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:26,251
A reworked version of that same basic paper was published later that year in IEEE Computer.

7
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:29,398
The Computer paper is a little shorter and more readable.

8
00:00:29,398 --> 00:00:33,530
Now, what they did is survey a whole bunch of highly optimized

9
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:38,037
parallel codes, paid attention to the patterns that emerged, and extracted 7

10
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:40,651
fundamental techniques that come up over and over again.

11
00:00:40,651 --> 00:00:43,371
And as you'll see, several of these techniques

12
00:00:43,371 --> 00:00:46,811
encapsulate or formalize lessons that we've already learned.

13
00:00:46,811 --> 00:00:48,764
So this will also be a good review of material that we've covered

14
00:00:48,764 --> 00:00:51,556
in Unit 2 and Unit 5, and along the way in the homeworks.

15
00:00:51,556 --> 00:00:55,164
Let's walk through the taxonomy of seven techniques that that they've come up with.
