1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The cosine outputs the ratio of 2 lengths

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
which means that the unit of measurement that the cosine returns is 1.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The cosine does not return meters or kilograms, it returns bare numbers.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So whatever is in front of that cosine determines the measurement unit of the result.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The result is not measured in days.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We can immediately reject these.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The result is measured in meters.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It can only be this one or that one.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The cosine and the sine range between -1 and +1.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
If you multiply by something x 10⁻⁹m,

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We would be dealing with very, very tiny lengths.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's not what we are into here.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It has to be the first one.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This is the radius of the orbit of the moon around the earth.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Let me do these in reverse order.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The radius of the orbit of the moon should not appear inside here.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This has to do with the period of the moon's orbit.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
How long does it take the moon to make one full orbit around earth?

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
27 days. It must not be the meters.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Which is also clear from the units.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
If we have meters in here, something has to cancel the meters.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We have to have an angle in here.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
If we speak of radians, again, something without measurements units.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
There must not be any measurement unit in here.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
If it were meters, these meters would have to cancel somehow.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
How would I do that?

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Not with time, obviously. Seconds or days don't cancel with meters.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Once we are here, it's clear that we have to use the division.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Days divided by days.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This gets rid of the measurement units.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We can't mulitiply by days, otherwise we would be getting days squared.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And the remaining choice, 2π x t.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Not this one. Not this one.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
If we let t grow by 27 days, 1 complete period,

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
the numerator increases by 2π x 27 days.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And this ratio increases by 2π x 27 days, divided by 27 days, by 2π.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
As t advances by one period, this ratio advances by 2π,

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
but that's precisely what we need for cosine and sine.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The angle has to advance by 2π 360°.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
One full revolution.
