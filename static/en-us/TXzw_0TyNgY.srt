00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,580
Alright, here's the quiz. So just to practice this

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,510
concept of what a version space is let's go

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:08,010
through an example. So here we go. Here's the

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,410
actual target concept C and, for all possible, it's, mapping

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,580
from two input bits to an output bit. And

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,770
the two inputs, X1 and X2 can take on all

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,010
four possible different values and the outputs are zero

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,710
One, one, zero, which is to say the XOR function,

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:26,870
okay so that's what we're trying to learn.

10
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:27,830
>> Okay.

11
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,100
>> But the training data that we have only has

12
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,020
a couple examples in it. It says well, one training example

13
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,960
says if the inputs are zero and zero. The output is

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,680
zero. And if the inputs are one and zero, the output

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,120
is one. And, ultimately, we're going to ask questions like,

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,650
well, what happens if the input is one and one? What's

17
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,080
the output? Now, since we know that it's XOR, we know

18
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,260
that the answer is zero but that's kind of using information unfairly.

19
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,900
So here's what we're going to do. Here's a set of, a hypothesis set. These are

20
00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:00,734
set of functions. That says, well the output could be just copy X1, negate

21
00:01:00,734 --> 00:01:06,700
X1, copy X2, negate X2, ignore the inputs in return true, ignore the

22
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,650
inputs in return false, take the OR of the inputs,

23
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,640
take the AND of the inputs, take the XOR of the

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,980
inputs and then return whether or not the inputs are

25
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,410
equal to each other. And, what I'd like you to do

26
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,710
is, some of these are in the version space and some of them are not for this

27
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:24,430
training set that I marked here. So, can you

28
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,080
check off which ones are in the version space?

29
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,320
>> I think I can.

30
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,590
>> Awesome. Let's do it.
