00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,640
A lot of Android Wear apps involve
scrolling side to side, and up and down.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,520
Grid View Pager handles
all this swiping for you.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,110
We also have Dots Page Indicator, which
shows the little dots that appear at

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,860
the bottom,
showing where the user is located.

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,270
These two classes do everything
with a consistent look and

6
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,490
feel, associated with
all Android Wear apps.

7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:20,430
To demonstrate this,

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,840
we're going to load the Grid View Pager
sample app on Android studio.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,900
So, we go to File > Import sample,
and look for Grid View Pager.

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,130
And load that up with the defaults.

11
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,890
Now, let's build it, and
install it to our device.

12
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:36,290
You can see here that we can
scroll around the cards, and

13
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,270
Grid View Pager takes care
of all of this for us.

14
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,180
For your quiz,
try out the sample yourself and

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,110
go through the MainActivity.java file to
see what code was used to generate this.
