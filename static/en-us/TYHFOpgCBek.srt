1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,839
If I had to guess, which you are kind of making me

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,270
do, I would say, well, for one thing, the number of parameters is

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,260
infinite. Right? Because if it's some convex polygon, and we're not putting any

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,760
bound on the number of sides on that polygon, then to specify it,

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,570
you have to give what the points are for each of the vertices

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,240
and the, you know, as the number of sides grows, the number of

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,760
parameters grows. So it's, it's unbounded. So it could be that the vc

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,380
dimensions is going to end up being unbounded but they do seem you know

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,450
at the limit they turn into circles and circles ended up being

10
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,850
a vc dimensions of three so maybe, you know, maybe it's three.

11
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,890
>> Maybe. So, so actually you, you, you've really sort of stumbled on

12
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,890
the right answer there, or maybe not so stumbled, on, on to the answer

13
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:44,480
there. So, in the limit, convex polygons become circles. Right? So

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,400
draw a circle for me, okay, now, lets sort of try to do this smartly, so put a

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,820
point on the edge of the circle, yeah I like how

16
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,220
you placed that, so pretty clearly you could come up with a

17
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,670
convex polygon that puts that either in or outside of it

18
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,640
right? Because you know, there is only one point, thats pretty easy.

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,030
>> Yeah, and the circle is kind of irrelevant.

20
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,710
>> Yeah the circle is kind of irrelevant, but its going to be

21
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,050
part of my little trick. So put another point on the circle somewhere.

22
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,745
And in the same way we've been doing it before with lines,

23
00:01:12,745 --> 00:01:15,440
you know, you can put both of the inside a convex polygon or

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,943
outside, you know, you can do all the labels. I think

25
00:01:17,943 --> 00:01:21,390
that's pretty easy to see. Now try three. So, the first thing

26
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,700
I want you to notice Michael, is that if I look at

27
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,300
those three points and I connected them together, what do I get?

28
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,320
>> Oh a triangle!

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,272
>> I get a triangle which is by the way, it starts with a C.

30
00:01:31,272 --> 00:01:33,860
>> [LAUGH] A sheep that has the

31
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,660
number of vertices equal to your favorite number.

32
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,868
>> That's right. But it's also a kind

33
00:01:37,868 --> 00:01:40,260
of geometric shape, it starts with an A.

34
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:40,542
>> It

35
00:01:40,542 --> 00:01:42,669
starts with a

36
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:43,292
>> It starts with AC?

37
00:01:43,292 --> 00:01:44,625
>> Appaplectic.

38
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:49,494
>> No it starts with a C. AC, Accenuated. No it starts with the letter C.

39
00:01:49,494 --> 00:01:50,470
>> Oh. Convex.

40
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,790
>> Yes. It's actually convex polygon. Try

41
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,670
putting a fourth point on there. And in

42
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,449
fact put the fifth point. And a sixth

43
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,660
point. Now, here's my question. We've put all

44
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,220
of these points on this circle, right? Now

45
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,970
let's just say it's a unicircle because it's

46
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,140
easy to think about it. So we put all these points on the circle. Do you

47
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,130
think we could shatter this with a convex polygon?

48
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,020
>> To shatter it? Right, to give it all possible labellings. Well,

49
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,760
let me draw the polygon. So each one being in or out.

50
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,560
>> Well, the thing is, the way you've drawn this polygon, all of them are

51
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,290
in. So, if you used this polygon, what would you be labeling those six points?

52
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,330
>> All positive.

53
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,720
>> All positive. What if I didn't want you to label one of

54
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,190
the points positive? Pick one of the points. Any point will do. So if

55
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,050
I don't want that to be in the polygon, what do I have to do?

56
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,430
>> Just push the, the corresponding vertex a little bit inside.

57
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,300
>> Right. And the easiest way to do that would be not to

58
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,960
have a vertex there at all but simply not to connect that point.

59
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,485
>> Oh. It's kind of like a, a rubber band art or

60
00:02:48,485 --> 00:02:51,239
string art if we just kind of pop that one out. [NOISE]

61
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,030
>> Right. So, ant point you'd, of those

62
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,390
six points you don't want to be labeled positive.

63
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,350
Just don't connect in as a part of your polygon.

64
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:03,050
>> I see. So, for any given pattern or subset, which

65
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,890
is what we need to be able to show, that, you know,

66
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,570
when we're shattering, we need to show that no matter what the

67
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:10,770
subset is, there's going to be some. Hypothesis that labels it appropriately.

68
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,730
You're saying, well just, you know, label the points as plus and

69
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:17,820
minus, and connect up the pluses. It's going to leave the minuses

70
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,180
outside because they're going to be on the edge of the circle. And

71
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,460
the pluses are all going to be in the polygon because they

72
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,250
touch the edges of it.

73
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,890
>> Yeah, because they are in fact the vertices. And in this

74
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,290
case you just think of the fact that if there's only two positive

75
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,910
points a line is a very, very simple convex polygon and if

76
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:35,890
there's only one point, then a point is a very simple convex polygon.

77
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,370
>> So the VC dimension is six!

78
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:41,480
>> No! So what happens if I had seven points? Could I do it?

79
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,410
>> So the VC dimension is seven!

80
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,640
>> What if I had eight points? Could I do it? It's the same trick.

81
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,550
We can make it eight.

82
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,240
>> So, can we make it nine?

83
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,890
>> No.

84
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:53,600
>> Yes.

85
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:53,850
>> Yes.

86
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,810
>> So, at what point can we stop?

87
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,970
>> When we run out of tape for the recording.

88
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:02,940
>> Exactly. So that means that the number of points that we can

89
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,120
capture this way is in fact unbounded. Which means the VC dimension is infinite.

90
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,440
>> Nice example.

91
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,610
>> Now, I do want to point out that

92
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,480
there's a, a teensy tiny little point here that,

93
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,930
that we sort of skipped over, but I can explain in

94
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:18,100
five seconds, which is we made polygons. We didn't actually argue that

95
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,350
they were convex, but they are convex, because they're all inside

96
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:27,110
the unit circle, and by construction, every, any polygon whose vertices are

97
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,990
on the unit circle will be convex. So it's just that's

98
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,520
why we needed a circle, that's why we were being clever with

99
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,860
it, but there you go. So we have a polygon that

100
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,610
we can always draw with those the right thing and because its

101
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,098
always subtended by it's circle it will be convex.

102
00:04:40,098 --> 00:04:43,582
So we have actually found a vc dimension that's infinite

103
00:04:43,582 --> 00:04:46,858
[CROSSTALK]. Or a hypothesis class that has a vc dimension.

104
00:04:46,858 --> 00:04:48,662
[CROSSTALK] It has to be infinite, yeah that's what I

105
00:04:48,662 --> 00:04:51,996
said. We have actually found the hypothesis class whose vc

106
00:04:51,996 --> 00:04:54,796
dimention is infinite and we came up with a proof

107
00:04:54,796 --> 00:04:57,596
where y would be that case, and nicely, I think

108
00:04:57,596 --> 00:05:02,360
very nicely connects with the observation you made earlier. That,

109
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,210
somehow, it connects with the number parameters. I think it's kind of

110
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,900
cool. I mean, you, you, end up with a circle, not

111
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,950
having a very good VC dimension, a very high VC dimension,

112
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,550
but convex polygons, which somehow seem not to be as cool

113
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,949
as circles, are in fact, in fact have infinite VC dimension.

114
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,195
Okay so there you go so we've done some practice of

115
00:05:22,195 --> 00:05:24,760
VC dimensions. So you've given me all this VC dimension stuff,

116
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,450
I agree that it's cool Michael, but what does it have to

117
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,670
do with, what we started out this conversation with? How does that

118
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:35,670
answer my question about the natural log of an infinite hypothesis space?
