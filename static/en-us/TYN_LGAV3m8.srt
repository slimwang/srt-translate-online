When you adjust the bin width, and here the bin

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,460
width is set to one, you really see these dramatic

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,530
patterns, these tall vertical lines. This is because when you

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,570
say, how many people do you think saw this post, people

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:16,890
typically say, oh, 10, 20, 50, 100. People guess these

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,510
regular numbers, and they don't tend to guess Numbers in

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,170
between. So this really helped me get a feel for

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,860
how big people thought their audience size was. The most common

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:30,880
guess was I think 20 with 50 and 100 close behind. In most

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,850
cases though, this was only about a quarter the size of the actual audience.
