1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,250
Let's look into whether debt
financing your business is the right

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:03,950
option for you.

3
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,670
We'll first define debt financing,
then hear about the benefits and

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,690
downsides of choosing this option.

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,910
So first, what is it?

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,760
Debt financing is basically any form of
loan you could get to help start your

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,650
business.

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,420
Banks, lenders, or

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,440
any other source of income that you
need to pay back is all a form of debt.

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,130
When using debt financing as an option,
the main thing to consider is that

11
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,080
you'll be paying back the loans you
get over an extended period of time.

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,380
Each payment will include
a principal plus interest.

13
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,090
The principal payment is the amount
that will go towards paying

14
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,600
the original loan amount.

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,320
The interest charge will vary
depending on the loan, but

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,430
this is the amount you owe on top of
the principal payment as a fee for

17
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,690
borrowing money from your lender.

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,970
There are a few benefits and downsides
to be aware of before considering

19
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,840
debt financing for your business.

20
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,980
So first, what are some of the benefits?

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,860
Let's overview three of them,
ownership, taxes, and interest rates.

22
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:03,250
First ownership, when borrowing money
from a bank or any other lender for

23
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,870
your business, you have the same
agreement as with any other loan.

24
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,080
You're agreeing to make your
payments on time, and that's it.

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,910
From there, you can make whatever
decisions you want about your business,

26
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,690
and the lender stays out of the way.

27
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,240
This lets you get the money you need,

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,501
while maintaining full
ownership of your business.

29
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:20,520
Next, taxes.

30
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,110
When you get a loan for your business,

31
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,900
the payments you make are considered
tax deductible business expenses.

32
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,220
Tax laws vary widely based
on where you live and

33
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,780
may also be impacted by where you
choose to incorporate your business.

34
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,860
This is a great way to minimize
the cost of any loan you accept.

35
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,270
Just be sure to diligently
track your expenses or

36
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,530
get an accountant to make sure you're
getting the returns you should be.

37
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,100
And finally, you can get lower interest
rates for your business loans.

38
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,990
Look through any options you may have,
and choose the one that's best for

39
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:47,860
your business.

40
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,780
This is a big decision.

41
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,940
This can get pretty complicated, so
I suggest you consult with an accountant

42
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,360
before making any major decisions
like this for your startup.

43
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,230
While there are some benefits to
debt financing, it's important to

44
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:03,090
understand some of the potential
downsides to choosing this option.

45
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,760
Let's overview three major downsides,
repayment, unaffordable rates, and

46
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,250
credit rating.

47
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:14,120
First, repayment, when you take a loan,
you don't have to give up any control,

48
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,570
but you will need to continue making
payments, possibly for a very long time.

49
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,840
If your business doesn't work out, and
you aren't making profits to help make

50
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,630
these payments,
your lender still wants their money.

51
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,980
Next, unaffordable rates,

52
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,610
after considering your tax
deductions and discounts,

53
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,620
you might still be getting a pretty
high interest rate from your lender.

54
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,390
It's tough enough to run a business
without having to worry about making

55
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,840
an extra 20% interest on
top of your other expenses.

56
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,710
And finally,
be careful about your credit rating.

57
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:45,690
If you choose to take out a personal
loan, it may affect your credit score.

58
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,320
Having extra marks on your credit score
makes you a bigger risk to your lender,

59
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,500
and you'll end up paying for
that at even higher interest rates.

60
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,960
One option to overcome this downside
is to obtain a business loan.

61
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,560
It is more difficult due
to logistical issues, but

62
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,880
the advantage is that it won't
affect your personal credit score.

63
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,210
While debt financing is possible,
it's a really tough way to go and

64
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:08,460
could be pretty devastating if
things don't go according to plan.

65
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:12,050
It's best to validate the success of
your product by seeking investment or

66
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:15,900
by operating a business with personal
expenses you can afford to lose.

67
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,540
If you decide debt
financing is right for

68
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,510
you, be very careful about how you plan
your business and do plenty of research.
