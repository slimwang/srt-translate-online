1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:06,610
To prevent unauthorized use of a device,
a user can use passcode or touch ID.

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,510
Touch ID is the fingerprint
sensing system

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,710
that makes secure access to
the device faster and easier.

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,540
That is,
it provides a degree of convenience.

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,900
By setting up a device passcode,

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,340
the user automatically
enables data protection.

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:27,710
iOS supports four digit and
arbitrary length alphanumeric passcodes.

8
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,260
To further discourage brute
force passcode attacks,

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,420
the iOS interface enforces
escalating time delays

10
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,970
after the entry of an invalid
passcode at the last screen.

11
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,720
Users can choose to have
the device automatically waived if

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,950
the passcode is entered incorrectly
after ten consecutive attempts.
