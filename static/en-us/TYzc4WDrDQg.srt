1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,300
Whenever we query the database, we get
a cursor back that contains columns.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,550
Each column has an integer
index assigned to it.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,730
Up until now,
we've had to call getColumnIndex for

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,180
each column in order to get this index.

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,129
But, there is a way to avoid doing that.

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,300
We can create a projection which is
just an array of the columns we want to

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,710
return in our cursor.

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,560
This is more efficient because we
are only fetching the data from

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,480
the database that we need to use and

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,290
since the database always returns
the columns in the order we specify,

11
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:36,030
we can rely on the indices matching
the order from our projection.

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,600
So we can then just use these indices
to get information from our cursor.

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,910
One minor note.

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,620
Since we are doing a join on our
weather with location queries,

15
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:50,510
we have to specify which ID we want
explicitly in our projection by adding

16
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:55,140
the table name followed by a dot before
the column name, as in this example.
