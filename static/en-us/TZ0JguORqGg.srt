00:00:00,147 --> 00:00:03,219
So far we've had a stationary
point of view while GigaGal

2
00:00:03,219 --> 00:00:04,628
moves around the screen.

3
00:00:04,628 --> 00:00:07,283
That puts some pretty severe
limits on our level design though,

4
00:00:07,283 --> 00:00:10,201
given that we only have one screen's
worth of platforms to work with.

5
00:00:10,201 --> 00:00:14,230
Let's fix that by allowing the camera
to follow GigaGal around the screen.

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,154
While we're at it, we'll also remove the
floor at the bottom of the screen and

7
00:00:18,154 --> 00:00:20,360
detect when GigaGal has
fallen to her doom.

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,443
Finally, while the chase camera is great
for debug purposes, it'd sure be useful

9
00:00:24,443 --> 00:00:27,962
to be able to move the camera
independently from GigaGal's position.

10
00:00:27,962 --> 00:00:30,280
So we'll add in some debug
camera controls as well.
