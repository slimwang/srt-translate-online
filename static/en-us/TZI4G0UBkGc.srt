1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,820
Now, lets actually build on this idea.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,502
And ask ourselves a series of questions.

3
00:00:05,502 --> 00:00:08,790
I'm going to make this into a quiz for
you to kind of think about also.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:14,290
Lets concentrate only on a point light
source, an idealized point light source.

5
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,550
So, lets say imagine I put a idealized
point light source in this set up here.

6
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,310
I have a lens based system and you know,

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,670
this is my camera and
I have three different set ups.

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,340
I'm going to show you one of them first.

9
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:28,140
Okay.

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,510
Of course focus point.

11
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,418
This is the image plane.

12
00:00:31,418 --> 00:00:32,900
This is where the location of this is.

13
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,210
This is an ideal camera and
the image is formed here.

14
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:39,180
Of course this pin single
point light source.

15
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,690
Would then of course, create a one
intensity pixel on my image sensor.

16
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,610
Right?

17
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,540
Focused and everything else.

18
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:54,120
The question for you now is if I move
this point source with the same camera.

19
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,800
And now I generate this thing, of course
on the image plane this is happening.

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,830
And, for the other one,
this is happening.

21
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:06,480
So, just to see if you've been paying
attention a little bit, simple stuff.

22
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,870
Just put in there is

23
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,570
what's happening in these types
of three different scenarios.

24
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:15,590
Put the number, one, two,
and three in the right box.

25
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,960
Which one of them is the near object,
and the output would be blurred.

26
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,970
Far object, the output would be blurred,
or in cases of, you know,

27
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,900
in focus image and
a perfect image would be generated.
