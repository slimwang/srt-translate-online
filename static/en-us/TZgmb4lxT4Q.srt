1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So let's go over the answer together.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
First, we're going to define a procedure, named: t_identifier.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It takes a token as an argument.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And the most important part of a token definition

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
is always the regular expression,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
declaring the class of strings that it matches.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We definitely want to allow lower case letters.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We also want to allow upper case letters.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And you can't start with an underscore or a digit, so this is all, for now.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
But after this, you could have more lower case letters,

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
more upper case letters--or underscores--

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and you can have as many of those as you want.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So there's our answer.
