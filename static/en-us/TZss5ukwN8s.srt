You've just worked with Sarah to write and understand several loops, and what

2
00:00:03,848 --> 00:00:08,326
will often happen to you that you have a loop that's really mysterious. And

3
00:00:08,326 --> 00:00:11,890
I'll give you an example. Here's some code that comes from a program that you

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,920
will improve in a bit to solve a common problem, namely to identify reverse

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,168
digits in a credit card. So let's see what this code does. What you always want

6
00:00:21,168 --> 00:00:24,860
to do is get out a sheet of paper. Here's my sheet of paper. You make a table.

7
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,890
One column for every variable. There's a variable n, there's a variable sum.

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,017
Now, it's always a good idea to take a marker, I like to use a paper clip to

9
00:00:32,017 --> 00:00:38,696
mark where we are. So, we set n to 365 and we set the sum to 0. Now, we enter

10
00:00:38,696 --> 00:00:43,216
the loop. Is n greater than 0? It sure is. We get to this statement. Now, we

11
00:00:43,216 --> 00:00:48,422
need to compute n modulo 10. That's the last digit of n. That would be 5. and

12
00:00:48,422 --> 00:00:53,556
now we have a new variable! We record it, we put in the 5. Moving on, sum is

13
00:00:53,556 --> 00:00:57,460
sum plus digit, n is n divided by 10, it's an integer division so we discard

14
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:03,944
the remainder. We move to the top of the loop. Is n greater than 0? Compute n

15
00:01:03,944 --> 00:01:10,502
MOD 10, 36 MOD 10 is 6, store that in the digit. Sum is sum plus digit. It is

16
00:01:10,502 --> 00:01:14,960
11. n is n, what, 10. Now, n is 3. Back to the top of the loop. Is 3 greater

17
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,288
than 0? It barely is, so we stay in the loop. Now, we need to take 3 MOD 10.

18
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:24,444
That's 3. Add it to the sum. Divide n by 10, that's an integer division, so now

19
00:01:24,444 --> 00:01:28,950
we get 0. 0 is no longer greater than 0. We fall out of the loop, and go to

20
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,650
this statement. And what are we printing? You're printing 14. Okay, well,

21
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:38,124
what's 14? Well, we've computed all of the digits of the number 365, 3, the 6,

22
00:01:38,124 --> 00:01:45,295
the 5, and we've computed their sum. 14 is the sum of the digits. And that's

23
00:01:45,295 --> 00:01:49,320
almost what one needs to do in order to verify a credit card. You'll see in

24
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,279
your next programming assignment what sum of digits you exactly need to do.
