1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,250
So now we know how to
stabilize the camera paths.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,120
Let's talk about how we can
re-synthesize some of them.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,500
So here again, we're trying to
do stabilization by cropping.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,520
Here is my window.

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,730
It's rotating, translating, and,
of course, scaling within this.

6
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,160
This is my output.

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,440
Of course, as we talked about,

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,490
this crop is constrained to
remain within the frame bounds.

9
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:19,030
So basically,

10
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:24,870
what we are doing is we're rendering
the image cell that actually is red box.

11
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:25,930
So, it's much simpler and

12
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,270
we don't have to worry about
doing any kind of interpolation.

13
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,469
We don't have to worry about any
kinds of filling in the gaps and

14
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:33,320
stuff like that.

15
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,624
Basically, what we're trying to do is,
we're applying a virtual crop and

16
00:00:37,624 --> 00:00:39,450
that results in a stable video.

17
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,280
And you can see on top the result.
