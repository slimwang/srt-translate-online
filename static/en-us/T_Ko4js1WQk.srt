1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
To answer this, let me make the scatter plot.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Here is my x-axis, which measures size.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Here is my y-axis, that depicts price.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If I graph the different sizes, I get those 6 data points over here.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
If I graph the different prices, I get the lines over here.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Sure enough, connecting those things get's me a data set that happens to be exactly linear.
