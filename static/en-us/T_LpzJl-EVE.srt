00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,090
Okay, so now it's time for a quiz.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:07,360
Here are four different groups of
database tables that might be used to

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,190
store information about
students in a school, and

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,210
their grades in several courses.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,090
I'd like you to check the check box for
each one of these that is normalized.

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:21,070
In the first group up here, we have one
table, this table has a student's name,

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,460
the teacher's name, and the grade.

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,330
In the second group,
we also have one table,

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:31,150
we have a student ID, student's name,
a course ID and the grade.

10
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,750
In the third group down here,

11
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,780
we have two tables, this one has
the student's ID and the student's name.

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,600
This one has the student's ID,
the course ID, and the grade.

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,780
And in the fourth group, we also have
two tables, we have student's ID,

14
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,040
student's name, student's birth date.

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,500
And then in the second table we have
the student's ID, the course ID,

16
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,490
and the grade.

17
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,950
So again,
I'd like you to check the check box for

18
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,460
which ever groups of tables
you think are normalized.
