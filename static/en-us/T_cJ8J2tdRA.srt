1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,890
Now we get to add a second
view controller to our app.

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,030
Adding another screen and
view controller to manage that screen

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:10,000
is just what we need to turn pitch
perfect into the app we want.

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,020
Open the library panel
here on the bottom right.

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,640
If you don't see the library panel,

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,350
make sure you have the objects
library button selected.

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,495
It's the third one from the left here.

8
00:00:20,495 --> 00:00:24,330
Drug our view controller onto
the storyboard, like this.

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,800
You may want to position
it as I have here

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,310
to the right of the records
view controller.

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,750
Let's make it clear we're
going to the new screen.

12
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,620
We can use our old trick of changing
the background color of the new

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,540
view controllers view so
that it's something other than white.

14
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,350
Here I've selected the view
controller and it's view.

15
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,680
You can see Storyboard has automatically
zoomed in to the second view controller.

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,500
With this view selected, I'm going to
change the background color to something

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,480
other than white, in my case, green.

18
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,070
Set it to whichever
color you prefer just so

19
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,380
that it's something other than white.

20
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,670
Now, we need to make storyboard
transition from our recording view

21
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:04,629
controller, which is just called view
controller, to our new view controller.

22
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:07,900
For now, what I want is to connect
it to the stop recording button.

23
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,860
First, select the stop recording
button here in the document outline.

24
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,000
Then you can hold down
the control key and

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,160
drag directly from it to
the new view controller.

26
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,200
Select the show segue.

27
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,770
You should see the new symbol with
the arrow connecting the two view

28
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,570
controllers, seen here.

29
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,580
This is called a segue.

30
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,390
Remember we previously wired
up the stop recording button

31
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,720
to the stop recording function,
VN IB action.

32
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,844
It means the stop recording
button is doing two things.

33
00:01:35,844 --> 00:01:38,807
It will call the code in our
recording view controller and

34
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:43,530
it will also cause the segue to occur,
moving us to the next view controller.

35
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,890
Now you may be thinking yourself,
wait a minute, where is the code for

36
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,220
that green view controller?

37
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,490
We never created any class.

38
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,650
You're correct.

39
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,520
Storyboard is using
the default UI view controller,

40
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,800
not a subclass that you wrote.

41
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,310
And there's just a plain UI view

42
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,370
of which we've changed
the background color.

43
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,380
Let's run this app and see.

44
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,280
If we click Tap to Record and

45
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,970
then Stop the Recording, we can see
that the Ui navigation controller

46
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,520
has transitioned us to the second
view controller, that's green.

47
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,780
Take a moment to notice the new bar,
called a navigation bar, and

48
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,220
the back button labeled Back.

49
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,550
This is a pre-built back button that
will return us to the previous view

50
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,950
controller, a sort of
breadcrumb if you will.

51
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,900
We have just scratched the surface
of UI Navigation Controller.

52
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,900
Because that is all we need for

53
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,370
now in order to build out
the pitch perfect app.

54
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,650
In UI fundamentals you're going to
learn about UI Navigation Controller

55
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,780
in much further detail.
