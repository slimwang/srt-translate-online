00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,106
Quick quiz to make sure we're all on the same page. Two quick questions.

2
00:00:03,106 --> 00:00:06,709
One, how many multiplications will this CPU code perform?

3
00:00:06,709 --> 00:00:12,232
And two, assuming that each multiplication operation takes 2 nanoseconds and everything else is free,

4
00:00:12,232 --> 00:00:15,482
how long will it take to compute the entire computation?
