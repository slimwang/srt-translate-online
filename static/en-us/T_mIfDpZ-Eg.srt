For the first question, each translation matrix represents a vector, a movement.

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,631
We can move an object by vector after vector and at the end of it, the object

3
00:00:08,631 --> 00:00:12,490
will have changed its location, nothing more. So we know the resulting

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:17,640
concatenated matrix is purely a translation matrix. So the answer is yes. With

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,031
scaling, each scale operation changes the dimensions of the object. Scale does

6
00:00:22,031 --> 00:00:26,850
not actually move or rotate the object. So a series of scales will result in a

7
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,503
scale matrix. So the answer here too is yes.
