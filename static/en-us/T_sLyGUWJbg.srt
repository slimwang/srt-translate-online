1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,810
We really want to have data that is
well randomized if we want to be

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,359
training on it sequentially.

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,670
It's important to, not present to a lot
of the those training methods, data

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,650
that has, you know, is all A's and then
all B's and then all C’s that really

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:22,198
breaks down the assumption that your
data is taking random steps over time. So

6
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:28,500
let's just randomize it once and that's
going to be enough for our purposes. In

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,140
some cases if you're running many many
parks over your data, you might want to

8
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:40,410
be randomized periodically your data to
improve the shuffling. It's not just a

9
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,718
theoretical concern, in practice bad
randomization really really can lead you

10
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:46,200
astray.

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,680
All right, and we’re panty raid so once
you randomize things.

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,160
Let's combine convince ourselves that
we've actually randomized things and we

13
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,419
haven't destroyed the data.

14
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:00,629
Finally we're going to save that data to
disk in the training data sets, training

15
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:05,670
labels, validation data set, validation
labels, test data sets and test labels.

16
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,979
The way python likes to store things is
using a little data structures like this

17
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:17,310
where you have a dictionary and you just
save the dictionary in to a file.
