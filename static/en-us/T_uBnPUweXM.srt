We need to multiple the 1/6 by 4/4. I know that if I do that I'll get 24 in my

2
00:00:05,012 --> 00:00:10,175
denominator and I'll get 4 in the numerator. My diagram of cake also supports

3
00:00:10,187 --> 00:00:15,450
this reasoning. If I thought about 1/6 of cake I can see that it;'s the same as

4
00:00:15,462 --> 00:00:20,250
4/24 of cake. For 3/8, we needs to multiply by 3 over 3. I know 8 times 3 is 24.

5
00:00:20,422 --> 00:00:26,140
And then 3 times 3 would give me 9. So I have 4/24 in strawberry icing, and 9/24

6
00:00:27,164 --> 00:00:31,621
in blueberry icing. Now I'm ready to subtract off my frosted pieces.
