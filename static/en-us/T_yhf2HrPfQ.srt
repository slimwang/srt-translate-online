Here in Atlanta we are home to
the world's busiest airport.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,980
They have 5 runways, and
2500 arrivals and departures per day.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,839
>> Have you ever wondered how
they schedule all those flights?

4
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:13,669

5
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:14,439
>> Wow.

6
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:15,359
It turns out,

7
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,699
this is an example of a classic AI
problem called constraint satisfaction.

00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:22,089
Let's start out with a simple
example as a challenge question.
