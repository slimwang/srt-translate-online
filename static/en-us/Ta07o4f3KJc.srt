00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:05,585
The answer is it depends. It really depends on the type of organization. There

2
00:00:05,585 --> 00:00:08,546
are many different types of businesses and organizations, and therefore,

3
00:00:08,546 --> 00:00:12,821
different types of incentives may work differently in each setting. Also, the

4
00:00:12,821 --> 00:00:18,200
value of extrinsic motivation, which isn't listed here can change across time.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,165
For example, younger people may be more motivated by a high paying hourly job,

6
00:00:22,165 --> 00:00:25,886
whereas those who are older may prefer a job with a good benefit plan over a

7
00:00:25,886 --> 00:00:32,286
higher salary. So, our intrinsic motivations are not fixed per say. Now, if you

8
00:00:32,286 --> 00:00:35,904
find this information interesting, you might pursue a career in industrial and

9
00:00:35,904 --> 00:00:40,036
organizational psychology. In addition to worker productivity, I/O

10
00:00:40,036 --> 00:00:45,392
psychologists also study behavioral-based safety in the workplace. Now, let's

00:00:45,392 --> 00:00:46,309
go back to Susan.
