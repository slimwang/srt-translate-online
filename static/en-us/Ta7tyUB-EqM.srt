1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,069
So congratulations.

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:04,771
You've just learned a lot about machine learning.

3
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:07,593
We focused on supervised machine learning

4
00:00:07,593 --> 00:00:10,001
which deals with situations

5
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:11,845
where you have input vectors

6
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,078
and given output labels

7
00:00:13,078 --> 00:00:16,788
and your goal is to predict the output label

8
00:00:16,788 --> 00:00:18,619
from an input vector.

9
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:21,755
And we looked into parametric models

10
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,661
like Naive Bayes

11
00:00:23,661 --> 00:00:25,459
non-parametric models.

12
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:27,761
We talked about classification

13
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,053
where the output is discrete

14
00:00:29,053 --> 00:00:32,098
versus regression where the output is continuous

15
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,601
and we looked at samples of techniques

16
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,603
for each of these situations.

17
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:38,172
Now obviously

18
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:40,574
we just scratched the surface on machine learning.

19
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:41,749
There's books written about it

20
00:00:41,749 --> 00:00:43,031
and courses taught about it.

21
00:00:43,031 --> 00:00:46,046
Machine learning is a super fascinating topic.

22
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,649
It's the one within the artificial intelligence

23
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,117
I love the most.

24
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:52,953
It's really great about the real world

25
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:54,869
as we gain more data

26
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:55,728
like the world wide web

27
00:00:55,728 --> 00:00:56,089
or medical data sets

28
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,292
or financial data sets.

29
00:00:58,292 --> 00:00:59,893
Machine learning is poised

30
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,137
to become more and more important.

31
00:01:02,137 --> 00:01:05,498
I hope that the things you learned in this class so far

32
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:07,036
really excite you

33
00:01:07,036 --> 00:01:09,067
and entice you to apply machine learning

34
00:01:09,067 --> 00:01:11,216
to problems that you face

35
00:01:11,216 --> 99:59:59,999
in your professional life.
