00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,200
Now that we've covered
activity content transitions,

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,870
let's move on to shared
element transitions.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,930
Let's start off by taking
a look at why they're useful.

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,990
Now when changing the state of your UI,
motion can help you to explain

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,530
that change as well as focus your
attention on the content that matters.

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,170
So, in this example, the album cover
remains throughout the transition

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:26,180
between an artist's screen and album
screen, smoothly moving into place.

8
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,230
The transition is organized around
the object that you selected, and

9
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,060
it unfolds from your touch.

10
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,190
It helps to keep you oriented.

11
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,270
We call this a shared element
transition as the album cover

12
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,740
is shared across the two states.

13
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,200
Even if your UI doesn't
include rich imagery for

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,110
you to transition between states,

15
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,390
you can use these same principles to
convey navigational relationships.

16
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,940
In this example, clicking on an item
in the list causes it to lift up,

17
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,720
forming its own surface,
and then expand into place.

18
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,580
This reinforces the parent
to child relationship.

19
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,250
That you're drilling down into an item.

20
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,489
The motion guides the user
between the two states.

21
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,720
We can also take advantage of
this advanced paper material

22
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,090
which can transform its size and
shape and position.

23
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,890
This helps us to move between
states within a screen,

24
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,300
not just across screen boundaries.

25
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,030
So in this example,
clicking on an event in your calendar.

26
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,990
The material lifts up into
its own separate surface and

27
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:25,720
then transforms into
the Event Details page.

28
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,790
These examples all help to provide
continuity between different states

29
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,770
in your UI to create a more
understandable experience.
