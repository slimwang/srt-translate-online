1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,730
So we have our object diagram started.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,950
And right now these objects
are just kind of floating around.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,640
We haven't really talked about
how they might be interconnected.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,220
So let's add some connections or if
we're going to use the more formal term,

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,590
we'll say, let's add some relationships.

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,400
Relationships that we're going to add
are going to ones that we've borrowed

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,070
from UML and
those are the contains relationship and

8
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,130
the kind of relationship and
these are also known by other names.

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,960
For instance contains might
be known as part of and

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,700
a kind of might also
be known as a type of.

11
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,689
And there's other variations too.

12
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:34,220
So what do these mean?

13
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,640
Let's start with
the contains relationship.

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,640
Like it sounds, a contains relationship
is representative of when an object

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,960
contains another object.

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,010
If we think about the world object,
it contains a robot,

17
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:49,030
it contains an alien, has a background.

18
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,780
Also has a dialogue bubble and the.

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,250
But we're going to leave those out for
now.

20
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,960
So in our diagram, let's create some
relationships between the world and

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,580
the robot, the alien and the background.

22
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,380
So I'm going to go ahead and

23
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,800
move some things around just
to make some extra space.

24
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,700
And to represent
the contains relationship,

25
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,410
we'll draw arrows from the world object
to the objects that it contains and

26
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,080
label them as contains relationships.

27
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,310
Pay close attention to
the direction of the arrows.

28
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,950
For these relationships, it's
pointing from the world to the robot,

29
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,480
to the alien, and to the background.

30
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,380
And the reason that it points in
this direction is it allows us to

31
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,980
read the relationship by
just following the arrow.

32
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,580
Now we could also said
that the app contains

33
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:37,480
each of the objects in this diagram,
but if I'm going to add an arrow for

34
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,620
every single object in our diagram,
it could get a little hard to follow.

35
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,940
So to keep our diagram simple we just
want to add the contains relationships

36
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,600
from the app to the most
high level objects.

37
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,500
By high level I mean objects that are
bigger in the sense that they have more

38
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,250
complexity about them.

39
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:59,590
So for instance the World object is at
a higher level than the Alien object in

40
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,520
the sense that it probably has more
functionality contained within it.

41
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,730
Another way to think about it is that
the World probably plays a bigger role

42
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,620
as part of the app than the Alien does.

43
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,280
In general you want to keep this going
from the most high level object like

44
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,940
In this case the alien aventure
to the lower level objects.

45
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,410
So for instance an alien adventure
consists or contains a world,

46
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,770
world contains a robot,
robot can contain a badge and

47
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,100
we can add a relationship for
that later.

48
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,060
Now the distinctions that we're making
here in these relationships that

49
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,070
we're adding again they're
completely up to you.

50
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:39,470
Where I'm using a contains relationship
between the world and the alien, you

51
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:43,815
might use something else, or you might
not even have a relationship at all.

52
00:02:43,815 --> 00:02:47,030
Or we're on labeling this
is a contains relationship.

53
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,070
I might not even have that.

54
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,560
I might even remove an alien adventure.

55
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,710
Because the world is kind of
the most high level object and

56
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:58,210
by the title here we know that we're
talking about the alien adventure app.

57
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,160
But again it's just personal preference,
you can do whatever you want to.

58
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,220
So moving on, let's talk about the other
relationship, the kind of relationship.

59
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,890
This is one of my favorites.

60
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,200
It's used to describe objects
that have similarities and

61
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,440
it also involves a little
bit of abstract thinking.

62
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,520
For instance let's think
about the alien and

63
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,410
the robot, they're actually pretty
similar, the robot and the alien.

64
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,650
And can animate, we saw that the robot
could move across the screen and

65
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,500
the alien is animating right now.

66
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,030
And they're both able
to speak to each other,

67
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,180
so in a sense they're a little
bit like actors in a play.

68
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:39,100
Now this is the abstract part, the
aliens and the robot are like actors in

69
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:44,760
a play, then why not add an object to or
diagram that represents an actor.

70
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,080
I mean that sounds pretty good to me,

71
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,300
an actor is an object they can be
animated and participates in discussions

72
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:56,450
and just like we said both the alien and
the robot are kinds of actors.

73
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,910
And that's how we'll add
this kind of relationship.

74
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:02,420
We'll start by adding
an actor to the diagram.

75
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,950
And then we'll add relationships from
the alien to the actor because an alien

76
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,620
is a kind of actor.

77
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,760
And from the robot, the actor because
the robot is a kind of actor.

78
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,670
And I hope you've noticed that for
this kind of relationships,

79
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,600
the direction of the arrows again,
we're going from the alien to the actor.

80
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,620
So it reads very naturally
an alien is a kind of actor.
