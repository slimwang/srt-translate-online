00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,100
The program must have more than one bug. Let's find out what's wrong with the

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,870
syllable calculation. Before we go too far, let's make sure that text is

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,014
actually hello. I'll place the break point in the beginning of syllable

4
00:00:11,014 --> 00:00:14,693
calculation. I can't place it right here because the declaration of the method

5
00:00:14,693 --> 00:00:18,810
isn't really a line that you can run. Now, I'll run the program. It still

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,766
thinks it's running, so I'll just hit terminate and now I'll run it. Or keep

7
00:00:23,766 --> 00:00:27,294
trying that same sentence, and it stopped and it looks like the text is right

8
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:33,605
this time, it's hello. That's good. So, I'll keep stepping. Probably the most

9
00:00:33,605 --> 00:00:37,610
interesting part is when count gets incremented. So, let's try stepping it till

10
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:42,911
that happens. Stepping, stepping, keep going, all right, we're getting closer,

11
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:49,091
we're now inside this four, inside the if. We'll step to the next one. Alright,

12
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:53,292
and now I'm at count. What is the value of letter right now? If you step until

13
00:00:53,292 --> 00:00:57,520
count is incremented, right here, what is the value of letter?
