00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,380
Note that in all the examples we've done so far, we've always used the same

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,530
base for our logs. The 3 properties that you've learned about. The product

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:13,160
property, the quotient property, and the power property. Only apply when the

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,840
base of the logs that are being combined is the same. This is a super important

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,090
concept. And we really need to make sure to keep it in mind. That we don't do

6
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:26,790
anything that's illegal. Thinking about this important concept, which of these

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,320
pairs of logs down here can we combine using the product property?
