2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:04,080
what we learned about fragments 
and resource folder qualifiers

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,786
to update our Sunshine app.

4
00:00:05,786 --> 00:00:08,942
Figure out which layout folders should
contain an activity-main layout file,

00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:11,620
so that we can accomplish
a one pane UI on phones,

6
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,756
and a two-pane UI on tablets.

00:00:13,756 --> 00:00:16,452
