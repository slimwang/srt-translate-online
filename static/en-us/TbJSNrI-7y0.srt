I think we need a Bedroom class to
represent the bedrooms in our house.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:05,910
Follow along with me.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,620
Like we did before Ctrl-click on
the House folder, go to New File,

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,050
choose Cocoa Class, and
we'll call this class Bedroom.

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,990
And of course we want
the language to be Objective C.

6
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:22,090
Okay so now, what should
the properties of our bedroom be?

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:26,530
I'm going to give it a BOOL to represent
whether or not it has a privateBath.

8
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,780
And I also want to property to represent
which direction the window faces.

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:35,190
I like it when my bedroom window faces
east, so that I can see the morning sun.

10
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,850
What's a good way to
represent a direction?

11
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,930
If this were swift,
we definitely use an enum.

12
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,740
That's what we'll do here too, but
you'll notice that Objective C

13
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,590
enums are pretty minimalist
compared to Swift enums.

14
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,930
Enum definitions go at
the top of your header file.

15
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,880
The preferred way to create an enum
is using the NS_ENUM macro,

16
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,350
where NSInteger is the enum type and
direction is the enum name.

17
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,440
All enums in Objective C
are of type NSInteger.

18
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,760
Now that we've created our direction
enum, we can add the property

19
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,810
directionWindowFaces to
our Bedroom class.

20
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,610
And now that our Bedroom class is ready,
let's go back into the House.h file and

21
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,395
add a couple bedrooms to our house.

22
00:01:15,395 --> 00:01:18,338
[SOUND] What's going on here?

23
00:01:18,338 --> 00:01:21,580
Unknown type name bedroom.

24
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,680
Okay, even though they're
in the same project,

25
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,720
the house class can't see
the bedroom class right now.

26
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,610
We have to import it at
the top of the file like this.

27
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,760
Looks like that come to the compiler and

28
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,740
now we can use the bedroom class
from inside of the house class.
