1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,510
The correct answer is that we do it this way because when we project along

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:08,470
the dimension of the largest variance this retains the maximum amount of

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,640
information in the original data.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,950
So, if we have to do a compression we want to choose a compression algorithm so

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,770
to speak that retains the maximum amount of information from the original data.

6
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:19,900
And, as it turns out,

7
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,260
that means projecting it onto the direction of the largest variance
