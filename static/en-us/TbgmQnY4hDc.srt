1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,545
So, let me help you recall the last quiz first things first. Before we show that

2
00:00:04,557 --> 00:00:09,090
if we had negative 3, the entire quantity taken the 4th power, that was equal to

3
00:00:09,102 --> 00:00:13,749
positive 81. The difference between that question and this question here, is the

4
00:00:13,761 --> 00:00:18,181
lack of parenthesis in this problem. This time we need to think about order of

5
00:00:18,193 --> 00:00:22,187
operations. I'm not going to do a super in depth review of this here, but we're

6
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,772
going to give you plenty of review problems to practice it, and we'll also keep

7
00:00:25,784 --> 00:00:29,233
touching on it at different points throughout the course, since it's pretty

8
00:00:29,245 --> 00:00:32,818
fundamental to doing algebra or any other kind of math. You may have heard some

9
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:36,587
sort of mnemonic device or acronym earlier to help you remember The order that

10
00:00:36,599 --> 00:00:41,096
we do different mathematical operations when we're evaluating expressions. So I,

11
00:00:41,194 --> 00:00:45,608
for example, learned PEMDAS. Now, each of these letters stands for a different

12
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:50,170
mathematical operator. The P, here, is for parentheses. The E, here, stands for

13
00:00:50,182 --> 00:00:54,783
exponents. The M stands for multiplication. The D stands for division. The A is

14
00:00:54,795 --> 00:00:58,970
for addition, and the last but not least, the S is for subtraction. So this can

15
00:00:58,982 --> 00:01:03,198
serve as a guideline, to tell us what order we do all these different operations

16
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,318
in, when we're looking at some set of numbers and variables combined together

17
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:11,480
with these operators. So in the last question we did, for example, since the P

18
00:01:11,492 --> 00:01:15,741
for parentheses comes before the E for exponents, we knew that the negative sign

19
00:01:15,753 --> 00:01:20,065
needed to be applied to the three. Since it was inside the parethesis before,

20
00:01:20,168 --> 00:01:24,887
before we took that number to an exponent. There are no parenthesis written out

21
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:29,231
here. So we really have, when we have a negative sign in front of a number,

22
00:01:29,334 --> 00:01:33,789
remeber is negative 1 times that number. So negative 3 is actually equal to

23
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:38,483
negative 1 times 3. And we take this 3 to the 4th power. The 4 is only attached

24
00:01:38,495 --> 00:01:43,123
to this 3 now because there are no parenthesis that surround the negative sign

25
00:01:43,135 --> 00:01:47,829
as well. Since PEMDAS tells us that we evaluate exponenents before we multiply

26
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:52,412
we first need to figure out what 3 to 4t h equals before we can multiply that by

27
00:01:52,424 --> 00:01:57,011
negative 1. So we know that 3 to the 4th is equal to 3 times itself 4 times. So

28
00:01:57,023 --> 00:02:01,541
now I will just multiply all this out and we get negative 81, so you can see

29
00:02:01,553 --> 00:02:06,404
that negative 3 to the 4th power gives us a completely different answer than the

30
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:11,131
whole quantity of negative 3 taking to the 4th power. Parenthesis make a huge

31
00:02:11,143 --> 00:02:15,944
difference from using exponents so I say please don't forget to take advantage

32
00:02:15,956 --> 00:02:20,252
of review exercises we give you. You want to make sure that things like order of

33
00:02:20,264 --> 00:02:23,737
operations, that you've probably seen in previous courses, feel completely

34
00:02:23,749 --> 00:02:27,421
comfortable for you. So, if you're having trouble at all with this, or just want

35
00:02:27,433 --> 00:02:30,638
to make sure that you totally understand it, do a bunch of our practice

36
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,124
problems. This is going to help establish a really strong foundation for you as

37
00:02:34,136 --> 00:02:35,499
we move forward in this course.
