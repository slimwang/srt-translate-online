1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:06,040
As we will see, one of the operating system's role is to control access of the

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,550
applications to physical hardware. So a basic understanding

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,730
of hardware components and how they interact is

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,010
essential to the course. Let's do a quick

5
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,660
review. What better way to start the review

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,780
than by a fun quiz. Now in this

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,450
quiz, I'm showing you the hardware continuum that exists

8
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:32,040
today in terms of the devices that you and I are using on an everyday basis.

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,440
Smartphones all the way to the cloud and

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,650
a lot of data points inbetween. There are tablets,

11
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,840
and laptops. There are desktop computers. There are

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,030
servers. And of course, the cloud computing itself that

13
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,840
you may have heard of, that is being

14
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,580
enabled by data centers. So this is a hardware

15
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,990
continuum that you're looking at. And the question that I'm posing to

16
00:00:54,990 --> 00:01:00,255
you is, is the internal organization of computer system in this continuum,

17
00:01:00,255 --> 00:01:05,360
going all the way from smartphone to the cloud. Is this vastly

18
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,240
different? That's the question. And it's a binary answer. Yes or no.
