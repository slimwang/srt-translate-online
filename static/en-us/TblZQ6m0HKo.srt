1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,019
Now there's one more type of search for
plans that we can do with the classical

2
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:08,070
planning language that
we couldn't do before.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,679
And this is,
searching through the space of

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,769
plans rather than searching
through the space of states.

5
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:18,405
In forward search, we were searching
through concrete world states.

6
00:00:18,405 --> 00:00:21,339
In backward search,
we were searching through

7
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:24,597
abstract states in which some of
the variables were unspecified.

8
00:00:24,597 --> 00:00:29,869
But in plans-based search,
we search through this base of plans.

9
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,292
And here's how it works.

10
00:00:31,292 --> 00:00:33,448
We start off with an empty plan.

11
00:00:33,448 --> 00:00:35,439
We have the start state and

12
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:38,789
the goal state and
that's all we know about the plan.

13
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:40,984
So obviously this plan is flawed,

14
00:00:40,984 --> 00:00:43,945
it doesn't lead us from
the start to the goal.

15
00:00:43,945 --> 00:00:47,003
And then we say,
let's do an operation to edit or

16
00:00:47,003 --> 00:00:50,729
modify that plan by
adding something in new.

17
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:53,875
And here we're tackling the problem
of how to get dressed and

18
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:56,041
put on all the clothes
in the right order.

19
00:00:56,042 --> 00:00:58,634
So we say,
out of all the operators we have,

20
00:00:58,634 --> 00:01:02,039
we could add one of those
operators into the plan.

21
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,340
So here we say, well what if we added
the put on right shoe operator?

22
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,746
Then we end up with this plan.

23
00:01:08,746 --> 00:01:10,909
That still doesn't solve the problem.

24
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:13,409
So we need to keep refining that plan.

25
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:15,369
Then we come here and say,

26
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:20,500
well maybe we could add in
the put on left shoe operator.

27
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,730
And here I've shown the plan as a
parallel branching structure rather than

28
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,430
just as a sequence.

29
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,250
And that's a useful thing to do,

30
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,849
because it captures the fact these
can be done in either order.

31
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:37,369
And we will keep refining like that,
adding on new branches or

32
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:41,569
new operators into the plan, until we
got a plan that was guaranteed to work.

33
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,879
Now this approach was popular in the
1980s, but it's faded from popularity.

34
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:52,929
Right now, the most popular approaches
have to do with forward search.

35
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,070
Now we saw some of the advantages
of backward search.

36
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:57,779
The advantage of forward
search seems to be

37
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,859
that we can come up with
very good heuristics.

38
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:01,340
So we can do heuristics search and

39
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:06,100
we saw how important it was to have
good heuristics to do heuristic search.

40
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:09,978
And because the forward search
deals with concrete plan states,

41
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,430
it seems to be easier to come
up with good heuristics.
