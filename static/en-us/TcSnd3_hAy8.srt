00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,850
As part of the code, it will actually draw this scatterplot and

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,990
put the decision boundary in on top of it.

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,250
So, the thing that you should see when you complete this code is an image that

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,430
looks like this one.

5
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,480
If you see this image, everything's working right.
