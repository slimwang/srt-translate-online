1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,610
Now, remember that Marla actually
receives most of her care from

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,060
specialists.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,680
Each of them is focused on the one organ
or body system they were trained in and

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,360
they care for.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,268
Remember Doctor Johnson, the
endocrinologist who cares for Marla's

6
00:00:16,268 --> 00:00:21,640
diabetes, and Doctor Jones, the lung
specialist to whom she was referred.

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,040
Each of them will probably be interested
in different data from Marla's very

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,690
large chart.

9
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,720
This would include subjective
information Marla has provided and

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,270
objective information from her
prior physical exams, lab tests, or

11
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,940
other studies.

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,010
Each of them will
prescribe medications and

13
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,984
other treatments that are specific to
the disease that they're managing.

14
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:45,060
Current EMRs generally
don't understand this and

15
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,300
don't automatically
make this distinctions.
