1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,314
So for the next part of the course, we're
going to talk about one of the ways that

2
00:00:03,314 --> 00:00:09,466
most people use math really frequently,
and that is with money. Now even though

3
00:00:09,478 --> 00:00:13,057
these dollar bills came out of my pocket,
we're not going to talk about my personal

4
00:00:13,076 --> 00:00:17,708
financial situation. Instead, we're going
to talk about the financial situation of a

5
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:22,466
pretend startup called Gleaming Glasses.
Now this story may not be entirely fact

6
00:00:22,478 --> 00:00:26,597
based, but the same principles and the
same math, that we'll talk about in

7
00:00:26,597 --> 00:00:30,639
regards to Gleaming Glasses, apply to
businesses in the real world too. My

8
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:34,296
friend Grant kept getting tired of having
to clean his glasses. It was really

9
00:00:34,308 --> 00:00:39,013
tedious and frustrating. He'd have to take
his glasses off of his face to clean them,

10
00:00:39,107 --> 00:00:42,526
which means that he could never really see
how clean he was getting them in the first

11
00:00:42,526 --> 00:00:47,467
place. One day while in the car, Grant had
an epiphany. If windshield wipers could

12
00:00:47,467 --> 00:00:52,112
clean his windshield so well, why not just
make windshield wipers for glasses? But

13
00:00:52,206 --> 00:00:56,602
Grant had a problem, he didn't have very
much money. So Grant decided that he would

14
00:00:56,614 --> 00:01:01,030
pitch his idea to a venture capital firm.
Basically, a venture capitalist is a

15
00:01:01,042 --> 00:01:05,340
person who invests money in brand new
companies that don't have enough money on

16
00:01:05,352 --> 00:01:09,665
their own to do what they want to do.
Grant's glasses wipers idea was so awesome

17
00:01:09,677 --> 00:01:14,625
that he received $3,000,000 from a venture
capital firm. Now, what matters isn't just

18
00:01:14,637 --> 00:01:18,975
how much money Grant got initially from
his funders though. What he really cares

19
00:01:18,987 --> 00:01:22,076
about at any given time is how much money
he has left over.
