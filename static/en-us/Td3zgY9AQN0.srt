1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,208
I was 12 years old when I got 
my first modem,

2
00:00:03,208 --> 00:00:06,436
a 1200 baud ACE compatible,
and starting getting online.

3
00:00:06,436 --> 00:00:10,125
And not the internet online, 
local BBSs.

4
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:12,572
At around the same time, 
yuppies were sporting

5
00:00:12,572 --> 00:00:15,890
the first brick-sized mobile phones 
as the first GSM network

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,555
started rolling out.

7
00:00:17,555 --> 00:00:22,470
Fast forward less than 17 years to 2007, 
and the iPhone launches,

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,140
followed less than a year by Android. 
And almost overnight,

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,590
we've come to expect the world's 
information in the palm of our hands.

10
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,770
Just six years after the first 
Android phone launched,

11
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,680
it's powering everything from phones,

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,868
to tablets, watches, TVs and cars.

13
00:00:36,868 --> 00:00:39,056
So where do we go next?

14
00:00:39,056 --> 00:00:41,245
The most obvious answer 
is enabling the same

15
00:00:41,245 --> 00:00:43,723
handheld cloud connecting 
computing platform

16
00:00:43,723 --> 00:00:46,201
to the next 5 billion people.

17
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:48,680
As hardware becomes cheaper 
and more powerful,

18
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,820
more of the world's 
population will be able

19
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,960
to get internet-connected computers.

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,790
And the smartphone is going 
to be what makes it possible

21
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,700
To facilitate this, we're seeing 
new approaches to getting online,

22
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,320
mesh networks, white spaces, 
or even Google's Project Loon.

23
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,260
We'll hopefully soon see ubiquitous 
world-wide internet connectivity

24
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,570
become a reality.

25
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,450
At the same time, smartphones
will start to disappear.

26
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,750
In the same way that we don't think 
of computers as computers

27
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,360
once they become part of our dishwashers, 
cars, or TVs, we'll stop thinking

28
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,990
of mobiles as such when they disappear 
into our watches and white goods.

29
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,980
We'll come to expect that anything that

30
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,560
can be improved through the incorporation 
of a wireless internet connection

31
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,820
will simply have one. 
For that to happen,

32
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,930
we need to find more creative ways 
to interact with computers

33
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,140
than using mice, keyboards,
and touch screens.

34
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,860
I can already pick up my phone 
or lift my wrist, address Google,

35
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,660
and perform searches, send texts or email,
set alarms, or take notes

36
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,470
without having to touch 
a screen or keyboard.

37
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,970
Screens themselves have become 
so sharp that their pixel densities

38
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,570
aren't perceptible to the human eye.

39
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,150
And the team at Google X 
are building contact lenses

40
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,760
capable of measuring blood sugar levels. 
Speaking of senses,

41
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,750
not only can I control my phone 
by putting it either face up

42
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,170
or face down, it has a battery 
of sensors similar

43
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,660
to an aegis class warship.

44
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,960
Light meters, temperature gauges, 
barometers, gyroscopes,

45
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,640
all of which can be used to 
replace text entry or automate processes.

46
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,823
Wearables, cars, and thermostats 
introduce even more possibilities

47
00:02:17,823 --> 00:02:19,036
of sensors.

48
00:02:19,036 --> 00:02:22,340
Connect all of that to the cloud, 
and the possibilities are endless.

49
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,420
Future of Android isn't 
a more powerful phone operating system.

50
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,410
It is the brains behind invisible,
ubiquitous, cloud connected computing.

51
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,800
So the skills we learn today 
to build cool apps

52
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,810
are the same skills we'll use tomorrow

53
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,270
to control everything around us.

54
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,732
We've taken the first step 
into that future.

55
00:02:40,732 --> 00:02:43,682
I can't wait to see what you do next.
