00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,158
Now that we've completed the square, we've actually reached our goal. We have a

2
00:00:04,158 --> 00:00:08,760
perfect square on the left, and a number on the right. This is an equation we

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,800
know how to solve. We can simply take the square root of both sides, indicating

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,608
the plus or minus here, and then solve for x. So you try finishing solving this

5
00:00:17,608 --> 00:00:21,929
equation. What would be the values for x? When you enter your answer, be sure

6
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:24,710
to use the plus or minus symbol. Good luck.
