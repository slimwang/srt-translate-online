Let's take a closer look at full consciousness. Now, psychologists use two

2
00:00:03,793 --> 00:00:07,564
terms to describe it. First, do you remember when Susan asked if you've ever

3
00:00:07,564 --> 00:00:11,840
been so involved in an activity that you've completely lost track of time?

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,420
Well, this is what psychologists call flow. Think of a sport, or a hobby, or

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,030
just some activity that you're really good at doing. Your attention becomes so

6
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:24,632
focused on this activity that time flies. Hours feel like minutes. You're so

7
00:00:24,632 --> 00:00:29,461
engaged that time doesn't even matter. The second and last example of full

8
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:33,396
consciousness is mindfulness. This is when a person has a heightened sense of

9
00:00:33,396 --> 00:00:37,828
awareness, and is focusing on the present. So if you're being mindful you're

10
00:00:37,828 --> 00:00:41,041
actively paying attention to your immediate surroundings and what you're

11
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:46,377
thinking. Research has actually shown that practicing mindfulness techniques

12
00:00:46,377 --> 00:00:49,557
can reduce stress levels and anxiety and it can actually be a really good

13
00:00:49,557 --> 00:00:52,275
treatment for depression...
