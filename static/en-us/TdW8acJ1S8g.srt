00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,157
Here are the two original equations and let's try graphing them. The first

2
00:00:04,157 --> 00:00:08,539
equation is already in slope-intercept form, so I won't do anything with it. For

3
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:13,037
the second equation, I'll change it into slope-intercept form. First, I subtract

4
00:00:13,037 --> 00:00:17,199
4 x from both sides, then I divide each term by negative 2. This is where want

5
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,687
to be careful. I get positive 1y here, positive 2x here. And negative 3 for my

6
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:25,855
constant. The y intercept is negative 2 for the purple graph and the slope is

7
00:00:25,855 --> 00:00:30,070
positive 2 over 1. For the green graph, the y intercept is negative 3 and our

8
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,146
slope is 2. Notice that the slopes are the same, so we have parallel lines.

9
00:00:34,146 --> 00:00:38,434
Parallel lines will never intersect. So, we know that there can't be a solution

10
00:00:38,434 --> 00:00:42,691
here. Whenever we solve an equation and get a statement like 4 equals 6, we know

11
00:00:42,691 --> 00:00:47,955
there can't be a solution. The lines must parallel, just like in this case.
