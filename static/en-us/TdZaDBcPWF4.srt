00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,870
We have seen in our pipelining lesson that each control hazard will waste many

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:10,240
cycles in a pipeline processor. Branches and jumps are relatively common, so

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,990
performance will not be very good unless we do something about that.

4
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,390
But what is it that we can do? That, you will discover in this lesson.
