1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay. So that's how a single checkbox works

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
but, rarely do you see a single checkbox by itself.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Usually you see them in a group.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So let's add a few more here.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So I've added two more checkboxes--

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
type="checkbox"--

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and I've made their names be "r" and "s".

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So now we have "q", "r", and "s".

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And then I also added a line break so it can

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
have a little separation from our Submit button.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Let's see how this looks in our browser.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Okay. If I Reload this page in our browser,

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
now we see--we have 3 checkboxes

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and they can be toggled on and off,

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
as you do with checkboxes.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Now what I'd like you to do is

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
tell me what happens when I check

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
these first 2 checkboxes and I hit Submit.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So when we select the first two checkboxes and click Submit,

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
what does the "query" section of the URL look like?

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Remember, the query section--that's the name

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
for the portion of the URL, after the question mark.
