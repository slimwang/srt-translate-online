00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,210
Okay, quiz time.

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:06,140
This one isn't really a quiz,
but I want you to use the web

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,330
manifest validator to validate
the manifest you just wrote.

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,640
Open the link to the manifest-validator
in the instructor notes below and

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,390
validate your manifest.

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:20,630
When you're done, check the my
manifest validates check box.
