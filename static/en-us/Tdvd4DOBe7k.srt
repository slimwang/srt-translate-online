1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,270
To receive simple downstream messages,
use a service that extends GCM

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:07,890
listener service to handle messages
captured by the GCM receiver.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,650
GCM receiver extends
wakeful broadcast receiver.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,270
Guaranteeing that the CPU is awake so

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,120
that your listener service
can complete its task.

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,660
Recall that this is why the way clock
permission was not optional for us.

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,410
We need it in order
to use this receiver.

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,270
By overwriting the method
on message received,

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,050
you can perform actions based
on the received message.

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,810
In our case, we want to
trigger a system notification.

11
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,740
So let's look at on message received
where we'll need to process our message.

12
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,540
There are many different types
of messages so just look for

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,000
the one you want in your app and
ignore any others.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,400
In this case,
we want a message from our SenderId,

15
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,710
that means that we will know
how to properly parse it.

16
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:53,140
Parsing the message is going to
be determined by you not by GCM..

17
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,300
The way that your server constructs
its requested Google service

18
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,550
is how it will be passed along.

19
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,230
In this case,
I used to JSON object to my fake server

20
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,570
in order to send data with both
a weather value and a location value.

21
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,040
You can build up complex messages or
use only simple ones, but

22
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,090
just make sure that if you
change something in your server,

23
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,920
you update your logic in your app.

24
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,420
Otherwise you might start to
notice a bunch of null values and

25
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,270
your app could go all wonky.

26
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:21,180
Finally, we'll pass our alert message
along to a helper function that

27
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,090
builds out a notification.

28
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,530
You recall how to build notifications.

29
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,660
The things you want to note here are the
content intent which directs back to

30
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,390
main activity and the priority.

31
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,980
Because this is an alert and
potentially important for

32
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,070
users, I'm going to increase
the priority to one.

33
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,770
Priorities can range from
negative two to two and

34
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,280
I want this one to be noticeable but
not spammy.

35
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,150
Choose priorities with care so that your
users have a good experience and not so

36
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,310
that you are always on top.

37
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,180
Also, note how we build up
the notification image.

38
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:56,910
We set both the small icon and the large
icon so that we can use a storm image to

39
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:00,330
make the alert more on point, but
also the sunshine sun image so

40
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,000
that users can understand
where the app came from.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,440
It is considered a best practice to use
your app icon as the small icon and

42
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,169
something relevant as the large icon.

43
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:12,500
Also, note that large icons
must be passed as bitmaps and

44
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,020
not as a resource reference.

45
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,490
So be sure you're constructing a bitmap.

46
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:20,700
Then, just fire the notification off and
our GCM implementation is done.

47
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,420
Congrats, you.
