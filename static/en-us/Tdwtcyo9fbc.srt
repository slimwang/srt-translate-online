1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,620
Okay, here's a problem to think about
that might seem a little bit fanciful,

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,770
but it's a good way to get intuition
about bandwidth and latency.

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,660
This is a problem about computing
the bandwidth delay product

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,400
of a network link.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,630
Which is just what you get
when you multiply bandwidth,

6
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:17,660
measured in bits per second,
times latency, measured in seconds.

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,120
If you multiply the bits per second,
times seconds, you get a result in bits.

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,340
And that has a real physical meaning,
it's the amount of data in bits that can

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,180
be in transit,
across the link at any moment.

10
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,360
The amount that can have
been sent by one end, but

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,500
not yet received by the other.

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,530
If you think of the network link as
being like a water-pipe, the bandwidth

13
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:40,760
is the flow rate of water through the
pipe, for instance in liters per second.

14
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,590
And the delay or latency is
the amount of time it takes to get

15
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,790
through the pipe,
from one end to the other, in seconds.

16
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,380
And in that case, their product

17
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,210
is the volume of the pipe in liters
the amount of water that's inside of it.

18
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,620
Now let's imagine that we have a station
on the moon that we'd like to send a lot

19
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,560
of data to.

20
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,410
We are beaming data to the moon using
a laser transmitter that can send one

21
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,920
gigabit per second.

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,885
Now the distance from the earth to
the moon is around 384,000 kilometers.

23
00:01:09,885 --> 00:01:11,410
And the speed of light,

24
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:16,080
the speed of that laser connection,
is 300,000 kilometers per second.

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,930
So any given bit that we send to
the moon travels at that speed.

26
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,490
Now, if we're sending at
full speed all the time,

27
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:26,110
because the rabbits in the moon
really like Udacity courses,

28
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,960
how much data is in transit between
the earth and the moon at any moment?

29
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,410
That is, what's the bandwidth delay
product of our earth moon network link?
