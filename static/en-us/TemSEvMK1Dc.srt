1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,200
Okay, so it's now time to
build your first prototype.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,900
Choose one of the methods we talked
about in the last video, and

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,300
build out the prototype for
our to do list app.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,620
You can find the mocks for that app in
the instruction notes below the video.

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,470
Remember that this prototype
doesn't need to look good.

6
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,940
You want to be giving a general sense
of what's going on with the app, but

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,710
you don't need a final or
beautiful design yet.

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,450
You'll want to end with each screen on
paper somehow, as well as a list on

9
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:26,900
a separate piece of paper of which
button leads to which screen.

10
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,255
Check this box [SOUND] when you're done.
