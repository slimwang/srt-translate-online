00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,670
The fourth topic I'd like you to be aware of is the Abstraction Mechanisms which

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:08,750
you can bring to bear in solving problems. As I indicated at the start of

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,760
the course, the key element in success in doing design, is having experience in

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,000
solving similar problems. The way that the human mind stores this experience is

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,670
in terms, of chunks or vocabulary, such as words like client server,

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,560
or visitor pattern. This Vocabulary can be thought of at different levels. So

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,830
at one end are, programming idioms that is snippets of program text which,

8
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:38,240
it's almost as if you've memorized in order to accomplish some specific task.

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,180
Classes of course are an Abstraction Mechanism, and being aware of

10
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:48,350
whatever Classes are available to you in system libraries can ease your task of,

11
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,230
of constructing the application. A little while later we're going to be talking

12
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,240
about design patterns and I mentioned one a second ago the visitor pattern.

13
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:01,100
Being aware of those already existing solutions can help you avoid problems. And

14
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,349
we'll be talking in this course about aspects but aspect orientated programming

15
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:09,000
is a way of specifically dealing with cross cutting concerns.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,150
We'll also won't be talking much about object orientated frameworks. Well,

17
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,580
they too are existing patterns of solutions which, if you are aware of them,

18
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,090
can significantly increase your productivity. And, as we've

19
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,650
already talked about, architectural styles, [UNKNOWN] approaches to solutions at

20
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,360
the architectural level, are a powerful mechanism you want to be familiar with.
