How did you decide which posts are spam?

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,850
Here's one way, all of the spam
posts contain the word spam.

00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:12,470
So if we replace all those with cheese,
well, it's definitely an improvement.

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,260
Instead of a lot of spam,
we now have a lot of cheese.

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,450
But still that's really a lot of cheese
in our forum, what should we do now?
