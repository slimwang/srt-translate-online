1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,520
Now we're almost home free.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,500
So the first thing I want to point
out is that we can reintroduce these

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,090
absolute value signs without
killing anything, because we can.

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,960
This was a positive quantity and so

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,740
taking the absolute
value doesn't change it.

6
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,840
So the last little thing to point out
is it if we take the max of this same

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,820
quantities substituting in different
values of a, this can only get larger or

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,150
no smaller because this a that
we're maxing over includes a1.

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,990
So we can definitely achieve
at least this value, but it's

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,240
possible that some other action will
let us achieve an even larger value.

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,555
But by maxing, we can't have
it achieve a smaller value.

12
00:00:34,555 --> 00:00:36,995
I mean it can achieve a smaller value.

13
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:40,885
But it will at least the max will be
at least as big as what we get from a1.

14
00:00:40,885 --> 00:00:41,405
>> Right.
>> And

15
00:00:41,405 --> 00:00:44,755
with that in place that actually
completes the chain of inequalities from

16
00:00:44,755 --> 00:00:49,115
here to here so we get this non
expansion property for the max operator.

17
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:51,810
Here the max operator is being used here

18
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,030
as sort of a way of summarizing
these functions F and G.

19
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,020
>> Okay so let me just say that
last thing back to you to make

20
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:57,830
certain I've got it.

21
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:02,060
So, I'm with you all the way
to F of A 1 minus G of A 1.

22
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,840
You went to the absolute values sign,
that's pretty easy because you already

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,270
knew that value was positive, that
difference was positive by construction.

24
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,530
And then that last step you noticed
that the difference between A1,

25
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,140
F of A1 and G of A1- 1 is some number.

26
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,740
You're maximizing all, over all possible
a's you could stick into f and g.

27
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:26,200
It has to include a1 by definition,
which means the max might be bigger.

28
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,505
But it couldn't be smaller than the a1,
and so

29
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,275
therefore, you're bounded from above.

30
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:30,855
>> Excellent.

31
00:01:30,855 --> 00:01:31,405
Good, good, good.

32
00:01:31,405 --> 00:01:32,175
Yeah, well said.

33
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:32,705
>> That's really cool.

34
00:01:32,705 --> 00:01:34,950
Now I've forgotten why we did this.

35
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,455
>> [LAUGH] I find that's often true for
me as well.

36
00:01:37,455 --> 00:01:40,965
This requires enough of my
attention that I lose context.

37
00:01:40,965 --> 00:01:44,245
But the context was
that we had this step

38
00:01:44,245 --> 00:01:46,795
in our proof that the Bellman
operator is a contraction.

39
00:01:46,795 --> 00:01:53,550
We needed it to be true that summarizing
the Q values at a given state

40
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:58,610
using a max, was going to leave us with
something that is no farther apart

41
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,740
than the maximum difference between
the two functions that we started with.

42
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,660
>> Okay.
Yeah, I remember that.

43
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,030
Maybe you can show me
the equation again.

44
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,690
>> And in particular, it was this
step right here where, essentially,

45
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:13,470
we had to, one way to think about it is
move this max out of the absolute value.

46
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,530
So if we compare that to what we just
proved, that that's what we did.

47
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,260
We kind of moved the max
out of the absolute value.

48
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,040
>> Right, that's awesome.

49
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,650
Good.
Okay.

50
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,184
So I get it.
So

51
00:02:24,184 --> 00:02:28,560
the Bellman operator is a contraction
operator value iteration works.

52
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,950
>> Yes indeed.

53
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,869
Now I went through a phase of my
life where I got really fixated on

54
00:02:33,869 --> 00:02:39,080
non-expansion, and identified
a whole bunch of other operators

55
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,690
other than max that
are also non-expansions.

56
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:45,050
And that actually gives us a way of
analyzing a whole bunch of other kinds

57
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,260
of decision processes.

58
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,850
So not just these standard mark-off
decision properties where we're trying

59
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:54,210
to maximize expected reward, but
we can do a lot of other things and

60
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,590
this same kind of proof is
going to end up holding.

61
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:02,010
So we're going to get back to that in
a moment, but first I want to talk about

62
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,750
how we use this property now that we've
established it to prove the convergence

63
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,110
of Q learning, to prove that
this interesting way of updating

64
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,850
the Q values over and over again In
the face of experience actually does,

65
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,840
in the limit, lead you to getting
the solution to the Bellman equation.

66
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,340
>> Okay.
