1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,940
To compute the maximum fare allocation, we take 20 and

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,490
we divide it by 4, which yields 5. But the first

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,810
user only needs one, which yields an excess of four. The

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,980
second user only needs two, which yields an excess of three.

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,780
So in this case the maximum fare allocation is easy.

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,320
We simply take this excess of seven and give it to

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,370
the only user whose demand is not yet satisfied, resulting in

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,015
the maximum and fair allocation of one, two, five, and 12.
