00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,490
Exploratory data analysis is an opportunity to let

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,930
the data surprise you. Think back to the

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,670
goals of your investigation. What question are you

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,050
trying to answer? That question might be relatively simple

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,160
or one dimensional like the comparison of two

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,640
groups on a single outcome variable that you

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,490
care about. Even in such a case, exploratory

8
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,870
data analysis is an opportunity to learn about surprises

9
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,260
in the data. Features of the data that

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,170
might lead to unexpected results. It can also be

11
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,460
an opportunity to learn about other interesting things

12
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,170
that are going on in your data. What should

13
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,090
you do first? While certainly you want to

14
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,660
understand the variables that are most central to your

15
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,040
analysis, often, this is going to take the form

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,900
of producing summaries and visualizations of those individual variables.
