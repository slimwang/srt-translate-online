1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is not necessarily.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We can't guarantee that m and n are relatively prime.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What we know is that n is pq, which are prime, and we know that m is less than n.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
But it's possible that m is some multiple of p or some multiple of q.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Those could still be less than n if c1 is less than q or c2 is less than p,

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
but that would mean that m and n are not relatively prime.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That means that we can't use Euler's theorem directly.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We'd have to deal with these special cases.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That's a little kink in our correctness proof. I'm not going to go through those details.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
They're not too interesting, but we're real close, and we're going to assume

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
that we can deal with this detail, and now we have the invertibility property

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
that we need for RSA to be correct.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
One useful thing to notice here is that this works in both directions.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What we wanted for signatures was invertibility

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
where we do decryption first and then encryption..

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That's equal to c^de mod n, which is also congruent to c mod n.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We'll have correctness in both directions.
