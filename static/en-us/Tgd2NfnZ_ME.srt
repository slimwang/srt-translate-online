1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
In the unit we learned about quartiles.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here we have a set of 8 numbers.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'd like you to tell me between which numbers the quartile boundaries occur.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That is, on this side of the boundary the number is in one quartile--

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
say the first quartile--

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and on this side it's in the second.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please check each box at which there is a quartile boundary.
