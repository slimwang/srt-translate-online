00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,250
Congratulations, we did so much.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,860
You laid out your long term goals
into your Vision Statement.

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,560
You put your short term goals
in your Mission Statement.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,540
And you made a list the steps
showing how you plan to get there.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,510
In the next lesson,

6
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,280
we'll break down these milestones into
the skills required to accomplish them.

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,110
This will get you ready to start
taking action on your ideas.

8
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,800
So, bring your plans and
I'll see you there.
