1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,770
Now that I've defined a person of interest it's time to get our

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:03,840
hands dirty with the dataset.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,910
So here's the path that I followed to find the dataset.

4
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,370
I started on Google as I always do.

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,760
My Google for Enron emails.

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,860
The first thing that pops up is the Enron Email Dataset.

7
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,630
You can see that it's a dataset that's, that's very famous.

8
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,350
Many have gone before us in studying this for many different purposes.

9
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,980
It has it's own Wikipedia page.

10
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,630
It has a really interesting article that I recommend you

11
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,000
read from the MIT Technology Review about the many uses of

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,680
this dataset throughout the years.

13
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,240
But the first link is the dataset itself.

14
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,510
Let's follow that link.

15
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,400
This takes us to a page from the Carnegie Mellon CS department.

16
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,030
It gives a little bit of background on the dataset and

17
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,389
if we scroll down a little ways.

18
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,700
We see this link right here.

19
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,990
This is the actual link to the dataset.

20
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,260
Below that is a little bit more information.

21
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,960
If you click on this it's going to download a TGZ file.

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,880
Which you can see I've already downloaded down here.

23
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,830
If you do this on your own.

24
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,050
It took me nearly half an hour to download the whole dataset.

25
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,810
So I recommend that you start the download and

26
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,030
then walk away to do something else.

27
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,440
Once you have the data set you'll need to unzip it.

28
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,340
So move it into the directory where you want to work and

29
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,240
then you can run a command like this.

30
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,820
There's no real magic here I just googled how to unzip .tgz and

31
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,170
found a command like this.

32
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,530
Again this will take a few minutes.

33
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:24,170
When you're done with that you'll get a directory called enron mail.

34
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,210
And then CD into maildir.

35
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:27,870
Here's the data set.

36
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:32,680
It's organized into a number of directories, each of which belongs to a person.

37
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,260
You see that there's so many here I can't even fit them all on one page.

38
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,630
In fact, you'll find that there's over 150 people in this dataset.

39
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,530
Each on is identified by their last name and

40
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,260
the first letter of their first name.

41
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,850
So, looking through on a very superficial level, I see Jeff Skilling.

42
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,110
Let's see if I can find Ken Lay.

43
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,450
Looks like he might be up here.

44
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,050
Yep, there's Ken Lay.

45
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,730
Of course, a whole bunch of people I've never heard of.

46
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,270
And remember, my question is,

47
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,330
how many of the persons of interest do I have emails from?

48
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,070
Do I have enough persons of interest, do I have their emails,

49
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,680
that I could start describing the patterns in those emails,

50
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,538
using supervised classification algorithms?

51
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:10,639
And so the way that I answered this question was,

52
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,980
again, using some work by hand basically.

53
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,710
I took my list of persons of interest and for

54
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:21,660
each person on that list I just looked for their name in this directory.

55
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,590
Let's go back to that, remind ourselves what it looked like.

56
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,020
You can see the annotated list here.

57
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,540
You might have been wondering what these letters were before each of the names.

58
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,460
These are my notes that I wrote to myself.

59
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:34,750
As to whether I actually have the inbox of each of each of these people.

60
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,800
So Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling we already found.

61
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,594
But then it started to become a little more difficult.

62
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:45,630
So you can see there are many, many people than I have n's next to their name.

63
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:50,750
And that means no I don't have, for example, Scott Yeager.

64
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:56,850
If I go over to the dataset, I don't see a Yeager down here.

65
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,430
So Scott Yeager is a person who I'd love to have his inbox.

66
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,490
I'd love to have some emails to in and from him, but I don't.

67
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,400
As it turns out, I don't have the email inboxes of a lot of people.

68
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,070
So I'll be honest,

69
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,890
at this point I was actually really just discouraged about the possibility of

70
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,270
using this as a project at all.

71
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,880
I think I counted something like four or five people that I had their inboxes.

72
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,150
And while that might be a few hundred emails or something like that.

73
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,210
There's really no chance that with four examples of persons of interest I

74
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:29,760
could start to describe the patterns of persons of interest as a whole.

75
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,830
In the next video, though, I want to give you a key insight that I

76
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,280
had that gave this project a second chance.

77
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,900
A different way of trying to access the email inboxes of

78
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,920
the persons of interest.
