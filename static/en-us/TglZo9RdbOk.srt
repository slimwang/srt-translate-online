1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The mean is still at 0,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
but for the variance we now need to add up 10 individual variances.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
There is one each time.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Since all of these are equal to 1, adding them is the same as saying 10 * 1,

5
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which just equals 10.
