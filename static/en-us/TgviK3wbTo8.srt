00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,615
We can find the y-intercept of this curve by plugging in x equals 0. That gives

2
00:00:04,615 --> 00:00:08,804
us a y-coordinate of 4, and we already know the x-coordinate is 0, so the

3
00:00:08,804 --> 00:00:13,556
y-intercept is 0,4. X-intercepts are where y equals 0. Now, we need to factor to

4
00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:18,578
figure out what x values makes this equation true. The two equations that yield

5
00:00:18,578 --> 00:00:23,786
solutions that could each make this equation true are x plus 4 equals 0 and x

6
00:00:23,786 --> 00:00:28,924
plus 1 equals 0. So now, I just have to solve each of these. Our x-intercepts

7
00:00:28,924 --> 00:00:33,779
are then at negative 4,0 and negative 1,0. Lastly, let's find the vertex by

8
00:00:33,779 --> 00:00:39,684
putting this in vertex form. Our final equation in vertex form is y plus 9 4th

9
00:00:39,684 --> 00:00:45,278
equals x plus 5 halves squared. That means, that our vertex is at negative 5

10
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:50,491
halves, negative 9 4th. If you think about the fact that we talked about what

11
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:55,493
parabolas are for the first time just a couple of lessons ago, it's pretty

12
00:00:55,493 --> 00:01:00,495
impressive how much you can do to manipulate them and find out about their

13
00:01:00,495 --> 00:01:03,644
graphs already. This is really awesome. Good job.
