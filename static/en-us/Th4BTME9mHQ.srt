1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
It turns out all the data can be fit exactly.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You can apply the formula we learned in class.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You can also just apply simple considerations here.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Take the first and second data point,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
which is a distance of 2 in the x dimension.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The y dimension is a distance of 3.2.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So 3.2 divided by 2 equals 1.6.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You can check that all the other ones fit using 1.6 for w1,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and w0 becomes 0.4.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
When you plug these things in you can easily verify that these two numbers are correct.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
There is really no residual error over here.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It was a relatively simple linear regression problem.
