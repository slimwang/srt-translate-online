1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,850
So what exactly does GeoJSON look like especially once we load it in with d3?

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,920
Just as with our previous charts, we simply set up our margins, our width and

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,780
our height and we append an SVG element this time with class map to our page.

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,010
And now we can put in a debugger, so we can pause execution and

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,050
expect what geo data looks like and the structure it has.

6
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:29,100
As you can see here we've loaded our globe.html file, that we were just

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,900
looking at in the browser and execution has paused at line 22 in the debugger.

8
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,970
Looking at what geo data is you can see here.

9
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,250
There is a JavaScript object with top level keys,

10
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,780
type with value feature collection and features that corresponds to an array.

11
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,360
And again, another one of the benefits of using geoJSON is that it

12
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,530
simply a JSON file that we can pass around like any other.

13
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,190
In this case, we can even load it in with

14
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,790
d3's standard JSON data loading function, and when we inspect it in our console,

15
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:09,250
we can see here the Crowoop console treats it like any other JSON and

16
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,420
gives us this nested structure to inspect through.

17
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,370
We can see here that in the features array there's 177 items.

18
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:25,180
Each of which it's self is an object that has a geometry key and properties key.

19
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,940
The properties in this case as a single key

20
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,000
value pair is the name of the country.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,820
In this case the first one is Afghanistan.

22
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:38,070
What makes GeoJSON unique is it's shape extensions.

23
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,580
Here we can see each country has a geometry key

24
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:46,180
that corresponds to an object that both has coordinates and the type,

25
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:51,330
in this case the geometry of a country is a polygon, as we can see here.

26
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,810
And coordinates is an array of values, or

27
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,370
rather an array of arrays of two elements or

28
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:03,130
pairs of coordinates representing the longitude and latitude of the country.

29
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,770
One thing to note here, and it's not explicit,

30
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:10,750
is that longitude actually comes first, in this case what's labelled with zero,

31
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:15,000
and latitude comes second, what's labelled as one here.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,050
And that's just a quirk of the format.

33
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:21,280
And there's geometry object that has coordinate points and the type,

34
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,910
polygon represents the border of a country, in this case, Afghanistan
