1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,740
Now let's learn about if statements.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:03,953
Let's start by playing our scene.

3
00:00:03,953 --> 00:00:11,451

4
00:00:11,451 --> 00:00:13,270
We still have one little problem.

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,160
Our coconut falls through the ground.

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:15,740
Let's fix that.

7
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,810
We're going to add an if statement to
check if the coconut is on the ground.

8
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,945
If it is,
then we stop moving the coconut.

9
00:00:22,945 --> 00:00:25,640
Let's go back to our script and
modify it.

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,250
Okay, like before,
we'll talk about this in just a second.

11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,845
But for now,
just save your script and press Play.

12
00:00:31,845 --> 00:00:37,644

13
00:00:37,644 --> 00:00:40,950
All right, our coconut stops
on the ground, nice work!

14
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,800
Let's look at that code one more time.

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,159
The if statement says,
if the object's position in

16
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:53,424
the y-axis is greater than 0.6 meters,
then move it down.

17
00:00:53,424 --> 00:00:57,120
Okay, great,
we've solved our coconut problem.

18
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,911
Now, just for fun,
let's do a slightly different animation.

19
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:03,713
Okay, go ahead and
save this and then press Play.

20
00:01:03,713 --> 00:01:06,699
[BLANK_AUDIO]

21
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:07,629
Look out over the rocks.

22
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,670
And there's your coconut,
defying gravity.

23
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:12,730
And it looks pretty cool, too.

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,630
Now the update is not just straight
down, but it follows the sine function.

25
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:19,960
You could do anything here.

26
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,599
So take a moment and play with it.

27
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:25,839
