00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,870
When the framework can run in the
background it is said to be thread safe.

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,930
However, there are several frameworks
that are not thread safe and

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,570
can only run in the main queue.

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,210
There or
two notable cases in the apple stack.

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:18,340
These are two banana peels waiting for
a newbie to step on them.

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,460
These are UIKit and Core data.

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,460
Let's start with UIKit.

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:27,070
You cannot run anything from
UIKit in the background, or

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,570
your app will crash intermittently.

10
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,710
That's the beauty of concurrency bugs.

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,710
Sometimes they show up,
sometimes they don't.

12
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,330
The bottom line is never use
anything who's name ends with

13
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,080
view in the background.

14
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:41,660
Or else.

15
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,750
Core data is a bit more complicated, and

16
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,470
we will deal with this in greater
detail once we reach core data.

17
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:52,750
The thing to remember here is
that ns manage object context

18
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,460
can only be used in the same
queue it was created.

19
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,960
Therefore, if you created
the context in the main queue,

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,710
you may only use it in the main queue.

21
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:06,660
However, if you create
a context in a background que,

22
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,740
then you may only use
it in the background.

23
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:14,760
My recommendation is to wait until we
feel really confident with core data and

24
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,790
GCD before you try to mix them together.

25
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,700
Core data in the background is second
than core data, so tread carefully,

26
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,374
Daniel son.

27
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:27,460
Until then, wax on wax off.

28
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,410
Remember to breath, very important, hai.
