00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,240
Here's a map where we've
colored in two regions for you.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,040
So given this state and
the map coloring,

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,250
propagate through the constraints to
make each variable arc consistent.

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:13,879
Check the boxes to indicate which
color is possible in each region.

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,129
Finally, is the entire
network arc consistent?
