1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And I think the correct answer here is this one above.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Again, it's a bit subjective using these small examples,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
but otherwise it's just too complicated for you to see and explain.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So my point here is basically this,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
if you have decided what you're going to do with x1, x2, and x3,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
then the following thing happens.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You've already decided what you're going to do with x1,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
you've already decided what you're going to do with x2,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and you've already decided what you're going to do with x3,

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and in that case, what remains is an instance of 2-SAT,

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and that is solvable in polynomial time.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Of course this is a very simple example,

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
so you could have already figured out how to solve it.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So there's many different ways to solve it,

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
but I just wanted to show you what I mean by distance

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
of a 3-SAT instance to a 2-SAT instance,

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
because over here you decide what to do with these values.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Well, you have it figured out for this clause here,

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
you have it figured out for this one here,

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
but you have not figured it out for that one here.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So in a way, the above formula is closer to a

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
polynomial-time solvable instance of SAT than the one down here.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But of course you would need a really, really large and tedious

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Boolean formula to actually take advantage of this.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
But in fact, many professional SAT solvers or SAT solving packages

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
actually make use of this fact.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
There are a number of variants of SAT

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
that are known to be solvable in polynomial time,

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and what these solvers do is they will try to figure out

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
if the Boolean formula that they are given is actually close

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
to one of those polynomial-time solvable instances.

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Actually, I don't even know if somebody has considered

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
this as a parameter for fixed-parameter tractability,

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
so there might actually be an open research

35
00:01:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
problem for you here if you're ready to get into it.
