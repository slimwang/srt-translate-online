Hello Charles.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,140
>> Hi Michael.

3
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,310
>> How are you today?

4
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,030
>> I'm doing just fine. How are you doing?

5
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,380
>> Alright. I'm a little out of practice with

6
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,050
this lecturing thing. So, I hope this goes well.

7
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,530
>> I'm absolutely sure it will.

8
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,780
>> So, today's lesson is continuing what you were talking about in

9
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,870
terms of Game Theory. But, I'm going to be focusing in on what happens

10
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:22,700
when you are worried about making decisions. With more than one player in

11
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,500
a sequence. Which we started to get into at the end of your

12
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,370
discussion but I'm going to go, more into it.

13
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,350
>> Okay. I really like the logo by the way.

14
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:34,000
>> Thanks very much. Yeah, it's a, it's a specially game theory logo.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,800
>> I like it very much, I like it very much. I

16
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,500
will point out, however, that all sequels should be called the quickening.

17
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,600
>> Yeah, I was going to go with the quickening. Or

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,480
judgement day, but I didn't, didn't think that made any sense.

19
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,190
>> Hm, that's a fair point.
