00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Once again, Big Theta allows us to work with functions in a much simpler form

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
without losing their essence. Let's just make sure that we understand how to do that.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Let's take this expression 2n² + 6n + 20 log n.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Which of these is it Big Theta of?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Is it Θ of itself? Is it Θ of the term with the largest coefficient?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Is it Θ of the highest order term--n²--but with the largest coefficient--20.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Is it Θ of n² by itsef?

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It is Θ of a combination of these things--n² and log n together?

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
More than one of these is true. Check exactly the ones that are true.
