00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
[Man] Now let's talk about the syntax of first order logic,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and like in propositional logic,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
we have sentences which describe facts that are true or false.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But unlike propositional logic, we also have terms

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
which describe objects.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Now, the atomic sentences are predicates corresponding to relations,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
so we can say vowel (A) is an atomic sentence

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
or above (A, B).

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And we also have a distinguished relation--the equality relation.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We can say 2 = 2 and the equality relation is always in every model,

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and sentences can be combined with all the operators from propositional logic

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:20,000
so that's and, or, not, implies, equivalent, and parentheses.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Now, terms, which refer to objects, can be constants,

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
like A, B, and 2.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
They can be variables.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We normally use lowercase, like x and y.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And they can be functions, like number of A,

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
which is just another name or another expression that refers to the same object as 1,

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
at least in the model that we showed previously.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And then, there's 1 more type of complex sentence

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
besides the sentences we get by combining operators,

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
that makes first order logic unique, and these are the quantifiers.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And there are two quantifiers for all, which we write with an upside-down A

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
followed by a variable that it introduces

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and there exists, which we write with an upside-down E

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
followed by the variable that it introduces.

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So for example, we could say for all x, if x is a vowel,

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
then the number of (x) is equal to 1,

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and that's the valid sentence in first order logic.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Or we could say there exists in x such that the number of (x)

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
is equal to 2,

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and this is saying that there's some object in the domain

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
to which the number of function applies and has a value of 2,

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
but we're not saying what that object is.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Now, another note is that sometimes as an abbreviation,

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
we'll omit the quantifier, and when we do that,

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
you can just assume that it means for all; that's left out just as a shortcut.

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And I should say that these forms, or these sentences are typical,

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and you'll see these form over and over again,

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
so typically, whenever we have a "for all" quantifier introduced,

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
it tends to go with a conditional like vowel of (x) implies number of (x) =1,

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
and the reason is because we usually don't want to say something about every object

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
in the domain, since the objects can be so different,

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
but rather, we want to say something about a particular type of object,

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
say, in this case, vowels.

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And also, typically, when we have an exists an x, or an exists any variable,

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
that typically goes with just a form like this,

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and not with a conditional, because we're talking about just 1 object

49
00:04:02,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that we want to describe.
