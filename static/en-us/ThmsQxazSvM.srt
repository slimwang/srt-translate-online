1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,770
now we're going to introduce you to a

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,448
high-level framework called Karis that

3
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:05,609
sits on top of tensorflow and provides a

4
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:06,899
simplified interface

5
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:08,759
yeah that sounds great and auto if we

6
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:10,589
need a lot of flexibility and we really

7
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:12,480
want to customize layer creation will go

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,490
straight the tensorflow but sometimes we

9
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,900
get everything we need out of a friend

10
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,550
interface like Karis and it makes

11
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,719
building a network so much faster and

12
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:19,679
cleaner

13
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:26,118
alright let's go check out Karis
