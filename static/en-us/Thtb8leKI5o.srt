00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,950
So now, let's look at differential operators for images.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:07,220
Recall, that we'd looked at how to do various types of efficient methods to

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,440
do processing on images, by taking a kernel and applying it to an image.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,130
Well, let's start to build on that concept, but now, actually,

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,460
let's use it to be able to do things like differential calculations on images.

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,670
So what we need, basically, is an operation that,

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,200
when applied to an image, returns its derivatives.

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,020
It would be a lot of fun if you can actually create these operators that

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,740
are like masks or kernels because we've already learned how to

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,090
do things like convolution or cross correlation.

11
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,930
And that would allows to now compute image gradients by

12
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,260
running operations like this.

13
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,980
And of course, then we need to do is,

14
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,950
threshold this gradient information to select images.

15
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,490
We will remember this term again, how to to thresholding to get to edges.

16
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,250
And we'll cover more of this in the next lecture,

17
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,900
when we talk specifically about edges
