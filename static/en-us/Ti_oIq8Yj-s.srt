1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,065
All right.

2
00:00:01,065 --> 00:00:05,840
So, fundamentally to in terms of makes a good feature,

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,170
we need to talk about finding one and describing one.

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,750
And today we're going to talk about the notion of finding these features,

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,180
sometimes referred to as interest points.

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,090
And these are going to be defined to be the points of

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,350
the image that would likely make good features,

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,120
that is ones that satisfy all those criteria we just talked about.

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,300
So, let's start thinking about an image pattern and

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,369
imagine you're looking at a large black square against the white wall, okay?

11
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,940
Would the middle of the square be a good interest point?

12
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,029
Megan, what do you think?

13
00:00:39,029 --> 00:00:39,549
>> Yes?

14
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:40,762
>> Wrong, no.

15
00:00:40,762 --> 00:00:44,100
Look, remember one of the things we need to be able to do is

16
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,980
precisely locate this?

17
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,700
Well, in order to try to find the middle of some big square,

18
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:49,580
there's like nothing there.

19
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,840
It's all black, I wouldn't know where to land.

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,320
Okay, well, what about along the edge?

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,120
Will a point along the edge be a good interest point?

22
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,680
Megan what do you think?

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,180
>> Yes.

24
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:02,950
>> No.

25
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,900
Look, okay, so if my edge was vertical we're going to do this in a minute,

26
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,330
if my edge was vertical I could tell which way to move left and right.

27
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,410
But as I move up and down, nothing would really change, right?

28
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,580
I just have black on one side, white on the other side, and

29
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,120
this edge in the middle, and I wouldn't be able to tell where that point lands.

30
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,090
Okay, you ready, Megan?

31
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,370
Two strikes.

32
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,730
What about the top left-hand corner?

33
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,290
Would that be a good point?

34
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,130
>> Yes.

35
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,810
>> Yes! She got it right!

36
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,680
Swings and hits a home run, well, a triple.

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,610
That seems pretty good, right?

38
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,190
The idea is that, I know exactly where that point is.

39
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,730
If I told you,

40
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,600
go point to the left, top left hand corner, you'd know where it was.

41
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,360
Whereas if I said, go point to the middle of the square, the exact middle,

42
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,970
you'd look at it and say, I, I don't know.

43
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,320
You'd have to get Megan, and she wouldn't know either, and

44
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,490
she'd say, oh I'm sorry.

45
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,810
Anyway, okay, so let's take a look at this.

46
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,560
All right.

47
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,600
So that this really is the basic idea of corner detection, all right?

48
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,880
So here I have a black, sort of zoomed in on a black, kind of rounded

49
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,030
square against a white background, where there's brown little square is, right?

50
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,560
I could move that square up and down or left and right.

51
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,229
And basically the pixels underneath that square wouldn't change very much.

52
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,450
That's what is referred to as a flat region.

53
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,980
That is that there is no change in the intensity.

54
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,260
Well, here's our edge.

55
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,770
Okay, so now we've put our square over the edge.

56
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,210
So what do we see?

57
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,380
Well, it's the same thing we, we talked about before.

58
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,170
Now, I can know about moving left and right.

59
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,650
I would know exactly more or less where that edge is.

60
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,720
But if I were to move up and down.

61
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,710
Okay, I wouldn't be able to see any difference,

62
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,300
because there would be no change.

63
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,140
So finally what do we get to, aha, we get to corners.

64
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,180
Okay.

65
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,980
And the idea is that in the corner, basically because I have gradience

66
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:48,190
in more than one direction, no matter how I were to translate that square,

67
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,820
the pattern underneath the square will change.

68
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:56,510
And so I can know when I've lined up exactly where I was before, right?

69
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,640
So there's this idea that we need the gradients to have more than one direction.
