1
00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:02,517
So for the final question of homework 2

2
00:00:02,517 --> 00:00:06,502
your goal is to define a procedure called print<u>_multiplication</u>_table

3
00:00:06,502 --> 00:00:09,866
and it takes as input a single positive whole number

4
00:00:09,866 --> 00:00:13,884
and it prints out a multiplication table showing all the whole number multiplications

5
00:00:13,884 --> 00:00:16,100
up to and including the input number.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,000
So here is an example.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,844
If the input is the number 2 what you should print out is:

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I hope I got all those right without using the interpreter.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
To be correct, you must print them out in the same order as we're showing here.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
There will be a longer example in the coments to make sure the order is clear.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
They should match exactly this format as well.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This is a pretty hard question, so it's worth a gold star.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Actually, I'm going to make it worth two gold stars.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
As a hint, one of the things you need to think about to do this question

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
is something that we haven't seen before,

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
but you've seen it for ifs.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We saw in the lecture to define biggest that we used one if inside another if.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
To solve this you're going to have to think about using a while inside another while.
