1
00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:04,229
The domain of this function is all the real numbers, which we write in interval

2
00:00:04,229 --> 00:00:08,822
notation as spanning from negative infinity to positive infinity. Now, there are

3
00:00:08,822 --> 00:00:13,514
no domain restrictions on this function imposed by the math itself because every

4
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:17,723
value of x that we could plug in from all the real numbers, is going to cause

5
00:00:17,723 --> 00:00:21,960
the function to spit out a real value of y as well. So, what is its range?

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,370
Another good question. Well, we can see from the graph, that as x decreases, y

7
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:31,204
is continuing to decrease as well. And as x increases, y is continuing to

8
00:00:31,204 --> 00:00:35,667
increase. If we look at the function, the higher the value of x that we plug in,

9
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:40,346
the higher and higher and higher, y is going to go. And similarly, the lower the

10
00:00:40,346 --> 00:00:45,086
x value we input, the smaller this number over here is going to get for the

11
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:51,750
output. So, the range is also all the real numbers.
