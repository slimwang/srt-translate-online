00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,580
The Mozilla Developer Network has
a massive list of different types of

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,520
events and
the categories that they belong to.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,770
Look through the list and try to pair up
which events belongs to which category.

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,500
A link to the list of events on
the Mozilla Developer Network

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,780
can be found in the instructor notes.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,730
Look through the list on
the Mozilla Developer Network and

7
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,800
match the event with the correct
category by entering the number

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,590
of the event category
next to the event itself.

9
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:30,880
So for example, if the change event
belongs in the view events category,

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,800
then we would write
the number four here.
