Graph D matches this new equation. Note that the vertex hasn't changed, since

2
00:00:04,043 --> 00:00:07,941
the values of h and k haven't changed. Well if you plug in values now, since D

3
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:12,058
is the only other curve besides C that has this vertex, that must be the answer.

00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:15,339
You could, of course, also plug in other points to verify this.
