00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,780
These points would form a circle. I hope you knew that was coming. Great job if

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:10,718
you got it. When we think about a circle, we're really thinking about a

3
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:15,968
particular relationship between any of the points. That is, the distance from

4
00:00:15,968 --> 00:00:21,396
any one of these points to the origin is always the same. In this case, any

5
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:27,610
distance from the end point of a string to the origin represent 50 centimeters.

6
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,480
They're all constant.
