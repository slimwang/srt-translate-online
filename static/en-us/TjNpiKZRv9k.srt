1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,520
Now we can calculate the sum of squares for between group variability.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:10,300
Remember, it's the squared deviation of each group mean from the grand mean.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,036
Then we sum all these deviations up, and multiply by n, the sample size in each

4
00:00:15,036 --> 00:00:16,740
group.
