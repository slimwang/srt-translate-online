1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,150
In addition to the numeric data, there are several other benefits and

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:08,508
costs to be aware of. Individual skills can be enhanced by looking at other

3
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:13,099
people's artifacts. There's some evidence to suggests that lightweight reviews,

4
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:16,844
those involving the author and a couple of other people doing desk checking,

5
00:00:16,844 --> 00:00:20,410
are more effective in finding defects per staff hour. Of course,

6
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,840
this does not mean that more total defects are detected and when using them,

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,030
it is more difficult to collect overall organizational data.

8
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:31,080
Your organization is going to have to learn from trying out various

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,380
approaches as to what's the most effective approach within that organization.

10
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,917
You should also be aware of the so-called ego effect. That is, the knowledge

11
00:00:39,917 --> 00:00:43,303
that an author's artifact will be reviewed tends to improve the quality of

12
00:00:43,303 --> 00:00:46,650
the delivered artifact. That is if you're going to show what you're doing to

13
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,900
somebody else, you're going to make it better. However, there's a danger of

14
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:54,270
damaged egos when an author is confronted with his or her defects. Collectively,

15
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,420
there is also what is called the big-brother effect, in which stress levels

16
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,080
are raised because people know they are being watched and measured.
