00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:07,080
We know that A equals P times e to the rt. We're looking for A, and here's what

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:17,122
we know. P equals 20,000, r equals 0.04, and t equals 5. Let's plug these

3
00:00:17,122 --> 00:00:23,580
numbers in. That gives us 20,000 times e to the 0.2. Now, it's time to use our

4
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,176
calculator. I'll type in 20,000, multiply that by e and take e to the power of

5
00:00:29,176 --> 00:00:35,040
0.2. Look at that, we managed to use all of the calculator skills we learned in

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,390
this lesson in one go. Now I will just press Enter and we'll see what happens.

7
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:48,042
We get $24,428 and if we round, 6 cents. Grant definitely makes some more money

8
00:00:48,042 --> 00:00:50,902
with continuously compounding interest than he did with the other options we

9
00:00:50,902 --> 00:00:52,290
checked out.
