1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,429
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:06,429 --> 00:00:09,943
So also is a change model that I share
with organizations that are going

3
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:12,240
through devops transformation.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,360
In that change model we
begin with an event,

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,890
we do something in the organization
that is new or different.

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,830
This could be the automation
of infrastructure,

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,210
it could be automated test coverage,

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:27,690
it could be any number of things that
we do to improve our release practice.

9
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,180
On the basis of that event,
we have new language now.

10
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:35,210
So often what you get from the
organization is that we can't do X or

11
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,160
Y, that's not possible.

12
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,880
And so as the change agent,

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,010
as the devops engineer inside of your
organization, you then go and do this

14
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,540
thing that was that had previously
been believed to be impossible.

15
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,200
And now we have new language
in the organization.

16
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,240
Even if the language had been no prior,

17
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:58,950
now the language is [LAUGH] Okay I
guess that is a thing we could do.

18
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,889
From that perspective now,

19
00:01:00,889 --> 00:01:04,694
structure inside the organization
begins to give way.

20
00:01:04,694 --> 00:01:08,381
And as that does, you have more agency,
more flexibility,

21
00:01:08,381 --> 00:01:10,493
more freedom to act in that space.

22
00:01:10,493 --> 00:01:16,882
And so you have Event,
Language, Structure, Agency.
