1
00:00:00,442 --> 00:00:03,150
I want to conclude this course module with a

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,680
couple of pictures. One showing Xen and guests

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,840
supported on top of it. And this is

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,790
from the original paper which shows what are all

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,740
the resources available. And how they are virtualized

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,590
and how guest operating systems may sit on

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,520
top of it. With a similar picture for

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,470
VMware. As you know, Xen is a paravirtualized environment.

9
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,770
VMware is a fully virtualized environment.

10
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:33,190
And there's a picture showing how VMware

11
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,270
allows different guests to sit on top

12
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,550
of its virtualization layer. The main difference

13
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:44,090
of virtualization technology from extensible operating system

14
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,810
that we have seen in the earlier

15
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,860
course module is, in the case of

16
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,130
virtualization technology whether we are talking about

17
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:58,590
para virtualization a la Xen. A full virtualization a la VMware. The focus is

18
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,360
on protection and flexibility. Performance is important,

19
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,280
but we are focusing on protection and

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,460
flexibility and making sure that we are

21
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,940
sharing the resources not at the granularity

22
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,740
of individual applications that may run on

23
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,160
top of the hardware. But, at the granularity

24
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,210
of entire operating systems that is running on top of the virtualization layer.
