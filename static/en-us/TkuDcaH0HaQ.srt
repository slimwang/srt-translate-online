The problem with the Painter's Algorithm is that you can get into cycles where

2
00:00:03,453 --> 00:00:06,850
each object is in front of the next. Here, the red triangle is in front of the

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:10,328
blue, which is in front of the yellow, which is in front of the red. There's no

4
00:00:10,328 --> 00:00:14,362
way to fully draw these objects in any order and produce the proper image. So,

5
00:00:14,362 --> 00:00:19,120
this is the only one that's impossible to draw. These others have a defined

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,753
order that is just fine.
