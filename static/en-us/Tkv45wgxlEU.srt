00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,930
In this lesson, we're going to learn
about the NumPy numerical library.

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:10,340
NumPy is a Python library that acts
as a wrapper around underlying C and

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,900
Fortran code.

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,880
Because of that, it's very, very fast.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,450
NumPy focuses on matrices which
are called in the arrays.

6
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,540
The syntax is very similar to MATLAB, so

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,305
if you've used MATLAB before
It'll look familiar to you.

8
00:00:25,305 --> 00:00:28,850
NumPy is one of the important
reasons people use Python for

9
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:29,900
financial research.
