1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,030
We talked about sort of reactive and
proactive security measures.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:07,410
So this is saying,
we have two options here.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:13,185
Which is you would say is
an example of proactive security?

4
00:00:13,185 --> 00:00:16,480
Remember reactive is sort of
post something bad happening,

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,195
it's the cleaning up and
doing something in response.

6
00:00:19,195 --> 00:00:21,895
Proactive is sort of
getting ahead of that, so

7
00:00:21,895 --> 00:00:25,025
which one of these two you
would say is proactive measure?
