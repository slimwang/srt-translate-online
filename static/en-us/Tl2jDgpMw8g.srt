00:00:00,603 --> 00:00:04,585
The method that shakes the bugs is
called disperse bugs animation.

2
00:00:04,585 --> 00:00:07,452
It gets called when
the shake motion ends.

3
00:00:07,452 --> 00:00:11,311
This makes sense because
the UIEventSubtype member value that

4
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:13,650
we're checking for is motion shake.

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,696
You could have written the answer for

6
00:00:15,696 --> 00:00:18,609
that second question in any
of the following forms.

7
00:00:18,609 --> 00:00:21,605
Now, I'll go back to the app and
simulate a shake event.

8
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:26,544
To simulate a shake event, go to
the Hardware option in the main menu

9
00:00:26,544 --> 00:00:30,369
at the top, and
then select the Shake Gesture here.

10
00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:36,220
You can also use the hot key for
shaking, which is Ctrl + Cmd + Z.

11
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,213
Once the phone shakes,

12
00:00:37,213 --> 00:00:40,400
all the spiders scatter readily from
the center of the web, and disappear.
