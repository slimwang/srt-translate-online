1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,510
So there should have been four
unnecessary backgrounds in

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:04,970
the remaining files.

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:06,660
Let's go ahead and review.

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,360
In our base activities XML, remember,
we wanted to keep this white background.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,770
Now, in the XML file for

6
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,550
our chat fragment, we've declared an
unnecessary white background right here.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,130
We don't need this because we can use
the white one from our main activity.

8
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,000
That's it for this file.

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,460
Now, in the XML for
our individual chat items,

10
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,220
we have three unnecessary backgrounds.

11
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,980
We have one right here that we don't
need, one right here that we don't need,

12
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:38,320
and lastly, down here, we don't this
white background in our text view.

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,509
So we can go ahead and remove these.

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:42,820
All right.
Cool.

15
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,580
Let's see what kind of progress we
made as far as overdraw is concerned.

16
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,680
Now this is what your
screen should look like

17
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,040
with these backgrounds removed properly.

18
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,770
Much cleaner, right?

19
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,560
Okay, good work.

20
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,420
Now, we're just about done,

21
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,980
but there's actually one last
optimization you can make.

22
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,550
Notice there's overdraw
here by the avatars,

23
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:05,410
because we are drawing a rectangle and
then the avatar image on top of it.

24
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,400
Let's try and be a bit smarter here,

25
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,920
let's only set a background
when an avatar can't be found.

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,500
Now, we can do this with
some conditional code.

27
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,040
All right,.

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,870
So let's jump into our chat adapter
code, which is responsible for

29
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,410
filling in our individual chat
items as they get loaded.

30
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,740
Let's go to our get view method.

31
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,760
Now, down here at the bottom we actually
have some logic that's displaying both

32
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,410
the avatar and setting a background
color at the same time.

33
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,610
Let's see if we can get
a bit more intelligent here.

34
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,190
Let's write some code that
only sets the background color

35
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,210
when an avatar isn't present.

36
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,650
And when it is, we'll set the background
color to be transparent and

37
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,340
just load the avatar.

38
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,210
We can do it like this.

39
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,520
All right, so here's our updated code.

40
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,020
Notice that when an avatar isn't
present, what we're going to do is load

41
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,480
a transparent color into where
the avatar would normally be, and

42
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,670
then set a true background color for
the avatar.

43
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,820
Now, in the else case, which
represents when the avatar is present,

44
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,160
we'll go ahead and
load the avatar properly,

45
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,590
and then we're going to set
the background color to transparent.

46
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,830
This way we're minimizing overdraw.

47
00:02:06,982 --> 00:02:09,070
All right, so let's go ahead and
see how this improvement helps us out.

48
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,949
Nice.

49
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:12,960
As you can see here now by our avatars,

50
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,902
much less overdraw
with our updated code.

51
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:19,040
All right, so that was our last
optimization, which means we're done.

52
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,670
Let's go ahead and recap.

53
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,630
When we started,
our overdraw was much more prominent.

54
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,840
The first thing we did was set
the background drawable to null.

55
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,010
The second thing we did was remove
unnecessary background declarations from

56
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:31,850
our XML markup.

57
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,580
Now, the third and last thing we
did was display a background color

58
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,240
only if there is no avatar present.

59
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,240
Now, with these changes,
we ended up with this.

60
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,970
Much, much cleaner in terms
of overdraw performance.

61
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,790
So, awesome job.

62
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,600
And remember, perf matters.
