1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,046
To get t by itself you first want to divide both sides of the equation by 1000.

2
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:10,800
On the left-hand side that leaves us with 1.25 and simplifying what we have in

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,840
the parenthesis here. We have 1.03 to the t on the right-hand side. Now all we

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,560
have over here term of an exponent. So we just need to take some sort of log of

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:27,490
both sides to get t down out of the exponent, and by itself. Now as we've seen

6
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:32,170
before the log we need to use should have the same base as this base right

7
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:38,000
here, 1.03. So, interestingly enough, using log of base 1.03 for both sides.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,860
Well, that's certainly different from anything we've seen, but it works in the

9
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:49,485
same way as a log with the base of any other number. On the right-hand side

10
00:00:49,485 --> 00:00:55,010
here, we just get t. And on the left-hand side we have this log expression that

11
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:59,395
we would of course like to evaluate. Now I usually prefer having t on the

12
00:00:59,395 --> 00:01:03,630
left-hand side, so I'm just going to switch it over there now. That just makes

13
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:08,730
things easier for me to see. Now since we don't have a log based 1.03 button on

14
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:12,360
the calculator, we're going to need to use change of base. How about this time

15
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:19,390
we use log of base 10. That means we're going to have, log base 10 of 1.25

16
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:26,110
divided by log base 10 of 1.03. Let's plug it in and see what that equals. So

17
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,760
here's our famous calculator. Log of 1.25 divided by log of 1.03. What does

18
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:40,780
that equal? Let's find out. 7.54914 and so on. Remember though, since Grant's

19
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:45,710
interest gets compounded only once a year, we need to round this up to 8, the

20
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:51,291
next highest integer. So, that is our answer. After 8, years Grant will have

21
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:54,337
over $1250 in the account.
