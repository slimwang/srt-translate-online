1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,060
All right. We're going to do a couple more definitions. This

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,420
notion of a version space turns out to be really important

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,400
in understanding how to analyze these algorithms. So, imagine we've got

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,320
some hypothesis, space H, capital H. And a true hypothesis that we're

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,970
trying to learn, C of H. This is also sometimes called

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,580
a concept. And we're trying to learn from a training set

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,710
S, which is a subset of the possible inputs. And what

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,370
our training set consists of is those examples along with the true

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,790
class for all of those X's. So, at

10
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,965
any given time a learner might have some candidate

11
00:00:29,965 --> 00:00:33,390
hypothesis, little H and big H, and a learner

12
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,380
who produces a candidate hypothesis little H, such that

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,460
C of X is equal to H of X for all X of the training set, is

14
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,405
called a consistent learner. Right, so what would be

15
00:00:43,405 --> 00:00:47,330
another way of describing hat a consistent learner is?

16
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,000
>> A consistent learner can actually

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,080
learn the hypothesis, or the true concept.

18
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,480
>> Well it produces, right, I mean of all the possible things it could

19
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,770
return, it returns the one that matches the data that it's seen so far.

20
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,810
>> Right, so it's consistent with the data. That makes sense.

21
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:05,486
>> Yeah. And the version space is essentially the space of all the hypotheses

22
00:01:05,486 --> 00:01:08,584
that are like that, that are consistent with the data. So we'll say the

23
00:01:08,584 --> 00:01:11,329
version space for a given set of data S is going to be the

24
00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:13,098
set of hypotheses, that are in the

25
00:01:13,098 --> 00:01:16,270
hypothesis set, such that they're consistent with respect

26
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,230
to the samples that they're given.

27
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,142
>> Okay that makes sense.

28
00:01:19,142 --> 00:01:22,910
>> All right. Good. So I think what we'll do next is a quiz just to make

29
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,860
sure that we kind of get this concept and

30
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,570
how it works. And we'll do that next time.

31
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:27,890
>> Okay sure. I like quizzes.
