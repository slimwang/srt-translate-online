00:00:00,268 --> 00:00:03,640
The web app manifest is a simple
JSON file that gives you,

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:08,140
the developer, the ability to control
how your app appears to users

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,730
in areas where they
would normally see apps.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,230
And, more importantly, how it behaves
when it's launched from the home screen.

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,810
It's currently supported in Chrome and

6
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,690
Opera with Firefox
actively working on it.

7
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:24,490
And it's currently under
consideration for Edge.

8
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:30,635
At a minimum, the manifest must contain
the name of the app and a short_name.

9
00:00:30,635 --> 00:00:34,140
The short_name is used
on the home screen and

10
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,710
in other places where
there is limited space.

11
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,960
It also needs the start_url,

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,730
the URL the app should open when
launched from the home screen.

13
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,640
Make sure, the page you specify is
cached as part of the app shell.

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,950
Otherwise, you won't get the benefits
of a cached app shell and

15
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,480
your app won't work offline.

16
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,700
One quick tip.

17
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,620
To track the number of users
who are launching your

18
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,330
app from their home screen, you can add
a query string to the end of your URL.

19
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:04,420
And use any analytics to track launches,
with that query string.

20
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:09,080
But don't forget to ensure that you've
cached the URL with the query string,

21
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,510
in your service worker.

22
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,830
Finally, we need to
provide a set of icons for

23
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,928
things like the home screen icon and
the tab switcher, and splash screen.

24
00:01:16,928 --> 00:01:20,580
The icons parameter takes
an array of icons and

25
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:26,140
must include the source,
the size of the icon, and the type.

26
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,680
For example, image/png.

27
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,188
I recommend providing eight icon sizes,

28
00:01:34,188 --> 00:01:39,336
48 by 48, 96 by 96, 128 by 128,

29
00:01:39,336 --> 00:01:45,516
144 by 144, 192 by 192, 256 by 256,

30
00:01:45,516 --> 00:01:50,958
384 by 384 and finally, 512 by 512.

31
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:59,050
Just make sure you have icons for
1x, 2x, 3x and 4x devices.

32
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:03,400
Chrome uses the 48 device
independent pixel icons for

33
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,150
the home screen icon and
the tabs footer.

34
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:11,230
And the 128 device pixel icons for
the splash screen.

35
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,090
Those are the minimum requirements.

36
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,420
But there are a few other helpful things
that you should set in the manifest.

37
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:21,210
The background color, and
theme color are used by the browser

38
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,770
along with an icon,
as part of the splash screen.

39
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,930
Shown the instant the web app is
launched, until its first render.

40
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:33,830
Once the app is loaded, the theme
color tells the browser, what color to

41
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:38,690
tint the UI elements such as the address
bar or the notification tray.

42
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:39,890
Display and

43
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:44,300
orientation property give you control
over how the app is displayed.

44
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,910
For example, you can hide
the address bar and the back and

45
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:53,000
forward buttons,
by setting "display": "standalone".

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,900
Or if you're building a game
that works better in landscape,

47
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:02,010
you can force landscape view by
specifying, "orientation": "landscape".

48
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,700
To save yourself some pain later,

49
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,620
be sure to validate
the manifest you've created.

50
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,960
Use the manifest validator linked in the
instructor's notes below to make sure

51
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,440
that you've got everything you need and
that it's formatted properly.

52
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,420
Once you've created a manifest file,
the browser needs to know about it.

53
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,961
To do that, add a

54
00:03:21,961 --> 00:03:26,330
href="manifest.json"&gt; to
the head of each page.
