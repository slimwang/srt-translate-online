00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,490
There's no discussion of security. There's no discussion of

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,650
availability. There's no discussion of mobility or support for

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,324
mobility. And there's also no mention of scaling. There

5
00:00:12,324 --> 00:00:13,700
are probably a lot of other things that are

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,600
missing and it's worth thinking about on your own,

00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,730
some of the other things that current internet applications

8
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,370
demand, that are not mentioned in Clark's original design paper.
