00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,020
The data point I saw was this one,
although depending on your code,

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,770
you might have seen a different one.

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,660
If you couldn't figure out what was
wrong with the data point, that's okay.

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,720
Sometimes a little more
investigation will be necessary.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,031
But I happened to notice
that the join_date and

6
00:00:13,031 --> 00:00:17,005
the_cancel date are the same and
the days_to_cancel is equal to 0.

7
00:00:17,005 --> 00:00:20,405
That could definitely explain why there
is no record in the engagement table for

8
00:00:20,405 --> 00:00:21,475
this student.

9
00:00:21,475 --> 00:00:23,335
The student probably
needs to be enrolled for

10
00:00:23,335 --> 00:00:25,249
a full day before their
engagement is recorded.

11
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,800
In order to find this record,
I looped over the enrollment table and

12
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,119
found the account key for
each enrollment.

13
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,880
Then I checked whether that account
key was in the set of unique

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,980
students in the engagement
table that I had found earlier.

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,370
If the student was missing
from the engagement table,

16
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,100
I printed the record and
then used break to exit the loop.
