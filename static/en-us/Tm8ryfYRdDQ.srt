1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,950
But before I elaborate on any of these answers in our grid, let's remember what

2
00:00:04,962 --> 00:00:09,480
the general formula for slope is. We can find two points along any of these

3
00:00:09,492 --> 00:00:14,290
lines, and then compare them using this formula to find the slope. The first

4
00:00:14,302 --> 00:00:19,105
line, v, is a really interesting case. If we pick any two points along it, let's

5
00:00:19,117 --> 00:00:23,892
say negative 7,3 and negative 3,3. You'll notice that they have the same

6
00:00:23,996 --> 00:00:28,262
y-coordinate, they have the same vertical position. That means that our

7
00:00:28,274 --> 00:00:32,548
numerator of our slope formula is going to be zero, since we'll just have 3

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,641
minus 3. Zero divided by any number except zero is just zero. So, the slope of v

9
00:00:36,653 --> 00:00:42,212
is just zero. w is another really interesting case. It's this vertical line

10
00:00:42,224 --> 00:00:47,110
right here. Although, the points along w have a wide variety of y values, they

11
00:00:47,122 --> 00:00:51,937
all have exactly the same x value. x equals negative 5 for any point we could

12
00:00:51,949 --> 00:00:57,332
place along this line. So, let's just pick 2 again. Maybe this point, negative

13
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:02,715
5,6, and this point negative 5, negative 1. Then, we have negative 1 minus 6

14
00:01:02,727 --> 00:01:07,940
over negative 5 plus 5. But, this quantity on the bottom is going to give us

15
00:01:07,952 --> 00:01:12,710
zero and we know that we can't divide by zero. That is just not allowed, at

16
00:01:12,722 --> 00:01:18,150
least not for right now. So, what we say is that the slope is undefined. Line x

17
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:23,305
is pointing up to the right, so its slope is positive. And if we step over one

18
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:28,485
to the right, we have to step up more than one to rejoin our line. So, its slope

19
00:01:28,497 --> 00:01:33,693
is not a fraction. It's greater than one. The line y also has a positive slope.

20
00:01:33,808 --> 00:01:38,921
But, if we pick a point and move over one to the right, we have to move less

21
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:44,187
than one unit up to rejoin the graph. So, this slope is a fraction. Line z

22
00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:49,403
points down to the right, so as we saw before, its slope is negative.
