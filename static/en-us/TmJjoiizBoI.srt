1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,960
We are going to now leave you with some
food for thought on outlier detection.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,430
The first question we
want to ask you is,

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:14,970
is Mahalanobis distance a good method to
detect outliers in the Medicare data?

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,530
To answer that,
let's try to ask another question.

5
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,400
Are Outliers in bivariate data

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,480
indicative of true outliers when
the data has more dimensions?

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,490
Think about these questions for a while.

8
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,620
These questions are not graded quiz but
just food for thought.

9
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,720
Share your thoughts with other
students in the forum and

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,360
we will post a link for
you in the instructor's comments.
