1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the correct answer should be No.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
If you marked Yes, and you insist on marking Yes--

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
even though we're going to mark you Wrong--

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
well, then you probably work on the App Engine Datastore,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and thank you for taking this course.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But for everybody else--myself included--

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
the answer is No.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You should get very comfortable with the App Engine Datastore

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
documentation--it's all online, there's a lot of it,

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and it's very helpful.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We'll link to it in the course notes and we'll link to it in the homework.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I reference it a lot while I'm even teaching these lectures.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So anyway, get familiar with the docs--there's a lot to know--

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and let's move on to the fun part.
