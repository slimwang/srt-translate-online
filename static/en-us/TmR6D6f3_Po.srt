00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,705
If we look at the next three
sections of the scene tab,

2
00:00:03,705 --> 00:00:06,345
they all have something in common, GI.

3
00:00:06,345 --> 00:00:09,240
Now you may be asking what is GI?

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,620
GI stands for Global Illuminati,
wait, I mean Global Illumination.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,450
Global Illumination is Unity's
system to model complex lighting

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,950
such as indirect light that
bounces off of nearby objects.

7
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,970
It works really well with
Unity's standard default shader

8
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,870
to really bring scenes to life.

9
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,470
These three sections let us fully
control the parameters Unity

10
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,800
uses when it makes its calculation for
precomputed lighting.

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,100
The first section is
precomputed real time GI.

12
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,910
If you add real time lights
to your scene, you could

13
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:44,180
use this section to precompute some of
the lighting effects for static objects.

14
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,790
Basically, precomputed real
time GI calculates how light

15
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,950
could bounce off static objects, and

16
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,800
can then use that information in real
time when you start your application.

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,060
With the real time resolution
property we can control

18
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,620
how much data we store
from precomputation.

19
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:04,040
And with CPU usage, we can also control
how much computation we want to let

20
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,580
the GI system have when we're
actually running our application.

21
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,670
Let's actually go ahead and
disable our directional light so

22
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,139
that we don't have any real
time lights in this scene.

23
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,180
Now that we don't have any real time
lights, we can now go ahead and

24
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,850
leave precomputed real time GI disabled.

25
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,640
Even though we're not using
precomputed real time GI, it's

26
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,460
still good to know that this feature
exists for whenever you need to use it.

27
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,960
Next up, let's talk about baked GI so

28
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,812
we can get the most
performance out of baking.
