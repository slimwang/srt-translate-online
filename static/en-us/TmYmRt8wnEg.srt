1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We've just finished learning about sets of strings,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
regular languages, regular expressions, and finite state machines,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
a beautiful formalism and a lovely way of implementing it

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
in actual Python.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This idea, this tool of regular expressions

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
specifying sets of strings is a really powerful

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and really expressive way of writing quite a few programs.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We're going to see this come up later on in everything from

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
mail to web servers to web browsers

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
to writing our interpreter for JavaScript and HTML.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You've learned quite a bit in Unit 1, and I'm really hoping

12
00:00:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that you'll stick with me and learn even more in Unit 2.
