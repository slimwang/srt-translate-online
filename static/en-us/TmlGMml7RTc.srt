00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,540
There are particular regions of the brain that regulate hunger, and tell us

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,381
when we're hungry, or when we're full. The most important region is the

3
00:00:08,381 --> 00:00:12,578
hypothalamus. In particular, there is one important part. The lower middle of

4
00:00:12,578 --> 00:00:16,976
the hypothalamus controls the sensation of feeling full. So in animal studies,

5
00:00:16,976 --> 00:00:21,130
when they lesion, or cut this part of the hypothalamus, the animal becomes

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:27,178
obese. Because the signal for being full is broken. So the lower-middle portion

7
00:00:27,178 --> 00:00:32,360
of the hypothalamus controls the sensation of feeling full. On the other hand,

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,180
the lateral area of the hypothalamus controls the sensation of being hungry.

9
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,770
Again, in animal studies, lesions in this part of the hypothalamus. Leads

10
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,439
animals to become very, very thin, because they don't know they're hungry.
