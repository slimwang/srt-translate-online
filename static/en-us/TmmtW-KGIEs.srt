00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,640
All right, welcome back to,
Computer Vision.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,166
Today we're going to talk, a little bit
more about some activity recognition,

3
00:00:06,166 --> 00:00:07,370
methodology, technology.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,520
In particular, we're going to
focus on Time Series, and, mostly,

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,800
we're going to, this part's going to be,
on something called the,

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,570
Markov Models and it's, and
its way of representing Time Series.

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,980
And then we'll talk a little bit
about how that is applied to vision.
