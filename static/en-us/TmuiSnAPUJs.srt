The IGP or the intra-domain routing protocol, disseminates routes inside an AS

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,210
to internal destinations. Whereas iGBP or

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,570
internal-gateway border protocol, disseminates routes inside an

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:19,265
AS to external destinations. So let's suppose that a router inside

5
00:00:19,265 --> 00:00:25,630
AS-A is trying to reach a destination inside AS-B. ASA would learn the route

6
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:30,730
by EBGP. And the next topic of course, at this router, would be the border

7
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:36,190
router at B. And now a router inside autonomous system A would learn the route

8
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:42,250
to B via IBGP. Then the BGP next stop, would be the border router. And so, this

9
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:49,740
router inside ASA, needs to use the IGP, to reach the iGBP, next hop.
