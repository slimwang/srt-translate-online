1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now we talked about the easy thing, which is the mean.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We're now going to move on to a much more challenging proof which is the σ².

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I once again started with the probability of data

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
which is the very familiar product expression over here.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And let me lay out the entire proof for you.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
As before, we start with the probability of data and as before we take the logarithm of it.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And since I've already done this, I'll just restate what we previously derived.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
This would look familiar. If not, go back and watch the previous video.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Now the key thing is that we take the derivative of spectral sigma.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let me lay out the entire proof for you. So here's how it looks.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We take the logarithm this time with respect to sigma of all expression

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
to arrive with this thing over here.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We simplify this by multiplying something into here, factor out something over here,

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and we arrive at our desired result.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Plug in those numbers as before.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 99:59:59,999
There's a total of 10 of those for seven open expressions on the left.
