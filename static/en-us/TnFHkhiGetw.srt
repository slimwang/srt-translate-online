1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,670
So let's take the notion of constraints. Consider this cube again. You'll notice

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:09,495
this cube has junctions, and these junctions have different kind of shapes. For

3
00:00:09,495 --> 00:00:13,589
example, this looks like a Y junction, this looks like an L junction,

4
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:17,956
this also looks like an L junction, it's just that this arm of the L is coming

5
00:00:17,956 --> 00:00:22,470
in the other direction. This also looks like an L junction. This junction,

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,410
on the other hand, looks a little bit like a W junction. So,

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,600
junctions of various kinds. Here are the kind of junctions that can occur, in

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,960
the world of trihedral objects like cubes. Y junction, W junction, T junction,

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,640
L junction. We can say a little bit more about each of these junctions.

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,715
Let us look at the Y junction first. If we examine the various kinds of

11
00:00:44,715 --> 00:00:49,180
Y junctions that get formed in the world of trihedral optics, then we find that

12
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:54,550
whenever there is a Y junction formed, then each of these lines

13
00:00:54,550 --> 00:01:01,060
represents a fold, where a fold is a line where two surfaces meet.

14
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:05,129
Now, the important thing about this is. That if we can infer, that this is

15
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:10,350
a Y junction and that this line represents a fold, then an image that follows,

16
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,670
this line must also represent a fold, and this line must also represent a fold.

17
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,395
Actually I should tell you quickly, that in the world of trihedral objects.

18
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:21,710
Y junctions can have multiple kind of constraints. But right now,

19
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:26,640
let's just look at this one single constraint. So in the case of an L junction,

20
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,020
which has a shape like this, in the world of trihedral objects, an L junction

21
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:36,760
is characterized by this being a blade, and this being a blade, where a blade is

22
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:41,960
a line, well we cannot infer that two surfaces are getting connected with each

23
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,950
other. Again, the L-Constraint can actually have many more formulations. But

24
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,680
right now, we're keeping it simple just looking at one single constraint for

25
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,740
the L junction. Similarly, in the world of trihedral objects, one of the ways in

26
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,580
which a double junction gets characterized is through a blade,

27
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:02,750
fold, blade. In effect, we're defining a spatial grammar here, for

28
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:07,320
the world of trihedral objects. The equivalent of this, in case of grammar of

29
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,830
natural language sentences might be that a sentence can have a non phrase,

30
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,430
followed by their verb phrase, followed by a propositional phrase, and so on.

31
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,610
Given this set of very simple constraints for the world of trihedral objects,

32
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:23,260
let us see how these constraints actually can be propagated, to group edges and

33
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,050
to surfaces
