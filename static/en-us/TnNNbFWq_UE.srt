1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,429
Imagine spending hours
crafting the perfect layout.

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,419
What happened to that layout
when you rotate the device into

3
00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:09,179
portrait orientation?

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:12,449
I'll clear constraints, so
constraint layout won't help us.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,408
The icon is completely lost here.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,899
With the TV layout, all of the items
are kind of smashed into one corner.

7
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:24,869
As you can see, something that looks
great on one device in landscape can

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,320
look terrible or doesn't work well on
other devices or in portrait mode.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,391
The good news is that the Android
framework provides excellent tools to

10
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,229
help you with layouts.

11
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:38,089
Using layout inference,
we can make our layout more responsive.

12
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:42,400
We can also easily create separate
layouts for portrait and landscape, or

13
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,659
for larger screen devices.
