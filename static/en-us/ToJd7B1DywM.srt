1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,980
So what are these benchmarks? They are programs

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,040
and input data that users or companies have

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,350
agreed upon will be used for performance measurement.

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,150
So pretty much either a consortium of companies meets

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,990
and decides that these are the programs and

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,290
input data that we will use for performance

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:21,137
measurements. Or a group of people, who is

8
00:00:21,137 --> 00:00:25,640
concerned about some performance issue, will design programs and

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,800
data and allow others to measure performance on

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,644
that type of a problem using those programs

11
00:00:31,644 --> 00:00:35,041
and input data. Usually we don't have just

12
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:38,429
one benchmark program, we have a benchmark suite,

13
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:41,663
it consists of multiple programs along with their

14
00:00:41,663 --> 00:00:45,190
input data. Each of these programs is usually

15
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,820
chosen to be representative of some type of

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,870
applications. So for example, we will not have

17
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,760
ten different compression programs in a benchmark. We will usually

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,390
have one or two because we think that those one

19
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,120
or two are probably accurately representing the behavior of the

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,970
other compression programs that we didn't put in the benchmark suite.
