1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,672
We can also write each of these square roots and each of these cubed roots in

2
00:00:03,672 --> 00:00:08,281
another way. We can use a fractional exponent or a rational exponent to write

3
00:00:08,281 --> 00:00:13,497
them. Remember that the index here for these square roots is a 2. So using this

4
00:00:13,497 --> 00:00:17,370
index of 2 and this power of 1, we can rewrite the square root of 4 as 4 to the

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:23,445
1 half. The square root of 25 can be written as 25 to the 1 half. And the

6
00:00:23,445 --> 00:00:28,260
square root of 81 can be written as 81 to the 1 half. So notice that this

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,670
fractional exponent really represents a radical, and in this case a square

8
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:38,115
root. We can write the cube root of 8 as 8 to the 1 3rd, and we can rewrite the

9
00:00:38,115 --> 00:00:45,603
cubed root of 125 as 125 to the 1 3rd power. The same is true for 343. So, what

10
00:00:45,603 --> 00:00:51,124
does each part of the fractional exponent represent? Does the numerator

11
00:00:51,124 --> 00:01:02,139
represent a power, the index of the root, a square root, or a reciprocal? And

12
00:01:02,139 --> 00:01:02,769
what does the denominator represent? Is it a power, an index of the root, a

13
00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:04,931
square root, or a reciprocal? Use these same words for each of the answer

14
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:09,320
choices over here, and then pick one for this blank, and one for this blank.

15
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,573
Good luck.
