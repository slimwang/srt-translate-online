00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,420
>> Alright, so I just introduced this Q function. It

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,970
turns out that baked into this one little Q function is

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,680
everything we need for, for dealing with U and pi without

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,110
knowing the transition function T or the reward function R. And

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,790
to you know, to demonstrate this for you, I'm going to

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,760
let you demonstrate it to me. [LAUGH] So, [LAUGH] here's what

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,788
I'd like you to do. I'd like you to rewrite these

8
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:25,920
equations, this U and the pi equation, in the little boxes,

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,020
using Q instead of any references to T and

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,510
R, alright? So, imagine that we have Q, that somebody's

11
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,920
already solved this out for us. How can we

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,370
define pi and U using Q? Does that seem okay?

13
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,065
>> Seems okay to me. I think I might even know the answer.

14
00:00:40,065 --> 00:00:43,850
>> Alright, that would be awesome. So let's, let's give people a

15
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,090
chance to think about it and then just tell me what you think.

16
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:46,850
>> Okay.
