1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,130
When I visualize this new feature I get something that actually looks

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:04,200
quite good.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,830
On the x axis I have the fraction of emails that this person gets that come from

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:08,930
persons of interest.

5
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,640
On the y axis is the fraction of emails that this person sends that they to

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,010
persons of interest.

7
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:18,130
And I can see that while my red points aren't particularly tightly clustered.

8
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,400
There do seem to be big chunks of feature space where I don't see any persons of

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,710
interest at all.

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,600
So for example, if less than 20% of the messages that you send are sent to

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,490
persons of interest that puts you in this band of points down here.

12
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,600
And it means you're almost certainly not a person of interest yourself.

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,020
And patterns like this can be taken advantage of in your machine learning

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,590
algorithms to help give you better performance.
