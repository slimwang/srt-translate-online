00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:06,190
Suppose I told you the transform from image A to image B is a homography.

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,030
Homography.

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,560
Your word processor part doesn't know about homography.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,000
Mine didn't, it keeps changing it to photography and other things.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,250
Homography.

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,190
How many pairs of corresponding points would you need to be able to

7
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,830
compute the transformation?

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,510
Same set of answers.

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,249
A, 3, b, 1, c, 2, d, 4
