1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,135
So now let's look at the performance of MOVZ

2
00:00:03,135 --> 00:00:06,130
and MOVN type of if conversion. In the previous quiz

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,360
we have already seen that branch code like this

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,820
can be if converted into code like this. Let's suppose

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,370
that this branch here is perfectly predicted, so all

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,930
we have to worry about is this one. And let's

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:22,124
say that this branch is 80% accurately predicted. And let's

8
00:00:22,124 --> 00:00:26,040
say there is a 40 instruction penalty on missed predictions.

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:31,550
In that case, we have, here, this costs us four instructions.

10
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:36,401
This costs us three instructions on this path, or two instructions on this

11
00:00:36,401 --> 00:00:41,470
path, let's say it's a very difficult to predict branch. So it's

12
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:46,530
not biased, in which case we have 2.5 instructions

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,370
all the time, plus 20% of the time, we have a 40

14
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:58,681
instruction panel. This gives us on average 10.5 instructions worth of work

15
00:00:58,681 --> 00:01:05,220
on this, versus four here, so obviously, that if converted code is more optimal.
