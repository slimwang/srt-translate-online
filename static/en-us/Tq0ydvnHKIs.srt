1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,300
Even though not every 32 bit number
represents a real public IPv4

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,530
that can be assigned to a host,
most of them do.

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:14,730
So knowing that, around how many IPv4
addresses do you think there are?

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,160
Here are four options,
pick the one you think is closest.

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,280
Are there around a thousand
public IPv4 addresses?

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,400
Are there a few hundred million, near
to the population of the United States?

7
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,420
Are there more than a billion but
less than the number of people on Earth?

8
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:37,010
Or, are there hundreds of billions, more
than the number of stars in the galaxy?
