00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,029
As we saw in lesson one,

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:06,680
Android makes it really easy to create
UIs that stretch based on screen size.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,330
We call these fluid layouts
because they can stretch and

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,490
compress depending on
the amount of space they have.

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,350
And you can build these using layouts
like linear layout, grid layout,

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,630
frame layout, or relative layout.

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,450
But fluid layouts only get you so far.

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,650
Most of the time, on larger screens
you can end up with a lot more white

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,820
space than you originally planned for.

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,810
These massive seas of white space
result in an unbalanced UI and

11
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,200
can make your app look less useful and
less beautiful.

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,730
Now before we jump into
ways to improve this,

13
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,000
let's dive a little bit further
into the problem at hand.
