1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,840
So now we understand our persona for our pizza app, Dorm

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,980
Room Debbie. We know all about her attributes and we understand

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,580
her use cases. So in a minute we're going to talk about

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,530
how we can build feature lists that are perfect for Debbie.

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,570
>> Yeah but before we do that though let's address the elephant in the room.

6
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:15,720
>> We actually didn't have an elephant so

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,840
we got this thing instead. The Abominable Snowman?

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,170
>> Yeah.

9
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,610
>> So where did these persona attributes and use cases come from?

10
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:22,710
>> How to we validate that they're

11
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,060
representative of actual users in the real world?

12
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:25,480
>> Well,

13
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,650
the way we do that is there's an

14
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:30,270
entire field called UX research which does just that.

15
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,740
>> There are folks that go out in the world and

16
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:37,090
they use a variety of tools like interviewing people, observing their behavior.

17
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,210
>> They have things hypnography and they figure what people

18
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,890
do, what tasks want to perform with technology in their

19
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,330
daily lives and what they expect from this technology. Exactly,

20
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,580
so they give us all the data to help us build

21
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,980
the really informed personas in news cases so we

22
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,830
know that our designs are going to be really accurate.

23
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,230
>> Yeah and we're going to see a video just now from Rich

24
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,850
that talks about UX Research and why it's important and how it's done.
