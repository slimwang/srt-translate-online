1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
All right so to compute this quantity, what we need to do is first take a look at the neighbors of ORD.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In this case, we've got Seattle, Los Angeles, Dallas Forth Worth, not Atlanta but Pittsburgh.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So Kv which is the number of neighbors is 4.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And then we have to count up the number of edges between these neighbor cities.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So in this particular case we've got one edge between Seattle and Los Angeles.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
One between Los Angeles and Dallas and that's it.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Pittsburgh doesn't have any edges that connect to any other pink nodes. So that makes this value 2.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Now we need to apply the formula for the clustering coefficient

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
to see what value we get from this case.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And the formula says it's 2 times the number of links.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Divided by the degree times 1 minus the degree. So in this case we get 1/3.
