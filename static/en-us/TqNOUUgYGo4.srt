1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,140
First on is cost of purchasing identity
theft protection for your customers.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,930
So Anthem actually offered that to me.

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:12,160
Some banks offered when they had
a breach to their customers and so on.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,630
So this is a cost that is definitely
because of this breach that we have had.

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,300
Loss of business due to
reduced customer confidence.

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,880
Well, that is an impact of this breach,
as well.

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,000
It is a loss and
it impacts you adversely.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,560
So, that should figure into
the impact of this event.

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,640
Compensation for
new cyber security personnel

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,175
the company hires to better manage
cyber security in the future.

11
00:00:36,175 --> 00:00:40,625
Well, this is, if you include this or
not, actually happened as a result.

12
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:43,225
Maybe you wouldn't have done it if you
didn't if you didn't have this breach,

13
00:00:43,225 --> 00:00:46,245
but this is really sort of
investment in the future.

14
00:00:46,245 --> 00:00:49,420
So, in the future, we don't have such
a breach, or don't get attacked.

15
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,250
Act the way we did this case.

16
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,870
So this is really part of the response.

17
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,290
It's how you get to a more secure state.

18
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:03,600
This impact is probably not
something that should be included,

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,800
the loss that occurs because of this
particular incident, or this breach.

20
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,150
This is something that probably
should have been there and

21
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,110
if it was there then this
situation wouldn't have happened.
