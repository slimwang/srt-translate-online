1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,670
All right, let's take a look
at this first one here.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:06,689
The relationship between a list and
the time stamp that it was last edited.

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:10,690
Thinking about list and timestamps,
each list only has one timestamp for

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:11,610
when it was last edited.

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,170
For example, this generic list might
have been edited at 12:05, and

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,910
this other generic list,
maybe was edited at 3:50.

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,880
It would be impossible for

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,410
a list to have two different
last edited timestamps.

9
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:23,960
It's just one.

10
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,890
And then similarly,

11
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,710
each of these timestamps is
directly associated with one list.

12
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,619
The single timestamp object
is generated for each list.

13
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:33,700
So it's impossible for

14
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,030
a single timestamp object to be
associated with two different lists.

15
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,810
This is a classic one
to one relationship.

16
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:41,680
As far as users and

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,394
friends go, a single user could
have a couple different friends.

18
00:00:44,394 --> 00:00:50,660
For example could have J.P.
and Walter on her friends list.

19
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,820
So this is not a one
to one relationship.

20
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,410
It's not a one to many either
because Walter in turn

21
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,930
could be friends with more than just.

22
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:04,099
Perhaps Walter's friends
with [INAUDIBLE] and Polter.

23
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,840
Since each friend could be friends
with multiple other users.

24
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,140
This relationship is many to many.

25
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,450
So what about items of
the users that own these items.

26
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,270
Each item has exactly one owner.

27
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,120
Which is to fight with
the item is added to a list.

28
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,700
For example, Walter could add cheesy
flacks to a shopping list, and

29
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,350
then this item would be
associated with him.

30
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,290
He could add a tomato to
another shopping list.

31
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,450
And similarly the tomato
would be associated with him.

32
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:33,020
Same goes for if J.P.
added a insta reader to a shopping list.

33
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,140
Now even though each of these items
is only associated with one owner.

34
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,890
A single user can have multiple
items associated with them.

35
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,130
So items and users are an example
of one to many relationships.
