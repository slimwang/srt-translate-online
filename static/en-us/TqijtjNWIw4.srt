1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,930
To Fork the recipes repository, first I'll visit Larry's repository on GitHub.

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,730
You can find the link for this repository in the instructor’s notes.

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,680
Now I'll zoom into this part of the page, and click the Fork button here.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,660
Then a copy of the repository is made on my own GitHub profile.

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,080
Now, when I visit my profile, I can see the recipes repository here.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,250
Now I'd like to be able to edit these recipes on my own computer rather than

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,290
just on the GitHub website.

8
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,930
So I'll also want to clone this fork.

9
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,680
For recipes it doesn't matter so much where I edit, but if I were writing code I

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,840
would definitely want to be able to edit on my own computer.

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,130
The GitHub page contains the URL I should clone over here, so

12
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,850
I'll copy that URL.

13
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,820
And paste it into my git clone command.

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,900
Now I'll cd into the new repository and

15
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,090
you might think that I need to add the fork on GitHub as a remote so

16
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,500
that I'll be able to push to it but actually when you clone a repository Git

17
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,730
automatically sets up a remote pointing to the repository you cloned from.

18
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,284
I'll verify that by running git remote -v.

19
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,500
And, sure enough, there's a remote called origin.

20
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,910
And the URL points to my repository on GitHub.

21
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,160
Finally, since I want Sarah to be able to collaborate with me,

22
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,150
she'll need permission to push to this repository.

23
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:19,950
I'll add her as a collaborator by going to Setting, clicking Collaborator,

24
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,620
and then adding her GitHub user name with the salogel42.

25
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,570
You won't need to add Sarah as a collaborator to your repository, but

26
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:32,990
you can add anyone who you would like to be able to push to your repository.

27
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,990
Then I'll need to click the Add Collaborator button.

28
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,300
Now fork Larry’s repository to your own GitHub profile.

29
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,200
Don't fork the one on my profile, since I'll be making changes to

30
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,600
my fork throughout this lesson, and you don't want those changes.

31
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,580
Again, you can find full link to Larry's repository in the instructor's notes.

32
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,610
Once you've created the fork, clone your fork and run git remote -v and

33
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,790
paste the output into this box.
