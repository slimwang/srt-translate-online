00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,342
I'm having kind of a hard time when I have all these x's floating around. So,

2
00:00:04,342 --> 00:00:08,883
let's just take it easy. Let's write a super simple inequality, maybe 1 is less

3
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:13,317
than 2. Those are two numbers that I think I can handle right now. Let's check

4
00:00:13,317 --> 00:00:17,741
this on a number line to make sure that I'm not crazy. Well here's 1 and here's

5
00:00:17,741 --> 00:00:22,172
2. We're going to look at just the range of values that is less than 2, and that

6
00:00:22,172 --> 00:00:26,895
is all of these values to the left of 2. 1 is definitely in this interval. But,

7
00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:31,111
I was looking at our earlier inequality, I ran into a problem when I divided

8
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:35,526
both sides of the inequality by negative 1. I'll make some room here, and now,

9
00:00:35,526 --> 00:00:39,945
let's see what happens if I divide both sides of the inequality by negative 1.

10
00:00:39,945 --> 00:00:44,229
So, what number do we get on either side of our inequality, if we divide both

11
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:48,568
sides by negative 1? Make sure you keep the numbers on the sides that they're on

12
00:00:48,568 --> 00:00:52,265
right now for the purposes of this answer. After that, I would like you to

13
00:00:52,265 --> 00:00:55,565
consider your answer, and tell me whether or not this makes sense.
