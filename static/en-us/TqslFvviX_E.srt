00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,126
It's one thing to animate characters by hand, however there's a huge variety of

2
00:00:03,126 --> 00:00:07,080
phenomena that are governed by the laws of physics. For simple tasks such as

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,187
bouncing ball, keyframing can suffice. Here's a keyframing timeline in 3D

4
00:00:11,187 --> 00:00:15,688
Studio Max, and the process of setting up an animation like this. What if we

5
00:00:15,688 --> 00:00:18,711
wanted to have the bouncing ball keep bouncing? Keyframing by hand becomes a

6
00:00:18,711 --> 00:00:22,745
challenge since there's no simple repetition. For these phenomena we turn to

7
00:00:22,745 --> 00:00:26,710
simulation to generate the animations. Here's another example. A set of bodies

8
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,055
attracted to each other by gravitational forces. For the bouncing ball, we

9
00:00:30,055 --> 00:00:32,935
could have perhaps written a little program that would create the key frames

10
00:00:32,935 --> 00:00:36,554
for us. Here the motions are complex and are calculated frame to frame on the

11
00:00:36,554 --> 00:00:41,588
fly. Many other phenomena can be simulated in real time. Here's an example of a

12
00:00:41,588 --> 00:00:45,114
spring system. These three demos were all created in GlowScript, a system

13
00:00:45,114 --> 00:00:49,141
that's even higher level than Three.js. Simulating friction is a scenario that

14
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:52,276
can be challenging, but critical if you want to get anywhere. A blowing wind

15
00:00:52,276 --> 00:00:56,015
has drag and lift constraints, cloth has stretch constraints. This is a

16
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:59,830
relatively simple system that can be solved in real time as you can see.

17
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:03,625
Simulations can be affected by the user's actions. As a simple example, in this

18
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:07,883
demo, you can turn the wind on and off, add a ball, and so on. These are not

19
00:01:07,883 --> 00:01:10,694
pre-stored canned animations, but are interactive.
