1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
In the example, we're just talking about with the marvel comic book characters,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
the strength of the link between some character i and some character j

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
was the number of comic books they appeared in together.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Now, this is an actually very useful metric for real life social networks.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I have not appeared in any comic books with anyone.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I have one friend who actually has appeared in a comic book,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
research her by the name of Micheal Bowling at the University of Alberta,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
actually had a comic book character made about himself, which is pretty awesome.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But I didn't appear in that comic book with him, so that's not a very good metric.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We won't really need to be studying weighted social networks just for comic book characters,

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
but there's lots of natural measures of the strength of a connection

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
between a person i and a person j.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You could imagine saying they're more stronger connected

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
as a function of how often they email each other,

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
or maybe how many years they have known each other,

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
the frequency at which they meet in a given week,

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
how often they rate each others post on some kind of social networking site,

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
or maybe the number of news articles both have read

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and you can imagine ask more examples like this.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This notion of having a weight in a social networking is actually a pretty

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
important and relevant concept.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We had talked about shortest paths in a graph,

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
but now let's extend this notion to the shortest weighted path in our graph.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Here, in this example now, we're going to look at a high weight meaning a weak connection

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and a low weight meaning a strong connection.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You can think of the weights as almost as being a kind of cost

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and we're looking for basically cheap roots from one person and a network to another.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The example of this sort of thing might be that we want to

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
send a message from one person to another in a social network

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
minimizing, say a social awkwardness.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
For example, my son is really interested in American history

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and my Dean is an expert in American history,

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and he wanted to ask the Dean a question, but that's kind of awkward.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
They actually don't know each other directly.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
They accept that they do know each other directly at see.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Random young man don't generally contact Deans of big school of arts and sciences.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
There's a sort of a high social awkwardness for that,

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
but I was able to help get a message for my son to the Dean

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
because I have very low social awkwardness with my son

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and I have fairly low social awkwardness with the Dean.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The path of sending a message basically recommendation

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
for a book to read about American history, traveled much more easily through me to the Dean

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
than it would have to the Dean directly, and I should note that my son also has curly hair.
