1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,290
Now let us consider analogical mapping. The problem here is called

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,360
the correspondent's problem. There are a number of obvious relationships in this

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,890
target problem. There are a number of obvious relationships in this source case.

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:17,180
What in the target problem corresponds to what in the source case?

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,410
If we can address the correspondence problem. If we can say, for

6
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,770
example, that the laser beam corresponds to the rebel army,

7
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,710
then we can start aligning the target problem and

8
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:32,659
the source case so it makes the deep similarities between relationships salient.

9
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:36,810
Note there are several parts of a target problem and several in the source case.

10
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,930
In principle, any of these objects of the target problem could correspond to any

11
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,220
of the objects in the source case. In which case we would have an m

12
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:50,430
to n mapping, and that becomes computationally inefficient. If you and I,

13
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,530
often do not have much of a problem deciding, if the laser beam must correspond

14
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:59,390
to the devil army. How do we do it? And how can we help AI agents make

15
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:05,069
similar kind of correspondences? Our answer is, we'll make use of relationships.

16
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:09,160
In fact, we'll make use of higher order relationships, whenever possible.

17
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:14,100
We'll give precedence to higher order relationships, over other relationships.

18
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,610
As a unary relationship, we might say that a patient is a person here, and

19
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,850
king is a person there. The binary relationship we might say, that physician has

20
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:26,510
a resource, the laser beam. And that the rebel army has a resource, the army

21
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:31,310
itself. It's a higher ordered relationship, a tertiary relationship between say,

22
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:35,760
that between the goal and the resource is an obstacle. They held a tissue in

23
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,450
this case. Similarly between the goal and the resource is an obstacle,

24
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,590
the minds in this case. We focus on the higher ordered relationship there,

25
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:48,670
that's where the deepest similarity between the two situations lies. This is

26
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,980
how we know to mark between the king and the tumor and not between the king and

27
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,340
the patient. Although the king and the patient are superficially similar,

28
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,700
a deeper similarity lies in viewing the king and

29
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,620
the tumor in terms of goals which need to be cured or

30
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,360
captured using a resource when there is an obstacle in between them.
