1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,880
All right, now it's time for a quiz.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,010
In the instructor notes below,

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,520
I'm going to provide you
with a link to this code.

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,270
This is the XML for a RelativeLayout.

5
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,730
I want you to read through it.

6
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,450
Try to imagine what it would
look like on the device.

7
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,306
I know that you're fully capable
of copying and pasting, so

8
00:00:16,306 --> 00:00:19,666
I don't want you to put it in the XML
Visualizer because then that will do

9
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,280
all the hard work for you.

10
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,990
In this course, we also want you to
be able to practice reading code.

11
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,680
That means looking at some code and

12
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,965
then figuring out what exactly it
will translate to in your app.

13
00:00:30,965 --> 00:00:33,855
Experienced developers become
quite good at this because then

14
00:00:33,855 --> 00:00:37,065
they don't need to actually run it on a
device to know what it would look like.

15
00:00:37,065 --> 00:00:38,806
They can just modify the code here and

16
00:00:38,806 --> 00:00:42,870
just keep working on it, knowing in
their head what it would look like.

17
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,450
For you, since you're starting off,

18
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,020
I want you to carefully read
this as best as you can, and

19
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,690
then you can draw it out on a scratch
piece of paper if that helps you.

20
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,530
Then tell me if the device would look
something like this or like this.

21
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,520
Go ahead and click on the option
that you think best represents

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,040
what would happen on the device for
the XML that we gave you.
