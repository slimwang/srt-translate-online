1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,727
Okay, so now we have the lay out for
our activities as designed, and

2
00:00:03,727 --> 00:00:06,310
our manifest and
grader files are set up.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,430
So the next thing to do
is to write the code.

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,750
If you haven't done so already,
open up the main activity and

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,120
at the top you'll see there
are a number of imports.

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,460
We have to add a few more.

7
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,010
Let's take a look at what they'll be,
I'll just paste them in.

8
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,900
So you can see here, these are the
imports that we're going to be using.

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,390
Things such as the login utility,

10
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,930
the text View control that
we've seen earlier on.

11
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:30,020
A location object that we're using for
determining location details, and

12
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,880
then all this stuff that's going to
be used by the location services;

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,390
connection results, API client,
connection call backs,

14
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,130
the on connection failed listener.

15
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,210
And of course the location
services themselves.

16
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,350
So these provide all the classes
that we're going to be using, and

17
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,160
next we're going to edit
main activity code itself.

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,790
We can see that the basic one that we
have just extends action bar activity,

19
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,180
but we need a few more interfaces.
