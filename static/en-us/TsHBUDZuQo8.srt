1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,669
I've been showing you this in one dimension.

2
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:04,490
It extends pretty simply in two dimensions and

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,174
here are the two dimensional forms, okay?

4
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:10,009
So this f of u, this is just when I've got a,

5
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:12,446
a continuous two dimensional function.

6
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:14,081
Here we have f of x, y.

7
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:19,451
Well, when we do it in discreet land, f of x, y is now going to be at discreet

8
00:00:19,451 --> 00:00:24,925
points and we have f of kx, ky, those are the two different frequencies.

9
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:28,863
The fr, the discrete frequency in x, the discrete frequency in y.

10
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:31,406
And by the way, this works middle if you put the origin of k in the middle,

11
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,767
you want to put the zero in the middle.

12
00:00:32,767 --> 00:00:36,737
So for minus k k n over 2 to plus n over 2.

13
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:40,526
Let's take a look at applying this two dimensional discrete Fourier

14
00:00:40,526 --> 00:00:41,776
transform to images.

15
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:44,549
So remember, we showed you, we talked about that we are going to have

16
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:47,782
these bases that have horizontal vertical components that can be combined.

17
00:00:47,782 --> 00:00:50,518
What does that look like when we apply these things to images?

18
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:52,920
So let's take a look at some very simple examples.

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,554
All right.

20
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:57,264
So here I have a sinusoid and it's at some particular frequency and

21
00:00:57,264 --> 00:00:59,527
it's only made up of vertical stripes.

22
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:04,165
What is the spectrum, the power spectrum of its Fourier transform look like?

23
00:01:04,165 --> 00:01:07,510
Well, it looks just like this and its a little hard for you to see, but

24
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,136
there are two bright dots there.

25
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:12,394
The origin is here in the middle and there is a dot to the left and

26
00:01:12,394 --> 00:01:13,407
a dot to the right.

27
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:13,974
Okay.

28
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:20,481
Those are my spikes for the, the frequency of this particular sinusoid.

29
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:27,521
So this picture, you see has only horizontal stripes and it varies more quickly.

30
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:31,641
So these dots are now spaced vertically for sinusoid that goes in this

31
00:01:31,641 --> 00:01:36,630
direction and they're further out, because the frequency component is higher.

32
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,935
If I have a sinusoid in an oriented direction, same deal again.

33
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:42,470
It's a little hard to see.

34
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:46,340
We've got these dots that are spread in that direction.

35
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,542
Let's go back to our linearity.

36
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:51,524
So let's suppose I take the picture on the left and

37
00:01:51,524 --> 00:01:54,515
the picture in the middle and I sum them together.

38
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:57,051
And we're actually going to do a sum, so it's linear.

39
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:57,818
Right?

40
00:01:57,818 --> 00:01:59,964
So this picture's going to look like that, so,

41
00:01:59,964 --> 00:02:02,289
you know, it's some combination of sinusoids.

42
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:07,138
But remember, a Fourier transfer, Fourier series is just made up of sums and

43
00:02:07,138 --> 00:02:09,763
multiplies, it's a linear operation.

44
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:10,631
Okay?

45
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:17,104
So, the Fourier transform of the sum is just the sum of the Fourier transforms.

46
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:18,005
Okay?

47
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:21,770
So that's why this picture is just these combined.
