00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,390
Ok so now we're going to get to a quiz that's actually hard.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,168
It's not really hard, it just kind of feels hard, because I always screw it up.

3
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:11,556
And that is, the Gaussian filter that we're talking about is referred to as a,

4
00:00:11,556 --> 00:00:15,470
as a exponential, and the complete formula here is what?

5
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:20,030
So h of u, v is, by the way you see the exponents?

6
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,250
They're the same everywhere.

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,990
The only thing we're looking at that's constant.

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,640
So, the question is, what's the right constant?

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,300
One over 2 pi sigma squared, 1 over the square root of 2 pi sigma squared,

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,170
1 over the square root of 2 pi sigma.
