1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,040
We want the FetchWeatherTask to
return an array of string forecasts.

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,840
This means we need to modify
the return type of the AsyncTask to be

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,160
a string array.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,100
The effect of this is that the
doInBackground method will now return

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,530
a string array.

6
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,085
In this method,
after we query the server and

7
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:21,660
then read in the input stream,
we're going to perform this code.

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,600
To parse the response from the server,
we call getWeatherDataFromJson.

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,540
We pass in the forecast JSON string,
as well as the number of forecast days.

10
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,290
To make sure that this is
returning the right string array,

11
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:37,650
we can go into the method, and then at
the bottom of the method, we just add

12
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,990
some logging statements to print out
every element of the string array.

13
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,550
Now, when you compile the code and
run it on your device,

14
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,060
you can hit the Refresh button to
pull the data from the server.

15
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,650
Then, if you open up log cat, you can
see that it was parsed correctly,

16
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,020
where you see all the forecast
entries being printed out.
