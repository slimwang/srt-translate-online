00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,692
You're so close to being done. Now we come up with our three intervals for which

2
00:00:04,692 --> 00:00:09,023
we need to test a value to figure out what the solution set for x is. So test

3
00:00:09,023 --> 00:00:13,496
values from within each of these intervals and then write what you think the

4
00:00:13,496 --> 00:00:17,200
solution for x is as an inequality and then also as an interval.
