1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,550
We would have 52 and 817 1000ths inches squared. This is our correct answer.

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,228
Fantastic thinking if you got there. Now, I know we haven't seen a problem like

3
00:00:10,228 --> 00:00:14,449
this one yet, or that involves the square of a quantity, so don't worry if you

4
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:18,455
struggled. Let's see how we can do it. Because the area varies directly, we want

5
00:00:18,455 --> 00:00:21,984
to make sure that we list the first quantities that cross from one another. And

6
00:00:21,984 --> 00:00:26,404
notice too that the area doesn't just vary directly with the radius, it varies

7
00:00:26,404 --> 00:00:31,854
directly with the square of the radius. So we have to square the first radius.

8
00:00:31,854 --> 00:00:35,695
And then, for our second area, it will also vary directly with the square of its

9
00:00:35,695 --> 00:00:39,434
radius. Now that we have our proportion set up, let's fill in each of the

10
00:00:39,434 --> 00:00:43,499
numbers in the appropriate place. This would be our first area and this would be

11
00:00:43,499 --> 00:00:50,344
the radius that goes with it. So we want to put 28 and 278 1000ths here, and 3

12
00:00:50,344 --> 00:00:55,490
here. Next we have the second radius which we know is 4 and 1 10th. So that will

13
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,590
go here, and then we'll use x for the area of 2. That's the area we're looking

14
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,874
for in our question. First I'm going to square each of these numbers to get this

15
00:01:03,874 --> 00:01:09,016
fraction. Next we cross multiply to get this equation. And finally we divide

16
00:01:09,016 --> 00:01:12,143
both sides by 9 to get our final answer.
