1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,750
We must have a starting point from which to conduct our investigation.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,790
Sometimes, this will be highly specified and

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,960
may even come to you from a colleague or perhaps a supervisor.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,160
Often however, we start with vague direction we want to investigate.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,980
And it is our job to refine this into something we can answer.

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,540
Let's start by asking the high-level question,

7
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,130
how popular were the different kinds of candy?

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,150
Note that this question can not be answered in the way that it is phrased.

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,740
We have no meaningful description of popular.

10
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:33,660
Much less a way to say that one candy is more popular than another.

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,030
To get the iterations analysis going, our task is to

12
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:41,650
refine this initial question until it is cast in the form of a precise,

13
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,510
statistical inference problem.

14
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:48,590
To do this, we will first need to make a guess as to how to quantify popularity.

15
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,850
So how would you quantify popularity?

16
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,820
What metrics would you use?

17
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,970
Type your answer in the text below.

18
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,290
Don't worry, there are no right or wrong answers.

19
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,310
And I will share my answer with you in the next video.
