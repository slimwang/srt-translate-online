00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,727
Here are the solutions were 6 plus or minus the square root of 31. Great work

2
00:00:04,727 --> 00:00:08,797
if you found those two answers. We subtract 5 from both sides of the equation

3
00:00:08,797 --> 00:00:13,997
to get this. Next we identify the b so that way we can complete the square. The

4
00:00:13,997 --> 00:00:18,963
b value is negative 12, which means b over 2 is negative 6. And b over 2

5
00:00:18,963 --> 00:00:23,381
squared is positive 36. We add this amount to both sides of our equations, so

6
00:00:23,381 --> 00:00:28,373
that way we can complete the square. We rewrite the left hand side as x minus 5

7
00:00:28,373 --> 00:00:33,710
squared, and the right hand side as 31. Next, we take the square root of both

8
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,430
sides of the equation to get x minus 6 equals plus or minus the square root of

9
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:42,008
31. And finally, we add 6 to both sides of the equation to get our final

10
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:46,350
answers. Here, we can't simplify the square root of 31 since 31 is a prime

11
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,737
number. The only factors of 31 are 31 and 1.
