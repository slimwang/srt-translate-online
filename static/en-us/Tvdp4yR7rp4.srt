1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The best option is the second one.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The problem with the first option is that it doesn't provide

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
the unpredictability property that we need.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
If an attacker knows X_0, they can easily compute X_1.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And that's a property our pseudo-random number generator needs to have.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The third option seems reasonable.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It requires a lot of randomness in the pool.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
But if we have that much randomness in the pool--to extract

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
a new random value for each random output--

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
we should just use that.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
If we do have enough randomness for this

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
there's no reason for all these other steps.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We should just extract something for the random pool each time.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We're not able to do this--we're assuming we don't have enough randomness

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
to do that. So we're using things that aren't actually random here

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
if we're extracting them from the random pool more quickly

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
than we're actually able to produce new randomness here.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's doing a lot of extra work, but it's eventually starrting to use values

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
that are not random as the inputs to our encrypt.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And if those values are predictable, well then the outputs become predictable, too.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So that doesn't work--so the best solution is this middle one

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
where we're extracting the seed once, we're reusing that seed,

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and we're encrypting a sequence of values which is--can just be a counter--

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and each time using the output of that encryption.
