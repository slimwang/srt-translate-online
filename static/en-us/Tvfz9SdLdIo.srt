00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,360
Congratulations on completing inferential statistics. We really hope you've

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,140
enjoyed this course. You now have the skills you

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,620
need to analyze your very own dataset and make

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,640
accurate predictions. Now you're ready to move on to your

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,210
final project, where you'll perform your own statistical analysis

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,170
on a dataset. With your selected data set, you'll

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,250
investigate a hypothesis of your choice, and present your

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,740
findings in a short report. This report will include visualizations,

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,490
descriptive statistics, test results, and an interpretation of

10
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,400
what you've found. If you're looking for what

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,210
course to go to next, maybe try out

12
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,750
our introduction to data science class or introduction

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,630
to computer science if you want to expand

14
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,090
your programming knowledge. Both of these classes are

15
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,310
linked in the instructor's notes box. Either way,

16
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,970
we really look forward to seeing you again soon.
