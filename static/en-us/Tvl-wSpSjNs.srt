00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,895
[SOUND] Great job colorizing
your command line output

2
00:00:04,895 --> 00:00:07,336
in the previous project.

3
00:00:07,336 --> 00:00:10,259
Not only will the text be much easier
to see out here in the wilderness, but

4
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:12,940
it'll also help you in your
future development career.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,790
You are now ready to start the
simulation part of your survivor camp.

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,540
The purpose of the game is
to take contestants and

7
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,250
put them against each other in
a series of challenges to declare

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,380
an ultimate winner.

9
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,060
You'll be using your knowledge of Ruby's
object orientation, as well as TDD,

10
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,070
test driven development, to ensure
that a new winner wins every time.

11
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,070
The test driven development workflow
may seem a little strange at first, but

12
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,290
that's to be expected.

13
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,460
Learning how to read tests and make them
pass is an incredibly useful skill for

14
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,370
all developers.

15
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,840
So if you're ready for your next
survivor challenge, let's get started.
