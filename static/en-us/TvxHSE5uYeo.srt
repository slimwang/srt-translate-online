00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,136
This is the equation we can write. Again, the key here is the total amount it

2
00:00:04,136 --> 00:00:10,037
takes for Katrina to go upstream and downstream is 4 hours. So, if we add her

3
00:00:10,037 --> 00:00:15,883
time upstream to her time downstream, those should sum to 4.
