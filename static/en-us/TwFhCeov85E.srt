1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,810
So you might remember in the beginning of this unit we talked about this example

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,500
where we use supervised learning to train the speed of our robot Stanley.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,820
Now we are going to do the same thing in the simplified example.

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,810
So picture a robot like the self driving car in the desert adjusting it's speed.

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,230
It'll do it based on some features we can observe and

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,850
the features we chose in this example are just two of them.

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,850
There's the steepness of the terrain.

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,270
Whether it's flat or whether it's a hill.

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:26,920
And then there's the ruggedness of the terrain.

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,180
How much the vehicle bops up and

11
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,840
down which we can, we can actually measure inside a car.

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,930
And what we do is we're going to set up an example where you're going to be

13
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,500
the machine learning specialist and you will learn, you will,

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,070
you will help Stanley decide whether to go fast or slow.

15
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,650
Using supervised machine learning.

16
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,300
So, let's begin.
