1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
All right, so I've got an interesting collection of names here.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I had to include Michael because it is a relevant name to me,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
but in fact, in 1995, it was the most popular name given in the US,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
more popular than any of the names given to any of the women and in fact,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Matthew is the second highest male name,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
but I didn't ask for male names, I asked for female names.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The most popular female name given was Jessica,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and I think that was actually most popular for a good solid decade or two.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That's been very popular for a very long time

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
as had Michael been in decades and decades and decades.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This is no longer the most popular given name, but it was for a long time.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The second most popular female name is Ashley.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Well, Zuzana was among the least popular, and Taylor was pretty popular

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and pretty distinctive to that year but not the second most popular in that year.
