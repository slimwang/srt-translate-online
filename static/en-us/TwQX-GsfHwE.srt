00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,580
In computer architecture,

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:05,290
we are interested in the locality
property of memory references.

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:09,750
If we know that the processor has
accessed the address x recently,

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:15,000
the locality principle says that it is
likely to access the same address again

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,230
in the near future.

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,790
And, it is likely to access
addresses close to x, too.

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,440
This is what we call temporal locality.

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,760
Once we access an address we are likely
to access the same address again.

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,830
This is what we call spatial locality.

10
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,180
If we access an address, we are likely
to access nearby addresses so on.
