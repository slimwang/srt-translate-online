00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,328
We looked at positive powers. So let's check out some negative powers. A

2
00:00:04,328 --> 00:00:09,008
negative exponent tells us to write the reciprocal of a base, and write it with

3
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:13,412
a positive power. So here the reciprocal of 3 is 1 3rd and then I write this

4
00:00:13,412 --> 00:00:18,108
with a positive power of 2. This negative sign is kind of like an operation. It

5
00:00:18,108 --> 00:00:22,968
tells us to write the reciprocal. Of our base. In the second example we need to

6
00:00:22,968 --> 00:00:27,525
be careful, we have 5 times x to the negative 3. The exponent on the 5, is a

7
00:00:27,525 --> 00:00:31,918
positive 1, so we're just going to list the 5 as a factor. Now, we take the

8
00:00:31,918 --> 00:00:36,418
reciprocal of x, which is 1 over x, and then change the negative power to a

9
00:00:36,418 --> 00:00:41,413
positive 3. For a fraction, we'll take the reciprocal of the base, which is 3

10
00:00:41,413 --> 00:00:46,841
4ths, and change our negative 2, to a positive 2. We can simplify our answers to

11
00:00:46,841 --> 00:00:51,913
get 1 9th, 5 divided by x cubed, and 9 16ths. Looking back at our work, we can

12
00:00:51,913 --> 00:00:56,737
see that a negative exponent in a numerator moves the factor from the numerator,

13
00:00:56,737 --> 00:01:01,133
to the denominator. The base of 3 was the numerator, and it ended in the

14
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:06,240
denominator. The same is true for the x and for the 4.
