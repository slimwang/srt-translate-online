1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,540
If we can get something on
the screen without waiting for

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:06,530
the network to succeed or
fail, that's offline first.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,310
Delivering full content
without the network

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,780
is a full a star offline
first experience.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,770
Delivering just the header without
the network isn't as good, but

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,641
still that header was
delivered offline first.

7
00:00:19,641 --> 00:00:23,058
And getting that on screen, while you're
busy with the network will give your

8
00:00:23,058 --> 00:00:26,410
app a better perceived performance
versus a blank screen.

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,090
The other two options require
the network to succeed or

10
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,850
fail before showing anything.

11
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,080
So they're online first,
not offline first.

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,820
In a moment Jake will introduce you
to a demo app that works online only.

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,910
By the end of the course,
we'll have it working lightning fast and

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:42,830
offline first.
