1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,640
Using that, we basically said, even taking these types of images, like this,

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,625
we can actually now compute the Fourier transforms that

3
00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:11,579
actually encode the frequencies, and we can use that in doing blending.

4
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:15,077
So of course, what we did was, we computed the Fourier transforms for

5
00:00:15,077 --> 00:00:17,100
the left image and the right image.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,190
Then we decomposed these Fourier images into octaves, which were,

7
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,570
of course, the different bands here.

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:28,090
So for the left one and the right one, we computed all the different octaves.

9
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,770
Of course, then to blend them, we have to feather them.

10
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,700
And what we did was, we basically took the octaves, separate ones, for

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,410
different frequencies, for the left and the right, and feathered them together.

12
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:43,860
And then of course, after all of that was done, we computed the inverse Fourier

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,070
transform and also did some feathering in the spatial domain.

14
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,240
And then took all of that information together

15
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,890
to generate a feathered octave images in the frequency domain.

16
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,090
And that was the process we went through.

17
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:03,070
So, basically, we computed the Fourier transforms of the images, and

18
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,739
feathered the corresponding octaves.

19
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,830
And used that, and built back up to generate a blended image.

20
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,630
Now, let's look at another whole method of trying to do this,

21
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:14,000
which will, intuitively, be a little simpler.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,200
And, actually, at the same time,

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,220
allow you to build your own tools to do this kind of blending.
