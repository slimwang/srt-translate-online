1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,486
1 divided by 9axy is correct. You're becoming a pro at these complex fractions

2
00:00:05,486 --> 00:00:09,053
if you got this one correct. The lowest common denominator might have been

3
00:00:09,053 --> 00:00:14,090
tricky, so let's find that first. We look at the denominators of 3 a squared b,

4
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,418
and ab. We know these two denominators share a common factor of a times b. The

5
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:22,797
other factor for this denominator is 3a. And the other factor for this

6
00:00:22,797 --> 00:00:27,980
denominator is 1. We multiply them together to get 3 times a squared times b.

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,798
And remember we want the highest power of any variable or factor that appears in

8
00:00:32,798 --> 00:00:37,324
our denominators, 3 is the highest number factor, a squared is the highest

9
00:00:37,324 --> 00:00:42,210
variable factor for a And 1b or just b is the highest for, well b. Next we

10
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:50,446
multiply by the LCD divided by LCD a form of one. These two factors would cancel

11
00:00:50,446 --> 00:00:56,384
out, leaving us with 2xy in the numerator. Here we can cancel out 1a and 1b.

12
00:00:56,384 --> 00:01:01,140
This means we have to drop this power down by one. Leaving us with 3a times this

13
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,920
expression. 3 times 6 is 18 and then we just list the product of the variables.

14
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,020
Now you might be wondering why I listed this a first instead of on the end.

15
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,304
Usually we list the product of the variables in alphabetical order but it's

16
00:01:15,304 --> 00:01:19,700
certainly okay to leave this a on the end. And finally we want to simplify our

17
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,718
rational expression. These are the factors of the numerator. And these are the

18
00:01:23,718 --> 00:01:28,526
factors of the denominator. We can cancel the factors that equal 1, which leaves

19
00:01:28,526 --> 00:01:33,680
us with a 1 in the numerator and 9 times a times x times y, in our denominator.

20
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,527
This is why it's important to remember that 2 divided by 2 equals 1. There's

21
00:01:38,527 --> 00:01:42,740
still a 1 in our numerator. We want to make sure that appears in our answer. We

22
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,390
can't simplify this anymore, since 1 is the only factor in our numerator so

23
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,943
we're completely done.
