1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,569
What nodes can be pruned in
this probabilistic game tree?

2
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:07,820
Check the boxes for nodes or
even full branches that could be pruned.

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,019
Then, find expected values
of each remaining node.

4
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:14,314
You can enter an exact number or
a range like less than or equal to 4.
