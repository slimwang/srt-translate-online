1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
An important application of that is to do digital signatures.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We think of physical signatures as authenticating documents.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
When something is signed, that means that the signer is responsible for the message in the document.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Physical signatures don't actually work very well for this purpose.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Someone can cut and paste a physical signature or maybe they can modify the document

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
after it's signed.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
There's nothing that really guarantees that the signature and the document are matched.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What we want with digital signatures is something much stronger than that.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We want something that shows that the person who signed it agreed to the message,

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and the message can't be changed without also breaking the signature.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
How can we do that with asymmetric cryptography?

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Here is our goal: we want Alice to be able to sign a message, transmit that message to Bob,

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Bob should be able to read the message.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and know that it could only have come from Alice.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The question is what should we use for the respective keys k1 and k2

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
in order to provide that digital signature where the message that Bob receives

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
proves that it was signed by Alice?

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Here are the choices.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We've used for k1 Alice's public key and k2 Alice's private key.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
For the second choice we'll use Bob's public key for k1 and Bob's private key for k2.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
For the third choice we'll use Alice private key for k1 and Alice's public key for k2.
