00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,900
Let's summarize things and
wrap up this lecture.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,181
I just want to repeat the points so

3
00:00:05,181 --> 00:00:09,580
you so reinforcement learning is
something that we can use in trading.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:15,260
The problem for reinforcement learning
algorithms is a Markov decision problem.

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,746
And reinforcement learning
algorithms solve them.

6
00:00:17,746 --> 00:00:23,060
A Markov decision problem
is defined by S, A, T, and

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:29,470
R, where S is the potential states,
A are the potential actions,

8
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:35,010
T is a transition probability, which is
given I'm in state s, I take action a,

9
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:41,420
what's the probability I'll end up in
state S', and R is the reward function.

10
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:46,190
The goal for reinforcement learning
algorithm is to find a policy, pi,

11
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:51,110
that maps a state to an action that we
should take, and its goal is to find

12
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:56,780
this pi such that it maximizes
some future sum of the reward.

13
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,300
We talked about that being
either infinite horizon,

14
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,800
fixed horizon, or discounted sum.

15
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,740
We can map our task for

16
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:11,413
trading to reinforcement learning and
it works out like this.

17
00:01:11,413 --> 00:01:15,075
S, our states,
are features about stocks and whether or

18
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,595
not we're holding a stock.

19
00:01:16,595 --> 00:01:20,245
Actions are buy, sell, or do nothing.

20
00:01:20,245 --> 00:01:24,395
The transition function here
is the market, and finally,

21
00:01:24,395 --> 00:01:28,535
the reward function is how much
money we get at the end of a trade.

22
00:01:28,535 --> 00:01:34,170
So, we can apply reinforcement learning
algorithms to find this policy.

23
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,750
We've mentioned a few of
those algorithms, for example

24
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,400
policy iteration, and value iteration,
and Q learning, but we haven't

25
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,090
talked in detail what they are, and
that's the subject of lessons coming up.

26
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,970
Okay, that's it for reinforcement
learning, I'll see you again soon.
