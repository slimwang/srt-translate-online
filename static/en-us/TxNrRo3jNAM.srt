Let me ask another trick question and that’s

2
00:00:02,589 --> 00:00:05,573
somewhat academic. For function f to qualify

3
00:00:05,573 --> 00:00:07,806
as an entity which of the conditions have to

4
00:00:07,806 --> 00:00:10,821
be fulfilled: has to be positive, non-negative,

5
00:00:10,821 --> 00:00:14,540
continuous, and smaller or equal to 1? Check

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,455
any or all that apply including the ‘none of

7
00:00:18,455 --> 00:00:21,255
above’ if you believe none of those apply.
