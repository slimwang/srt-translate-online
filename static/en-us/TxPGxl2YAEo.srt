1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
From 0 to 10, we have 5 individuals.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
From 11 to 20 it's 7.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
From 21 to 30, it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And finally from 31 to 40, it is the remaining 5 data points.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In this example, our chart would look like this.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This is a histogram that depicts the count in this data set as the function of the range.
