1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,840
So, this whole concept of how we can actually take a signal, and

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,490
represent it in a different way,

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:11,550
was something proposed by a famous mathematician known as Fourier, and

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,370
of course, this whole concept is also referred to as a Fourier transform.

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:16,239
So, in the previous slide,

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,675
when we did the work on trying to reconstruct a signal,

7
00:00:18,675 --> 00:00:21,880
[INAUDIBLE] have to remember that those impulse functions were repeating

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,490
themselves after a fixed period, so that's why that was a periodic function.

9
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,580
And we looked at them and basically concluded that a weighted sum of sines and

10
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,190
cosines of different frequencies, because we changed the frequencies,

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,830
allowed us to reconstruct that periodic function.

12
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:40,100
So in essence, what that says is that any periodic function can be

13
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,280
rewritten as a weighted sum of sines and cosines of different frequencies.

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,600
So in essence, what a Fourier transform does,

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,350
is it transforms a mathematical function of time, into a new function,

16
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:59,090
whose argument is frequencies, not time, and this frequency usually has units

17
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:04,760
of cycles per second repetition, and it's sometimes referred to as hertz,

18
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,540
and sometimes also kind of looked at as radians per second.

19
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,510
So it's no longer time steps, but is measured in,

20
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,720
how the frequency or how many times it's repeating itself.

21
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,360
And the new function basically is a frequency spectrum,

22
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,300
of the function f, we'll show what this means in a few seconds too.

23
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:29,330
Now, one thing to note is this operation, that goes from a function to

24
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:34,150
a Fourier transform has to be a reversible operation, and for

25
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:39,850
every frequency omega that goes from 0 to infinity, the Fourier

26
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:45,040
transform holds the amplitude A, and the phase, of the sine function,

27
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,620
again, we will look at this carefully, but in essence, we need to be able to

28
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,610
both look at the amplitude and the phase variations of the sine function,

29
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:56,170
cause that's something we want to be able to use to represent that signal.

30
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,980
So this is the equation that we want to be able to model, frequency, phase, and

31
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,290
this is the Fourier transform, A is the amplitude.
