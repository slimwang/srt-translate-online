1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,819
The answer's $107.80.

2
00:00:01,822 --> 00:00:07,350
So if you got it right, well done. Let's see how we got 107.80. I have a

3
00:00:07,362 --> 00:00:13,395
computer monitor, and the original price was $154. And, since the computer

4
00:00:13,407 --> 00:00:19,630
monitor is on sale, we know that we have to subtract the 30% from 100%, since it

5
00:00:19,642 --> 00:00:27,100
is decreasing the price, since it's on sale. So we have 154 times 100% minus

6
00:00:27,112 --> 00:00:32,833
30%. Well 100 minus 30 gives us 70%. Once again, whenever we use a percent in a

7
00:00:32,845 --> 00:00:39,806
problem, we have to convert it to a decimal. So, 70 percent is written as .7 as

8
00:00:39,818 --> 00:00:47,602
a decimal. We need to move the decimal place two places to the left. So, we have

9
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:49,169
154 >> Times .7.

10
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,003
When you multiply 154 times .7, we get 107.8. Now, this answer doesn't exactly

11
00:00:54,015 --> 00:00:58,780
like what we put in the box, because we're talking in dollars and cents. 107.8

12
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:03,210
in dollars is one hundred and seven dollars and eighty cents. Once again,

13
00:01:03,315 --> 00:01:07,851
remember to put the dollar sign, because it's a word problem and we need to

14
00:01:07,863 --> 00:01:09,014
include the units.
