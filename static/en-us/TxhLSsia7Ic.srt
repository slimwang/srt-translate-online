1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,270
Congratulations on
finishing the first level.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,240
You've learned a little
bit about game engines,

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,280
gaming platforms, how to break a game
down into its component parts, and

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,170
how LibGDX allows you to
write cross platform games.

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,970
Finally, you made sure you were
set up for success in this course.

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,090
Well, sorry for making you stare
at my face so much in this level.

7
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,510
That won't be a problem
in future levels,

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,770
since you'll actually be programming
instead of staring at me.

9
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:29,190
In the next level you'll set up your
tools, load up your first LibGDX project

10
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,130
and get your first game running on
your computer and on your phone.

11
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,370
The next two levels
are all about drawing.

12
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,690
You'll learn about the computer drawing
pipeline, draw some simple shapes, and

13
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,070
to spice things up a bit,
we'll also be drawing some fractals.

14
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:45,610
Level five is all about making those
shapes move around the screen.

15
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,200
We'll learn about the game loop and

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,930
we'll also set up some
cool fake physics.

17
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,710
In level six, we'll learn how to
handle user inputs including touches,

18
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,710
key presses and device orientation.

19
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,320
Level seven and eight will wrap
together everything you've learned so

20
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,770
far into the finished game.
