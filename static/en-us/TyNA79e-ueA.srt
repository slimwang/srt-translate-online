00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,469
So, to continue on, one of the things I'd like to kind of point is that

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:06,290
there's been an evolution in the whole field of photography.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,940
We've gone from cameras that look like this to that.

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,550
Our darkroom which used to be looking like this and

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,280
is now replaced by software on our computer.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,150
Which basically now means is that basically a whole lot of

7
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,780
people can actually be involved with this pipeline.

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,780
Photography is not just for the few, but everybody's exercising it.

9
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:30,810
That's why computational photography that encompasses all of this could be

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,042
just applied to photography in general but

11
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:36,824
also could be applied to advanced photography to generate novel types of

12
00:00:36,824 --> 00:00:39,552
images is becoming a very interesting discipline.
