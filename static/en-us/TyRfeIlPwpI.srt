For question 3, your goal is to define a procedure called median,

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,510
that takes three numbers as its inputs,

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,410
and outputs the median, which is the middle value, of those three numbers.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,210
Here are a few examples--

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,220
If the three inputs are 1, 2, and 3--

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,650
your procedure should output 2--

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,520
if the three inputs are 9, 3, and 6--

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,160
your output should be 6, since 3 is lower than 6--

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,890
but 6 is lower than 9--

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,230
and if the three inputs are 7, 8, and 7--

11
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,170
well, then the median is 7.

12
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,170
This is a pretty tough question, so I am going to give it 1 gold star.
