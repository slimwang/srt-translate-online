1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This change may be hard to think about,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
but it's relatively simple to implement.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Our procedure was named "optimize."

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So now, instead of having A be just tree 1

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and B be tree 3,

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
we're going to call ourselves recursively on our subchildren,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and then, only once they've both been optimized

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
do we check for the pattern.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This will correctly handle A plus 5 times 0.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I may need 1 more return tree at the bottom,

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
but that was assumed.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So it was as simple as adding 2 recursive calls

13
00:00:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
before we check for the pattern.
