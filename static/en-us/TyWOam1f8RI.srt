1
00:00:00,635 --> 00:00:03,270
So, one way of doing this is to draw a square

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,330
and then turn a little bit to the right and then

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,610
draw another square. And then turn a little bit to the

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:11,820
right again and then draw another square. And keep doing that. Let's

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,520
build that. So, here's the piece of code that draws a

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,760
square. And after I've done that, what I want the turtle to

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,980
do is turn a little bit to the right. So, let

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,880
me add a piece of code that says brad.right, let's say by

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,390
ten degrees. Now, because I want these two statements to

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,570
happen over and over again, I will put them inside a loop. So let me do that. So

11
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:40,680
I'm going to add a for loop by saying for i in range, let's say this

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,670
loop runs four times. I'll add a colon and then put these two

13
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:51,030
things inside the loop. Let me save, and run, and see

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,600
what happens. Ah-ha, so here is the output. We've drawn two squares,

15
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,020
three squares and it should stop, there it is four squares. So all I have to

16
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:08,180
do now, is let the turtle keep going around the circle, which has 360 degrees.

17
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,770
So, this loop should run not four times, but 36

18
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:17,720
times instead. Let me save and

19
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:23,773
run that. All right. There it is, folks. A circle made out of squares. Now

20
00:01:23,773 --> 00:01:26,356
I'm going to put some background music behind this

21
00:01:26,356 --> 00:01:28,702
video and let you enjoy our final creation.
