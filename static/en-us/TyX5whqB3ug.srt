1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,200
We're going to talk a little bit more

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,380
about streaming and in particular, specific applications

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,340
and how they work. We'll talk about

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,720
a streaming video application, YouTube, and a Voice

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,450
over IP or streaming audio application, Skype.

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,090
With YouTube, all uploaded videos are converted

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,660
to Flash or html5 and nearly every

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,320
browser has a Flash plugin. Thus, every browser

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,870
can essentially play these videos. HTTP and

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,530
TCP are implemented in every browser and the

11
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,540
streams easily get through most firewalls. So,

12
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,770
in this case, even though we've talked about

13
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,890
why TCP is suboptimal for streaming, the

14
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,950
designers of YouTube decided to keep things simple,

15
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,030
potentially at the expense of video quality.

16
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,435
When a client makes an HTTP request to

17
00:00:50,435 --> 00:00:54,510
youtube.com, it is redirected to a

18
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,120
content distribution network server located in

19
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,550
a content distribution network, such as

20
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,890
Limelight or perhaps even YouTube's own content

21
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:08,510
distribution network. We will talk about content distribution networks later on

22
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:16,440
in this course. When the client sends an HTTP get message to this CDN server,

23
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:23,430
the server responds with a video stream. Similarly with Skype, or Voice Over IP,

24
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:30,850
your analog signal is digitized through an A to D conversion and

25
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:36,320
this resulting digitized bit stream is sent over the internet.

26
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,520
In the case of Skype, this A to D conversion happens by way of the application.

27
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,030
And in the case of Voice over IP this

28
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,750
conversion might be performed with some kind of phone

29
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,600
adapter that you actually plug your phone into. An

30
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,940
example of that might be Vonage. In VoIP with an

31
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,100
analogue phone the adapter converts between the analogue and

32
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,200
digitial signal. It sends and recieves data packets and then

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,280
communicates with the phone in a standard way. Skype,

34
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,825
on the other hand, is based on what's known as

35
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:11,890
peer-to-peer technology. Where individual users, using

36
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,120
Skype, actually route voice traffic through one

37
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,015
another. We will talk more about

38
00:02:17,015 --> 00:02:20,740
peer-to-peer content distribution, later in this course.
