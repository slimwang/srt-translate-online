1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,850
Recall that we had this state
as a kind of hanging state.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,960
It had no successes state.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,330
And we said that, well this state can
be dismissed, but here is a question.

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,940
Who will dismiss it,
the generator or the tester?

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,390
What do you think, David?

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,840
So I think the tester would do it.

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,670
We could have the tester basically say
any state where there is only one person

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,890
on the side of the river that
has the boat can be pruned off,

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,590
because the only way to get into that
state is to send that person over.

10
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:33,585
And the only way to get out of that
state is to undo the previous move.

11
00:00:33,585 --> 00:00:37,665
So my rule would be for the tester,
any time only one person is

12
00:00:37,665 --> 00:00:41,355
on the side of the river with the boat,
throw out that state.

13
00:00:41,355 --> 00:00:44,015
>> What does everyone else think?

14
00:00:44,015 --> 00:00:45,095
Is David right about this?
