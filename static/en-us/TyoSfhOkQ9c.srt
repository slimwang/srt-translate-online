00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,080
One of the mistakes that
people often make is to

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,970
only test their site's
performance on the desktop.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,550
Because desktops are significantly
more powerful than mobiles,

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,910
it means you can miss performance issues
that only show up when on device's CPU,

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,470
memory or connectivity constrained.

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,350
What you want to do is where you can,
test on real devices.

7
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,820
If you have an Android device,

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,630
you can use the same Chrome DevTools
you know and love from your desktop.

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,390
So I can start it, interact, stop,

10
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,510
and you can see I got a timeline
that I can work with.

11
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,610
If you don't have an Android
device available,

12
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,570
you can check out
the instructor notes below for

13
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,610
how to use the emulation
settings in Chrome DevTools.

14
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,780
Remember though, that the performance
characteristics of simulators and

15
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,370
emulators are wildly
different to a device itself.

16
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,440
So while it's good for getting used to
the workflow, you'll need to test on

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,190
the device itself to make sure that you
don't have any performance issues there.

18
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,100
In the next video, Peter Lovis is
going to show you how you can use

19
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,870
Chrome DevTools with
your Andriod device.

20
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,270
If you already know, just skip ahead.
