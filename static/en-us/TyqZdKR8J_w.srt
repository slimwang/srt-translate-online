00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,356
For this, we'll have to use the z table. So if 5% is above the C score, then

2
00:00:05,356 --> 00:00:12,718
that means 95% has to be below the z score. So lets look in the table and find

3
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:20,278
.95. So in the body of the table again, we have the probability. Less than a

4
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:24,422
certain z score. This is the same as the proportion of values in the

5
00:00:24,422 --> 00:00:29,730
population, less than a certain z score. Let's zoom in a little. Here we have

6
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:40,146
0.9495, and 0.9505. Hopefully you can see that. 0.95 is in between those. So if

7
00:00:40,146 --> 00:00:46,900
you said either 1.64 or 1.65 then you got it right. Let's just say its about

8
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,824
1.65.
