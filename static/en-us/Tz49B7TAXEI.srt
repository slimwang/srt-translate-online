1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,260
We will also learn how to extend a bunch of these concepts that we're

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,230
learning about in this class to video.

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,578
Now, to be very honest,

4
00:00:06,578 --> 00:00:09,470
video is the real area that I work on as a researcher and

5
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:13,933
it's an academic discipline that I've been working on for oh, two decades now.

6
00:00:13,933 --> 00:00:17,128
In this class, I will introduce some of the basic ideas, some of

7
00:00:17,128 --> 00:00:21,211
them actually related to the work, we ourselves have done, of capturing video,

8
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:25,078
video of course as you know is becoming even a more popular medium now, ,.

9
00:00:25,078 --> 00:00:27,801
Sports video analysis becomes very common, and,

10
00:00:27,801 --> 00:00:29,637
as we start getting into fancier,

11
00:00:29,637 --> 00:00:34,090
newer types of cameras like the quadcopter cameras that are capturing video.

12
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,580
In this context we will learn about video textures and also learn about video

13
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:42,270
stabilization, two of the techniques that my group has also worked on, and

14
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,340
actually more importantly, we'll introduce you to the whole area of video with

15
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,470
a simple and fun experiment and assignment to let you do video textures.
