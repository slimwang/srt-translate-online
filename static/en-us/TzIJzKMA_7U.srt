00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,420
There are three main types of mobile
ads that can be used in a game.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,570
Banner ads, interstitial ads,
and offer walls.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,370
The most commonly used ads are banner
ads, which are banners, at the top or

4
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:14,890
bottom of the screen.

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,910
These are simple to place in your game
without obscuring the whole screen.

6
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,400
And you can size them to
fit different devices.

7
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:26,350
>> Another type of ad is interstitial
ads which take up the whole screen and

8
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,712
the user has to manually close them.

9
00:00:28,712 --> 00:00:31,160
They auto-fit the screen or
whatever device you're on.

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,510
And so you want to put them at
natural pauses in the game.

11
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,100
Because these ads take up more space,
and more of a player's attention than

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,930
banner ads, users are much
more likely to click on them.

13
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,129
And this makes these ads a little
more profitable than banner ads.

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,510
>> They take a lot of the screen
like interstitial ads,

15
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,840
but also include videos to watch.

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:56,470
And after you watch them, you can get
game power ups or in-game currency.

17
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,790
These are all good ways of
integrating ads into your game.

18
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,940
But it's important not
to have too many ads

19
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,390
because they may start
to seem like spam.

20
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:09,050
So place your adds at points where
it seems natural to pause and

21
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,080
keep your game experience a priority.
