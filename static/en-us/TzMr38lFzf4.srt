1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,060
Layout dependent on the size of my browser,

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,689
right? What happens if I rotate my phone?

3
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:06,210
>> If the dimensions of the layout viewpoint

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,380
change, the browser has to rerun the layout

5
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,530
step. That's what happens every time you rotate

6
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,210
your phone or, for that matter, resize your browser.

7
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,720
>> Hm, I see. So our examples are pretty

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,740
simple but could this possibly a performance bottle neck?

9
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,800
>> Yep, let's take a look at their tools. I've captured a trace of gizmodo.com

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,250
which is a popular new site. If you're curious you can grab this trace from

11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,119
the instructor notes and follow along. Let's take

12
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,370
a look. First of all, there's a turn

13
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,300
of events here. Since we're only interested

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,630
in layout, let's filter out the loading, scripting,

15
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,610
and painting events. Okay, here's the first layout

16
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,840
event. Check it out. It took 145 milliseconds.

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,520
>> Wow! That's a long time.

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,580
>> Yeah, as you can see there are over 1400 nodes. In the tree.

19
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:55,260
>> Huh. but there are other layout events in here. What's going on?

20
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,020
>> That's a great question. Recall that

21
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,970
any time we update the render tree, either

22
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,350
by modifying styles or the content, there's

23
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,670
a good chance we have to rerun layout.

24
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:05,910
And in this case, it looks like

25
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,310
that's exactly what's happening. The page is adding

26
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,460
new content and modifying styles, and hence, we

27
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,470
need to run layout a few more times.

28
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,980
>> Hm. I see. So how do you go about optimizing for that?

29
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,910
>> It really depends on the site, but a good rule

30
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,630
of thumb is to batch updates to avoid having multiple layout events.
