00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:06,010
It doesn't seem to make much sense to have a room that is 0 square meters in

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:10,069
area. So I'm going to say that A of 0 equals 0 does not make sense in the

3
00:00:10,069 --> 00:00:14,899
context of this story. We know that Grant definitely wants a room to exist. His

4
00:00:14,899 --> 00:00:19,689
employees want to have a lot of fun. We need actual space to do that in, 0 just

5
00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:24,318
doesn't really make sense. We also have A of negative 3 equals 18 meters

6
00:00:24,318 --> 00:00:28,930
squared. In this first one that we marked off, neither the input nor the output

7
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,577
really makes sense. But in the second choice, it's a little bit trickier because

8
00:00:33,577 --> 00:00:38,257
the output seems totally fine. Grant could conceivably have a room that was 18

9
00:00:38,257 --> 00:00:43,127
meters squared in area. However, since x is a length, it doesn't really make

10
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:47,578
sense to plug in negative 3 for it's value. What kind of ruler could you use to

11
00:00:47,578 --> 00:00:51,510
measure a negative length? So this trace doesn't really make sense either.
