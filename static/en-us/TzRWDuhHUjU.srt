1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,932
We should multiply this equation by negative 2. If I distribute this negative 2

2
00:00:05,932 --> 00:00:11,212
to each term, then I can see that I were to get negative 2 times 5x, which is

3
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:15,498
negative 10x. Negative 2 times positive 2y, which is negative 4y. And negative 2

4
00:00:15,498 --> 00:00:19,708
times positive 1, which is negative 2. And look at that, we're ready to do

5
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:24,366
elimination, if positive 10x and negative 10x. These terms have the same

6
00:00:24,366 --> 00:00:29,028
absolute value of 10 but one is positive and the other's negative, so we know

7
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:30,894
when we add them they sum to 0.
