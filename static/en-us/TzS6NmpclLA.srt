1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,560
For our first animation,
let's animate the clock.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,190
To start, we'll need to open up
the Animation Apartment scene.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,710
Next, we need to open up
the Animation window.

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,085
Go to window, Animation.

5
00:00:15,105 --> 00:00:18,315
That'll create
the Animation Timeline window.

6
00:00:18,315 --> 00:00:21,285
Let's go ahead and
drag that next to the console.

7
00:00:21,285 --> 00:00:23,325
Now, to start using
the animation window,

8
00:00:23,325 --> 00:00:26,295
we need to select
an object in the hierarchy.

9
00:00:26,295 --> 00:00:29,095
In this scene,
we'll be animating the clock.

10
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:30,255
More specifically for

11
00:00:30,255 --> 00:00:35,280
our clock, let's select our clock
handle seconds game object, and now in

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,190
our Animation window we should now
have an option to create an animation.

13
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:45,292
Let's go ahead and create one and
call it seconds rotation.

14
00:00:45,292 --> 00:00:48,090
It'll be saved as a .anim file.

15
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,350
As soon as we do that,

16
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,930
our window now turns into a timeline
which is also known as the dope sheet.

17
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,470
On the left, we can add properties
that we want to animate.

18
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,190
These can be components on
the current game object or

19
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,690
components of children game objects.

20
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:07,190
Since we want to animate the hands of
the clock, let's animate it's rotation.

21
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:12,230
From properties,
let's select transform rotation.

22
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:16,170
Once we do that, you'll notice that
rotation is added as a property and

23
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,930
there are couple of diamonds at
zero seconds and one second.

24
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,460
Those diamonds represent key frames.

25
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,540
Key frames are points in our animation
where we can update our properties.

26
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,670
In this case, the rotation of our clock.

27
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,030
For any new property,

28
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,330
Unity creates two points by default that
are initialized to the current values.

29
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,380
We can add a new key frame to
the animation by double-clicking

30
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,040
on the timeline.

31
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,510
We can also drag key frames
around to whatever time we want.

32
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,210
For example something like 0.5 seconds.

33
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,660
To update a key frame we need
to drag the timeline selector

34
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,550
to a key frame we want to edit.

35
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:57,440
To edit this key frame, let's go
ahead and set this rotation to 180.

36
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:02,620
And then for the last key frame, let's
go ahead and set its rotation to 360.

37
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,480
Notice how the backgrounds for

38
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,590
the rotation values are all
highlighted in red.

39
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,310
That means the Animation window
is recording our changes and

40
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,665
setting them as key frame values.

41
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:16,065
This lets us know we
are editing the right property.

42
00:02:16,065 --> 00:02:19,505
Now let's find the play button
in the animation window.

43
00:02:19,505 --> 00:02:21,995
This play button slowly
runs our animation,

44
00:02:21,995 --> 00:02:25,275
as opposed to the main play button,
which runs the entire scene.

45
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:28,475
So now, if we hit the play
button in the animation window,

46
00:02:28,475 --> 00:02:29,955
we'll see our hands start to rotate.
