1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,000
>> Okay, cool. So we're back, I've seen this

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,520
before. We've made an object, this is good. we

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,010
have all these things, again, standard fields, custom fields,

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,100
what are these guys. Related lookup validation, all that.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,520
>> So these are different things that we can build, mainly

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,810
business logic, around our attendee object. And so we'll go into more

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,770
of what this is later, but we'll be able to create

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,540
validation rules for making sure that we input good data, page layouts

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,260
for being able to modify how that form looks when we create a record. All

10
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,920
these different layouts, I mean, this is really

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,320
your one-stop shop for modifying your attendee object.

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,280
>> Okay.

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,150
>> And at the very top, boom.

14
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,790
>> Oh yeah, we've got our tab. All right.

15
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,900
Cool. So we want to add a field, right?

16
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,680
>> Yes, let's add some fields.
