00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,860
Knowledge based approaches rely on
experts to develop a set of rules

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,770
that describe the normal and legitimate
behaviors observed during training.

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:15,290
For example, these rules can classify
activities into different classes.

4
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:20,440
For example, a rule can say that
a secretary typically only uses

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:25,100
office productivity programs
such as web browser, email,

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,810
calendar, and Microsoft Office.

7
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,500
These rules are quite robust and

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,850
flexible because it's relatively
easy to update and improve them.

9
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:39,910
On the other hand, these approaches
rely on manual efforts by the experts,

10
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,180
and the experts must have very
good knowledge of the data.
