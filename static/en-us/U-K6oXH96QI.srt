00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,380
Welcome to the coding portions of lesson three. In this

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,531
lesson, we're going to learn how to use Objectify to

3
00:00:06,531 --> 00:00:09,932
save entities in the datastore. We're going to use entities of

4
00:00:09,932 --> 00:00:14,580
kind profile to save user profile information. And we're going to

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,790
learn how to get the user ID of a logged

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,690
in user to use it to generate a unique ID

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,680
for the entity's key. Once we've created some data and

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,830
saved it in the datastore, we're going to use the Datastore Viewer

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,330
in the Admin Console to look at the data that we've saved. Make sure that

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,550
it saved like we thought it would. And

11
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,900
there's no point putting data into the datastore

12
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,100
if you can't get it back out. So then we're going to learn how to get

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,070
an entity out of the datastore if you

14
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,370
know its key. Let's go create some profiles.
