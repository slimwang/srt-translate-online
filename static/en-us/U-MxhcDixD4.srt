00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So another kind of big classic questions I've been 
seeing in the forum's lecture is hosting.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Specifically people want to know if you're not using 
Google App Engine, what else should I do?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Or why should you use Google App 
Engine instead of the alternatives.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So let's talk about each of those. The first 
option is to run your website locally.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And this basically means run this out of a machine 
that's in your house, or in your dorm room,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
or it's your everyday computer--the same 
machine you might be developing,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
which works fine for this class.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Basically, the website doesn't 
have to be on all the time.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It just has to be on while your submitting 
your homeworks and that's it.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
For almost every other use case, 
it doesn't really make sense.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Some of the big drawbacks are--it's not always on.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The Internet doesn't go to sleep 
neither should your website.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's not always accessible. By that, I mean your 
Internet may be broken or power goes down.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
There's lots of--you're running in the house. 
It's not a data center.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So there's lots of things that can go wrong. 
Your IP may change.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Depending on your hosting provider, you may 
need to pay extra for what's called a static IP,

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and this is an IP that you have to 
pay extra for so your IP address.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Basically, the location of your machine 
on the Internet doesn't change.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Because you want to have a name 
for your website--domain name--

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and that domain matches to an IP.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
If your IP changes all the time, which it does with 
most Internet connections, it won't work out.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Now there's technologies to work around this 
but probably won't have a static IP.
