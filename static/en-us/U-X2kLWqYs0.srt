1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,139
Open up the first exercise
in the third lesson,

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,050
the one that's called exercise
recycler view layout.

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:11,109
Unlike in the previous lessons, for this
app you're going to fill out a different

4
00:00:11,109 --> 00:00:14,209
part of the recycler
view with each exercise.

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:18,109
And we've given you the entire rest of
the code, which means once you complete

6
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:21,239
your changes you can build and
run the project and see it working.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,789
In this exercise we'll be mainly
modifying these files but

8
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:30,299
we've also provided you with
this file called ColorUtils.

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,000
It contains a method that colors
the view holders for the recycler view.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,755
Feel free to explore
the ColorUtils file and

11
00:00:37,755 --> 00:00:40,750
its documentation but
we won't be do any changes here.

12
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:46,959
Currently our activity main layout
includes the frame layout and

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,740
that includes a text view in it.

14
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,240
The text view simply displays
the text hello world.

15
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,219
In this exercise,

16
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,890
we'll be replacing this entire
text view with a recycler view.

17
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,859
But to do that,

18
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:02,539
we first need to add the recycler view
dependency in the build.gradle file.

19
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:08,299
Inside the build.gradle file we can add
a new dependency by typing in compile.

20
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:12,750
And then because the recycler view is
part of the Android Support Library,

21
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,689
the dependency line starts
with com.android.support.

22
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:19,700
And then colon,
followed by the word recyclerview.

23
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,670
And then followed by v7,

24
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,778
which is the library type that allows
us to target Gingerbread devices.

25
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:29,382
And then followed by colon and
the version of the library.

26
00:01:29,382 --> 00:01:32,915
Because we just made this change
in the build.gradle file,

27
00:01:32,915 --> 00:01:36,253
we need to sync the project
with the new gradle settings.

28
00:01:36,253 --> 00:01:41,114
Now, let's change the text view here and
replace it with the recycler view.

29
00:01:41,114 --> 00:01:47,609
The recycler view needs to cover the
entire space in the parent frame layout.

30
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:51,194
So we need to set it to,
you guessed it, match_parent.

31
00:01:52,269 --> 00:01:55,018
Now that we've created
our recycler view,

32
00:01:55,018 --> 00:01:57,920
we need to assign it
an ID called rv_numbers.

33
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,460
This is the ID that everywhere else
in the code is expecting it to have.

34
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:09,079
Once we add the ID to our recycler
view everything should be set up and

35
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,110
ready to go.

36
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,010
Note that we could also replace the
entire frame out with this recycler view

37
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:17,469
because the frame layout isn't
really serving any purpose anymore.

38
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:20,710
We encourage you to go and
try out what we just did yourself.

39
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,330
Start by adding a recycler
view dependency and

40
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:27,010
then change the activity main
to contain the recycler view.

41
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:31,569
You can see what needs to be done,
by checking this TODO tab down here.

42
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:35,199
It would list all the TODO items
that we've assigned for you.

43
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:37,099
The rest of the work is already done.

44
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:40,639
So, you'll be able to see the recycler
view in action right away and

45
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,149
know that you've done
your work correctly.
