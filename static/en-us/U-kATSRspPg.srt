00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,370
In fact,
no matter what the care setting,

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:07,590
without electronic assistance,
physicians often don't coordinate well.

00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,650
The Commonwealth Fund
surveys patients like Marla.

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:16,280
In 2011 they found that,
quote, to varying degrees in

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,080
all countries chronically ill or
sicker patients encounter

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,670
failures of providers to communicate
with each other or coordinate care.

7
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:29,140
Yet in each country, patients with
primary care practices that help them

8
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:34,020
navigate the care system and
provide easy access are far less

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,350
likely to encounter duplication delays
and failures to share information.

10
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:44,770
Unsaid here is that almost all patients
in patient-centered practices,

11
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:49,030
shown in red here,
are using electronic records.

12
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:53,200
And you can see that they have lower,
actually significantly lower,

13
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,970
reported rates of care
coordination problems.
