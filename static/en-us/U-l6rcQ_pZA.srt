00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,350
Computer science is a highly collaborative study, especially when you're

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:09,880
looking at the working world. Everyone works together to pull out and put

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,560
together this beautiful product. Let's look at Facebook and let's look at

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,290
Google. You're going to see thousands of programmers sitting in different

5
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:21,535
rooms, coding and sharing their ideas as well as lots of people coming in who

6
00:00:21,535 --> 00:00:26,530
want to enhance your idea. Or perhaps change your idea. And you're not always

7
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,290
going to be able to be there to explain it. So documenting your code is really,

8
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:34,850
really important to be able to work as a very fast paced efficient team, and to

9
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,240
make impact on the products that you work on very quickly.
