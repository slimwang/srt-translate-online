Here's another principle by Robert Martin,

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:07,170
called the Interface Segregation Principle. Robert Martin developed this,

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,950
principle, which suggests that clients depend on an interface to

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:16,335
a part of a large class's features rather than directly on the large class.

5
00:00:16,335 --> 00:00:20,120
Note the relationship of this principle to role-based design that we discussed

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,440
earlier in the course. In role based design, classes are synthesised from

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:29,580
interfaces each of which reflect a role that objects of that class might play.

8
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,930
The implication of this principle, like that of role based design,

9
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,230
is that class interfaces should be broken into small pieces,

10
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,270
each corresponding to a single use case.
