1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So the task for you now is to implement the function with three input arguments

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
that it computes this number over here so that it can vary any of those

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and still get the absolute correct answer for this function over here.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
If you've never programmed before, this is tricky.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You have to add one more argument and you have to change the returned function to implement

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
a formula just like this but this using p0, p1, p2

7
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
as arguments not just the fixed numerical numbers here.
