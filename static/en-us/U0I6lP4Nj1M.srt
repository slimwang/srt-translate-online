Hi, I'm James.

2
00:00:01,476 --> 00:00:03,833
Welcome to this course on Canvas 2D.

3
00:00:03,833 --> 00:00:07,266
We're going to teach you how to use the canvas API using memes with my

4
00:00:07,266 --> 00:00:08,836
co-instructor, Cameron.

5
00:00:08,836 --> 00:00:09,772
Cameron.

6
00:00:09,772 --> 00:00:10,425
Cameron.

7
00:00:10,425 --> 00:00:11,508
>> Oh.

8
00:00:11,508 --> 00:00:12,229
Hey, sorry.

9
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:13,674
Am I late?

10
00:00:13,674 --> 00:00:14,496
My bad.

11
00:00:14,496 --> 00:00:17,539
>> So much for coordinating what we're going to wear beforehand.

12
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:19,774
Let's fix that.

13
00:00:19,774 --> 00:00:20,961
>> Huh.

14
00:00:20,961 --> 00:00:22,220
Doge.

15
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,220
I like it.

16
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,700
>> So, what's with the box?

17
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,840
>> Well, you said we'd be painting with canvas, right?

18
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,320
So, I brought some acrylics, I brought some brushes, I brought a palette.

19
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,250
>> Hold, hold up.

20
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,490
I'm going to give you an A for

21
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,440
effort, but I actually was talking about the canvas API inside the browser.

22
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,500
So, we're going to do all our painting with JavaScript code.

23
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,660
>> Oh, oh, that kind of Canvas.

24
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,210
My bad.

25
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,990
Well, anyways, the Canvas is a powerful API which you can use to edit,

26
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,550
resize and otherwise change images, animations, and interactions.

27
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,470
>> Though we won't cover it any detail,

28
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:55,630
you can even use the Canvas to create games that run inside the browser.

29
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:56,310
Okay.

30
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,020
Let's get started.
