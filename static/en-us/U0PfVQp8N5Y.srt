1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,110
That does it for
protocols and extensions.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,230
These skills are really going to come in
handy as you get deeper into building

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,850
apps with UIkit.

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,090
Next up,
our last lesson is all about closures.

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,730
Closures are serious business,
a real challenge for

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,260
every iOS developer
the first time around.

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,370
So rest up and

8
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,660
get ready to learn an entirely
new approach to using functions.
