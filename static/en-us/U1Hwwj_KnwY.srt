00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,585
So there are lots of good reason to use race. For this quiz, we're going to use

2
00:00:03,585 --> 00:00:07,486
it purely for fun, purely to obfuscate our code. And the question is which of

3
00:00:07,486 --> 00:00:10,936
these code fragments print out raise a ruckus? Check all the ones that do. Of

4
00:00:10,936 --> 00:00:14,590
course you could solve this by just running the code in Python, but I want you

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:18,086
to try to figure it out without doing that. If you can solve this without

6
00:00:18,086 --> 00:00:20,823
running the code, then you definitely deserve a raise.
