1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,290
We're almost done with our login, but

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,990
before we go to the next view,
we need to grab the user's ID.

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,990
If we look back to the methods of
the documentation like the one for

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,605
adding and removing a favorite we
can see this ID in curly braces.

5
00:00:13,605 --> 00:00:18,405
And like we said a little bit before,
this ID corresponds to the user ID and

6
00:00:18,405 --> 00:00:19,475
getting it ahead of time and

7
00:00:19,475 --> 00:00:23,035
storing it will save us having to
make requests later when we want to

8
00:00:23,035 --> 00:00:26,063
add favorites, or do something
else that requires the user ID.

9
00:00:26,063 --> 00:00:30,355
Back in Xcode lets go to
the get session ID method and

10
00:00:30,355 --> 00:00:33,950
lets go to the bottom where
the completion handler is finishing.

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,100
Here we go.

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,550
And we've stored the session ID and
now it's just called get user ID.

13
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:43,030
And if we look at the get user ID
method, it's empty and it's ready for

14
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,300
you to implement.

15
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,330
So for this exercise, find the correct
movie database method to use to get

16
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:52,830
the user ID, implement the seven steps,
then store the user ID and

17
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,150
call the completeLogin method.

18
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,330
If you do all this correctly,

19
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,640
then the completeLogin method
will go to the next view.

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,050
And when you're done, check this box.
