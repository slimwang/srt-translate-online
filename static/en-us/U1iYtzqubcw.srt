1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,120
Let's say that we wanted to compare the batting averages

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,880
of left handed and right handed hitters in major league baseball.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,150
So we're curious in answering the question, is there any difference

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,770
between the batting averages of lefties and righties? We could just

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,950
look at the data and try to answer this question without

6
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,990
a significance test. But then we really couldn't trust our answer

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,140
very much. It's a much better idea to answer this question

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,070
using a statistical test. Many statistical tests that you might use

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,190
to analyze data make an assumption about the probability distribution

10
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,570
that your data will follow. There are many different probability distributions

11
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,860
out there, but one of the most common and the

12
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,030
one that I want to discuss is the normal distribution, which

13
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,100
is also sometimes referred to as the Gaussian distribution or

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,050
a Bell curve. If you've taken an introduction to statistics course,

15
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,430
the normal distribution should be familiar. Which of the images below

16
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,720
depicts a normal distribution? Check the box below the correct one.
