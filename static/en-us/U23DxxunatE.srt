1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,294
This ellipse would be centered at negative 1 comma 3. It'll have an a value of

2
00:00:05,294 --> 00:00:10,872
1 and it would have a b value of 5. Nice work if you got these 3 correct. We

3
00:00:10,872 --> 00:00:14,900
can find this center by looking at the x squared term and the y squared term.

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,853
The x is a plus 1 x to it so that means the x coordinate of the center will be

5
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:26,015
negative 1 and the value y has a negative 3 or subtraction of 3 next to it. So,

6
00:00:26,015 --> 00:00:30,748
this means that the y coordinate of the center is positive 3. Always keep in

7
00:00:30,748 --> 00:00:33,988
mind that the values of h and k for our center are the opposite of these two

8
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:40,560
signs. This will always be true for circles and ellipses. So, now we need to

9
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,205
find the values of a and b. So, what we should do is take our equation and

10
00:00:45,205 --> 00:00:50,149
divide through by 100. That will set our equation equal to 1. So, here's my

11
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:55,294
original equation and now we're going to divide each term by 100. A 100 divided

12
00:00:55,294 --> 00:01:01,586
by a 100 equals 1, so this will simplify. An then we have 4 divided by a 100.

13
00:01:01,586 --> 00:01:08,142
Well 4 divided by 4 equals 1. An 4 divided it into 100, equals 25. So, we'll

14
00:01:08,142 --> 00:01:11,854
have 1 in our numerator, with the y minus 3 squared divided by 25 and the

15
00:01:11,854 --> 00:01:17,340
denominator. I don't write the 1 here because it's just multiplication, 1 times

16
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,749
any expression is itself. And then finally, on the right hand side, we'll just

17
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:27,690
have 1. Now we want this equation to look like this one. But notice I don't

18
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:32,795
have an a squared term, I don't exactly have a fraction here but really I do.

19
00:01:32,795 --> 00:01:37,004
Remember we can divide any expression by 1, dividing by 1 will give us this

20
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:43,322
same exact expression. So, now I can rewrite these denominators with 1 squared

21
00:01:43,322 --> 00:01:49,094
equally 1 and 5 squared equaling 25. This is how we get the values away and b,

22
00:01:49,094 --> 00:01:54,330
and thinking back to our center. The value of h really needs to be negative 1

23
00:01:54,330 --> 00:02:00,445
in order for the equation to have positive 1. And the value of k would need to

24
00:02:00,445 --> 00:02:06,516
be 3 since we'll have 3 here. So, we can see that our center is at negative 1,

25
00:02:06,516 --> 00:02:12,015
3. Then we move 1 unit left and right to get 2 points on our ellipse. And we

26
00:02:12,015 --> 00:02:17,464
move 5 units up and down to get two more points on the ellipse. Highlighting

27
00:02:17,464 --> 00:02:21,112
these points, we can see that these two are 5 units above and below our center,

28
00:02:21,112 --> 00:02:26,276
and that this point is 1 unit to the right of our center. Now desmos isn't

29
00:02:26,276 --> 00:02:30,111
showing this point, but that's just because it only shows us certain points of

30
00:02:30,111 --> 00:02:34,394
interest. Now, there a reason why it's only showing us these points of

31
00:02:34,394 --> 00:02:38,615
interest. And when you learn more about ellipses, you'll discover why these

32
00:02:38,615 --> 00:02:43,454
points are so important. For this one, it happens to be a y intercept. And, in

33
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:47,548
fact, desmos will also tell us the x intercepts. These other two points are

34
00:02:47,548 --> 00:02:51,360
really important and perhaps you can do some research to figure out why.
