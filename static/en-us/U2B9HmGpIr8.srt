00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,780
So now that we've reviewed all the shpaes that we've encountered so far, let's

2

00:00:08,234 --> 00:00:13,772
conic this equation represents. Is it a circle, a hyperbola, an ellipse, or a

4
00:00:13,772 --> 00:00:19,020
parabola. Then if it's a hyperbola or a parabola, check all the directions in

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,090
which it opens.
