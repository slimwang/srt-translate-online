00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,320
So in the, the previous two examples we were talking about the value of

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,420
an attribute and those are usually pretty straightforward. Let's now talk about

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:14,415
operations. OCL provides a way to specify operations using pre and

4
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:17,710
post-condition constraints. These are different keywords in the language.

5
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:21,460
In this case, we're going to look at requirement three, which describes some

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,670
query operations. Now by query operation, I mean an operation that is asking

7
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:31,260
about the value of an attribute, but not changing anything. So, in this case,

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,010
it should be straightforward to have an operation that returns that value.

9
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,180
So, the requirement itself says, in addition, at any particular point in time,

10
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,760
the library may need to know or to calculate. The items a patron has

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,520
checked out, when they are due and any outstanding overdue fines. So,

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,010
let's concentrate on a part about the items a patron has currently checked out.

13
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,250
So, previously when we did our analysis, we associated this text with

14
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,080
an operation class patron called items currently checked out.

15
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,460
What we need to do now is to say something about that particular operation.

16
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,490
We need to make it stated more precisely then just saying that it exists. And

17
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:18,260
in fact, we have to say that the value computed by this operation corresponds to

18
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:23,572
just those items that are checked out for that patron. Recall that we have a,

19
00:01:23,572 --> 00:01:29,130
an association between patron and loanable item.

20
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,730
And that association is going to record what items are checked out.

21
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,490
And now we're talking about the operation in patrons, so

22
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:40,380
essentially that operation is querying the association, and

23
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,480
we want to make sure that what the operation returns is in fact,

24
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,910
what's appropriately expressed in the association.
