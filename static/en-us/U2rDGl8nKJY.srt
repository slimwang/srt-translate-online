1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer happens to be no.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
If I draw the original blue data points, the data is indeed linear,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
but this data point over here of a house of size 2100 square feet

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
sold remarkably cheap, so we get the point right over here.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Similarly, the house of size 1300 square feet sold for a lot.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Both of these data points are outliers.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We'll talk about outliers later.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
There is clearly no way to fit a linear function through all those data points.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I would even question that this wicked kind of function that I drew is a good

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
accurate representation of the relationship between size and price.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You would not expect that as you go south of 1500 square feet

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
that the price would rapidly increase and then decrease again

13
00:00:53,000 --> 99:59:59,999
because there is likely nothing special about small houses than justifies the price over here.
