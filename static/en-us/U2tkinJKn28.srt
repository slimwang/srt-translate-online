1
00:00:00,251 --> 00:00:02,682
And, the correct answer here is 0. Any specific

2
00:00:02,682 --> 00:00:05,817
continuous thing, 0. For uniform distribution,

3
00:00:05,817 --> 00:00:07,903
we find that the interval weâ€™re talking about

4
00:00:07,903 --> 00:00:11,034
skates between 0 and 60 so the correct

5
00:00:11,034 --> 00:00:15,034
answer is 1 over 60 and that is 0.01666.
