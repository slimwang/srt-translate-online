1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:00,850
All right.

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,320
Welcome back to Computer Vision.

3
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,450
If you remember last time,

4
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,850
we started talking about
discriminative classifiers.

5
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,410
So we first did generative,
then we did discriminative.

6
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,490
And the idea of discriminative
classification or

7
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,890
recognition is that instead of
worrying about modeling our classes,

8
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,190
we're going to learn a boundary.

9
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,280
We're going to learn a surface, and some
feature space that divides our classes.

10
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,410
And we've talked about two simple
method, well actually, one simple

11
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,430
method, nearest neighbor, a much
more interesting method of boosting.

12
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,420
Last time, we were talking about
the Viola-Jones face detector which

13
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,430
used boosting.

14
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,460
But today we're going to talk
about support vector machines.

15
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,436
Support vector machines became
a very significant method of doing

16
00:00:39,436 --> 00:00:42,927
classification, and especially
is applied to computer vision.

17
00:00:42,927 --> 00:00:47,250
It really and today, and
still today is is, is fundamental
