00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,600
Hi there,
welcome to week two of the program.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,820
This week we have a guest instructor,
Andrew Trask.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,900
Andrew is a PhD student at
the University of Oxford,

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,370
where he studies deep learning for
natural language processing.

5
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:17,099
He's also the author of grokking Deep
Learning, which teaches deep learning to

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,809
anyone with Python skills and
basic math knowledge.

7
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:24,419
Andrew will be leading you through
building a network to predict sentiment,

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,520
positive or negative in movie reviews.

9
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,280
Then we'll cover methods such as,
Bag of Words, and

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:35,770
Word2vec for transforming text into
vectors we can use inputs to a network.

11
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,020
And finally, we'll give you
a brief introduction to TFLearn,

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,670
a high-level Python library for
quickly building neural networks.

13
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:47,789
Then, will show you how to use TFLearn
for more advanced sentiment analysis.

14
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:48,759
All right, let's get started.
