1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,230
Okay, I'm going to try my, my little

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:06,090
friend on the right here. And, okay, validation rules.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:06,630
>> Yup.

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:11,390
>> Excellent, new. Okay, rule name, I want

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:15,370
to call this, Valid Ticket Number Checker. How's that?

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,370
>> It's a little weird, but.

7
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,450
>> Valid ticket number?

8
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,054
>> Let's run with it. There you go.

9
00:00:20,054 --> 00:00:21,233
[LAUGH]

10
00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:25,940
>> in description make sure that you've got less than eight tickets.

11
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:30,230
>> Yeah, and I mean, while we're checking, you know, bad data, why don't

12
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,150
we just make sure there's also more than zero tickets. So at least one ticket.

13
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,830
>> Okay, that makes sense. And, you've bought at least one ticket.

14
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,970
>> So the weird thing about validation

15
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,980
rules is they're a little backwards. The

16
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,540
rule that you create needs to check if the formula is true, which means

17
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,840
whatever equation you're building needs to evaluate to

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,770
true in order to throw an error message.

19
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,690
>> So basically, I want to say, instead

20
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,330
of saying, making sure, make sure it's between

21
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,800
one and eight. I want to make sure it's not less than one or greater than eight.

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,580
>> Exactly.

23
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,570
>> That makes, I mean sort of makes sense, but I'll roll

24
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:10,380
with it. Okay, so I guess I'm going to use this little hierarchy thing.

25
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,740
>> It

26
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,160
allows you to choose fields on the attendee object, or even of of related

27
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,360
objects. But yeah, just click the fields

28
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,920
that you're trying to add into this formula.

29
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,260
>> Tickets purchased, I think.

30
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:20,640
>> Yep.

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,660
>> Okay, so I'm going to make sure, I

32
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:27,560
want to check if tickets purchased is greater than eight.

33
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,140
>> Yep.

34
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,190
>> I can just do that, right?

35
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:29,670
>> Yep.

36
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,840
>> I want to do or, how do I do or?

37
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,290
>> Check that insert operator.

38
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,956
>> Oh, sweet. Okay.

39
00:01:36,956 --> 00:01:46,170
Or tickets purchased, less than one.

40
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,190
>> Right.

41
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,750
>> Okay, I'm going to check to make sure I didn't screw anything up too bad.

42
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,080
>> And this looks pretty similar to the formula we just made doesn't it?

43
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,950
>> Yeah, yeah. It's cool that you can do all this

44
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:03,490
with just the mouse. Okay, no errors found. Okay, error message. Dude.

45
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,140
You have to buy between 1 and 8 tickets. Okay,

46
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,300
Save. Okay. I'm going to, obviously, try and break this rule now.

47
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:20,690
>> So, let's create a new one. New attendee. Maybe, Sally Scalper?

48
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:25,270
>> Oh, nice. Sally Scalper, you're not getting in through my validation rule.

49
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:25,270
>>

50
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,838
[LAUGH]

51
00:02:26,838 --> 00:02:34,290
>> Email, thief@evil.whatever. purchase source, box office. If

52
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,875
she'll try to buy general admission tickets, she'll try to buy ten of them, for

53
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:44,280
Cloudstock. And let's to see what happens to Sally Scalper.

54
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:50,230
Ha, she was foiled, she was thwarted in her evil attempts to scalp tickets.

55
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:50,230
>>

56
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:50,972
[LAUGH]

57
00:02:50,972 --> 00:02:52,710
>> Okay, that's pretty cool.

58
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:52,710
>>

59
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,470
[LAUGH].

60
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,910
>> Alright, Sam this is pretty cool, we did all of

61
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:00,250
this object building and field adding, and things are updating automatically.

62
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,020
>> Formulas, validation, like does your head feel like it's about to explode?

63
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,830
>> No, no. It's actually, it's alright.

64
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,460
>> That's awesome.

65
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,200
>> Which, I mean, so we've only done it for attendees and festivals. I

66
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,880
guess next step is to do it with bands and stages and all that.

67
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,900
>> Yeah! Let's do it!
