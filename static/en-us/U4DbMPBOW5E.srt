1
00:00:00,282 --> 00:00:03,600
Alpha beta pruning could still provide
some performance improvements when

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,790
applied to expectimax game
tress that have finite limits

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,620
on the values the evaluation
function returns.

4
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:12,979
In this case,
the right branch of the middle subtree

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:17,170
is pruned as well as the last
value on the rightmost branch.

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,429
We'll revisit this example in detail
later in this unit to explain

7
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:21,169
precisely why.
