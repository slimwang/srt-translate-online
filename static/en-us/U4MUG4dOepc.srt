00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,490
So, the first thing I will do on

2
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:05,600
my Windows machine, is open Python and IDLE. Here's

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,230
how to do it. I can go to the

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:12,060
Start Menu, hit All Programs, find Python 2.7, which

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:17,040
is what we just installed and launch IDLE. On

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,380
a Mac, this is what you'll need to do.

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:25,640
I will go to Spotlight and then type Idle. You can think of IDLE as a notepad or

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,450
a place where we write Python programs. I can click on File and then New

9
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:36,010
File and boom, I will get a fresh new place where I can write my code.

10
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,000
By the way, the other window is where

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,330
we'll see the outboard of our program. Okay,

12
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,820
let me rearrange both of these windows so we can see them at the same time.
