The answer is a lot. If all we know about Grant's profit is that it could be

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:13,800
$5000 or more, then profit could be $5000, or it could be $5001, or $5002.50, or

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:20,574
$120,000. Or any other number that's bigger than or equal to 5000. This means

4
00:00:20,574 --> 00:00:24,995
that there are a ton of numbers. Way more than just these ones I've written down

5
00:00:24,995 --> 00:00:29,195
here. In fact an infinite number of numbers that profit could be equal to.
