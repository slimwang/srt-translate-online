00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,320
Now I want to introduce to you
the concept of Photosynth.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,390
Photosynth is a very unique application
of computational photography

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,080
that builds up on all the different
steps that we have looked at so far.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,910
It brings together all those
concepts to allow you to now

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,430
take a series of pictures of a site and

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,630
then bring them together to visualize
that site in many different ways.

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,780
It actually allows you to do equivalent
to photo tourism, where anybody

8
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,720
takes pictures of a site, and
now you can actually visualize them and

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,110
see different sites from
different viewpoints.
