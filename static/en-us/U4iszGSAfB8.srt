1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,839
So what's the difference between them?

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,440
Well you take a look and you say,
you know, to get from 75 to 225 that's

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,640
a difference of 150 and yep,
there it is, it's 150 okay?

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,430
But then you take a look between 45 and

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,490
315 and you say what's
the difference you say, oh my gosh,

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,930
to go from 45 to 315 requires a,
a, a hundred and oh, that's a lot.

7
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,270
So what's the difference?

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,284
What's, what's 315 minus 45?

9
00:00:24,908 --> 00:00:26,709
[SOUND] 270.

10
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:30,600
It says there's 270 between them,
that's a really big difference.

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,759
Well, of course, the answer is no.

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,060
The difference between
them is actually 90.

13
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:40,260
And the reason is that,
if we go from let's say 0 all the way

14
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:49,460
around to 360 again,
45 is over here 315 is over here, right?

15
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:55,770
So the answer is it's not 270 between
them, it's only 90 between them.

16
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,180
So it's just a way of remembering
that things have to wrap around.
