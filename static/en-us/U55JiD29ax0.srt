1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,900
By rejecting the null, we know that at least two of the foods differ in terms

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:09,686
of mean amount consumed. But we don't know which ones differ. We can see that

3
00:00:09,686 --> 00:00:12,813
all three of the means differ from each other, but we don't know if these

4
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:17,795
differences are due to sampling error. Therefore, we need to do additional

5
00:00:17,795 --> 00:00:22,357
testing to see which means are different. This additional testing is called

6
00:00:22,357 --> 00:00:26,813
multiple comparison test. So we're able to compare all of the means with each

7
00:00:26,813 --> 00:00:32,900
other. We wouldn't do a multiple comparison test until after we've done ANOVA.

8
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,385
One of the most common multiple comparison tests is called Tukey's HSD, which

9
00:00:37,385 --> 00:00:42,008
stands for Honestly Significant Difference It's named after John Tukey, a very

10
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:48,450
influential statistician. Tukey's HSD evaluates the significance of the

11
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:54,100
difference between any two group means. In statistics, we say that this test

12
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:59,039
will allow us to make pairwise comparisons. The way we calculate Tukey's HSD is

13
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,410
just like the margin of error that you've learned before. Remember that with

14
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,910
the z test, it was the z critical value, denoted z star times the standard

15
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:14,344
error. And remember with the t test, it was the t critical value times the

16
00:01:14,344 --> 00:01:19,370
standard error. But now when we're comparing three or more samples, we have a

17
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:24,332
new statistic called Q. And we multiply this by this square root of the mean

18
00:01:24,332 --> 00:01:30,350
square for within subject varibility divided by n. You might ask how is this

19
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:35,890
similar to these. Well, the mean square for within subject variability is the

20
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:40,895
pooled variance. It's just the average square deviation of each value from its

21
00:01:40,895 --> 00:01:46,446
respective group mean. Therefore, the square root is the pooled standard

22
00:01:46,446 --> 00:01:52,342
deviation. Q is the student highest range statistic, and we find this in yet

23
00:01:52,342 --> 00:01:57,969
another table. It's purpose is to adjust the whole HSD, so that it's less

24
00:01:57,969 --> 00:02:04,300
likely we commit a type one error. Remember a type one error is when we reject

25
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:08,139
the null hypothesis when it's actually true since q increases when there are

26
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:11,980
more groups that we're comparing, it makes it less likely to commit a type one

27
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:19,598
error. Remember that if a sample mean was further away from the population

28
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:26,383
mean, than the margin of error, it was considered unlikely. Well if two sample

29
00:02:26,383 --> 00:02:31,531
means are further apart than the Tukey's HSD then that's considered honestly,

30
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:34,724
significantly different.
