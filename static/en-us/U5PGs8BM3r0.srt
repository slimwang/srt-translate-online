00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,650
Is longitude, latitude, altitude a right or left handed coordinate system?

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:09,556
Consider going east to increase the longitude, and consider going north to

3
00:00:09,556 --> 00:00:14,436
increase the latitude. Order is also important. I list longitude first here,

4
00:00:14,436 --> 00:00:18,490
since we tend to think of that direction as the X direction. In reality,

5
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:23,330
locations are usually listed as latitude first, then longitude. So the question

6
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,884
to you is, is longitude, latitude, altitude left handed or right handed?
