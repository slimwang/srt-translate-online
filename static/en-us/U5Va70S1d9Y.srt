What we've used here is called a Composite Function. R is a function of N, but

2
00:00:05,208 --> 00:00:11,712
N is a function of d. So it ends up that R is actually a function of d. That's

3
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:15,190
really awesome. We'll come back to see example with the revenue and numbers in

4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:19,700
a bit, but first let's talk about composite functions in general. To do this, I

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,606
think we need a fresh set of functions, so how about these two, f of x equals x

6
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:28,932
squared and g of x equals x minus one. When we talk about composition of

7
00:00:28,932 --> 00:00:33,804
functions, this means that we're combining two functions in a special way. We

8
00:00:33,804 --> 00:00:37,452
take the results, the output, of one function, and substitute that in, as the

9
00:00:37,452 --> 00:00:42,814
input of the other function. For example, if I want to find f of g of x, I

10
00:00:42,814 --> 00:00:50,173
would plug in the function g of x Everywhere I see a x in f. So in the case of

11
00:00:50,173 --> 00:00:55,680
these functions, the output of g of x is x minus one. So that's going to be the

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,270
input of f. That means that f of g of x is really just f of x minus one. So

13
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,510
what expression do we get to complete this comoposite function?
