1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,090
So to help us understand how imaging can be done with cameras,

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,900
let's try to build one from the basic first principles.

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:13,350
Help us do this, I'm starting off with a simple tree, shown here.

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,810
basically, it's kind of attempting to show a 3-D scene.

5
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,480
And what we're interested in is capturing this 3-D scene in a way that it

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,310
actually captures the geometry and all of the light variations of this.

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:29,340
Of course, nothing of the scene would be visible without a light source, right?

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,810
If you walk into a dark room, you can't see anything.

9
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,800
There has to be a light source, there could be an external one with sun or

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,240
simple light bulbs and stuff like that in internal situations.

11
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,810
Light source from this hits the tree, and basically then it reflects the light

12
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,700
back and it's the reflections from the scene that hit our eye,

13
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,880
that's why we see the scene, and again we want that reflections to hit

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,480
the camera, and store that image, and that's what we're interested in.

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,340
So in essence, any light source illuminates the scene like this, and

16
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,900
it's these reflections from this, kind of what we see, and

17
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,020
again that's one of the reasons we see color, we see specularities, and

18
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,280
stuff like that, depending on the type of surface it might be.

19
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,280
For example, if it's kind of reflecting black,

20
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,990
well it means that in essence it's absorbed everything.

21
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,850
If it's reflecting white, it means it's reflecting everything.

22
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:23,460
And you know, color come in, because again, the color properties of

23
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,870
the surface that actually has those color materials reflect differently, and

24
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,200
that's why we see those colors.

25
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,920
So this in essence, basically suggests that scenes have to be illuminated.

26
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,300
Now let's try to capture this information.

27
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,820
So to do this I'm actually going to pop up a, a screen of some sort, and

28
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,850
I'm now interested in basically saying this is my screen.

29
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:48,460
I want to capture this 3D structure onto the screen.

30
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,930
We can actually refer to this screen as a sensor.

31
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,350
Now we will talk about different types of sensors but let's assume this is

32
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:59,840
a sensor that actually captures this light and saves it for us.

33
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,370
But, before we get to the saving part,

34
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:06,010
let's see how light is actually created or gathered on this surface.

35
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:10,190
Of course, as I said in the last slide, if the sun was illuminating this tree,

36
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:14,750
each and every point of this tree would be reflecting back the light.

37
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,350
And that light would be hitting our eyes, and that's how we see it and

38
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,190
all that kind of stuff.

39
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,880
Well, so in essence, each and

40
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,030
every point is reflecting light and it's hitting the sensor.

41
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,060
And of course, no image is forming on this one because it's coming across in

42
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,960
all possible ways.

43
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,630
And of course, at present we're not thinking of this as a sensor.

44
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,890
Let's just claim it to be a screen and all of the light is there.

45
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:39,550
And of course it's for this reason, you walk around in an environment,

46
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:44,420
you actually don't see reflections of everything exactly on this environment.

47
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,610
What we want to now figure out is how to get these beams of

48
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,840
those rays of light focused.

49
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,940
So, to achieve this, let's put an obstruction in front of our screen.

50
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,610
And here I basically show an obstruction to be basically, a big, you know,

51
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:03,990
let's say a object of some sort, except that I do have an opening.

52
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:07,960
So, because of this obstruction, what will happen to all these sources of light?

53
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,752
Only the ones that actually go through this obstruction, this hole,

54
00:03:12,752 --> 00:03:14,629
would make it to my screen.

55
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:16,536
The rest of them would just reflect off and

56
00:03:16,536 --> 00:03:19,916
diffuse themselves in this part of the environment, and nothing will get

57
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:23,790
through, only the ones that get through would be through this opening.

58
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,010
So let's look at exactly what that means.

59
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,160
If a ray of light goes from the bottom of the tree, it goes through here,

60
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,210
it goes through the hole and hits the screen.

61
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,359
Let's see what happens on the other end.

62
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:37,240
Another ray of light goes from the top, goes through here and hits the screen.

63
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,210
Simple geometric kind of a way of looking at rays of light.

64
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,200
Remember, rays of light are the ones we are trying to

65
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,860
capture to create an image.

66
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,510
So one thing interesting is bottom is there, top is there.

67
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,790
So just by looking at this triangles,

68
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:55,890
we can say that this tree should be upside down when it forms on the sensor.

69
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,090
And again it makes perfect sense, this point is actually coming in and

70
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,270
registering here.

71
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,690
This point is coming and registering here and of course all of the points

72
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:08,610
on this tree would be going through this small hole and creating an image there.

73
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,855
So that in essence is basis of a camera per se.
