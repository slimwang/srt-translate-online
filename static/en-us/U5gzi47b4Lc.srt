00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,460
Recall our five rules
of message passing.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,420
Now, I want you to think about
them in the following scenario.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,360
Consider this two dimensional mesh
network of nine nodes arranged in

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,510
a three by three grid.

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:16,900
Suppose node zero wants to
send a message to node eight.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,540
And suppose at the same time node four
wants to send a message to node six.

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,990
Here's my question.

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,940
What is the minimum
time to send n words?

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,160
Type your answer here symbolically.

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,880
You can use little a for
alpha, little b for beta.

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,049
And of course, n for itself.
