00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,680
Many misused detection
approaches are signature based.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,890
A signature is essentially a known
pattern of malicious activity data.

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:14,450
For example, this can be option
settings of flags in a packet header,

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,280
or it can be a particular
string in the packet pay load.

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,250
The set of signatures needs
to be as large as possible

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,695
in order to have a high detection
rate and a low false-positive rate.

7
00:00:26,695 --> 00:00:31,870
Signature-based approaches are most
widely used in anti-virus software and

8
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,670
network intrusion detection systems.
