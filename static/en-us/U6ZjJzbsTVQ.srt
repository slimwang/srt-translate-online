Bottomline is you can't design an complex system with having,

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,270
without having some idea of what it's supposed to do.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,720
That is what problems is it trying to solve. Diagrams can help you

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:17,120
express that understanding and express your solution to that problem.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:22,538
UML provides a wealth of diagram types for you as well as OCL and

6
00:00:22,538 --> 00:00:27,300
the meta model. In general, the more precisely you understand problem the fewer

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,290
subsequent problems you will have with that system's history.
