1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Even though the overall equation is simple, there's two things to be careful about.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
First, you cannot write 1/3 because that would be 0.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Integer divided by integer would be an integer so you have to put in at least one decimal point here.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The second thing to be careful about is Python's power operator.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If you forget the parenthesis here, it would be forming the first power

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and would be dividing the result by 3, which is not what we want obviously, and here's the result.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
If you start with an initial value of 0, the results stays at 0 all of the time,

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
but if we start with a positive number that's ever so slightly above 0, such as 10⁻³⁰⁰,

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
we get a completely different evolution

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and as you can see, there's hardly any difference between starting with 10⁻³⁰⁰

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and starting with 0.01.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
From a numerical view point, this differential equation looks as though

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
0 is a highly unstable fixed point.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Once you get a tiny bit above 0, the solution is going to quickly divert from that

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and mathematically speaking, this is a differential equation whose solution curves are not unique.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
If you start with 0, you will branch off at any point in time in this fashion and get another solution.
