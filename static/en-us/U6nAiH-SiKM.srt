In addition to major depressive disorder, there are other depressive disorders

2
00:00:03,738 --> 00:00:09,050
that have milder symptoms, but the key is that they last longer. One of these

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:14,856
milder forms include persistent depressive disorder, or PDD. Most of the

4
00:00:14,856 --> 00:00:19,666
symptoms of PDD are the same as in major depressive disorder, but they are less

5
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:25,270
intense in PDD. Also the depressive mood lasts for most of the day and most of

6
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:30,899
the time for at least two years. Remember, in major depressive disorder you

7
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:36,019
only need to have the symptoms for two weeks. In addition, people with PDD may

8
00:00:36,019 --> 00:00:40,508
also experience one or more episodes of major depressive disorder during their

9
00:00:40,508 --> 00:00:42,411
lifetime.
