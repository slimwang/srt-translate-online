Thanks. Now let's take a look at this. Simply we can take in the typename and

2
00:00:02,967 --> 00:00:06,069
have a series of if statements checking the typename against a given class name

3
00:00:06,069 --> 00:00:10,730
that we're interested in. If we find a match, we can return a new instance of

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,100
that class out from the spawnEntity function.
