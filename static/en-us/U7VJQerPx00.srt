1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,800
So, how can we tie this to our graph? Well, the train track is in one piece.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,440
The train can't just jump from station to station, because it can't leave this

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,676
track. Similarly, all of the graphs that we've looked at so far are also in one

4
00:00:12,676 --> 00:00:18,362
piece, with no breaks. When a graph is like this one, and has no brakes in it.

5
00:00:18,362 --> 00:00:21,848
But, it's, rather, one piece connecting two points together. What can we say

6
00:00:21,848 --> 00:00:25,418
about the range of that function? So, looking at this graph over here in

7
00:00:25,418 --> 00:00:29,588
particular. What numbers can we say are in the range of this function? Does it

8
00:00:29,588 --> 00:00:34,400
only contain the numbers, negative 8 and 4? Does it contain all of the integers

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,377
between negative 8 and 4? Does is span the entire interval from negative 8 to

10
00:00:38,377 --> 00:00:43,268
4, but doesn't include those end points? Does it span that entire interval and

11
00:00:43,268 --> 00:00:47,630
include the points negative 8 and 4? Or does it contain all the real numbers?

12
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,423
Please pick what you think is the best answer.
