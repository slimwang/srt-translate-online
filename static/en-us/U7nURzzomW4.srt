1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,760
Some traits can be obvious and distinguish easily

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,130
in whether they are learned or innate

3
00:00:07,042 --> 00:00:08,000
To help us illustrate this concept a little bit better. We have

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,280
asked some udacious friends to come in today and talk

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,880
to us for a bit. This is Clifton and

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,885
Eduardo and I am pretty sure both these guys have

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,870
the innate ability to speak, don't you guys?

8
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:17,570
>> Yeah off course.

9
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,640
>> I am pretty sure these words are coming from my mouth.

10
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,260
>> Okay, great, and based on their answers I would also

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,310
assume they would understand me if I were to speak in

12
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:28,820
english. And say science is amazing, because they both learned how

13
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,200
to speak English, but Clifton here also knows how to speak Mandarin.

14
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:32,446
>>

15
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:33,741
[mandarin]

16
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:34,790
[mandarin]

17
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:35,840
>> And, what does that mean, exactly?

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,250
>> Oh, it just means, Science is amazing, in Mandarin.

19
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,990
>> Clifton can do that because he learned to speak both

20
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:45,920
Mandarin and English. But, he may not understand Spanish, let's say.

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:45,920
>>

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,800
[spanish]

23
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:47,960
What?

24
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,190
>> Exactly.

25
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,880
>> That just means science is amazing in Spanish.

26
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,370
>> Okay, now I want you guys, see

27
00:00:54,370 --> 00:01:00,172
if you can have a conversation with each other.

28
00:01:00,172 --> 00:01:00,172
>>

29
00:01:00,172 --> 00:01:00,360
[FOREIGN]

30
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,040
>> okay guys. How's it going? Are you able to understand each other?

31
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,340
>> Not really. That's because you both have the

32
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,970
innate ability to speak, but you've learned different languages.

33
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,530
>> Another good example of a learned trait is something

34
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,010
like religious belief or cultural practice. Usually, people believe in a

35
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,290
religion that they were raised in, but later in life, they

36
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,100
can adopt a different religion, or even no religion at all.

37
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,880
>> Another example would be music. You can perceive music and

38
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,030
then you can have music that you like. Which one do you think is more

39
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,300
of a learned trait and which one do you think is more of an innate trait?
