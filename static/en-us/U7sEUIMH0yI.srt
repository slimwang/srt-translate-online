00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,050
As I mentioned previously, we want our
code to be easy for anyone to dive into.

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,670
Your users may need to use
your code to make changes or

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:11,690
to understand how to use it,
predictably, so might your coworkers.

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:16,800
And while it may surprise you, you
are also an end user of documentation.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,090
You of the present and you of
the future are two different people.

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,180
And future you will not remember
every little detail about your code.

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,050
Treat future you just like
you'd treat a coworker, and

8
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,480
give them the things
they'll need to succeed.

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,120
I'll touch more on that in just a bit.

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,580
But let's first take a look at how some
of the engineers here at Udacity use

11
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,370
documentation.
