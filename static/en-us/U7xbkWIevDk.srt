1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,680
The correct answer says,

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,870
well who has what roles gets defined
by the company itself, okay.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,650
So whoever is responsible for
secure access to its resources,

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,220
trusted sys admin or whoever it is.

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,960
So what role you can take on
is mandated by the company and

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,830
what you can access depends on the role.

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,220
So, it doesn't depend on so,
remember, discretion access control,

8
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,990
the owner decides who can access
their file or data that they created.

9
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:32,930
Here that's going to be decided
by roles have access and

10
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,990
who can take on what role is
going to be decided by the company.

11
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,070
And because of that,

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,640
the fact that the company decides how
accesses are going to be allowed,

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,650
that's what makes this a mandatory
access control policy.
