1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,850
And the answer here is that--yes, this algorithm is actually correct.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:08,470
It might not be very practical in terms of running time but the arguments are perfectly fine.

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:13,490
If you have finite memory and a program is in an infinite loop, then at a certain point in time

4
00:00:13,490 --> 99:59:59,999
snapshots are states of the machine must repeat themselves--there's no other way.
