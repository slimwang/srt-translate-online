1
00:00:00,252 --> 00:00:02,723
And, this is a really tricky question. So,

2
00:00:02,723 --> 00:00:05,545
clearly, densities don’t have to be positive

3
00:00:05,545 --> 00:00:07,694
everywhere. It suffices to be non-negative

4
00:00:07,694 --> 00:00:09,754
and I gave you examples where outside of

5
00:00:09,754 --> 00:00:12,970
certain interval density was zero. Zero is not

6
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,920
positive. Zero is just non-negative. Now,

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,130
densities don’t have to be continuous. I gave

8
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,021
you an example of a density like this. And,

9
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:22,223
over here where the density jumped, you had

10
00:00:22,223 --> 00:00:24,941
a point of discontinuity. So, continuous is

11
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:26,892
not correct. And, if you got this wrong,

12
00:00:26,892 --> 00:00:28,359
no big deal. The word continuous might not

13
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:30,057
even mean much to you. But, it’s one of these

14
00:00:30,057 --> 00:00:33,001
things to know about densities. Now, smaller

15
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:35,576
or equal to 1, that’s a really tricky one. And, I

16
00:00:35,576 --> 00:00:37,825
would submit that’s not correct and here’s why.

17
00:00:37,825 --> 00:00:41,825
Suppose you have a density that assigns

18
00:00:41,825 --> 00:00:44,625
uniform probability only to values between 0

19
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:49,674
and 0.1, then the height of this density could

20
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:53,743
be 10; it’s 1 over 0.1. And, as a result, it’s

21
00:00:53,743 --> 00:00:56,856
possible that densities can exceed 1. And

22
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:58,393
that is a key point that makes them different

23
00:00:58,393 --> 00:01:00,445
from probabilities. Probabilities are always

24
00:01:00,445 --> 00:01:04,000
smaller than or equal to 1. Densities can be larger than 1.
