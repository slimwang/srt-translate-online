00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,380
So now let me bring up the whole
famous approach of using SIFT for

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,290
doing feature detection,
scaling the features, by David Lowe.

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,060
Reference is also there if
you want to look it up.

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,510
It's also on the website.

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,980
Basically what we're interested
in is finding the local maximum,

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,190
both in scale and in space.

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,390
Basically the measurements we want
to do is difference of Gaussians.

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,952
I already showed you before.

9
00:00:23,952 --> 00:00:27,251
And difference of Gaussians basically
creates a pyramid of the difference of

10
00:00:27,251 --> 00:00:28,632
Gaussians within each object.

11
00:00:28,632 --> 00:00:31,390
So it captures the scale.

12
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,260
By looking at the derivative information
of the difference in variation of

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,920
Gaussians across scale and also space.

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,780
So here, basically coming up again
we have space, x y, scale going up.

15
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,510
We basically again do the same
processing, but again for each and

16
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:48,050
every aspect of it we're going to be
now doing difference of Gaussians.

17
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:53,250
So in this case the difference of
Gaussians in x and y for each and

18
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,020
every image, but also doing the same for
difference of Gaussians in scale.
