Welcome back to CS215.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This the beginning of Unit 6, which is going to cover the hardness of network problems.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
All right, I made another magic trick and I'm going to show it to you now.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So this is a map of a country that used to be part of the old Soviet Union called Tetristan

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and it consist of 8 counties, which I've labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And what I'd like you to do is color the map each one with one of three colors

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
so that no two counties that are touching show the same color

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and then I want you to number those colors--0, 1 and 2,

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and then depending on which numbers you assigned to each colors

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and which colors you assigned to each counties, I want you to calculate the color of county D

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:01,000
plus the color of county F plus the color of county C times the color of county G

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
minus the color of county A plus the color of county H.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I want you to work out what that number is and then write it in this block,

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
but before you write it let me see if I can guess what it's going to be.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes--yes, I have a very good guess as to what it's going to be, but you write it in

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and let me make sure I'm right.
