00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,634
Here is a scatter plot, and now we can easily see a trend going like this. As x

2
00:00:05,634 --> 00:00:11,874
increases, y tends to decrease. The data don't fall exactly on a straight line

3
00:00:11,874 --> 00:00:16,535
but they definitely follow a clear linear trend. There is a line that best

4
00:00:16,535 --> 00:00:20,820
approximate this data and we are going to talk about that in the next lesson.

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,284
Data doesn't just ahve to follow a linear path. It can also follow a curved

6
00:00:26,284 --> 00:00:31,006
linear path, like this. In this lesson we're just going to focus on linear

7
00:00:31,006 --> 00:00:36,612
trends. Intuitively we know that certain variables have a relationship. As I

8
00:00:36,612 --> 00:00:41,730
said before, height and weight or age and height tend to have a relationship.

9
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,490
So now let's focus on which variables have a stronger relationship.
