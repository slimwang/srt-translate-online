00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,160
Bit Torrent's solution to free-riding is called

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,870
choking, which is a type of game theoretic

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,950
strategy, called tit for tat. Choking is

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:12,460
a temporary refusal to upload chunks to another

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,740
peer that is requesting them. Downloading, of

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,300
course, occurs as normal. But if a node

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,010
is unable to download from any particular

8
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,460
peer, it simply doesn't upload to that peer.

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,560
This ensures that nodes cooperate. And

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,160
eliminates the free rider problem. If you're

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,240
interested in the game theory behind

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,020
why this strategy ensures cooperation, I encourage

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,510
you to go read about the

14
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:42,550
repeated prisoner's dilemma problem. Where, a tit-for-tat

15
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,870
strategy, such as that which is shown

16
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:49,790
here, ensures cooperation among mutually distrustful parties.
