Hi all.

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:04,560
Today we are going to talk about
a subject that usually does not

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,320
get the attention it deserves.

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,460
Money!

5
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,189
Why?

6
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,020
Because if you wish your startup
to last, it must be profitable.

7
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,041
There is no other way.

8
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:15,200
>> And, you should think of
your business funds as air,

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,560
as long as you have enough of it you
don't have to think about it at all.

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,670
But the minute you run out of it,
it's game over.

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,130
>> I'm Ido Green and in the past 20
years I've started six companies.

12
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,280
Two companies were acquired,
one became profitable, and

13
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,100
three flew into a wall
just like Buzz Lightyear.

14
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,400
Currently I'm having fun at Google as a
developer advocate helping startups and

15
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,710
developers get the most
out of monetization.

16
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:43,070
>> And I'm Jess, a program manager and
course developer here at Udacity.

17
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,198
My role in this course
is to ask questions.

18
00:00:45,198 --> 00:00:47,540
Questions of Ido on how we monetize.

19
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,870
And questions of you, to help you start
thinking about how you'll apply what you

20
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,870
learn here in your own product.

21
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,720
>> In this course, you'll learn
basic monetization principles for

22
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,550
a variety of product types,
how to implement these strategies, and

23
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,100
how to track their effectiveness.

24
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,280
Let's take a little look
at how we'll do this.
