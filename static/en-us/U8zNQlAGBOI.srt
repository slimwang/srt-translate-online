00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,860
The dimensions of our garden are 12 feet in length, and 6 feet in width. Nice

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:10,076
solving if you found these two answers. Now, we're just getting warmed up, so

3
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:14,523
if you didn't get it, that's okay. Let's see how we solve. First we replace

4
00:00:14,523 --> 00:00:20,740
this variable l with the equivalent expression 18 minus w. That goes inside

5
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:27,432
parenthesis here. Next we multiply each term in the parenthesis by w. So, we'll

6
00:00:27,432 --> 00:00:32,966
have 18w minus w squared. Again, we have a quadratic equation here, since we

7
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:37,747
have w squared. So we want to move all these terms to the left-hand side so our

8
00:00:37,747 --> 00:00:43,592
w squared will be positive. So we'll add w squared to both sides and we'll

9
00:00:43,592 --> 00:00:48,870
subtract 18w from both sides. This gives us w squared minus 18w plus 72 on the

10
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:56,540
left. And zero on the right. Next, we want to factor this quadratic. So, we

11
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:03,234
find factors of one times 72, equals 72, that sum to negative 18. These two

12
00:01:03,234 --> 00:01:08,796
factors are negative six and negative 12. We'll set each factor, equal to zero,

13
00:01:08,796 --> 00:01:14,511
so the width can equal six or the width can equal 12. We know the length should

14
00:01:14,511 --> 00:01:19,280
be 12 feet and the width should be 6 feet, since the length is the longer side.

15
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,060
You'll notice that it doesn't matter which value that we use for w. The final

16
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,799
result will be the same rectangular garden. It will be 12 feet by 6 feet. And

17
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:32,662
as always, we can quickly check to make sure these dimensions are correct. If

18
00:01:32,662 --> 00:01:37,078
we go all the way around our garden, we'll have the perimeter, which is 12 plus

19
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:43,328
6 plus 12 plus 6, which equals 36 feet altogether. This checks, since this is

20
00:01:43,328 --> 00:01:47,967
what we expected the perimeter to be in our original problem. For the area, we

21
00:01:47,967 --> 00:01:53,926
multiple 12 by 6 to get 72 feet squared. This also checks, which is great,

22
00:01:53,926 --> 00:01:57,745
since 72 was the area of our garden originally.
