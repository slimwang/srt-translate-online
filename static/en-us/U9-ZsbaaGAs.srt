1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,020
So, we've reached the end of support vector machines, and

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,650
I think we learned quite a bit here.

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:05,430
>> That's right.

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,610
At the end of Naive Bayes we started a list of all the different things that we

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,670
should be thinking about when picking an algorithm.

6
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,450
We've learned a lot about support vector machines that now we can add on to

7
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:14,480
that list.

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,830
>> Yes. So they work really well in complicated domains where there is

9
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,250
a clear margin of separation.

10
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,280
And they don't perform so well in very large data sets,

11
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,145
because the training time happens to be cubic in the size of the data set.

12
00:00:26,145 --> 00:00:28,780
They also don't work well with lots and lots of noise.

13
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,470
So when the class are very overlapping you have to count independent evidence.

14
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,550
That's where then a Naive Bayes classifier would be better.

15
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,590
>> So again, it comes back to the data set that you have and

16
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:38,780
the features that you have available.

17
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,010
If you have a really big data set, if you have lots and

18
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,540
lots of features, SVMs right of the box might be very slow.

19
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,670
And they might be prone to overfitting to some of the noise in your data.

20
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,600
>> Okay. Yes, so, just test it out on the testing set.

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,880
See how it how it performs.

22
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,880
And then you're ready to go.

23
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,630
>> Exactly.

24
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,230
So, I think we're ready to go on to the next lesson?

25
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:55,790
>> Awesome.

26
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,290
>> Great.
