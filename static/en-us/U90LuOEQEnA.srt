1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,330
Okay, Michael, what's the answer?

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:06,470
>> So, alright. Does it make sense to repeat, an attribute along a path in

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:11,600
the tree? So, it seems like it could be no, [SOUND] in that, you know,

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,750
if we're looking at attributes like, you know, is A true, then later we wouldnâ€™t

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,970
ask again is A true because we would already have known the answer to that.

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,380
>> Right, and by the way, information

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,860
gain will pick that for you automatically.

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,880
>> It doesn't have to be a special thing in the algorithm,

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,790
if, if, you consider, an attribute that you've already split on, then you're not

10
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,090
going to gain any information, so it's going to be the worst thing, to split on.

11
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:32,970
>> Exactly.

12
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,020
>> Alright, but it,

13
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:35,410
>> Okay, doing good.

14
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,180
>> But it seems like maybe you're trying to lead us

15
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,470
on because ,this we're in the continuous attributes portion of our show.

16
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,020
>> Okay, well what's the answer there? Is the answer not also false?

17
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:43,880
>> Well we wouldn't want to ask the

18
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,700
same question, about the same attribute. So,

19
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:51,096
we wouldn't have age, between 20 and 30, and then later ask again, age ,between

20
00:00:51,096 --> 00:00:55,160
20 and 30. But ,maybe we want to ask, you know, given that we are less than 20,

21
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,400
we're, are we teenagers or not, so we might

22
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,720
have a different range, on age later in the tree.

23
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,360
>> So, that's exactly right, Michael. So, the answer is

24
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,930
no, it does not make sense ,to repeat an attribute along

25
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:12,520
a path of the tree, for discrete-value attributes. However, for

26
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,484
continuous-valued attributes, it does

27
00:01:14,484 --> 00:01:16,230
make sense. Because, what you're actually

28
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,840
doing, is asking a different question. So, one way to think

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,800
about this, is that the question is age in the 20's

30
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,810
or not. Is actually ,a discreet valued attribute that you've just

31
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,430
created, for the purposes of the decision tree. So, asking that

32
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,670
question doesn't make sense but asking a different question, about age,

33
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,390
does in fact make sense. So ,once you know, that you

34
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,740
are not in the 20's you might ask well am I

35
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,650
less than, 20 years old? Maybe a teenager or am I greater

36
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:45,420
than 40. How old am I, 44? Greater than 44, in which case, I'm old.

37
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,570
>> So if it's, if you ask, [LAUGH] the

38
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,270
tree that you drew isn't quite right though, right?

39
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,530
>> Yeah, it is.

40
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,360
>> because, if you go down the false branch, it means you are less than 20.

41
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,550
>> No, I can be greater than 30.

42
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,050
>> Oh, good one.

43
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,480
>> Yes, I'm very clever, or at least I accidentally got it right.

44
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,750
One of the two, it's the same thing. Okay, so there you go.
