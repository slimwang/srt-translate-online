00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,805
Let's think back way, way back to right triangles. Let's say that I have a right

2
00:00:04,817 --> 00:00:09,292
triangle whose two shorter legs are both equal to the square root of 2 times x.

3
00:00:09,396 --> 00:00:14,122
What then, is the length of the hypotenuse of this triangle or the length of

4
00:00:14,134 --> 00:00:18,827
this longest side? Be super careful about which factors are under the radical

5
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:19,120
sign.
