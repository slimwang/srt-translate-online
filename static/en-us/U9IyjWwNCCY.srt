00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,350
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:05,500
In the first lesson, you learned how the
browser renders pixels from HTML, CSS,

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,910
and JavaScript.

4
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,690
Understanding this process is key
to optimizing an app's performance.

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:11,210
>> Right.

6
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:15,300
And in this lesson, you'll take a step
back to think at a high level about your

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,230
app's life cycle as a whole.

8
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,320
The goal is to help you make intelligent
choices about when your app can and

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,880
should do the heavy work to create
a buttery smooth experience

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,340
for your users.

11
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,180
Now, before we start,
I have a question for you.

12
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:34,042
Should your goal be to make your app run
at 60 frames per second all of the time?

13
00:00:34,042 --> 00:00:35,494
>> Ooh, ooh, I know this one!

14
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,600
>> Yeah.
>> Okay can I answer it for them?

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,480
>> Yes.
>> Okay cool.

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,650
The answer is no, actually, not quite.

17
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,470
It's important that you pick
your battles a bit, and

18
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,360
focus on the things that
matter to your end users.

19
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,532
When you think about it, there
are actually four major areas of any web

20
00:00:49,532 --> 00:00:53,430
app's life cycle, and performance fits
into them in very different ways.
