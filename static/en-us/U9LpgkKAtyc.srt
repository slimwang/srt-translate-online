00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here's my solution for pig<u>actions</u>d.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
If you were challenged with a double, then the legal actions are accept and decline.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
If there's something pending, then you can either roll or hold.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
If there's nothing pending, then you can only roll.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That's my initial description of actions.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And then I add in if doubling is 1, then we append to whatever we computed before--

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
that we're allowed to do the double action--and return that.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I didn't describe my strategy function because there were so many good ones

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
that people have come up with. There's lots of different choices.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So I think the best thing is just look in the discussion forums

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and then you can see some options for ways to go for figuring out a good strategy.
