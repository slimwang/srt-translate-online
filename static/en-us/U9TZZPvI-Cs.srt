1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,320
The job of the Control Plane is to compute

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,920
state that ultimately ends up in the data plane.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,420
So computing a forwarding path that satisfies a high-level

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,360
policy is something that the Control Plane would do.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,990
The Control Plane can also compute shortest path routing

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,210
trees. And it might make decisions about whether or

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,810
not a user's device should be allowed to send

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,525
traffic or not based on that device's MAC address.

9
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:28,530
Rate-limiting is something that is typically done

10
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,460
in the data plane, and the load-balancing example

11
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:37,170
that we have listed here. Is such that a router or a switch would make

12
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,300
decisions in the data plane based on a hash of the source IP address. So

13
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,130
all of the decisions are being made at

14
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:49,160
forwarding time, not by a centralized high-level program.
