1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,512
As we can see, one of the more

2
00:00:01,512 --> 00:00:05,130
important things about the processor is power consumption. There

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,400
are really two kinds of power that a processor

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,040
consumes. There is dynamic power which is the power

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,680
consumed by actual activity in an electronic circuit.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,840
But there is also static power which is consumed

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,684
when the circuit is powered on but idle, so

8
00:00:21,684 --> 00:00:25,272
it's not really doing much. We will discuss both

9
00:00:25,272 --> 00:00:27,978
the dynamic and static power and also how they are

10
00:00:27,978 --> 00:00:31,380
related to each other and how do they affect processor speed
