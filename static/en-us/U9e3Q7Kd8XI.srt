00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,006
Here's an RGBA texel value that is not pre-multiplied. Let's called it

2
00:00:04,006 --> 00:00:07,764
unmultiplied. If we pre-multiply the RGB value by the alpha value, we get this

3
00:00:07,764 --> 00:00:12,614
result. If we undo this multiplication, we get the unmultiplied RGBA values

4
00:00:12,614 --> 00:00:17,192
back. All unmultiplied RGBA values can be converted to premultiplied RGBA

5
00:00:17,192 --> 00:00:22,074
values and then back again to unmultiplied if needed. Precision could be lost

6
00:00:22,074 --> 00:00:24,954
in converting back and forth like this, but otherwise it's always valid when

7
00:00:24,954 --> 00:00:28,926
starting with an unmultiplied value. However, you can start with a

8
00:00:28,926 --> 00:00:32,061
premultiplied RGBA value that cannot be properly converted and stored as an

9
00:00:32,061 --> 00:00:37,274
unmultiplied RGBA, and so could not have come from unmultiplied values. The

10
00:00:37,274 --> 00:00:40,058
question to you is, which premultiplied texels below come from valid

11
00:00:40,058 --> 00:00:44,878
unmultiplied numbers. Valid means that all four values of the unmulitplied RGBA

12
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:50,092
are between 0 and 1 inclusive. The order of values below is RGBA as usual. My

13
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:53,128
advice is to think about what the premultiplied RGBA value is representing, if

14
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:56,164
you have any concerns about whether it can be converted back to an unmultiplied

15
00:00:56,164 --> 00:00:57,880
value.
