00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,716
Let's see if we have the skills to solve our original equation. We've learned

2
00:00:03,716 --> 00:00:08,272
about the greatest common factor, how to factor using special patterns, and how

3
00:00:08,272 --> 00:00:12,490
to factor by grouping. Can we use any of those techniques on the left-hand side

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:18,066
to help us solve this equation? Answer these questions using yes or no.
