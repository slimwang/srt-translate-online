00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,620
One more little piece of technical detail which is easy and then we'll just show

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,710
you some examples and then we're going to go have a beer because it's Friday.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,880
Remember, n is a function of the probability you want of success.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,840
S, the size of the minimal set.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,070
And e, e is the percentage of outliers.

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,010
But I don't know e, right?

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,080
If I knew which ones were wrong, right?

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,680
If the oracle of Delphi told me which ones were wrong I would of just thrown

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,000
those away to begin with, and just computed the thing that was right.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,200
So if I don't know which ones are wrong I also probably therefore don't know

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,490
what percentage of them are wrong.

12
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:35,530
I could try to guess.

13
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,610
So here's what you can do.

14
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,850
You could say here it's just in words and then we'll do the algorithm.

15
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,370
You can guess say, okay, I don't know,

16
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,210
I'm going to assume that it's 50% are wrong.

17
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,520
Maybe even 80 but whatever it is I'm going to assume that some percent is wrong.

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,020
And I'm going to start computing some models.

19
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,070
If I start finding lots of models where

20
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,820
the inliers are much higher percentage than I guessed,

21
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,910
then I'm going to adapt my belief about the outliers to some smaller value.

22
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,020
So that's written here, as a, as an algorithm.

23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,450
basically, I start off saying,

24
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,820
I'm going to assume that everything is an outlier and therefore,

25
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,360
I'm going to assume that I have to take an infinite number of samples.

26
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,450
So I'm going to be here all day or night, and weeks, and years, whatever.

27
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,500
But, not so bad.

28
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,520
The algorithm says, I start how many have I done so far?

29
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,970
Zero, I say as long as N is bigger than my current set of samp,

30
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:36,330
samples that I've tried I'm going to pick a sample and

31
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,590
I'm going to count the number of inliers.

32
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:44,665
And I'm going to guess that the percentage of outliers is

33
00:01:44,665 --> 00:01:47,740
1 minus the percentage of the inliers that I've seen so far.

34
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,410
After all, this is just my first one, et cetera.

35
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:55,040
If that value is less than the value that I started with, and since I started

36
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,830
out believing that they're all outliers, I'm going to get some values smaller.

37
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:05,110
So if the new e is less than the one I had before, I set that value, and

38
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:05,960
I re-compute N.

39
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,130
So, first time around, N was at infinity, and then N gets lower.

40
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,230
And I keep doing this and what can happen is,

41
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:19,200
since I only change e if it's smaller, that means N can only get smaller.

42
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,290
So, eventually my samples, the number of samples that I've tried,

43
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,220
will get bigger than the N that I need.

44
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,660
And, when I do that, then I stop.

45
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,153
And that's a way of adapting when you don't know a priori,

46
00:02:31,153 --> 00:02:34,070
the number of outliers that are there.

47
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,510
Something that I, I didn't mention before.

48
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,620
It's true if you have a real noise model in terms of how

49
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,220
the noise distribute from measurements, you can analytically set some threshold.

50
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,450
Dirty little secret, we almost never have a noise model.

51
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,240
Sometimes we do, but not too often.

52
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,780
Because we have a noise model from somebody else's censor center.

53
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,530
So you know what we do?

54
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,310
We end up adjusting it to see what works.

55
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,980
Now, not always, and certainly never in our papers.

56
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,700
But for real, sometimes you just have to make the thing work.
