00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,080
Many apps need to establish the user's
identity in order to customize an app to

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,310
the user's desires, to save their data,
allow them to identify themselves in

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,430
social circles, and
countless other scenarios.

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,350
There are many ways that you can allow
your users to identify themselves.

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,220
Such as implementing a sign
in functionality of your own,

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,070
where you manage your users and
their credentials.

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,630
Or, as is becoming
increasingly more common.

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,150
You can allow them to sign in using
their credentials from commonly used

9
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,910
platforms, such as Facebook,
Twitter, or Google.

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,160
To support this, we've built
the Google identity platform,

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,220
and the services it provides.

12
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,540
Including Google sign in for
Android, IOS and

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,000
the web, the Google identity toolkit and

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,670
the Chrome identity API which allows
users to sign into your Chrome apps.

15
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,050
As this is an Android course, we're
going to focus on the Google sign in

16
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,960
technology and you'll learn how to
integrate this into your mobile apps.
