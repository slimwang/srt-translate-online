00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,557
Actually, we can create any normal distribution with any normal distribution.

2
00:00:05,557 --> 00:00:11,222
Sorry if that sounds confusing. Basically, we can take any normal distribution,

3
00:00:11,222 --> 00:00:16,367
convert it to the standard normal distribution and then scale it any way we

4
00:00:16,367 --> 00:00:22,262
want. So, for example, let's say we want to give everyone a popularity score

5
00:00:22,262 --> 00:00:27,755
from 0 to a 100, with 50 being the mean. And let's say we want the standard

6
00:00:27,755 --> 00:00:33,837
deviation to be 10. We start with our original Facebook distribution, where the

7
00:00:33,837 --> 00:00:39,657
mean is 190 and the standard deviation is 36. So let's say that someone has 210

8
00:00:39,657 --> 00:00:45,721
Facebook friends. Let's first convert this to a Z score. What's that going to be

9
00:00:45,721 --> 00:00:49,090
and where does it fall in this distribution?
