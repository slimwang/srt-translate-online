Hi Michael.

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,920
>> Hey Charles, how are you doing?

3
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,580
>> I'm doing just fine. How are you doing?

4
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:04,930
>> I'm fine, thank you.

5
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:09,130
>> Excellent. We are on our penultimate topic in unsupervised learning.

6
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,950
>> Huh, that seems kind of fast.

7
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,880
>> It does seem kind of fast, but we'll probably

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,735
go back and pad things so that it seemed longer.

9
00:00:14,735 --> 00:00:17,800
>> [LAUGH] Maybe we could just talk more slowly.

10
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,510
>> I'm not really sure I'm capable of that, but

11
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:25,180
I'll do my best to talk more slowly. So, today,

12
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,420
what we're going to talk about is feature selection.

13
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:28,620
>> nice.

14
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:33,390
>> Oh. Now it turns out that this is one of two topics that we'll

15
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,790
be talking about. That's what I meant by

16
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,170
penultimate. And the other is feature transformation, which

17
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,050
is something that has a long history, and

18
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,970
is very interesting in its own way. But

19
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,420
I think it's better to talk about feature

20
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,280
selection first. It's a nice crisp problem. Okay?

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,970
>> Sure and then this is in the unsupervised setting?

22
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,190
>> Yes. This is in the unsupervised setting,

23
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,490
though it'll turn out that, as is often the case, it's

24
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,310
not clear what it means to do something in the unsupervised setting,

25
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,470
in the absence of some supervision later down the road. But we'll

26
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,310
see that as we, as we talk in a couple of minutes.

27
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:01,690
>> Cool.

28
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,000
>> Okay? Alright. So the first thing that we should

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,310
do I think for feature selection is, define the problem.
