00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Welcome to the 5th office hours.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We had a lot of great questions on twiddle and parameter optimization.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Let's get started.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The first question comes from George.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
He wants to know, first, is twiddle really all that good?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Does it really give better results than other methods you might use for selecting parameters?

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Well, George, that's a great question.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's good in only one dimension, which is it's really easy to implement.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Sometimes people overlook this.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This is an entire literature on search parameter optimization.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
In a lot of cases where twiddle would fail other methods would succeed.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You can write a PhD thesis about this, but the nice thing is twiddle takes no time to implement,

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and I've never seen a piece of code that couldn't be made better with a twiddle around it.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That's why I explain it. I think it's just an easy method.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I literally use it all the time.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Another question from George about twiddle is local minima.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Are they a problem with twiddle? It seems like it's pretty easy to get caught in one.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
That would be a fantastic final exam question.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Sorry for taking it out of the final exam.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Of course, it's susceptible to local minima.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's essentially a hill-climbing technique.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It might on occasion jump over because of the step size,

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
but by and large we're going down the hill.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's also can get stuck on ridges and other phenomena

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
that might occur in certain optimization spaces.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It really good if you have a good guess for the initial parameters.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's pretty horrible if you want to search systematically.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Then you have to do things like grid search

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
or a kin of particle filters as randomized methods for searching as well.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Matt wants to know how you can smooth a vehicle's path and still

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
guarantee that it's going to be collision free.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It seems like sometimes that new path will run into an obstacles you had previously avoided.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Matt, you're absolutely right and that's regrettable for the obstacle and the car.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It turns out that in practice the smoothing techniques

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
that we use are a little bit more sophisticated.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That is, it's not just points in x-y space, but it's successive state vectors for cars.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The parameters from one to the next are the steering commands for the car,

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and then you can actually often much better guarantee that you stay away from obstacles.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
There is still this issue of how to--obstacles are repellent,

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
and you have to put into your optimization terms

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
a constraint that expels you away from these obstacles.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
To be honest, this becomes a bit of a black art how to tune these parameters.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I had a PhD student work on very narrow openings with smoothing

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
where we used the distance between obstacles

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
as one way to scale the pressure that obstacles would assert

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
on the path to pull away from themselves.

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The car would be able to go through very narrow passages

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
but in very wide passages wouldn't go straight to the middle of it.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's a bit of a black art, and I'm really trying to scratch the surface here.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
All right. Lauren wants to know--in the unit we had this PID exercise where we were driving

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
the car and trying to get it to align with this straight line at y equals zero.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
He found that when halfway through his run he switched the target to y equals 2 instead

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
after the car had already gotten going along y equals zero pretty well, this went sort of haywire.

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Do you have any idea what may have happened?

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It seems like in reality a moving target is a pretty common thing to have in a car.

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Don't do that. Don't do that with your own car. Okay? Your car will go haywire.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It turns out in a lot of controls there is something called the "basin of attraction."

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It says a controller, when you look at it mathematically, is only guaranteed to succeed,

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
we called this "stable," if it's initial set point, the distance and the angle and so on

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
from the reference trajectory, is confined in a specific area.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
If you were to analyze our controller, which happens to be a nice stable controller

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
so you can actually do this, you'll probably find that the set point

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
2 off is outside the basin of attraction, specifically if we have an integral term.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That would be particularly bad.

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
There are other ways to derail it.

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You could have the car face the wrong direction,

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
and I believe the car would produce something that you wouldn't expect.

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
When you design the controller practically and theoretically it's useful

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
to guarantee to yourself or convince yourself that you're within this basin of attraction

70
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
where the controller actually works.

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I love the fact that you're running this experiment,

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
because that's the kind of stuff that's really interesting to run.

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I think it's much more interesting to break things than have things work,

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
because we can understand where the boundaries are.

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And you found one, and that's really, really great. I didn't even talk about this in class.

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Thank you.

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Next question comes from Omar.

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
He's a high school student, and he's taking this course,

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and he's going to be applying to colleges soon.

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So Omar-- >>No, go on. Any advice. Go for it.

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Omar, I'm your friend. >>That's it? >>No, go ahead with the question.

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
He wants to know if you have any advice for projects he could tackle,

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
hopefully, that would show college admissions committees how much he's learned in this class.

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Omar, I'm your friend. Keep doing what you're doing.

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You have your life ahead of you, which is wonderful.

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You're asking the right question. You're taking my class.

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You are audacious to take this class. That's fantastic.

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
All the high school students out there--you guys rock.

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
In the Darpa Grand Challenge, one of the top competitors was a team from

90
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
southern California, a high school. What was the name? Palo Verdes, I believe.

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It was mostly girls, it turns out, and they were all under the age of 17,

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
and they actually beat MIT out of the prelims in the Grand Challenge.

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I was insanely impressed, and these students to the present day are actually my heroes.

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What can you do? There is a FIRST. My friend Dean came and started the competition.

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's a great way to be creative.

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
There is Lego Mindstorms that you can play with and have a lot of fun with

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and be creative about it.

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
There are all kinds of mathematics/robots olympiads

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
where people do hard problems, hard programming problems and so on.

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The only thing I take issue with is I think we pay way too much attention

101
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
to the admissions process and way too little attention to just having fun and learn something.

102
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I have never worried about admission.

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I ended up at Stanford because I couldn't decide and move on,

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
so I got older and older and eventually became a professor.

105
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I think the focus on having fun and exploring something new and learning something new

106
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
to me is one that I wish you could maybe remember when you do this.

107
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Because that's really the most important thing in life in my opinion.

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That's good advice, I think. Thank you.

109
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
MJL talked about his own experiences driving a car and how his decisions on the road

110
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
don't just depend on where his car is and where he wants to go but also on how fast he's going.

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That's something we haven't talked about much,

112
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
how to incorporate speed into robot decisions.

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Coming from Germany we don't really worry about that--just kidding.

114
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Absolutely correct, and there are multiple aspects to speed.

115
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You bring up one--that is, if you take the same turning radius at a higher speed,

116
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
your lateral acceleration goes up--your sideways acceleration.

117
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Eventually your car will spin, flip, slide, or similar, but it won't work anymore.

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So in our work on the Google car and the Stanford car,

119
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
we put actually a limit on the level of acceleration and made that the thing.

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It means on highways our turning radius is significantly larger than, say, on a parking lot.

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That's true for any human driver as well.

122
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The second part we didn't talk much about is selection of speed.

123
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I didn't because the control methods are not quite

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
as interesting as the steering control methods.

125
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Basically, you can imagine that you set the speed so that you can always come to a safe stop.

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Every obstacle in your way, every pedestrian on the side, every car in front of you

127
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
puts a limit on the speed, as does, of course, the legal speed limit.

128
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
In the controller is one that uses the throttle and the gas to gradually pull back,

129
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
in a PID way actually, to the set speed that's the maximum legal speed

130
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
or drives at the speed given all these other constraints.

131
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The lateral acceleration does impose on the maximum speed.

132
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
When we know we have to drive a turn, we can compute where we do the acceleration

133
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
based on different speeds and then back propagate those into the equation for speed.

134
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
That gives us a limit on speed as well.

135
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Our car naturally slows down before turning.

136
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Does that maximum lateral acceleration depend on things

137
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
like road condition, which I imagine it would?

138
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
A slippery road would, of course, have an effect. >>It should. It should.

139
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I hope so. >>I think it presently doesn't. It will in the future.

140
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
We have a bit of a difficult time right now determining what the exact road conditions are,

141
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
partially because we don't have access to

142
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
the stability management systems on cars themselves,

143
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
but it absolutely should, I agree.

144
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Laurent asked another question about twiddle.

145
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
This one's about correlated parameters.

146
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It seems like with twiddle we're adjusting one parameter at a time.

147
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What if we have a situation where we need to change both of these parameters

148
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
or two of the three or three parameters to really get a better minimum?

149
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That's a fantastic question that a case where twiddle will just fail you.

150
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
If you have a small diagonal ridge and two parameters to co-evolve,

151
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
it'll just fail. There are fixes.

152
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Again, there is an entire literature.

153
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The easiest fixes, if you have happen to know the direction, the can twiddle in that direction.

154
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
There is something called adaptive samplers that actually learn

155
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
about this direction dynamically and build gradients to follow.

156
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
There are all kinds of other methods that look at the surface shape and model the surface shape

157
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
and model the surface shape and find the optimal direction to go.

158
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Again, twiddle was only given because it's so simple,

159
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
and I hope you found it to be very effective.

160
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It was partially given because I couldn't figure out what the right control parameters are,

161
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
so I just implemented this twiddle thing.

162
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But yes, there are many, many ways to improve over twiddle.

163
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Phillip points out that there's going to have to be some sort of time lag

164
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
between when you make your commands and when the car actually responds to them.

165
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
How do you account for that time lag?

166
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Phillip, that's a great question. This is what a lot of our time goes into.

167
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
This is a really, really, really hard question.

168
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The time lag basically kills everything.

169
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
If you take your car and control software, say, and you make a controller

170
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
and then you add, say, a 10th of a unit of time delay in there.

171
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Just try it out and pretend that you're always acting on the previous sensor measurement.

172
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You'll be amazed and how badly the car will drive,

173
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
because it would constantly over steer and under steer.

174
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The best method we have right now is to use a predictive controller,

175
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
which is we have a model of the car.

176
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
We know at what time the control command was issued,

177
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
when the sensor measurement was taken, how much time the processing took,

178
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
and we kind of predict what the measurement would be at the time the processing is finished

179
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
and then use this as an input.

180
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
If you know about time delays in the vehicle itself to execute commands, you add this on.

181
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
The second thing we do is actually model the car more detailed than I pretended.

182
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
In the way I taught it it felt like we could set the steering wheel to any set point instantaneously

183
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
but a physical steering wheel has inertia.

184
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Instead of modeling the set point, we have a secondary controller that understands

185
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
how much torque it takes to turn a steering wheel and uses that as its information.

186
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The better your model the more accurate your control. It takes some work to get it right.

187
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Thank you. The last question comes from Martin.

188
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
He wants to know what happens when the physical model

189
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
that we're basing all of our decisions on changes?

190
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
If the car gets a flat tire, or something along those lines, what happens?

191
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
What happens to people? People are actually quite amazing.

192
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You can do the test yourself.

193
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Pick up a box. You have no clue how heavy it is--someone puts a brick inside or not.

194
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You lift it, You can completely adjust the dynamics of your body--

195
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
the posture of your body--to be able to walk with it.

196
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
If find this unbelievably amazing that we have this kind of intuition how to handle things,

197
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
and we really reconfigure our body.

198
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Cars can do this to some extent.

199
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
They can do it specifically if they have a model of the change.

200
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
If they understand which way, say, a blown tire affects their dynamics.

201
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
There has been a lot of work on this.

202
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You can run multiple predictive models--one with a blown tire and one without a blown tire--

203
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
and then when the one with the blown tire comes along,

204
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
then this model all of a sudden becomes the more plausible to explain what's happening.

205
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
That's kind of what people also do in a very, very fast way.

206
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
They understand, well, I tried something that didn't quite work.

207
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Then they correct for it.

208
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
PID controller is somewhat robust,

209
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
like when we put the drift in the tire, there was a change like this.

210
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
But yes, a blown tire will very quickly leverage the PID controller out

211
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
of the basin of attraction for stable control.

212
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
As a result it could really happen that this thing flips.

213
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
In reality the number of things that can happen to a car are quite enormous--

214
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
from the mattress on the highway all the way to the blown tire to the defective computer,

215
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
which also effects the car.

216
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I wouldn't claim we have solved this problem.

217
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
We are really working on this at Google right now through these different situations

218
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
to make the situation as robust as possible.

219
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
For me it's still an open problem how to control a car well

220
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
and also notice that a tire is blown. Thanks for asking this question.

221
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Thanks a lot for all the good questions. Thank you for helping to answer them.

222
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Next week we're doing SLAM, I think.

223
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
We don't know what slamming is. >>Whatever slamming is.

224
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Who's being slammed? >>I don't know. I think--

225
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Slam, slam, slam, slam, slam. We're doing SLAM.

226
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Come see the SLAM lecture.

227
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I want to say a word that--we've started with many tens of thousands of students.

228
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
There's still a huge number of students left,

229
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
but when you're at this point and ask this level of question,

230
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
you're a serious person. I totally appreciate this. This isn't an easy course.

231
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
In fact, this course is really hard.

232
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Thanks for asking such insightful questions.

233
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm going to go back to the discussion forum and answer some more questions there.

234
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I guess I'll see you in class. >>See you next week.
