1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,259
now that we've learned a bit about the
importance of categorical variables

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:07,890
how about we go back to all tricks to
view how to actually analyze them what

3
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:11,759
we can use is the frequency tool with
our cleanup data to take a look at our

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,679
target field churn since it is a
categorical variable first thing we

5
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:17,160
should do

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,710
just grab that cleaned up data set to
use an input data tool to go grab it to

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,510
drop down menu and go to turn data
cleaned the next thing i want to do is

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,890
go to my back to my data investigation
category and grab this frequency table

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,539
tool inside of this we can ask to get a
frequency result from all of our

10
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:39,238
different categorical of string
variables

11
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:43,289
what I'm going to choose is just that
one turn field and then going to bring

12
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:48,479
in a browse after our interactive output
then hit run to run this analysis one of

13
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,378
the first things i want to know about my
different categorical variables is how

14
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:54,179
many unique groups it has within it

15
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:58,590
in this case since this term field is a
binary field it's a true or false

16
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,180
clearly we have two different unique
options true and false then the next

17
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:08,310
thing I look for is that frequency and
percentage of my different categories

18
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,560
within this variable

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,920
the next thing I look for is the
frequency in the percentage of our

20
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,570
different categories within this
individual variable and it definitely

21
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:23,548
looks that we have way more false values
that are true values it seems that we

22
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:27,868
actually have about eighty six percent
false values and about fourteen percent

23
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:31,650
true values and if we go to the
frequency were able to see that we have

24
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,030
4,200 false values and 700 true values

25
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,100
what i get from this result is that
since there are so many more false

26
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:42,569
values and true values

27
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:48,118
it may actually be difficult to predict
just a few number of records if this is

28
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:52,319
something that does seem actually
logical in the large scheme of things

29
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,849
more customers are going to stay with
their cell phone carrier then actually

30
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:02,009
turn over and go to another carrier but
what I wanted to show you is how you

31
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,359
actually analyze your different
categorical variables within all tracks

32
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,348
and hopefully you're able to see how
easy it is to perform this analysis by

33
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:12,579
simply just bringing in a free

34
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,840
can see table tool
