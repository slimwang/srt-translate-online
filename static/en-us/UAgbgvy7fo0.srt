1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,210
You just made your first workflow. As you

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,380
saw, workflow actions fire depending on some kind

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,338
of event or trigger. When Barack Obama was

4
00:00:09,338 --> 00:00:11,735
campaigning for the President of the United States, he

5
00:00:11,735 --> 00:00:15,050
used salesforce. How might he had used workflow

6
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:19,200
rules in his campaign. Let's say someone signed

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,603
up to volunteer for his campaign. Maybe an

8
00:00:21,603 --> 00:00:24,460
e-mail would be automatically sent to the new volunteer.

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:31,560
Or they could create a set of tasks to ramp up the new volunteer. Or possibly

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,620
they could use the volunteer's location to decide which campaign manager to

11
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:41,210
notify. Now Samantha and Andy will show you how to use approval processes, to

12
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,560
define a sequence of events that involves

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,090
human interaction in the decision making process.
