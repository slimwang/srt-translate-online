1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,560
We can think of diagnosis as a mapping from a data space, to a hypothesis space,

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,220
In case of a medical diagnosis, the data may be the greatest kind of signs and

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:14,080
symptoms that I may go to a doctor with. Some of the data may be very specific,

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,830
some of it may be very abstract, an example of a very

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,540
specific data is that a [UNKNOWN] temperature is 104 degrees fahrenheit.

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,861
An example of the extraction of the data is that [INAUDIBLE] is running a fever.

7
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:30,480
The hypothesis space consists of all hypothesis that can explain parts of

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,600
the observed data. A hypothesis in the hypothesis space can explain some part of

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,840
the data, In case of medicine, this hypothesis may reference to diseases.

10
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,220
A doctor may say that my hypothesis is that a shook is suffering from flu, and

11
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,100
that explains his high fever. In the domain of car repairs,

12
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,450
this hypothesis may refer to specific faults with the car, for example,

13
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:58,210
the carburetor is not working properly. In the domain of computer software,

14
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,950
this hypothesis may refer to specific methods not working properly.

15
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:07,470
And this mapping from data space to the hypothesis space can be very complex.

16
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,250
The complexity arises partly because of the size of data space, partly because

17
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,690
of the size of hypothesis space, partly because the mapping can be M to N. And

18
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:21,520
also, because this hypothesis can interact with each other, If H3 is present,

19
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,450
H4 may be excluded, If H5 is present, H6 is sure to be present and so

20
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:31,450
on. It helps then not to deal with all the raw data, but

21
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:35,910
to deal with abstractions of the data, so the initial data that a patient may

22
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,230
go to a doctor with may be very, very specific. The signs and

23
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:43,200
symptoms of their particular specific patient, but the diagnostic process might

24
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,910
abstract them from Asok has a fever of 104 degrees farenheit to Asok has

25
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:52,780
a high fever. This abstract data that can be mapped into an abstract hypothesis,

26
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,160
Asok has high fever can get mapped into Asok has a bladder infection for

27
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:02,888
example. The abstract hypothesis can now be refined into a suffering from flu or

28
00:02:02,888 --> 00:02:06,060
a flu for a particular screen. At the end,

29
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,070
we want a hypothesis that is as refined as possible, and

30
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:14,600
that explains all the available data. When we were talking about classification,

31
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,880
we talked about two processes of classification, bottom-up process and

32
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,070
our top down process. The bottom up process of classification, we started with

33
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:29,050
raw data and then grouped and abstracted, it in case of top down classification

34
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:33,550
we started with some high level class and then established it and refined it.

35
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,840
You can see that in diagnosis both the bottom up process of classification, and

36
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,920
the tope down process of classification are co-occurring.

37
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,930
This method of bottom up classification and data space, mapping and

38
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:49,640
hypothesis space, and then top down classification of hypothesis space is called

39
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,219
heuristic classification. This is yet another method like rule-based reasoning,

40
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:57,700
case-based reasoning, and model-based reasoning with a diagnostic task.
