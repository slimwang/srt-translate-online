Hello, I'm with Nir Eyal,

2
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,470
the author of Hooked,
How to Build Habit Forming Products.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:06,360
Thank you for joining us.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,910
>> My pleasure.
Good to be here.

5
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,180
>> So,
tell me a little bit about the book.

6
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:10,700
>> Sure.

7
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,310
So, my book is really about
how do products engage users?

8
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,690
How do we build products and

9
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:21,710
services To keep people coming back, not
every business needs to form a habit.

10
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,400
But every business that forms a habit
needs a hook, and so that's what

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,400
the book is really about, it's about
this pattern that I call the hook model.

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,170
This four step process of trigger,
action, reward, investment

13
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,280
that keeps people coming back and using
these various products and services.

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,250
And my hope here is that we
can use the psychology of

15
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,740
what makes products engaging to help
people live happier, healthier,

16
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,880
more productive, more connected
lives by using habits for good.

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,980
>> And now,
I as an entrepreneur use this model?

18
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:52,810
>> Right.
So

19
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,130
if you're building a product
that requires a habit, so

20
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,210
if you think about products.

21
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,810
Some of the most successful companies
over the past several years.

22
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:02,570
Companies like Facebook, and Google, and
Instagram, and WhatsApp and Snapchat,

23
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,350
and Slack these companies have
all formed habits in users.

24
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,400
Now that's not a requirement lot's of
businesses can do just fine without

25
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,780
forming a habit, but if you're the type
of company who's business model relies

26
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,290
upon a habit just like those companies
I just mentioned they would go out of

27
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:21,430
business if they had to send advertising
every time just to bring people back.

28
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,910
So if you're that kind of company,

29
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:26,150
if you're an entrepreneur building
a product that requires people to

30
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,890
come back on their own, you can use this
framework to figure out, hey do I have

31
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:36,120
the fundamental elements that I need to
form, to build a habit-forming product?

32
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,990
>> Is this only for consumer products?

33
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,460
>> No.
So whether it's enterprise products or

34
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,830
consumer products, doesn't matter.

35
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,790
What matters is,
is the product something that people use

36
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,480
throughout their day with little or
no conscious thought?

37
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,840
So if you're building an enterprise
application that, you know,

38
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,150
might be some piece of software that's
put into some server farm somewhere and

39
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,620
nobody actually uses that piece
of software, that's fine.

40
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,490
That's a great business, you know,
you should keep doing that,

41
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:02,370
but you just don't need to have it for
that, because that's not used regularly.

42
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,140
On the other hand if you're building an
enterprise product like a communication

43
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,620
tool, like Slack, or GitHub, or
Stack Overflow, or Sales force.

44
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,910
All of these are enterprise facing
products that necessitate habits.

45
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,270
They require people to
come back on their own.

46
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,780
And for those types of products,
you need a hook.

47
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,650
So these hooks, this four step process,

48
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:25,480
starts with a trigger to an action and
a reward and then an investment.

49
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,010
So every hook starts with a trigger.

50
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:31,090
A trigger prompts the habit and
we have these two types of triggers,

51
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,120
an external trigger or
an internal trigger.

52
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,970
External triggers are things in
our environment that tell us

53
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:37,670
what to do next.

54
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,600
They give us some piece of information.

A friend telling you about this great

57
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,360
new app through word of mouth.

58
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,560
All examples of external triggers.

59
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,690
These external triggers
prompt us to action.

60
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,160
That's the habit itself.

61
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,570
Open an app, scroll through pinterest,
search on google,

62
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,000
push the play button on YouTube.

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,480
These are these actions
that we do with little or

64
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,650
no conscious thought that
are these very simple behaviors

65
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,950
these very small behaviors
that we do seeking a reward.

66
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,240
Which brings me to the third step
of the hook the reward stage.

67
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,020
Is where the user's itch is scratched,
where they get what they came for.

68
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,900
And yet there's a bit of mystery
around what they might find

69
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,120
next time they engage with the product.

70
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,490
So it's not just a reward.

71
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,240
It turns out that habit-forming
technologies integrate what's called

72
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,840
a variable reward.

73
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,450
So this comes from
the classic work of B.F.

74
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,810
Skinner, the father of
â€Žoperant conditioning.

75
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,590
Skinner found that when he gave
rewards to his pigeons and

76
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,920
these little boxes on a variable basis.

77
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,380
So, sometimes the pigeons
would peck at the disk,

78
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,730
they wouldn't receive a reward.

79
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,550
The next time,
they would receive a reward.

80
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,980
What Skinner observed was,
at the rate of response,

81
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,840
the number of times his pigeons
peck at the disk, increased

82
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,030
when the reward was given on an
intermittent schedule of reinforcement.

83
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,040
And so in all sorts of products
that we find most habit-forming,

84
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,700
most engaging, we find this bit of
mystery, this bit of variability.

85
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:01,330
So searching, and scrolling and
scrolling on a newsfeed, or what makes

86
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:06,300
sports fun to watch is the uncertainty
of will our team win the game.

87
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,720
Or what makes for
a great TV show or a movie?

88
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,480
The uncertainty about how the happy
ending is going to unwind.

89
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,460
All these are examples
of variable rewards.

90
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:20,010
And finally, the investment phase,
the last step of the hook.

91
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,620
The investment phase is where the user
is prompted to put something into

92
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:29,530
the product, to invest in the product
In anticipation of a future benefit.

93
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,760
So, the purpose of investments
is to increase the likelihood fo

94
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,820
the next pass.

95
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,360
That's what the investment phase is for,
and it does this in two ways.

96
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,370
The investments load the next trigger.

97
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,460
So, loading the next trigger, an example
of that would be, when I send someone

98
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,450
a message on WhatsApp I don't
get any immediate rewards.

99
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,660
Right?
There's no leader boards,

100
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,540
there's not badges, there's no points,
nothing really happens.

101
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,730
What I'm doing is I'm loading the next
trigger because I'm likely to

102
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,550
get a reply.

103
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,070
>> Right.
>> And that reply comes coupled with

104
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,170
an external trigger.

105
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,580
Hey, here's a message from your friend
which prompts me to use the hook

106
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,880
once again.

107
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,900
The second way that investments
increase the likelihood of an x-pass

108
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,560
is by storing value,
and this is a big deal.

109
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,910
Storing value is when the product
gets better and better with use,

110
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,570
it appreciates in value.

111
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,910
And it does this by storing data,
followers,

112
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,620
reputation, content
>> Photos.

113
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,080
>> Right.
Anything that I'm putting into the app

114
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,800
that gets better and better over time.

115
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,680
And so it's through successive cycles,

116
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,140
through these hooks trigger
action reward investment

117
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:34,020
that now an association has built
with that second type of trigger.

118
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,530
Remember I told you there was two types
of triggers: external triggers and

119
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,720
internal triggers.

120
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,450
The internal trigger
are these things in our life

121
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:45,930
that prompt us to action like a place, a
situation, a routine, a certain person.

122
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,850
And most frequently, emotions that
prompt us to do this next action,

123
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,500
this next habit with little or

124
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,870
no conscious thought, but
without any explicit information.

125
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,550
So over time,

126
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,810
through successive cycles through
these hooks, now we use the product.

127
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,320
Not with a message that tells us,
hey click here, but

128
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:04,920
>> With a need.

129
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,830
>> With a need, exactly.

130
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,320
We internally trigger ourselves.

131
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,880
We have these associations, so,
I'm lonely, I check Facebook.

132
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,640
I'm uncertain, I Google.

133
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,570
I'm bored and
I'm on YouTube or Reddit or

134
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,620
checking stock prices or
sports scores, right?

135
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:22,110
We do these things instantaneously
because of the successive cycles

136
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:22,800
through these hooks.
