1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,490
So Rich mentioned personas and use cases as a

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,750
way to understand our users attributes and their behaviors.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,970
>> Yeah, and remember we asked you to come up with a, three features for pizza

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,390
application for entry. And we have a situation

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:14,720
where you came up with a feature list, and.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,140
>> Yeah.

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,450
>> And we each came up with a different one,.

8
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,680
And we had gone over two options, which is to combine

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,560
the features or just pick one of our feature sets.

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,520
But those are actually both not the right thing to do.

11
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:25,760
>> The way

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,550
we really should have started was, to start with personas and

13
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,760
use cases. Because we could have debated and talked about features

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,770
all day. Everybody had really great ideas of features, but if

15
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,440
we had started with personas and use cases, we would have

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,630
come up with very different feature lists. A persona is a

17
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,050
proxy for a group of actual users of a product, for

18
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,610
whom the UX is going to be optimized. A use case

19
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,840
is the scenario of how, when, and where a persona will

20
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,590
use your product to accomplish a task.
