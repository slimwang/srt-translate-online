00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,650
In the context of data science,

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,830
when creating visualizations, you should almost always focus on

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:10,000
communicating in the most effective manner to solve the problems at hand.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,800
Although data artists, or even a data journalist,

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,650
may be interested in creating a complex graphic to creatively convey

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,310
information, data scientists' first priority is solving problems.

7
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:26,170
Whether that be through models, algorithms, analyses, or visualizations.

8
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,730
When faced with a dataset that you want to visualize, you should inspect your

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:35,320
data, the columns, the variables, inspect what types they are, and always

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,960
choose the right tool, in this case chart, that best represents your data.

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,495
We will see in just a second all the options and how to determine which chart

12
00:00:44,495 --> 00:00:48,990
might be best for representing our given data and conveying a certain message.
