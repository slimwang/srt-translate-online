1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
As we'll see, they'll oscillate faster.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You have to spend some time with this, but for the larger value of 0.3,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
we reach a negative value in y already here, which means we just crossed the line.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This is just 13 steps in whereas if we were back to 0.1,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
then our step 13 would still be 0.6 off.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So clearly the control oscillation is much slower, and we compensate much less
