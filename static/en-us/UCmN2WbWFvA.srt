1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:04,100
A second method for
dealing with missing data is to impute

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,440
new values where values
in the data are missing.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,940
Now if you're not familiar with
the term imputation, in statistics it's

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,350
the process of substituting values in
the data where the values are missing.

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:22,748
Which basically means that when we
impute values, we are making them up.

6
00:00:22,748 --> 00:00:26,280
Some statisticians might not
appreciate that terminology, but

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,755
it's important to realize just what
we're doing when we impute data.

8
00:00:30,755 --> 00:00:36,375
We are creating fake data in order to
develop a model that makes sense and

9
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:39,345
is as close to reality as we can get it.

10
00:00:39,345 --> 00:00:42,765
The last part of that statement
is what's most important.

11
00:00:42,765 --> 00:00:47,750
We want to develop a model that gets
as close to reality as we can get.

12
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,430
So let's go back to our
example dataset and

13
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,310
see what it might mean to impute
data in our survey results.
