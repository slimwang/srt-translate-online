1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,410
Remember how Scatter works.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,010
A root has all the data, and

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,460
it distributes that data
to all the other processes.

4
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,350
Suppose I give you the following scheme.

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:16,340
The roots sends each piece of data, and
all other p minus 1 processes receive.

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,450
My question is,
how much time does this take?

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,290
Here are a bunch of options.

8
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,880
I want you to choose the best one.

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,600
That is,
even if an option doesn't seem exact,

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,080
just choose the asymptotically closest.
