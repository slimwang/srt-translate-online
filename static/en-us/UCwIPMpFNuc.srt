00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,650
Okay, how are we going to make this.

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,510
When I have a complicated
project in front of me,

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,970
I like to break it up
into smaller pieces.

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,640
So, let's start there.

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,630
Here's our high level to-do list.

6
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,990
First, we need to convert a newly
recorded video into a GIF.

7
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,740
Add a caption to the GIF we create and
share it.

8
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:24,160
We also want the user to have
the option to choose from the album.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,610
And we want to enable at least some
basic editing of the video before it

10
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,370
becomes a GIF.

11
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,497
Let's start with this first task and
break it down a little further.

12
00:00:32,497 --> 00:00:35,600
To convert a newly recorded
video into a GIF we'll need

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,640
to present a video camera and
retrieve the saved video.

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,900
Convert that video into a GIF and
display that GIF in the UIImageView.

15
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,860
So now,
we get to start with something we know.

16
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,730
Presenting the camera.
