1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,920
These were the missing signs and numbers for the perfect square trinomial

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:07,752
patterns. Great work if you got all four of these correct. We know the first

3
00:00:07,752 --> 00:00:12,850
one needs to be positive 9, because this middle term is positive 18x. When we

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:17,260
have the quantity a plus b squared, we know we'll get a squared plus 2ab plus b

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:24,530
squared. So, this middle term is 2 times the multiplication of these two terms.

6
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,430
Since we already have an x here, we know that we just need two times this

7
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:32,043
number. So this number would have to be 9. We use similar reasoning to figure

8
00:00:32,043 --> 00:00:35,268
out the other three problems, and we just need to pay attention to what sign

9
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:40,511
this is. This sign will indicate what sign we use in the parentheses. If it's a

10
00:00:40,511 --> 00:00:44,530
minus, we'll use minus. If it's a plus, we'll use plus.
