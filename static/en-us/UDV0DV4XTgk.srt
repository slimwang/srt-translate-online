1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
So, how does it work for startup weekend next.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,809
Well, after the weekend, it seems that you're told

3
00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:07,359
that you're going to be presenting your results tomorrow

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,790
and the types of things we want to see is how big is this idea.

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,940
So, you have to understand that this is a note for the facilitators and coaches

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,780
Is while the business model canvass talks a lot about the business

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,550
the big idea and you need to note this.

8
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:28,930
The big idea is that there's thing external to the canvass that are important for a start-up.

9
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,770
It doesn't talk about competition. It doesn't talk about market size.

10
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:38,760
All of these external forces you need to be asking the team to present as well

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,420
and be constantly thinking about it.

12
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,880
Market size, we'll what kind of interest is this.

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,830
Is this is a large scalable opportunity or is it a hobby?

14
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,250
Or is it like a lifestyle business?

15
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:55,690
Now, those teams might decide that making 300 grand a year is just fine, thank you very much

16
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:59,720
but they ought to understand that they can never raise venture capital or even investment

17
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,240
and that it's a nice lifestyle business.

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,640
There's nothing wrong with that once you understand that that's the game you're in,

19
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,170
but you need to teach them the distinction between a scalable business and one that's a small business

20
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,650
Same for competition. Competition is not on the canvass.

21
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,469
They need to understand the external environment and they need to come in.

22
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:22,040
Understanding the proposed experiments to test each one of the segments

23
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,660
for customer segments, value proposition channel, and revenue model

24
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,850
and they want to know what the past fail signal is for each test

25
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,880
and more importantly you want these teams to hit the ground running

26
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,059
and so they need to come in with a 100 plus contacts

27
00:01:36,059 --> 00:01:39,820
they're going to be calling on in the three weeks that they're in the class.

28
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,790
Where do they get the contact? Welcome to social media.

29
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,050
Friends, family, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.

30
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:52,660
And since it's a team, there are multiple members of the team so a 100 contacts really isn't that much

31
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,270
spread among three or four or five people.

32
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,940
So you need to be able to contact them and they need to be roughly pre-qualified

33
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,660
So, each week the team will have homework.

34
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,420
You know, watch part of the Udacity lectures.

35
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,450
Fill out the business model canvass.

36
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:13,780
Talk to 10-15 customers and then talk to your mentor via Skype or Google hangout

37
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,270
and fill out the Launchpad Central software.
