Thanks, Kai/g. It looks like the picture class has some other methods. In

00:00:03,676 --> 00:00:07,515
BlueJ, I'm going to create a picture object as we've been doing. And I'm going

3
00:00:07,515 --> 00:00:11,162
to fill it with a picture of Jonathan, and here's my picture of Jonathan. I'm

4
00:00:11,162 --> 00:00:16,680
going to translate it a little. Translate, and 100. Jonathan can't wait to grow

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,370
up. Are there any methods in the picture class that we could use to help him

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,800
out? Let's see. Which of these methods might help him grow up? What about the

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:31,470
grow method? If I enter 50 and 50 and then hit OK, what will happen? Does

8
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,060
Jonathan grow 50 pixels wider and 50 pixels taller? Does Jonathan grow 50%

9
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,716
bigger? Does Jonathan grow 50 pixels on each side? Or does Jonathan grow 50

10
00:00:40,716 --> 00:00:41,874
years older?
