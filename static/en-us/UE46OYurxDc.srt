1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,630
And highly intelligent in linguistics would be really good for poets, writers,

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:08,330
lawyers, politicians or speech writers. Because they're really good with spoken

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:13,272
and written words. Scientists, engineers and accountant would really benefit

4
00:00:13,272 --> 00:00:18,320
from mathematical and logical intelligence. Because they're good at performing

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,950
mathematical operations and analyzing information and problems logically.

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,660
Spatial intelligence really helps navigators, pilots, architects and sculptors

7
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,397
do their job. Because they're really good at solving problems in three

8
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:35,297
dimensional space. Musical intelligent benefits musicians, songwriters, and

9
00:00:35,297 --> 00:00:39,444
dancers. Because they have a greater capacity to perform, or compose music, and

10
00:00:39,444 --> 00:00:44,385
to hear patterns and recognize them in music. Bodily-kinesthetic intelligence

11
00:00:44,385 --> 00:00:48,509
really helps athletes, dancers, mechanics, and carpenters. Because the use

12
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:52,149
their whole body or different parts of their bodies to solve problems and make

13
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:58,172
something or carry out performances. You'll see high levels of interpersonal

14
00:00:58,172 --> 00:01:02,393
intelligence in people who live contemplative lives, such as rabbis, priests,

15
00:01:02,393 --> 00:01:07,332
or monks, because they reflect inwards. They really understand who they are,

16
00:01:07,332 --> 00:01:11,370
and what they want. You'll see high levels of interpersonal intelligence in

17
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,770
psychologists, politicians, and some types of writers because they understand

18
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:19,735
other people and what motivates them. And finally, the naturalist intelligence

19
00:01:19,735 --> 00:01:23,875
is great for botanists, ecologists, and biologists because they're sensitive to

20
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:27,775
the natural world, and can understand how to differentiate different living

21
00:01:27,775 --> 00:01:29,819
things.
