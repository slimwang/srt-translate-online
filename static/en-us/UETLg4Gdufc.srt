So, it's important to test your code, because you never know the impact it's

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:08,420
going to have. You sit down and you write a piece of software for one thing,

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:13,520
and someone else might see it a month or year down the road. And think of

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,620
another awesome way it can be used, and you want to make sure that a code you

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,290
write doesn't break in other situations. And I think that's one of the things

6
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,340
that's awesome about computing, is that the code we write has such a big

7
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:28,700
impact. But in order for it to have a big impact, we need to be very vigilant

8
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:33,710
about making sure that it's good. And we build a good product that other people

9
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,715
can then take and do more awesome things with.
