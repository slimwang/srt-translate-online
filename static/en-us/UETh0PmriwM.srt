00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,060
Given this description about how
a traditional Turing Machine can

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,200
simulate a random access model,

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,380
I want you to think about how
long the simulation takes.

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,270
We'll let R be a random access machine,
and

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,570
we'll let M be its
multi-tape equivalent.

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,400
n will be the length of the binary
encoding of the input to R.

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,600
And we'll let t be the number
of steps taken by R.

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,050
Then M takes how long to compute R?

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,770
This is a tough question so
I'll give you a hint.

10
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,210
The length of
the representation of a number

11
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:36,660
increases by most a constant in M,
as it simulates a step of R.
