00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,380
Flexbox, is one of the most powerful
tools that you can use for layout.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,490
It's changed a lot in the last
couple years, but at this point,

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,660
it's hit candidate recommendation and
it's supported by most browsers.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,610
In this class, I'm just going to
show you the current syntax.

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,510
But, in your code and for
anything you're building.

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,570
For production, I want you to make
sure that you're including all of

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,190
the vendor prefixed version.

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,290
So that way,

9
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,800
if anybody's on an older browser,
you're not leaving them out in the cold.

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,720
>> The reason Flexbox is so powerful.

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,350
Is its ability to fill
the space available.

12
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,520
If an element has extra room around it,

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,810
it'll expand to fit or if it's getting
crowded elements will shrink, so

14
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,590
that they take up as
little space as possible.

15
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:43,910
Let me show you an example.

16
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:48,670
Flex box makes it super easy to position
elements left or right, without floats.

17
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,320
You can also change the order of
elements, without changing HTML,

18
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,510
and flex box makes it really
easy to accomplish a lot of

19
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,920
other common layout techniques.

20
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,630
Pete, how do you approach
design with flex boxes?

21
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,880
>> Well, let me show you.

22
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,380
>> Cool.
