1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,108
So let's blow up our sampling distribution a little bit. So we have three

2
00:00:04,108 --> 00:00:11,500
critical regions. The smallest one has a probability greater than this z score

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:18,857
of 0.01, and this z score here is 3.08. And remember that the middle of the

4
00:00:18,857 --> 00:00:22,783
distribution, the mean, has a z score of zero. Then our second smallest

5
00:00:22,783 --> 00:00:27,402
critical region is point zero one. So that's the probability of being greater

6
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:33,270
then this value, which you found was about two point three two. And then our

7
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:40,880
biggest critical region is point zero five. So that's the probability greater

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,700
than a z score of 1.65. The z scores corresponding to these alpha levels are

9
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,113
called the z critical values. So we'll find our sample mean. Calculate the z

10
00:00:51,113 --> 00:00:55,984
score, and the distribution of sample means, or the sampling distribution. And

11
00:00:55,984 --> 00:01:00,422
then look to see where this mean falls. Let's say it falls in the critical

12
00:01:00,422 --> 00:01:05,128
region, any of them, that means it's unlikely. If it falls out here in the

13
00:01:05,128 --> 00:01:08,956
green region or the smallest critical region, we'll report the smallest alpha

14
00:01:08,956 --> 00:01:12,784
level, because that means our sample statistics are really different from the

15
00:01:12,784 --> 00:01:18,119
population parameters. And therefore there's strong evidence of an effect from

16
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,528
whatever treatment was imposed. For example, say we take some sample mean from

17
00:01:23,528 --> 00:01:29,600
some sample size n and then we calculate the z score. So remember we subtract

18
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,580
the mu and then divide by the standard deviation of the sampling distribution.

19
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:39,430
And let's say that we get the z score is 1.82. We would say that this is

20
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:45,185
significant at p less than 0.05. And that's because if we look at where this

21
00:01:45,185 --> 00:01:50,280
z-score falls on the distribution, it falls in between 1.65 and 2.32. So this

22
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,533
z-score, 1.82, is somewhere in this red region. Meaning that the probability of

23
00:01:55,533 --> 00:02:04,510
having obtained this sample mean is less than 0.05. But it's not less than

24
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:11,619
0.01. So it's only significant at probability, or p, less than 0.05. And

25
00:02:11,619 --> 00:02:15,473
remember 0.05 is the alpha level.
