1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,695
Maybe you have the stereotype that women don't like hockey. Well I'm here to be

2
00:00:03,695 --> 00:00:09,070
the exception to the rule for your stereotype, because I love hockey. Wait, let

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:12,886
me clarify that. I'm a Detroit Red Wings fan. That's right, I have only one

4
00:00:12,886 --> 00:00:16,370
team that I'm in favor of, and that's the Detroit Red Wings. Now when I was

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,458
living in Michigan in the Detroit area, I would run into other Red Wings fans

6
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:23,876
all the time. Everywhere we went somebody had on a t-shirt, they had on their

7
00:00:23,876 --> 00:00:28,422
hats. They had on their jerseys. And it was awesome. But now that we're talking

8
00:00:28,422 --> 00:00:31,315
about the Red Wings, that's going to bring us to our next topic. Let me set the

9
00:00:31,315 --> 00:00:35,376
scene. Throughout the years as a Red Wings fan I've had the great opportunity

10
00:00:35,376 --> 00:00:40,700
to watch my team win multiple Stanley Cup championships, and it's been awesome.

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,820
And throughout those years we've also seen a few pesky teams that prevented my

12
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,845
team from moving forward in the playoffs. One of those teams was the San Jose

13
00:00:47,845 --> 00:00:51,510
Sharks. Now, I really had no opinion of them other than that they were a team

14
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,595
that sometimes got in the way. Fast-forward a few years and I find myself

15
00:00:55,595 --> 00:01:00,683
living in enemy territory with the San Jose Sharks and their fans. It turns

16
00:01:00,683 --> 00:01:04,282
out, unfortunately, that a lot of the fans don't like the Red Wings, or Red

17
00:01:04,282 --> 00:01:09,732
Wings fans. Now, how do I know that? I know because I've experienced first hand

18
00:01:09,732 --> 00:01:14,199
what it's like to be treated as an outsider. I'll never forget the time when I

19
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:17,301
finished teaching my general psychology course, ran down to my office, and put

20
00:01:17,301 --> 00:01:22,426
on my Wings gear, and went down to catch the bus to watch the game. I got on

21
00:01:22,426 --> 00:01:27,195
the bus, and I realized that I was in a sea of teal, all Sharks fans. And

22
00:01:27,195 --> 00:01:31,144
immediately they all started booing me. Some people had some off color remarks

23
00:01:31,144 --> 00:01:36,068
about my team. And they were yelling me go back to Detroit. Well, I can tell

24
00:01:36,068 --> 00:01:38,966
you from that experience it was obvious that I was a part of the out group, and

25
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:43,756
not a part of the in group. As you can imagine, the bus ride was a little

26
00:01:43,756 --> 00:01:48,797
uncomfortable. There were a few people who were kind of nice to me. I think

27
00:01:48,797 --> 00:01:52,083
they felt badly because I was getting picked on, but for the majority of the

28
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:56,822
ride people were booing me. Here's the interesting part. When I got to the

29
00:01:56,822 --> 00:02:01,005
arena I saw a lot of Detroit Red Wings fans. They were wearing their jerseys,

30
00:02:01,005 --> 00:02:05,186
had their hats on, and we smiled at each other, we high five. We yelled, go

31
00:02:05,186 --> 00:02:09,299
wings, and here I had total strangers, but I felt a part of that in-group. And

32
00:02:09,299 --> 00:02:13,295
I did not feel a part of the San Jose Sharks, that would be the out-group.
