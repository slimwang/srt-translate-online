00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,460
Just as we can talk about the degree of a
term, we can also talk about the degree of

2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:08,675
an entire polynomial. The degree of a
polynomial is just equal to the highest

3
00:00:08,687 --> 00:00:12,965
degree of any of its terms. So to figure
out the degree of a polynomial we first

4
00:00:12,977 --> 00:00:17,135
need to figure out the degree of each of
its terms just like we did in the last

5
00:00:17,147 --> 00:00:20,545
quiz. If we look back at one of the
polynomials we used earlier.

6
00:00:20,545 --> 00:00:26,773
-12x^7+3x^2+64x, we can see that this is a
7th degree polynomial. We figure this out

7
00:00:26,785 --> 00:00:31,709
by first calculating the degree of each
term, so this one is a seventh degree

8
00:00:31,721 --> 00:00:36,792
term. This is a second degree term, and
this is a first degree term, because of

9
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:42,141
the invisible 1 next to this x that stands
on its own. The highest number out of 7, 2

10
00:00:42,153 --> 00:00:45,963
and 1 is 7, so this is a 7th degree
polynomial.
