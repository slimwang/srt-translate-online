1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,170
Now as you'll remember from the last unit, just having a huge number of potential solutions

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,340
of course does not show that your problem is NP complete.

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:14,300
But it can be an indicator if you cannot come up with any substantially better algorithm.

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,200
Dave currently cannot come up with a substantially better algorithm,

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,560
so he wonders could his problem of shortest tour also be NP-complete?

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,730
That's why, together with Dave, we will now try to show that indeed

7
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,770
shortest tour is NP-complete.

8
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,580
To do that we will go through these 2 standard steps here.

9
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,880
First of all, we have to show that the problem of shortest tour is in NP.

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,470
To do that, as you'll remember from the last time, we actually have to state this problem

11
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,470
as a decision problem. So here's our next quiz for you.

12
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:48,160
How can Dave state his problem of shortest tour as a decision problem?

13
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,130
Given a graph with distances, what is the shortest tour?

14
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:55,090
That visits all vertices of course.

15
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:59,070
The second option would be, given a graph with distances and a number d,

16
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,650
is there a tour of length at most d?

17
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,670
Given the graph with distances, how long is the shortest tour?

18
00:01:04,670 --> 99:59:59,999
Please check the problem statement that states shortest tour as a decision problem.
