00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,190
My name's Chris Morel and
I work in social media marketing and

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,770
concept marketing for
the last ten years or so for

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:10,520
brands including FitBit, Clif Bar, Sony
PlayStation, and now here at Edacity.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,974
When you're setting
up your ad campaigns,

5
00:00:11,974 --> 00:00:14,503
it's really important to think about
what keywords you're going to target.

6
00:00:14,503 --> 00:00:16,441
So if you're developing a fitness app,

7
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:19,063
it might not make sense to
target fitness as a keyword,

8
00:00:19,063 --> 00:00:22,038
because it's really competitive and
might be really expensive.

9
00:00:22,038 --> 00:00:25,535
It might make sense to target a phrase
like hit the gym, or go outside,

10
00:00:25,535 --> 00:00:29,450
or something that might get you a little
better return, because the cost is low

11
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,326
and it's a little less
competitive with bigger brands.

12
00:00:32,326 --> 00:00:35,120
You have to get creative
with keywords and ad terms.

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,070
Five, six years ago, when these social
channels were really getting off

14
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,660
the ground,
things weren't quite as expensive.

15
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,920
It wasn't a lot of competition
with big brands, but

16
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,090
now everybody's advertising on social,
so you have to start getting a little

17
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,870
bit creative with the keywords and
your campaigns to get better returns and

18
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,680
to compete against people that might
be advertising the same words as you.

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,420
>> When we're thinking about acquiring
new customers, we definitely want to

20
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:07,780
make sure our key words are really
targeted to your audience, so

21
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,872
you want to keep them long-tailed too.

22
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:17,648
If you start bidding on really broad
terms, where we're thinking more

23
00:01:17,648 --> 00:01:22,240
father up in the buying cycle or
the buying funnel, right?

24
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,270
So you want to be capturing a user
who's about ready to download an app,

25
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:28,970
for example.

26
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:34,100
So maybe, for example,
it's a music app or music streaming app.

27
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,990
You don't want to be targeting users
who are looking for Taylor Swift or

28
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,140
Taylor Swift music.

29
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,780
That's going to be too broad,
and most likely,

30
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:49,350
they're not going to be as likely
to convert or download that app.

31
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,670
So you want to be thinking really
specific, like music streaming app,

32
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,395
or listen to Taylor Swift
music on my phone, or

33
00:01:58,395 --> 00:02:01,700
Taylor Swift music app,
something like that.

34
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:07,970
So you want to get really down to those
long tail terms when you're acquiring

35
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:13,590
new users off search because you want to
think about how people behave on search,

36
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,460
both google.com and Google Play.

37
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,120
They know what they're looking for,
and so

38
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,740
you want to be present only when they're
most likely to download that app.

39
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,930
The other thing you want to keep
in mind is making sure your

40
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,010
ad creatives are relevant
to your keywords.

41
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:35,020
So if I'm searching for Taylor Swift
music, ideally I see an ad that

42
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,760
says listen to Taylor Swift
music 24/7 or something.

43
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:49,120
So having that relevancy really makes it
more likely that your ad will perform,

44
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,870
that it'll drive more downloads,
capture the user's eye, and

45
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:58,000
you also want to make it clear what
the action is, so in any ad creative,

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,550
you want to say download today or
download the app now.

47
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:06,520
Something really simple like that where
the user knows if I'm going to click on

48
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,420
this ad, it's going to be very
clear what the action is.

49
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:14,607
And it'll make it easy for
me to download the app or

50
00:03:14,607 --> 00:03:18,307
register for your product or
your service.

51
00:03:18,307 --> 00:03:21,335
So yeah, those are the things you
want to keep in mind is keeping

52
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:24,842
the keywords in the ads relevent and
then ultimately the landing page.

53
00:03:24,842 --> 00:03:29,426
So obviously if I'm looking to
download or stream music or

54
00:03:29,426 --> 00:03:33,167
sign up today,
hopefully when I click that ad,

55
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:37,843
it takes me to the registration
page where I can register for

56
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:42,230
your product, or
I can download that app right then.

57
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:47,280
So the most ideal experience would,
say on my phone,

58
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,150
I'm going to search on my phone and
listen to Taylor Swift music on an app,

59
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,810
see your ad, click on the ad,
then it takes me to Google Play Storem,

60
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:58,800
and I can download the app and
start then using it.

61
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:05,420
AdWords function as an auction,
so if a user is looking for

62
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,380
a certain type of product, usually
they're going to see multiple ads, and

63
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:13,600
you might wonder how do I make sure
that I show in the top position, or

64
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,200
at the top of the page,
or even on that page.

65
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,420
So all of that comes down to how
well your campaigns are set up, so

66
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,750
you want to follow those principles
that we've been talking about and

67
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,520
have really tightly themed keywords
that are most relevant to your product,

68
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,810
keep your ads really
relevant to your keywords,

69
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,360
and then ultimately your landing
page is really relevant.

70
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:42,410
So all of that comes into play, but then
ultimately, you can use your bid to,

71
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:48,140
so this would be how much you're willing
to pay for a user to click on your ad.

72
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:52,650
So there are a number of factors
that determine which place your

73
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,640
ad is within the auction.

74
00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:00,070
So which position your ad will
be within the Google results.

75
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,040
Two of those main factors that we
know of, it is an algorithm so

76
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,490
we don't know all the factors that go
into play, and that's part of Google's

77
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:12,710
secret sauce is just keeping it fair so
that no advertiser,

78
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:18,280
one advertiser can play the system, and
know how to place their ad at the top,

79
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,410
but we want to make sure the best ads
are showing for every search query, so

80
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:28,160
the way that we determine that
as Google is two major factors.

81
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,760
One is quality score and
the other is your bid.

82
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,490
And so quality score,
we'll talk about that first.

83
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:39,210
It's a score that combines
the quality of your ad, and

84
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,610
the quality of your keywords, and
the quality of your landing page.

85
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,740
So that's why we talked about why
those three are so important in your

86
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:52,870
campaign set up, because you really
want to make sure you have a quality ad

87
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,720
that really is descriptive of what your
business is, of what your product is.

88
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,570
And that the landing page does
actually direct to your business.

89
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,020
So all of that goes into play
in creating a quality score,

90
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,960
which is attached to every
one of your keywords.

91
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,920
So then when a user searches
a term that triggers your keyword,

92
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,910
that quality score comes in to play.

93
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:20,090
As long as everything is in place and
you have a high-quality setup,

94
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:23,510
then the next thing that the auction
will look at is your bid, and

95
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,650
your bid is how much are you
willing to pay per click.

96
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,690
Now every advertiser can set that
individually per keyword and

97
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:37,410
say I'm willing to pay,
let's say I'm willing to pay $0.30 for

98
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:40,010
a user to click on this ad.

99
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:48,690
Now maybe my competitor is willing
to spend $0.20 for a click.

100
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:53,206
Now my competitor might have a lower

101
00:06:53,206 --> 00:06:58,323
quality score than I do and
in that case,

102
00:06:58,323 --> 00:07:03,440
the combination of the quality score and

103
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,670
the bid will win out the auction.

104
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:12,519
So the advertiser will get the first
position with the best quality score,

105
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:14,140
and the best bid.

106
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:19,010
Now as far as bidding goes, you only
have to pay the amount that'll win

107
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:23,680
the auction or beat out the next
advertiser competing with you, so

108
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,350
if my competitor was bidding $0.20, I
was bidding $0.30, but I had the better

109
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:35,150
quality score, I'll only have to pay
$0.21 to beat out that other advertiser.

110
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:39,760
That's why Google functions as
an auction to make it more fair for

111
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,280
advertisers to decide how much
are they willing to pay, but also,

112
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,050
you don't have to pay more than
the market price per click.
