00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,850
Since we want to know how much money 
Grant will have left after one year, we

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:08,870
need to plug in 12 for n. 
Since n is the number of months that have past.

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:14,470
So m of s of 12 equals 3 million minus 
100,000 times 12.

4
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:19,770
Simplifying gives us 1 million 800,000. 
So grant will have $1.8 million left

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,249
after one year in business.
