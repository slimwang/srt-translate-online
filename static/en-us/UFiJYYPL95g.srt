1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,300
Let's get started with
the Udacity student data.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,300
We'll start with the data
wrangling phase.

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,950
That is, acquiring and
cleaning the data and

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,590
you'll pose a question once you know
what data you have to work with.

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,880
Data acquisition can happen
in a variety of ways.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,490
In this case,

7
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:19,100
you acquired the data by downloading
some files that were available.

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,340
In other cases, you might need
to get the data from an API or

9
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,560
you might need to scrape
it from a web page.

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,470
You'll also often need to combine
data from multiple different formats.

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,945
Now don't worry if some of these
terms are unfamiliar to you.

12
00:00:30,945 --> 00:00:33,840
They'll be covered in more depth in our
data wrangling course which is linked in

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,210
the instructor notes.

14
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,980
It's a great course if you'd like to
learn more about how to get data from

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,240
a variety of different sources.

16
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,840
Your files are in a format called CSV
which stands for comma separated values.

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,970
A CSV file is similar to
a spreadsheet with no formulas.

18
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,330
The CSV format is also very
easy to process using code.

19
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,280
Unlike, for example, and XLSX file,

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,390
which is the format used
by Microsoft Excel.

21
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,230
For example,

22
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:04,140
let's take a look at one of your files,
which contains student enrollments.

23
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,140
Here's what the file looks
like in Google spreadsheets.

24
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,580
There is a row for each time
a student enrolls and columns for

25
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,560
different pieces of information such as
the account key, the enrollment date,

26
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,180
and the cancellation date, if any.

27
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,110
Now here is what the file looks like
if you open it in a plain text editor.

28
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,650
A plain text editor is
a program like Notepad or

29
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,180
Subline that shows exactly
what is present in the file.

30
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,880
As you can see, the actual contents
of the file are very simple.

31
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,790
The header row from the spreadsheet
is present as the first line

32
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,340
of the CSV file.

33
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,550
The second row of the spreadsheet is
the second line of the CSV and so on.

34
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:43,550
Within each row, you'll see
the first cell, followed by a comma,

35
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,730
followed by the second cell,
followed by a comma, and so on.

36
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:52,760
This makes CSV's very easy to process in
programming languages such as Python.
