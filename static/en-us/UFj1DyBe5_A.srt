1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,770
Okay, I'm going to step you now through
the mechanics of short selling.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,795
Pay attention because it's complicated.

3
00:00:06,795 --> 00:00:09,320
[LAUGH]
Okay,

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,810
let's imagine the following scenario.

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:15,919
You want to take a short
position in IBM, and

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:19,597
IBM is currently selling at $100.

7
00:00:19,597 --> 00:00:21,200
That's the current market price.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,910
Joe holds 100 shares of IBM.

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,540
He likes IBM, he wants to hold onto it.

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,817
But he's willing to lend
you those shares of IBM.

11
00:00:32,817 --> 00:00:37,050
In fact, Joe's broker will
take care of that for him.

12
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,860
He may not even know that
he's lending you the shares.

13
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:45,710
Let's suppose Lisa thinks that IBM is
going to go up and she wants to buy IBM.

14
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,060
So you want to sell IBM short.

15
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,850
You don't own any shares of it.

16
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,810
Lisa wants to buy IBM.

17
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,600
She thinks it's going to go up.

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,340
So here's what happens.

19
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,960
You borrow that 100 shares from Joe.

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,440
Now that you have those shares, you
can turn around and sell them to Lisa.

21
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,780
And in exchange for
those 100 shares that you gave Lisa,

22
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:17,300
she gives you 100 times $100,
or $10,000.

23
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,050
So let me recap that.

24
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,100
You want to sell IBM short.

25
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,490
Joe has 100 shares of IBM.

26
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,040
Lisa wants to buy IBM.

27
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,262
So you borrow those 100 shares from Joe.

28
00:01:29,262 --> 00:01:34,533
You immediately turn around and
sell them to Lisa, and you get $10,000.

29
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:38,866
The result of this transaction,
after everything settles,

30
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:44,630
is you have $10,000 in your account but
you owe Joe 100 shares of stock.

31
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,660
And of course,
Lisa has 100 shares of stock and so on.

32
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,880
Now the problem sort of arises here that

33
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,780
Joe may decide he wants
his 100 shares back.

34
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,802
What you'll have to do is go
buy them from someone and

35
00:01:59,802 --> 00:02:01,390
then give them back to Joe.

36
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,640
But let's deal with that
a little bit later.
