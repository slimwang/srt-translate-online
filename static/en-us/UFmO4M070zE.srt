00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,170
We've seen how to multiply polynomials, so now let's see how we can undo that

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,557
process. In this section, we'll learn how to divide polynomials and how to check

3
00:00:08,557 --> 00:00:12,983
our answer. Here's a polynomial, and we're going to divide it by one monomial, a

4
00:00:12,983 --> 00:00:17,012
term. This problem's actually very similar to the problems we've seen in

5
00:00:17,012 --> 00:00:21,127
exponents, and in fact, you already have the skills to solve it. We can write

6
00:00:21,127 --> 00:00:25,762
this another way by dividing the entire polynomial by 2x. These two forms are

7
00:00:25,762 --> 00:00:30,625
equivalent. Next, we divide 2x into each of the terms. So using what you know

8
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:35,489
about exponents and division, I want you to find the answer or the quotient to

9
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:37,010
this division problem.
