1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer to that is that this example is actually wrong.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It does get everybody across, and it gets them across in 19,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
but there's another solution that's faster than that.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's look at our program and see what we did wrong and why we missed the fastest solution.
