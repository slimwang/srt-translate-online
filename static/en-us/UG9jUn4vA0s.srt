00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,710
Let's consider a different case. Supposing we have a case Z of going back from

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,810
the restaurant or the home. Let's also suppose that we're change our index equal

00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:13,780
Kim. Now we are indexing things by the x square coordinates of the destination

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:18,450
not the origin. What will be the indices for the case Z?
