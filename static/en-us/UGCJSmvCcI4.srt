1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,650
Now let's suppose you want to create
a different animation with the second

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,050
hand, like having it spin in reverse.

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,950
To do that, we can click on
the name of the current animation

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,190
in the top left of the Animation window.

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,930
That will open up a drop-down menu
where we can click Create New Clip.

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,900
Let's do that and
call it ReverseSecondsRotation.

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,100
Just like before,
we'll have an empty timeline.

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,720
Let's go ahead and quickly create a
reverse animation with the curve's view.

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,311
First, add the rotation property,

10
00:00:31,311 --> 00:00:33,091
[BLANK_AUDIO]

11
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:37,787
Set the first keyframe to start
at 360 degrees in the Z rotation.

12
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:43,030
Now, make sure the last keyframe
is set to zero in the Z rotation.

13
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:47,010
And just like that, we have our
seconds hand rotating in reverse.

14
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,700
Next up, we'll look at how
to use various animations
