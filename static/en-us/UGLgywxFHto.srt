1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,982
We've seen direct variation and we've seen inverse variation, but these two

2
00:00:04,982 --> 00:00:09,552
don't have to be separate. There are times when the quantities can vary jointly.

3
00:00:09,552 --> 00:00:12,976
In other words, we'll have more than just two amounts related to each other. An

4
00:00:12,976 --> 00:00:17,376
example of this would be simple interest that accrues over time. Simple interest

5
00:00:17,376 --> 00:00:21,687
is equal to the principal amount we start with times the interest rate. The

6
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:26,379
amount of interest that accumulates in one year is dependent, or varies directly

7
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:31,166
with these other two values. If the principal amount were to go up, our interest

8
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:35,463
would also go up. Likewise, if we increase the interest rate, our interest would

9
00:00:35,463 --> 00:00:40,844
go up as well. So this is a case of joint variation. Because simple interest

10
00:00:40,844 --> 00:00:45,068
varies directly with both the principal amount and the interest rate, we could

11
00:00:45,068 --> 00:00:48,946
set up a proportion like this. The principal amount and the interest rate

12
00:00:48,946 --> 00:00:53,050
associated with our first interest would appear directly across from it. So if

13
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:57,145
we had any five of these quantities, we could solve for the remaining one, or

14
00:00:57,145 --> 00:01:01,196
the one that's left out. Let's see if you can use this idea of joint variation

15
00:01:01,196 --> 00:01:02,793
to solve a different problem.
