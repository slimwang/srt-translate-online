1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,051
Let's see first which options
we can eliminate quickly.

2
00:00:03,051 --> 00:00:06,177
NFS definitely allows for
files to be modified, so

3
00:00:06,177 --> 00:00:08,948
immutable is not one of
the correct answers.

4
00:00:08,948 --> 00:00:13,336
And also being a distributed system and
if this doesn't meet guarantees that

5
00:00:13,336 --> 00:00:17,263
an update for a file will immediately
be visible, so it's not Unix.

6
00:00:17,263 --> 00:00:19,298
Now we said that in principle,

7
00:00:19,298 --> 00:00:24,075
NFS tries to make session semantics in
that the updates made to a file will

8
00:00:24,075 --> 00:00:27,621
be flushed back to the server
when the file is closed.

9
00:00:27,621 --> 00:00:30,857
And also when a client
performs an open operation,

10
00:00:30,857 --> 00:00:35,758
the client can check with the server to
see whether the file has been updated.

11
00:00:35,758 --> 00:00:39,044
And in that case, the client will
also update the cached value.

12
00:00:39,044 --> 00:00:43,762
The problem is however, that NFS
can be configured to periodically

13
00:00:43,762 --> 00:00:47,322
have client and
server interactions that check for

14
00:00:47,322 --> 00:00:51,232
any intermediate updates to
our file during a session.

15
00:00:51,232 --> 00:00:54,701
Now how frequently this is done
can be configured and in fact,

16
00:00:54,701 --> 00:00:56,514
it can be completely disabled.

17
00:00:56,514 --> 00:01:01,020
So, in that case, NFS will always
behave like with session semantics.

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,772
However, given that this option for
periodic updates exists.

19
00:01:05,772 --> 00:01:08,652
It is not quite a session semantics.

20
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:13,123
At the same time, it's not purely
periodic file sharing semantics,

21
00:01:13,123 --> 00:01:17,762
because we will still have changes in
the file propagate and file close.

22
00:01:17,762 --> 00:01:18,912
Or on file open,

23
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:23,692
just as what happens with
a session-based file sharing semantics.

24
00:01:23,692 --> 00:01:28,157
So for both session and periodic,
yes, perhaps there are elements of

25
00:01:28,157 --> 00:01:33,314
the sharing semantics that NFS supports
that are session like or periodic like.

26
00:01:33,314 --> 00:01:37,879
And whether it will behave like
with session or periodic semantics,

27
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:41,035
it will really depend on
how NFS is configured.

28
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:44,877
That leaves that by default
NFS is really neither.

29
00:01:44,877 --> 00:01:48,248
It is not purely session-based
file sharing semantics

30
00:01:48,248 --> 00:01:49,904
distributed file system.

31
00:01:49,904 --> 00:01:53,910
And also, it doesn't purely support
just periodic file sharing semantics.
