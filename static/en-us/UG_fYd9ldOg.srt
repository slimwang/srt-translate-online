1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,167
First we have disturbance. And here we mean, disturbance of though, emotion or

2
00:00:05,167 --> 00:00:09,626
behavior. That is, things are not going well in how a person thinks, feels or

3
00:00:09,626 --> 00:00:14,924
behaves. Second, we have dysfunction. And here we mean, dysfunction of

4
00:00:14,924 --> 00:00:20,590
biological or development processes. Dysfunctional behavior interferes with

5
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,302
everyday functioning, and could lead a person to being at risk, or the person

6
00:00:24,302 --> 00:00:29,850
is risking the safety of others. Dysfunction can mean the inability for a

7
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,315
person to hold down a job or engage in meaningful social relationships with

8
00:00:33,315 --> 00:00:39,079
close friends or loved ones. And third, we have distress or disability. And

9
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:43,199
here we mean, distress or disability in everyday life. Especially

10
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:47,583
relationships, work or other activities. Here, the behavior leads to real

11
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:52,484
discomfort or anguish. Either in the person directly or in others. The

12
00:00:52,484 --> 00:00:56,564
distressing element is one reason we may say a person is suffering from a

13
00:00:56,564 --> 00:01:01,643
disorder. It can cause pain to a person and/or other people, especially family

14
00:01:01,643 --> 00:01:06,576
members. And this is an important point to bring up. In something we discussed

15
00:01:06,576 --> 00:01:10,172
throughout the class, that it's not only the person with the disorder that

16
00:01:10,172 --> 00:01:15,521
experiences the difficulty, pain, anxiety or sadness. It's also the person's

17
00:01:15,521 --> 00:01:20,164
loved ones who can experience difficulty as well. That is, it can be painful

18
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:22,804
and sad to watch a loved one suffer through some of the symptoms of mental

19
00:01:22,804 --> 00:01:27,892
illness. Remember in the lesson on memory, when we talked about HN and people

20
00:01:27,892 --> 00:01:32,130
with amnesia or dementia. And how we talked about how difficult it could be, if

21
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,562
you were the husband or wife, mother, father, brother, sister of the person who

22
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:41,768
was unable to remember you? Obviously, it'd be really painful to deal with. And

23
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:47,372
now finally, for the last D, we have deviant. By this we mean, deviant thought,

24
00:01:47,372 --> 00:01:53,316
emotion or behavior. But only if it's also dysfunctional. Deviance alone is not

25
00:01:53,316 --> 00:01:57,926
enough. Deviant literally means, different from the norm, or different from

26
00:01:57,926 --> 00:01:59,904
what most people do. The

27
00:01:59,904 --> 00:02:00,528
[UNKNOWN]

28
00:02:00,528 --> 00:02:05,412
does stress that deviant behavior can be classified as a disorder, only if it's

29
00:02:05,412 --> 00:02:11,204
also dysfunctional. Einstein, for example, was deviant in many ways, but he

30
00:02:11,204 --> 00:02:13,360
wasn't dysfunctional.
