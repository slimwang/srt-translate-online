00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,050
Time to face the final
boss of this level.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:07,357
In this exercise, you'll animate
GigaGal's walk, first by loading up

3
00:00:07,357 --> 00:00:11,282
the animations and storing them
in GigaGal's asset inner class.

4
00:00:11,282 --> 00:00:15,955
Then by getting and displaying the
proper frame in GigaGal's render method.

5
00:00:15,955 --> 00:00:17,645
When you're done, it'll look like this.

6
00:00:19,815 --> 00:00:23,795
To add GigaGal's walk loop,
you'll need to load up the animations,

7
00:00:23,795 --> 00:00:27,275
keep track of how long GigaGal's
been walking, draw the right frame,

8
00:00:27,275 --> 00:00:30,065
and then you just have to sit back and
enjoy your victory.
