00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,719
Typing in long directory and
file names is a big, boring pain and

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:05,190
nobody likes doing it.

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,890
One way you can avoid running out of
fingers is to use tab completion.

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,880
It works pretty much the same
as tab completion for commands.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,630
As you're typing a command or
file path, just hit the tab key.

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,010
If you've typed enough to
distinguish a single command or

7
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,260
a single file, the shell will
automatically complete it.

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,730
Otherwise it will go beep.

9
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,090
Then if you press tab again it'll list
all of the possible completions for

10
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,545
what you've typed.

11
00:00:27,545 --> 00:00:30,210
Experienced Shell users use
tab completion all the time

12
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,970
almost without thinking about it.

13
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,030
Try it out.

14
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,910
You can actually use it to navigate
all around the directory structure

15
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,450
without ever using the CD at all.
