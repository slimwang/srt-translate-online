1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,971
Well, unless Grant plans on paying other
people to buy his products, he'll

2
00:00:03,983 --> 00:00:08,365
presumably bring in some money each time
he sells a nozzle, and each time he sells

3
00:00:08,377 --> 00:00:12,378
a set of wipers. This means that the money
he earns is going to be equal to the money

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,373
he makes from his wiper sales plus the
money he makes from the nozzle sales,

5
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:21,680
which is just this first choice up here.
For example, let's say, just picking

6
00:00:21,692 --> 00:00:27,850
numbers out of the air, that Grant decides
to sell a wiper set for $5 and one nozzle

7
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:33,570
for $3. Well, then we know that money
earned at that point would be equal to $5

8
00:00:33,582 --> 00:00:39,687
plus $3 or let's see, if I was going to
pay for these, it would be 5, 6, 7, $8

9
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:45,648
total. So all we would do to find the
total money earned would be to add the

10
00:00:45,662 --> 00:00:48,093
cost of each of the products together.
