1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,820
Now that we know that we can use
a bullion to represent the check state

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,290
of this check box,
let's modify the order summary so

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,830
that it reflects whether or
not we want the whipped cream topping.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,860
If I say that I want the whipped cream
topping and then I click on the order

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,870
button, then it should add a line to
the order summary that says whether or

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,800
not I want that topping.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,080
It says true if I check
the box to add the topping.

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,120
And if I uncheck the box and
click on order then it should say false.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,590
Android already handles checking this
box and we already have code in our app

10
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:37,650
to handle clicking on the order button
to create an initial order summary.

11
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,320
The part that's left for us to implement
is adding this line of text here

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,940
that says add whipped cream and

13
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:48,010
we need to put in the right value based
on whether this box is checked or not.

14
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:52,210
Before we start diving into the code,
let's think about the pseudo code first

15
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:56,280
to help solidify the main ideas
of what we want our code to do.

16
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,520
When the order button is clicked,
we should do these steps.

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,390
The first step is to get the checked
state from check box, and

18
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,140
then store it in a variable.

19
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,300
So, that's this checked state.

20
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,590
Once the Android device
knows if this is checked or

21
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,410
not, then we can pass this information
into the order summary method,

22
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,710
the method that creates this text.

23
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,520
As the third step, we can change
this text to include this line here

24
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,960
about whether the whipped cream
topping should be added or not.

25
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,120
There are a couple of
steps along the way.

26
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,010
To make sure that you're on the right
path, you can actually log this

27
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:32,220
variable value here to make sure that
it reflects the actual checked state.

28
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,830
We introduced logging earlier, but
here's another example for you.

29
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,510
You can write log.v, and then use the
class name, which is MainActivity, and

30
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:46,160
then put in a string message that
you want to print out to the logs.

31
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,890
By printing out the price here,
we're verifying that after step one,

32
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,880
the calculatePrice method does
return the expected price.

33
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,150
When you run the app on your device,

34
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:00,970
you should be able to check the logs
with this tab to see this message.

35
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:04,610
I use the technique of logging messages
often when there's a problem and

36
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:08,360
I'm not sure which line
of code has the problem.

37
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,830
And then after I figure out the problem,
and everything works as expected,

38
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,520
then I just delete the log message.

39
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,260
So, temporarily,

40
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,240
if you want to add a log message to
print out the checked state, you can.

41
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,055
The reason why I delete log messages
after I don't need them anymore,

42
00:02:22,055 --> 00:02:24,820
is because the log is a limited length.

43
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,540
If you fill it with a bunch
of unnecessary messages,

44
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,100
then it will cause the important
messages and errors to disappear sooner.

45
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:35,390
Once the checked state information
is showing up in the order summary

46
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:39,410
on the device, they you really don't
need the log messages anymore.

47
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,240
When you're done,
check this box to continue.
