1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,969
To bring data from a database in Altrex,
simply click on the Input Data Tool and

2
00:00:04,969 --> 00:00:06,364
drop it onto the canvas.

3
00:00:06,364 --> 00:00:10,299
Next we click over to
the Configuration Window.

4
00:00:10,299 --> 00:00:13,587
And then to the drop down arrow and
choose Database Connection.

5
00:00:13,587 --> 00:00:18,533
You'll need to know the proper way to
connect to your database, whether it

6
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:24,210
be an all ADB driver, an all DBC driver,
or a direct connection to Oracle.

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,316
In this example,

8
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:29,310
we're going to connect to SQL
server using an all ADB connection.

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,521
The first thing I do is
select the all ADB driver for

10
00:00:33,521 --> 00:00:38,070
SQL server, and
then I enter the server name.

11
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,243
Next I select the security
used to log in to the server.

12
00:00:41,243 --> 00:00:45,818
In my case, I'm using Windows integrated
security, so I select this, and

13
00:00:45,818 --> 00:00:49,780
then I can select the database
from the drop down.

14
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,836
I'm going to select from the master
database and test the connection.

15
00:00:54,836 --> 00:00:58,621
So the connection succeeded and
we're good to go.

16
00:00:58,621 --> 00:01:04,220
Once we click on OK, I can pull
the data using several common methods.

17
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,592
So I'm pulling in all the data
from the transactions table,

18
00:01:08,592 --> 00:01:11,945
taking a look at the query
in the query editor.

19
00:01:11,945 --> 00:01:16,244
Test the query and click on OK.

20
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:18,942
At this point,
my connections been made, but

21
00:01:18,942 --> 00:01:22,410
the data can't be shown until
I hit the Update Sample link.

22
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,920
And so now, all of the data is shown,

23
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,951
at least the first hundred
records in my file.

24
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:33,442
If I want to see all the data I
can bring in the browse tool,

25
00:01:33,442 --> 00:01:38,320
run the workflow, and this is all
of the data from my data set.
