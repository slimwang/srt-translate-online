00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,968
Now you've seen a couple examples of the use of the hand operator, so how about

2
00:00:03,968 --> 00:00:09,549
or? We'll put or to use for drawing this Charlie flag. Again, here is my sketch

3
00:00:09,549 --> 00:00:15,096
and we have blue at the top or the bottom. If Y is less than height over 5 or

4
00:00:15,096 --> 00:00:21,210
if Y is height times 4 over 5 or larger, then the pixel is blue. So we'll put

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,316
an or operator here to join these two conditions. Once again, it's your turn to

6
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:29,089
complete this program. Use the or operator for the blue ones, and for the

7
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:35,550
middle strip here, you get to use the and operator one more time. Go for it.
