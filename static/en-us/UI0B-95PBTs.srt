1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,710
This course has 7 units, and I'm now going to give you a brief overview of what we have planned.

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,660
The first 3 units will introduce you to challenging problems,

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,350
and I'm going to do this by telling you about some problems

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:16,320
that are really relevant in practice, yet very, very hard to solve.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,790
We're also going to do a bit of the formal background of challenging problems

6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,080
through a concept known as NP-completeness.

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,330
And I'm going to show you how to recognize NP-completeness

8
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:29,930
so that you'll be able to develop an intuition when you encounter a challenging problem.

9
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:35,500
So the first 3 units are basically about recognizing the hardness of a problem.

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,030
In units 4 to 6 we are then going to discuss what to do if you encounter a hard problem,

11
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,450
because, as I told you in the beginning, many people,

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,530
once they've recognized that their problem is hard to solve, actually tend to stop.

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,710
And these units here will give you various techniques for solving hard problems.

14
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:56,750
Solving them very exactly using techniques such as optimized search trees and pre-processing,

15
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:01,840
but also solving them almost optimally using techniques such as approximation and randomization.

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,670
So this will give you an aresenal of tools that you can use to try

17
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,140
and tackle any hard problem, should you encounter it.

18
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,470
And then in the final unit we'll be going into computability and talk about unsolvable problems,

19
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,820
problems that no computer can ever solve,

20
00:01:14,820 --> 99:59:59,999
and how you could solve them, nevertheless, if you come across them.
