1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,870
So we just talked about how the evolution step in the case based reasoning

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,220
process when decided a correct solution in fact meets the requirements of

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,280
the given problem. Now that we have the new problem and the solution for

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,050
it, we can encapsulate them as a case, and store them in a case memory.

5
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,170
We saw the advantages of this kind of storage earlier,

6
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,010
when we went from home to restaurant. We stored that case is memory so that

7
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,660
when wanted to go back from restaurant to home. We could retrieve that case and

8
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,740
try to adapt it. So case choice is an important way of learning.

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,890
We are constantly accumulating and assimilating new cases. We talk

10
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,640
about two kinds of storage mechanisms. Indexing and discrimination crease.
