1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,280
To begin, we can open our AREMA
workflow from our differencing and

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,100
selecting AR and MA terms lessons.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,300
Now, like we did in our ETS model,

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,020
we'll use a record ID to filter
out a hold out sample to start.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,740
We saw previously in our
seasonal differencing lesson that

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,290
auto correlation after
seasonally first differencing

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,900
has now lowered to a point where
we can add autoregressive and

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,630
moving average terms to account for
any remaining autocorrelation.

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:30,280
This also means our lower case d and
upper case D values will be 1 since we

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,750
took a seasonal difference and
a first difference.

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,040
From the ACF plot, we saw negative
autocorrelation at Lag 1 and

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,240
it is confirmed in the PACF.

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,900
This suggests a lower case q value of 1.

14
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,530
We also have significant autocorrelation
at the first seasonal period like 12.

15
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,609
We can add an upper case Q
term of 1 to account for this.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,370
Now that we have our terms,
let's bring in an AREMA tool.

17
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,040
We'll call the model AREMA,
set Bookings to our target variable,

18
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,620
and set Target field
frequency to Monthly.

19
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,200
On the Model Customization tab,

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,770
let's select Completely user
specified model, and set our terms.

21
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:13,514
The non-seasonal auto regressive
component, lower case p, is 0.

22
00:01:13,514 --> 00:01:16,358
The degree of first differencing is 1.

23
00:01:16,358 --> 00:01:19,756
The order of the moving
average component is 1.

24
00:01:19,756 --> 00:01:22,995
The seasonal autoregressive
component is 0.

25
00:01:22,995 --> 00:01:25,874
The degree of seasonal
differencing is 1.

26
00:01:25,874 --> 00:01:29,694
And the order of the seasonal
moving average is 1.

27
00:01:29,694 --> 00:01:32,262
On the Other options tab we
can set our start date and

28
00:01:32,262 --> 00:01:34,250
the number of periods to forecast for.

29
00:01:35,388 --> 00:01:39,330
Since it is wise to construct more than
one model and compare the results, let's

30
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:43,800
copy and paste our AREMA tool on the
canvas, and change the uppercase Q to 2.

31
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,580
We're using additional seasonal MA
terms because our time series is very

32
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,680
seasonal, and we want to ensure this
seasonal component is accounted for.

33
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,522
Before we hit Run, add a browser to
the R or report node of the AREMA tools.

34
00:01:56,522 --> 00:01:59,530
We can click on the Play button
now to build our models.

35
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,727
The output from our AREMA tool will
show us important measurements such as

36
00:02:04,727 --> 00:02:08,140
the information criteria,
in-sample error measures, and

37
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,733
the remaining ACF and PACF.

38
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:12,264
We'll discuss how to compare,
forecast, and

39
00:02:12,264 --> 00:02:15,200
visualize these results in lesson four.

40
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,850
For now, save this workflow as we'll
come back to reference it later on in

41
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:19,430
the course.
