1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,200
All right, so one of the reasons that
contraction mappings are really cool is

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,820
because they have some very nice and
convenient properties.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,490
So let me state those properties and

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:12,190
then maybe we can figure out why and
how it has these properties.

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:14,130
So the properties are B
is a contraction mapping,

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,970
we know that B is a contraction mapping,
and

7
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,220
that means that any two functions that
we pump through it are going to get

8
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,700
closer to each other than they were
before you pumped them through.

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,734
Then first of all the equation F* = BF*

10
00:00:27,734 --> 00:00:32,810
sometimes called the fixed
point equation, has a solution

11
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:37,920
that there is some F* that you can plug
in to B that causes it not to change.

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,280
All right, so whatever F* was
before after we put it through

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,365
B it stays the same as
it was to fix point.

14
00:00:43,365 --> 00:00:44,430
>> Mm-hm.

15
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,310
>> And there is just one of those,
it's unique.

16
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:52,040
So just setting up this equations
says okay, it has a solution and

17
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,560
we could just call it F* because
there is only one that works.

18
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,060
>> Okay.

19
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,170
>> And a second property is that
we can actually converge to F*

20
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,050
by doing this kind of
value iteration idea.

21
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,180
That we start off with
some value function.

22
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,380
We push it through the operator.

23
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,000
We get a new value function out.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,290
We push that through the operator.

25
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,580
We get a new value function out.

26
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,680
We just keep thing doing this over and
over and over again.

27
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,980
And at the sequence,

28
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:20,770
the value functions, is converging
in the limit 2, the solution, F*.

29
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,700
>> Okay, so that makes sense Michael.

30
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,740
Here's a question for you.

31
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:29,820
If 1 is true, and
I know that B is a contraction mapping,

32
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,069
then doesn't 2 follow from that?

33
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,645
>> Well, 1 is true.

34
00:01:35,645 --> 00:01:40,730
[LAUGH] But yeah, it's actually not so
hard to see 2 being true given that.

35
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,550
So, here's the idea.

36
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,850
So let's say we have some F* and
we know that B is a contraction mapping.

37
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:52,099
Then let's look at what happens
to Ft minus 1, compared to F*.

38
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:52,860
All right, so

39
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,070
by the definition of a contraction
mapping, we have this property.

40
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,151
That there's some gamma less than 1
such that for any two value functions,

41
00:02:00,151 --> 00:02:03,910
they're going to get closer together
after we apply the operator.

42
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:07,387
But the two value functions
that I choose are F of t-1,

43
00:02:07,387 --> 00:02:13,173
the value function that's coming out of
this sequence, and F*, the fixed point.

44
00:02:13,173 --> 00:02:13,820
>> Mm-hm.

45
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:18,860
>> All right, so just by virtue
of being a contraction mapping,

46
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,420
we have to have this be true.

47
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,482
But let's look to see what
this is actually equal to.

48
00:02:23,482 --> 00:02:27,197
So what's BFt-1?

49
00:02:27,197 --> 00:02:28,359
>> Ft.
>> Yep.

50
00:02:28,359 --> 00:02:31,610
And what's BF*?

51
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,307
>> F*.

52
00:02:32,307 --> 00:02:33,004
>> Yeah.

53
00:02:33,004 --> 00:02:37,365
So we're getting closer and
closer and closer to F*.

54
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:42,385
This sequence, however far if was
from F* before we do the operator,

55
00:02:42,385 --> 00:02:46,055
the next time we do the operator it's
at least 1- gamma of the way to F*.

56
00:02:46,055 --> 00:02:48,115
So we just keep repeating this over and

57
00:02:48,115 --> 00:02:50,535
over again and
they're going to be equal.

58
00:02:50,535 --> 00:02:51,435
>> Right, that makes sense.

59
00:02:51,435 --> 00:02:54,015
Okay, so
if B is a contraction mapping and

60
00:02:54,015 --> 00:02:57,970
a unique fixed point exists,
then you have to get there eventually.

61
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,080
>> Right, and then showing that the
fixed point is unique is the same kind

62
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,990
of argument as here, like if we have
two different fixed points then, right.

63
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,487
So if we have two different fixed
points that would mean that we'd

64
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:13,221
have an F* that satisfies
an equation like this and

65
00:03:13,221 --> 00:03:15,810
a G* that satisfies
an equation like this.

66
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,196
And that means if we take F* and

67
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:20,260
G* and we put them through the B
operator they're not going to get any

68
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,560
closer together because they're going to
stay exactly as far apart as they were.

69
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,270
And that violates the notion that
it was a contraction mapping.

70
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,920
So there can't be multiple fixed points.

71
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,430
>> That's beautiful.
