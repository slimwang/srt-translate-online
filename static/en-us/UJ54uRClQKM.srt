1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The initial value for the velocity of the car is of course 120 km/h converted to m/s

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and the initial value for the velocity of the rim of the wheel

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
has to equal the velocity of the car so that there is no slip.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The implementation of the forward Euler method should be straightforward.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The top most subplot illustrates the braking distance.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The endpoint of each these curves is at the braking distance.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The second subplot shows that the car velocity decreases almost linearly.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This is not quite sure of the wheel velocity.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
In particular, you can see that the rear velocity

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
quickly deceases to zero when the strength of braking this too high.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The most interesting part, however, is the lower subplot. It shows the wheel slip.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
If we apply just a little of braking, we're going to run into the lower equilibrium, which is a stable one

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and which is always below the optimum value of the wheel slip of 0.2,

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and to see that for this curve colored in green and this curve colored in purple,

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
we do not reach such a reasonable equilibrium, however, the wheel locks up.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The wheel slip becomes one, which we have seen in the plot above as well.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Among these five options, the red one seems to work best and you see that we must not apply

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
too little braking and that we must not apply too much braking.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You maybe wondering about this artifact here. Remember how we compute the wheel slips.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
One minus the velocity of the rim of the wheel divided by the velocity the car.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
If these two gets close to zero, the ratio is going to vary widely.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This is a numerical artifact. So the reason for this artifact is built into our equations.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
At the end of the simulation, we're dividing numbers, which are close to zero.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That's always a bad idea when it comes to maintaining stability.
