00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,550
In order to establish connections
with investors you have to network.

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:05,620
The question is, where do you start?

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,910
And you can start by going to events and
meeting people there,

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,940
you can start through your own personal
network that's already in place, but

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,670
the key thing is you have
to establish that network.

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,410
And there are various tools you
can use to help with that, but

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,860
there's no way around it.

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,210
Investors are receiving pitches and
business plans from people all the time.

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,920
And what they're really going to
end up paying attention to

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,620
is something whether some personal
connection with the idea.

11
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,700
There's a personal connection
with whoever the founder is and

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,310
that's what you need
