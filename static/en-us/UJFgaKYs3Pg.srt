1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,664
We typically report the results of one-way ANOVA like this. Our F-statistic as

2
00:00:05,664 --> 00:00:10,400
a function of our two degrees of freedom, between and within, our p-value and

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,309
eta squared. Note that when we're doing ANOVA by hand, we can't find the exact

4
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:21,778
p-value. This is the same as with the T test. We only know that our p-value is

5
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:25,810
less than 0.05, our alpha level, because our f-statistic is greater than the

6
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:31,922
f-critical value. If we're using software, it'll be the same thing, except we

7
00:00:31,922 --> 00:00:37,154
can calculate the exact p-value. Notice that we've frequently used small

8
00:00:37,154 --> 00:00:42,186
samples in our examples and problem sets. However, we wouldn't normally use

9
00:00:42,186 --> 00:00:47,218
such small samples, especially in real research. But if we use large samples,

10
00:00:47,218 --> 00:00:52,162
we can't do ANOVA by hand. That would just take too long. We would use software

11
00:00:52,162 --> 00:00:56,010
instead. When we use software, we don't care as much about the intermediate

12
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:01,640
steps. Really, we just want to compare the p-value with alpha. We know that if

13
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,656
p is less than alpha, we'll reject the null. Since using software is so

14
00:01:05,656 --> 00:01:09,562
essential to doing statistical tests, we're going to provide you with some

15
00:01:09,562 --> 00:01:15,410
software output for you to see and analyze, so that you get familiar with it.

16
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,162
This is real data that Doctor Laraway collected from his psychology students at

17
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:24,842
San Jose State University. There are 188 students total, 90 of which were

18
00:01:24,842 --> 00:01:31,204
freshman, 44 sophomores, 23 juniors, and 31 seniors. And he asked them to

19
00:01:31,204 --> 00:01:36,476
self-report how many days every month they drink caffeine. You can already see

20
00:01:36,476 --> 00:01:39,689
that the number of days that seniors drink caffeine is higher than any of the

21
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:45,675
others. But it also has a pretty large standard deviation, as does that for

22
00:01:45,675 --> 00:01:50,692
juniors. We want to know if at least one group of college students drinks more

23
00:01:50,692 --> 00:01:56,102
caffeine than the others. Doctor Larawayused the statistical program SPSS to

24
00:01:56,102 --> 00:02:02,102
answer this. Here's his ANOVA table output. According to this, which of the

25
00:02:02,102 --> 00:02:03,470
following would we do?
