00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,720
Here is the answer to this question.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,410
By looking at the differences, you notice that,

3
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:07,100
of course, there's a peak here, comes down and then goes back up a little bit.

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,410
So the two extrema points here and if you just look at the numbers,

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,090
by just doing differences it's one intensity, but

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,610
when I'm coming here there is a bigger difference this way between eight one.

7
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:21,480
So this allows us to kind of start capturing this kind of information.
