1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Here I've written a slightly more complicated grammar

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
that actually describes part of Python.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We can make assignment statements--

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
stmt is a common abbreviation for statements--

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
by assigning to an identifier an expression value.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Using the rules for identifier and number and +, - and =

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
that we've established previously, I've written down 4 possible utterances.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The question for you, multiple, multiple choice,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
is which of these are statements according to this grammar?

10
00:00:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check all that apply.
