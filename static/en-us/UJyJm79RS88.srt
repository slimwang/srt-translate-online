Hi I'm Shanon Bradshaw director of education

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,270
at MongoDB, MongoDB is the company behind the

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:11,690
open source noSQL database of the same name. Prior to joining MongoDB, I was a

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:16,200
computer scientist working in academia and consulting

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,170
on a number of different data science projects

6
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,510
in the financial industry, social media and other

7
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,810
spaces. This is a class about data wrangling.

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,760
Data scientist spend about 70% of their time data

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,409
wrangling. So what is data wrangling? Well, it's a process

10
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:38,210
of gathering, extracting, cleaning, and storing our data. Only

11
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,020
after that does it really make sense to do any

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,740
analysis. So if you're quantum wall street and you

13
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,910
want to build models to automate trading you first need

14
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,890
to make sure you're basing your models on reliable

15
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,970
data. Or if you're building a map app you need

16
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,820
to ensure your data's correct, or you can quickly find yourself in something

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,710
of a public relations disaster. As another example if you're working on

18
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,850
a smaller scale Analyzing data for a research team, you want to

19
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,200
ensure your team can make decisions based on the data you're providing. If

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,910
you don't take the time to ensure your data is in good

21
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,500
shape before doing any analysis, you run a big risk of wasting

22
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,710
a lot of time later on, or worse, losing the faith of

23
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,230
your colleagues, who depend on the data you've prepared. It's a little like

24
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,320
putting the cart before the horse. So while we're going

25
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,550
to get to some analysis, That's why we're doing all this

26
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,200
in the first place. This class is really about getting

27
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,650
your data ready so that any analysis is built on a

28
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:30,200
solid foundation of good data. Here you're going to get

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,700
a chance to do some tinkering. We're going to develop your

30
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,040
hacker muscles, or, should I say, wrangler muscles. We'll work

31
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,340
with lots of different types of data. For music, energy, Wikipedia,

32
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,090
and Twitter, to name a few. We'll also teach you how

33
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,280
to work with data in most of the formats you're likely

34
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,290
to see. JSON, XML, CSV, Excel, and HTML. And even some

35
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:54,170
legacy text formats. In the last half of the course, we'll

36
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,390
show you how to store your data in MondoDB, and use

37
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:00,390
it to support analysis. Mongo DB is becoming increasingly important to

38
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,930
data scientists around the world, as a powerful and scalable tool

39
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,370
for big data problems. And we'll wrap it up with a

40
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,300
case study, that allows you to put all the pieces together.

41
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,650
We're happy to have you in the class. Let's get started.
