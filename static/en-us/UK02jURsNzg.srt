00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,270
Thanks for your response.

2
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:04,160
Now remember,
your goal should be authentic and

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,770
specific, something you
actually care about.

4
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,730
They should have short term deadlines,
so within the next few months or so.

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,020
They should be measurable.

6
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,380
And finally, they should realistic.

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,322
Now you want to pick something
that's challenging, yet

8
00:00:17,322 --> 00:00:20,398
attainable given your staffing and
financial resources.

9
00:00:20,398 --> 00:00:24,258
It's just not realistic to think that
you're going to go from 0 to 100 million

10
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:25,910
users overnight.

11
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,300
Okay, so here are our goals for
Embarkment.

12
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,330
First, increase traffic of dog
owners to our site by 5% monthly for

13
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,820
the next four months.

14
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:35,500
And second,

15
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,870
increase the number of qualified
sitters by 8% within the next 60 days.
