1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,483
So we already talked about the general
version of the distributive property is

2
00:00:04,495 --> 00:00:09,280
that if you have some variable, or number,
or expression, or really anything in the

3
00:00:09,292 --> 00:00:13,762
slot where a is and you want to multiply
that by some set of terms that are added

4
00:00:13,774 --> 00:00:18,883
together Inside parentheses. They could
also, of course, be subtracted. Then the

5
00:00:18,895 --> 00:00:22,737
factor that you want to multiply
everything by distributes its

6
00:00:22,749 --> 00:00:27,718
multiplication to each term that's inside
the parentheses. So we end up with a * b,

7
00:00:27,823 --> 00:00:32,051
or ab over here, + a * c, ac over here.
Now, we already saw how we use the

8
00:00:32,063 --> 00:00:36,295
distributive property when we want to
subtract polynomials from one another. But

9
00:00:36,307 --> 00:00:40,540
in those situations, we let a = -1, and
clearly, a could equal many other things

10
00:00:40,552 --> 00:00:44,304
besides -1. So, let's try something out,
where a is a different number.
