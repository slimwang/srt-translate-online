00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,609
Here is my answer.

2
00:00:01,609 --> 00:00:05,050
We run the input program
M on the empty string.

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,330
If this loops then N will as well.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,350
On the other hand,

5
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:14,370
if this halts, then we just accept
everything including the string 34.

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,950
In one case,
the language of N is the empty set.

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,800
In the other, it is sigma*,
every input string.

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,240
And a decider for
L could tell the difference.
