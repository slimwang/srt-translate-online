1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,740
So, the first concept we will learn

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,830
in full tolerance is dependability. Dependability is

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,782
a quality of delivered service, meaning a

4
00:00:08,782 --> 00:00:13,210
characteristic of delivered service, that justifies relying

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:19,390
on the system to provide its service. So pretty much a dependable system

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:25,420
is one that provides the service in a way that makes us expect it to

7
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,710
provide it correctly and in a dependable way.

8
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,818
Now, the service actually has two definitions. One

9
00:00:33,818 --> 00:00:36,260
is the specified service, which is what the

10
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,130
behavior of the system should look like. And then

11
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:43,150
we have delivered service which is actual behavior.

12
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,180
This is the behavior we actually got out

13
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,420
of the system. So we could say that

14
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,550
dependability is really about can we expect the delivered

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,720
service to match the specified service. Can we get

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,052
what we are supposed to be getting from this system.

17
00:00:58,052 --> 00:01:01,076
Now of course the system has some components which

18
00:01:01,076 --> 00:01:04,500
are called modules. So these are not components like transistors

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,280
and so on. These are the kind of largest

20
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,900
components of the system. So for example, a computer system

21
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,450
will have a processor and a memory and so

22
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,935
on. Each of these has components of its own and

23
00:01:15,935 --> 00:01:18,970
so on. And for each of these modules

24
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,620
we can specify some behavior that it should be

25
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,541
ideally getting. So each module has some sort

26
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:27,760
of ideal behavior that we will want to expect

27
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,718
from it, but of course real modules will

28
00:01:30,718 --> 00:01:35,060
maybe not always exhibit this ideal behavior. So when

29
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,890
we talk about things that make the system

30
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:41,180
not be dependable, we're really talking about modules deviating

31
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,740
from specified behavior and that causing the system to deviate

32
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,850
so that the delivered service no longer matches the specified service.
