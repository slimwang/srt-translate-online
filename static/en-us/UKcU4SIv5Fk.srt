1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,150
In general, too much patient care
in the U.S. is provided this way.

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:08,882
In part, as we just discussed,
this is because of patient choice.

3
00:00:08,882 --> 00:00:15,183
But, if all patients wanted a PCP, we
don't have enough of them to go around.

4
00:00:15,183 --> 00:00:19,759
Only 12.3% of US patients practice

5
00:00:19,759 --> 00:00:25,020
primary care versus
around 50% in France.

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:30,540
The same comparison holds true with
other advanced industrialized nations.

7
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,790
You can see here, the U.S.

8
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,550
lags substantially in the percentage
of primary care physicians.

9
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,443
The full reasons are beyond
the scope of this course.

10
00:00:40,443 --> 00:00:44,884
But one of them is that specialist,
shown in green here,

11
00:00:44,884 --> 00:00:48,318
makes significantly
more money than PCPs.

12
00:00:48,318 --> 00:00:51,469
Yet, as also shown here in blue,

13
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:57,240
they leave medical school
with the same debt level.

14
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:02,110
So it shouldn't be a surprise,
as shown here, that over the years

15
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:06,200
the percentage of medical school
graduates selecting primary care,

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:12,510
the bottom blue line here,
has decreased, as the salary of a PCP,

17
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,960
as a percentage of what a specialist
makes, has also declined.
