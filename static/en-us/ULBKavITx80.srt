00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,851
Recall also the related idea of neuroplasticity from the brain lesson. Neurons

2
00:00:04,851 --> 00:00:10,408
grow and develop when they're used and stimulated by experience. And of course,

3
00:00:10,408 --> 00:00:14,612
our favorite, Hebb's Law. Neurons that fire together, wire together. Our brain

4
00:00:14,612 --> 00:00:17,384
neural growth are shaped by experience especially in the first few years of

5
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:21,198
life. Neural growth is rampant in the womb and during the first year or two of

6
00:00:21,198 --> 00:00:26,024
life. But not all of this growth is happening just because of experience. Some

7
00:00:26,024 --> 00:00:29,186
of it happens just because we have such big, complex brains and they need to

8
00:00:29,186 --> 00:00:33,900
develop. All of this random neural growth ultimately does have a price to pay.

9
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,844
These random neural connections that are not stimulated and strengthened due to

10
00:00:37,844 --> 00:00:42,535
experience end up dying off. Or in other words, they're pruned. And this is

11
00:00:42,535 --> 00:00:43,969
know as neural pruning.
