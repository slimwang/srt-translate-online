00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,558
To find the perimeter of our rectangle, we simply add up the sides around the

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:08,968
shape. So we have two l's, and two w's. You might have written this equation,

3
00:00:09,071 --> 00:00:13,749
which also is correct. We want to combine the two l's, however, because they're

4
00:00:13,761 --> 00:00:16,045
like terms. The same is true for the w's.
