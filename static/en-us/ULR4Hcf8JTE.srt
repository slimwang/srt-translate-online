1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,050
Okay, hopefully you've absorbed
that pattern into your fingers.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,920
So now you know how to type
at updating variables.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,210
We hope this reduces your errors
when you're adding this code to

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:08,800
Android Studio.

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,760
Here's what the value of
the quantity variable is after

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,220
each line of code is executed.

7
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,680
It starts off at 2 and
then you add 1 to it, so it becomes 3.

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,700
Then you add 1 to that again,
and it becomes 4.

9
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,400
Then you add 1 again and it becomes 5.

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,030
So after all of these lines
of code are executed,

11
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,524
the latest value of
the quantity variable is 5.
