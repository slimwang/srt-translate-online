>> Thinking back to what information we started off with, or what information we

00:00:03,847 --> 00:00:07,764
had after we calculated the slope for this problem. Did using point slope form

3
00:00:07,764 --> 00:00:11,424
to get us eventually to the slope intercept form of our equation, give us a

4
00:00:11,424 --> 00:00:15,337
short cut? Or did it actually give us extra work? We know that, in some cases,

5
00:00:15,337 --> 00:00:17,772
it helps us out. But was that the case this time?
