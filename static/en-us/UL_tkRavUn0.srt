1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,870
>> Okay, Michael, so here's the quiz. Are you ready?

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:04,740
>> Sure.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,287
>> Okay, so here's what's going on. I have copied over our little grid world

4
00:00:09,287 --> 00:00:15,315
over here twice. So it's the same grid world except I have changed the rewards

5
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:20,180
that you will receive in all of the states other than the two absorbing states.

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:25,440
So for the top one you get a reward of plus two. In every single

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,720
state, except for the absorbing states, and in the bottom one you receive a

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,200
reward of minus two in every single state but the absorbing states, got it?

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,120
>> Interesting.

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,120
>> So, what I'm going to want you to do is, I'm going to want

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,290
you to fill in for these boxes that I've indicated, these same four boxes in

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,970
the top and the bottom, whether you should go up, down, left or right. So

13
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:50,380
enter into each one of them either Up U, D down, R right, L left,

14
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,590
okay?

15
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,960
>> Yeah, I appreciate you making the numbers nice and big, because I was

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,950
worried you're going to say something like minus 0.13. But this, this I think.

17
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,670
>> I can do that.

18
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:04,360
>> No, no, no, that wasn't a suggestion. Yeah, let's go with the plus two and

19
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,870
minus two. I feel like there's a better chance I might be able to get it.

20
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,620
>> [LAUGH] Okay, so you think you got the what we're trying to do here?

21
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:15,440
>> I do. Now just to, just to keep, just to make sure that I'm there,

22
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,700
the plus one and the minus one end the game,

23
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,230
and there's no more reward after that, it's like zero forever.

24
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,060
>> Yep.

25
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,100
>> And the other things, the blueish rewards, I would get them.

26
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:25,480
>> Mm-hm.

27
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,510
>> Continually until a state is reached.

28
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,020
>> Right, exactly.

29
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,595
>> Where the game ends, okay Yeah. No, that's, that's, that's cool.

30
00:01:32,595 --> 00:01:34,910
>> Okay, cool. Alright so go.
