1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,650
Now that you've downloaded CocoaPods,
we can use the pod file

2
00:00:03,649 --> 00:00:08,820
included in our example code, to fetch
the dependencies we need for Firebase.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,490
Let's open the pod file, inside
the project folder for FriendlyChat.

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,519
This pod file was provided for you, so

5
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:15,980
you don't have to create
one from scratch.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,990
But when you start using Firebase for
your own apps,

7
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:19,931
you're going to have to
create one yourself.

8
00:00:19,931 --> 00:00:22,989
If you're curious what a process for
this would look like,

9
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:27,219
we've included instructions for making a
pod file from scratch, in the resources.

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,310
So here's our pod file, and we have
this list of dependencies called pods,

11
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,250
that we will be using for our app.

12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,539
to incorporate these dependencies,
for the first time.

13
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,700
We need to run pod install.

14
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,516
But before we do,
it's best to close Xcode,

15
00:00:43,515 --> 00:00:46,119
to ensure a smooth download and install.

16
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:49,439
So I've closed the project and
I'll run pod install, from the terminal.

17
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:51,339
While at the root directory,
for our project.

18
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:54,482
This creates an Xcworkspace,

19
00:00:54,482 --> 00:00:58,573
that includes all the dependencies
mentioned in the pod file.

20
00:00:58,573 --> 00:01:01,039
And we can see that file, right here.

21
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,142
Now a quick note.

22
00:01:02,142 --> 00:01:04,707
If you've already generated
an Xcworkspace, but

23
00:01:04,707 --> 00:01:07,161
then you decide to make
changes to your pod file.

24
00:01:07,161 --> 00:01:11,530
You can always run Pod Update, and
this will reconfigure the Xcworkspace.

25
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,299
Based on the changes.

26
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:15,549
Just be sure to close your workspace,
before you do it.

27
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:21,329
Also, from now on, we'll be sticking
strictly to using the xcworkspace,

28
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:23,670
instead of the previous xc project file.

29
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,536
In case you weren't aware Xcode
projects or XC projects contain files,

30
00:01:29,536 --> 00:01:33,623
settings, and targets, for
building products like an app.

31
00:01:33,623 --> 00:01:36,729
And expanding a little
bit further on this idea,

32
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,700
we have Xcode workspaces,
or Xcworkspaces.

33
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,100
Which contain multiple Xcode projects,
that can reference one another.

34
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,510
So this Xcworkspace
that we just generated,

35
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,829
actually contains multiple projects.

36
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:51,989
One containing your code, and
another containing the code, for

37
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:53,269
the pods that we pulled in.

38
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,109
Now let's open the new Xcode workspace,
and try running the app.

39
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,530
If the app compiles and

40
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,719
you see this empty table view,
then you're good to go.

41
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,000
But if you aren't seeing this, or
you get stuck somewhere along the way.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,800
Then I suggest, going on the forums and
asking around, to get some help.
