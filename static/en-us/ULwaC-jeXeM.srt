00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,719
While we're on the subject of this sort
of picture of a matrix multiply, and

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:07,939
I mean the picture on the left, I want
to mention a related geometric way of

3
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:11,240
thinking about how
a matrix multiply works.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,890
This geometric view will give you a
handy fact which you'll need later when

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:19,710
I ask you, what's the minimum amount of
communication a matrix multiply needs?

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,168
Oh, the intrigue.

7
00:00:21,168 --> 00:00:24,820
The intrigue, oh!

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,500
Starting with this initial picture,

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,720
I want you to imagine a cuboid where
the faces are the matrix operands.

10
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,990
Notice how the edges match the same
way the dimensions need to match.

11
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,700
For example, where A has k columns,
and B has k rows.

12
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,760
There's a matching edge.

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,100
The same holds for the columns of B and
the corresponding edge of the cube.

14
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,460
Columns of B, and corresponding edge.

15
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:54,160
Recall that an element i, j of C depends
on row i of A and column j of B.

16
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,610
In the cube,
there's also an element i, j of C.

17
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,419
The dependents on A and
B is a line that cuts through here.

18
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,610
And if line is a projection of
a row from A and a column from B.

19
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:13,030
Now each of these scalar multiplications
is like a point inside this cube.

20
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,270
Let's think about what that means.

21
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:20,500
Suppose I pick a set of matching
rectangular blocks from A, B and C.

22
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:25,180
So here I picked an r by s block of A,
a matching s by t block of B,

23
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,760
and of course there's the corresponding
matching output which is r by t.

24
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,950
If they're perfectly aligned,

25
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,340
then they define a volume of
the interior of the cube.

26
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,970
In other words, this volume is the set
of all multiplications you need to do

27
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,680
in order to update this output block
with these two surface sub-blocks.

28
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,720
How many multiplies is that?

29
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,210
Well, it's just the volume of the
interior, so that's r times s times t.

30
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,720
In terms of the sizes of the sub blocks

31
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,500
it's just the square
root of their product.

32
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,420
In fact, there's a general result
from the geometry of discrete

33
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,750
lattices like this one, for
any integer cube of point,

34
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,070
suppose I give you
a subset of its surfaces.

35
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,550
Let's call them SA, SB, and SC.

36
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,290
Now there may be some blob of
intersection in the interior,

37
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,010
we'll call that I.

38
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,350
The theorem is this,
the volume of I is at most

39
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:22,190
the square root of the size of A, times
the size of B, times the size of C.

40
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,650
This is a theorem due to Lumis and
Whitney in 1949 and

41
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,220
a sighted in the instructors notes.
