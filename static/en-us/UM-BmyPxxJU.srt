00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,029
We know Olivia can travel 30 miles, so we'll have her distance as 30. And

2
00:00:05,029 --> 00:00:10,242
Terrance can go 15 miles, so his distance would be 15. And here's where we

3
00:00:10,242 --> 00:00:15,514
want to be careful. We can either let x be Olivia's rate or Terrance's rate. We

4
00:00:15,514 --> 00:00:19,920
know Olivia can go 4 miles per hour faster than Terrance. So we'll just add

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,974
four to whatever Terrance's rate is. We don't know Terrance's rate, so I think

6
00:00:23,974 --> 00:00:29,304
it's best to use x here. If we do this, Terrance will be x and Olivia will be

7
00:00:29,304 --> 00:00:35,040
four more than that, four x plus four. And finally, to find the time, we'll

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,188
take the distance of Olivia and divide it by her rate. So the time is 30

9
00:00:40,188 --> 00:00:46,478
divided by x plus 4. We do the same thing for Terrance, since his time would be

10
00:00:46,478 --> 00:00:51,360
distance divided by rate, or 15 divided by x.
