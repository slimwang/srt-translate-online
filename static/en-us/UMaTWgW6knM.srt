1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:00,640
There' s at least

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,520
one function in this app that
would benefit from transactions.

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,960
And, that is registration for
a conference.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,060
When a person registers for a
conference, the app needs to change two

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,360
pieces of data, the number of seats
available at the conference, and

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,080
the set of conferences,
the user is registered to attend.

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,780
The number of available seats
is the seats available field in

8
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,930
the conference record.

9
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,570
And, we'll keep track of people's
registrations by adding a field to their

10
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,460
profile, with the conference keys.

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,770
Transactions let us guarantee that both
of these changes will happen in sync,

12
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:27,690
with each other.

13
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,910
If we updated the conferences for
a user, but didn't update the seats

14
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,910
available, then if two people
registered at the same time.

15
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,330
They could both be trying
to take the last seat.

16
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,710
Transactions prevent
that race condition.

17
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,880
Making sure that an api function
uses transactions is easy.

18
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,360
You just have to add the decorator
nbd.transactional to the function.

19
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,670
And, if the transaction has to work on,
several kinds of entities that belong to

20
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:54,590
different entity groups, you have to
use the parameter xg equals True.

21
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,760
xg stands for cross group.

22
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,520
The default behaviour for transactions
is to work on only one entity group.

23
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,650
An entity group is defined as, entities
that belong to the same ancestral path.

24
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,000
So, in this case, a conference
that was created by user Joe, and

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,370
the profile of user Joe,
are in the same entity group.

26
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,090
While a conference created by Alice,

27
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,660
is in a different group than
the profile of user Joe.

28
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,750
You'll also need to modify
the user profile class,

29
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,150
to have a property that
will hold conference keys.

30
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,257
See TODO 6 files, for

31
00:01:22,257 --> 00:01:26,120
the additional functions that
implement conference registration.

32
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,690
So as you complete this, check these
off, and then, think about this.

33
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,810
What is the correct decorate
to use in this case?

34
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,644
Is it ndb.transactional,
ndb.transactional xg equals False,

35
00:01:35,644 --> 00:01:37,941
or ndb.transactional xgequals True?
