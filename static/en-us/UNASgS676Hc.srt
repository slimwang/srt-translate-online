Let's say we reject the null, that means we think it's going to rain. That

2
00:00:04,454 --> 00:00:08,816
means we're going to bring our umbrella. Alternatively, if we retain the null,

3
00:00:08,816 --> 00:00:13,904
we decide it's not going to rain, then we won't bring our umbrella. Remember

4
00:00:13,904 --> 00:00:17,500
that, these two rejecting the null or retaining the null correspond to our

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,358
decision. If the null is true, meaning that it's not going to rain, then we

6
00:00:22,358 --> 00:00:28,820
should put A here. And if the null is false, that means it rains. Hopefully,

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,133
this helped illustrate the concept of type one and type two errors.
