00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,402
>> Fantastic. The solution for this is pretty straight forward, based upon what

2
00:00:03,402 --> 00:00:06,699
we've already seen. Firstly, we walk through all the tile set's inside of the

3
00:00:06,699 --> 00:00:10,496
map object that we've created. For each one of them, we've created a new image,

4
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:14,522
set it's on load function, and then set it's source name. Once we are loaded,

5
00:00:14,522 --> 00:00:18,554
effectively we increment the imgLoadCount variable, and then we test if the

6
00:00:18,554 --> 00:00:22,838
imgLoadCount variable is equal to the number of tile sets that could potentially

7
00:00:22,838 --> 00:00:27,183
occur. So effectively, we are saying that our number of images loaded equal to

8
00:00:27,183 --> 00:00:31,586
number of images that exist. If so, we can set fully loaded to true. Now, you'll

9
00:00:31,586 --> 00:00:36,002
notice one annoying little variants of the JSON format for tiled, is that the

10
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:40,349
image path is actually an absolute path to the file from where the editor and

11
00:00:40,349 --> 00:00:44,871
base file were formed. So effectively, what this is saying is that, given the

12
00:00:44,871 --> 00:00:49,491
path to tiled, there's some really crazy file path to actually get to the grid's

13
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:53,820
master PNG from the source file we're using. So, to properly load that, what

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,242
we'd like to do is strip out all of the other data that's not just the file

15
00:00:57,242 --> 00:01:00,980
name. And then, append the file name to our data directory. Now, this is because

16
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,444
our editing environment may be in a different directory structure than our

17
00:01:04,444 --> 00:01:08,347
production environment that users are actually playing. For grids, we use this

18
00:01:08,347 --> 00:01:12,373
nifty little regular expression here that allowed us to replace all of the data

19
00:01:12,373 --> 00:01:16,338
before the final slash with blank characters, giving us the file name for this

20
00:01:16,338 --> 00:01:20,726
image. We appended that filename to the ../data directory, giving us the source.
