00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,977
You're really mastering division, if you got 3x plus 7. First we think about

2
00:00:04,977 --> 00:00:10,097
what number times 5x, would give us 15x squared, that must be 3x, 3x times 5x is

3
00:00:10,097 --> 00:00:15,011
15x squared, and 3x times negative 4 is negative 12x. Now we subtract this

4
00:00:15,011 --> 00:00:20,702
expression, which changes both of the signs. 15x Squared minus 15x squared is 0,

5
00:00:20,702 --> 00:00:26,162
and 23x plus 12x is 35x, we bring down the negative 28 to continue our long

6
00:00:26,162 --> 00:00:31,922
division. Repeating our process one more time, we want to think about what

7
00:00:31,922 --> 00:00:37,824
number times 5 x gives us 35 x? That should be positive 7. Positive 7 times 5x,

8
00:00:37,824 --> 00:00:43,370
is 35x, and positive 7 times negative 4 is negative 28. We subtract this

9
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:49,442
expression, which changes both of the signs, this leaves us with a remainder of

10
00:00:49,442 --> 00:00:52,108
0, so our final answer is 3x plus 7.
