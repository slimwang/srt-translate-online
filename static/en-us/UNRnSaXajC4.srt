1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,290
In the last lesson,
we focused on access control, but

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,990
in particular what we called
discretionary access control.

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,760
The idea there is that access
control is about checking

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,648
if the source of a request should be
able to gain access to a resource.

5
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:18,450
We know that who the user
is because user comes and

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,648
authenticates himself or herself.

7
00:00:20,648 --> 00:00:22,240
So in discretionary access control,

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,850
we said whoever creates the resource
is the owner of that resource.

9
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:31,810
So the owner can also selectively
grant access to other users.

10
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:36,260
For example, Bob may both be able
to read and write, and Charlie

11
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,910
can either read or write or maybe just
has read access or something like that.

12
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,090
So the idea of a discretionary
access control model is

13
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,710
that resources have
owners who are users.

14
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,520
And these owners get to decide,

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,530
it's at their discretion, who else
should be able to share these resources.

16
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:56,880
In this lesson, we're going to examine
if this model has any limitations or

17
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,980
any problems.

18
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,830
Are there situations where it's
not going to do the job for us?

19
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,940
And if that is the case, then what other
kind of models do we need to develop

20
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,140
to meet those applications, or

21
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,240
those needs that arise when
we talk about access control?
