1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,412
The inverse of 8 is a number that when
we add to 8 MOD 20 will result in 0.

2
00:00:06,412 --> 00:00:13,984
So obviously the answer is 12,
because 8 + 12 MOD 20 is 0,

3
00:00:13,984 --> 00:00:19,700
because 8 plus 12 is 20, 20 MOD 20 is 0.

4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,334
Therefore, the additive
inverse of 8 is 12.
