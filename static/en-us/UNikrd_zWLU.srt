1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,500
So we're losing out all the negative values in the result.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,570
How do we ensure that we can preserve image difference?

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:12,520
Let's say a and b are two images of type uint8.

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,370
Check the following options, which you think will give the desired result.

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:21,360
For instance, should we compute the absolute values of the two images first and

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,730
then compute their difference?

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,060
What about this expression?

8
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,400
Or converting to a different type?

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,100
Would that help?
