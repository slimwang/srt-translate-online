1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,305
The average percentage of obese people in all states is 27%.

2
00:00:04,305 --> 00:00:07,590
With the help of some interactivity on this graphic,

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,620
I can hover over this black middle line and see that.

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,190
Here's the figure.

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:17,030
For the second question, we were looking for DC, or the District of Columbia.

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,500
This question was a bit easier to answer.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,570
We can determine these rankings by looking at the state that's on

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,040
the left side here.

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,280
So if I just hover over,

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,220
this would be the least educated state by population, West Virginia.

11
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,020
The most educated would be up here, the District of Columbia.

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,390
And finally, most states have higher percentages of obese people.

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,610
This one is harder to notice from the graph, but

14
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,910
it's recognizable from the color of the lines.

15
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,120
Looking at our plot,

16
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,630
we can tell that slightly more lines are red rather than blue.

17
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,310
So, slightly more states have larger pair of percentages of obese people,

18
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,920
compared to percentages of people with higher educations.
