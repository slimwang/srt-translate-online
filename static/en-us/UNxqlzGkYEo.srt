There're actually several relevant principles,

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,000
such as the Liskov Substitution Principle,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,520
the Interface Segregation Principle, the Stable Abstraction Principle.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,360
Riel's Inheritance, should be used only to model a generalization hierarchy.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,310
All of these express Gosling's belief that inheritance should not be

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,910
used share implementation, but

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,900
instead use implementation of interfaces to share abstractions.
