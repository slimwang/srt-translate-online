1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,080
The answer, it turns out, is in the DOM.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,510
Like I mentioned before,
in bindCounterToCat,

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,850
it gets the current number from the DOM.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:13,870
It finds the counter object, grabs
the text out, turns it into a number,

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:17,260
adds one, and
then updates the DOM with a new number.

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,880
So where is that data coming from again?

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,210
It's coming from the DOM element.

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,700
Now the number of clicks shouldn't be
stored in the view or octopus areas.

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,350
Remember that the model is for data.

10
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,540
And the number of clicks
belongs in the model.

11
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,070
But Andy is storing it in the view.

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,210
And that's a problem.

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,580
So, we've established that Andy is
storing his data in the DOM, and

14
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,900
that's one of the reasons that his
code has become kind of spaghettified.
