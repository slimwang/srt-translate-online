1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,930
Unclassified document contains
data that is not sensitive.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:09,090
So it could be read or written by
anyone in a system that implements BLP.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,264
You can read down, so

4
00:00:10,264 --> 00:00:14,130
anyone can read it all the way from
the top to the unclassified levels.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,050
It can be read.

6
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,020
Can it be written by anyone?

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:21,060
Well, so it can be read by anyone or
written by anyone.

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,610
The question is asking,
is this statement true?

9
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,410
Unclassified document contains
nothing that's sensitive, so

10
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,365
it can be read or written by anyone.

11
00:00:29,365 --> 00:00:30,510
It is true.

12
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,090
Okay, so
pick the right option in this quiz.
