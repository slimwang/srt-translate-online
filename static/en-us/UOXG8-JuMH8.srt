1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,390
Let's look at a way we might try to calculate this.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:08,240
We need to know the number of possible states that this computer could go through

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,240
in order to know whether or not we could get to a state we've already been to

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,070
in a reasonable amount of time.

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,070
How many states are there?

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,130
Each bit can be in 1 of 2 states, either 1 or 0.

7
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:25,640
There are 8 bits per byte, that's 2^8 states, per byte.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,400
We have a 1,024 bytes in our memory. We have a kilobyte of memory.

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:40,570
That gives us 2^8^1,024 power, which is 10^2466.

10
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:45,350
This is a huge number already. This is just the possible states in our memory.

11
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:48,180
How many can we go through in a year?

12
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,120
We take 10 billion steps per second.

13
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,870
So 10 billion steps per second is 10^9 steps per second.

14
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,890
Now how many seconds in a year?

15
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:04,500
This is just multiplying by 60 seconds in a minute, times 60 minutes in an hour,

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:12,870
times 24 hours in a day, times 365.25 days in a year.

17
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:21,680
This equals 10^17.5 states that we can calculate in a year.

18
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,690
That means that really what we want to do is take 10^2466 states

19
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:34,270
and divide by this 1 year/10^17.5 states.

20
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:40,940
This gives us 10^2448.5 years.

21
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,030
This is an insanely huge number.

22
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:46,700
This is for a computer that only has a kilobyte of total memory.

23
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,500
The sheer number of states that we can be in, even in such a small memory

24
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,680
and especially in a larger memory like you would see in a computer today,

25
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:01,930
is just so massive that calculating decidability in this fashion isn't actually feasible.

26
00:02:01,930 --> 99:59:59,999
This is why we still really care whether our problem is undecidable theoretically or not.
