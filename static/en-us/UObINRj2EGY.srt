00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's talk a little bit about the difference between GET and POST.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We've already seen one of the differences, and that's

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
GET parameters are included in the URL

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and POST parameters are included in the body.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Another difference is that GET requests

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
are often used for fetching documents

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and GET parameters are usually used to describe

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
which document we're looking for

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
or maybe what page we're on

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
or things of that nature--

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
basically, things that are describing what we're getting;

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
where POST parameters are often used for updating data--

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
for actually making changes to the Server

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
or to the data held on the Server.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Another difference is that GET parameters--

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
because they are in the URL--

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
have a maximum URL length,

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
or they're affected by the maximum URL length

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
because you can only encode so many parameters.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
For example, I think Internet Explorer

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
allows 2000 characters in the URL,

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
or something like that, which can be quite limiting.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
POSTs, by default, have no maximum length.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Now, the Server can be configured--and most are--

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
to have a maximum length, but it's usually substantially longer than 2000 characters.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's probably a few megabytes.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Another difference is that GET parameters

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
are generally okay to cache.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And when you make a GET request--a simple request for a URL--

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
there's a good chance that it's been cached.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
There are a lot of machines between

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
you and the Server--

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
or often there are--

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and it saves a lot of effort

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
if we know the document hasn't changed

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
to--you know--cache it along the way

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
so you don't have to request it new every time.

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
POST parameters are almost never cached.

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That's because you're probably updating data on the Server.

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And so the industry standard is: don't cache POST requests.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
One more difference is that GET requests--

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
because they're okay to cache

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and because you're usually describing

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
which document you want--

45
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
they shouldn't change the Server.

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You should be able to make the same GET request over and over,

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and the Server shouldn't change.

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
POST requests, on the other hand, are okay to change the Server.

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That's what they're generally used for,

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
is requests that update the Server.

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's why they're not cached; there's no max length,

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and that's the whole story.

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So in short, GET requests should be

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
simple requests for fetching a document.

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And GET parameters should be used to describe

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
what document or what page you're looking for.

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And POST parameters are used for making updates to the Server.

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And POST requests generally are destructive in nature.

59
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Now, if you don't follow these rules,

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
you can get into a little trouble.
