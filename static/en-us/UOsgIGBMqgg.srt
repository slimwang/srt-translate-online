00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,689
Earlier in lesson three,
we referred to PKI indirect.

2
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:10,139
This is another highly simplified
representation of direct designed

3
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:16,250
specifically to show the dual function
these keys play in security and trust.

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,390
Along the top, you see that
the message attachment, which contains

5
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:26,100
protected information, is encrypted
using the receiver's public key.

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,300
This is a critical point.

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,830
Anyone can discover their intended
recipient's public key and

8
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:36,910
can use it to secure information they
wish to send to the owner of that key.

9
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:42,480
Since only the owner should
have the matching private key,

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,840
only they can decrypt and
view the message.

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,500
That's the essence of PKI for security.
