1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,138
In order to launch the SettingsActivity, 
we modify Mainactivity.java

2
00:00:04,138 --> 00:00:06,670
in the On options item selected method.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,610
When the Settings Menu Item 
is selected, we create

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:13,170
a new, explicit intent
to the SettingsActivity Class.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,010
We call Start activity
to launch this intent.

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,650
We don't call StartActivity for results
because we're not expecting

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,020
a result from the SettingsActivity. 
Similarly, in the detail activity class,

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,380
when the settings menu is selected,
we launch a new intent

9
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,680
to SettingsActivity.
