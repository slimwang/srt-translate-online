1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,043
But that doesn't help us.

2
00:00:02,043 --> 00:00:03,125
>> Well why not?

3
00:00:03,125 --> 00:00:05,661
>> Well, the whole point of limiting
the depth of our search and

4
00:00:05,661 --> 00:00:08,650
using an evaluation function was to
avoid the exponential explosion in

5
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,779
the number of nodes we have to examine.

6
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:13,989
With quiescent search, we have to
search the game tree for two levels,

7
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,728
and maybe a whole lot more if
the results are changing between levels.

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,170
>> Well, we don't have to use
quiescent search all the time.

9
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,730
In fact, if we play isolation a lot,
and see that the evaluation function

10
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:30,109
is giving us consistent results,
then we might not bother at all.

11
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:34,615
However, we might find that in our
testing, that certain times in the game,

12
00:00:34,615 --> 00:00:37,399
quiescent search might
give us better results.

13
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:41,439
Oftentimes, that's at the beginning of
the game or at the end of the game.

14
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:44,289
Also, we have another trick we can
use called iterative deepening, and

15
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:45,159
that might help us too.
