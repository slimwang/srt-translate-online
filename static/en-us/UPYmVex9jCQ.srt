1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,570
There are a couple of different solutions for this,

2
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:05,000
but all of these solutions will have in common that you need at least

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,060
4 monitoring devices to monitor the whole network,

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,520
and I will show you one of these solutions.

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,030
So you could install one here, which would monitor these cables here.

6
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,070
You could install one here to monitor these cables,

7
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,700
and then you need one here, or you could have one here.

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,230
There are other possibilities, as I said, to monitor these 2 cables here.

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,420
And then finally, you can install one here to monitor these 2.

10
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,590
So this is one solution where you use 4 monitoring devices

11
00:00:29,590 --> 99:59:59,999
to monitor the whole network, and it's not possible with 3.
