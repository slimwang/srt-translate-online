1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,500
So that ends this lesson.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,490
Gives you a little bit of discussion of about how images are formed.

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:07,448
This is reality.

4
00:00:07,448 --> 00:00:12,740
But in general lenses

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:17,250
are designed to make it look like as if you had a perfect pinhole that

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,140
happened to give you really bright pictures that were very clear.

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:26,040
That's really good for us because the mathematics of a pinhole camera are very

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,250
well understood and are very clean.

9
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,780
They're a little bit, shall we say, complicated than simple algebra.

10
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,790
But they're, they're very easy to model.

11
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:39,020
So, when we do the mathematics of how images relate to the geometry of

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,978
the world, we'll use the pinhole model.

13
00:00:41,978 --> 00:00:45,890
But everything that I've showed you here is how we build lenses that give us

14
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,850
this illusion of having a very powerful pinhole imaging system.

15
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,450
See you next time.
