1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,500
The length of the rectangle is 12 units long and the width is 9 units. Great

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,500
work if you found these two numbers. The key to this problem is that the

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:13,853
diagonal is 15 inches long. The diagonal rectangle cuts from one corner to an

4
00:00:13,853 --> 00:00:18,348
opposite corner. So, we can draw in this line and consider this to be one of

5
00:00:18,348 --> 00:00:23,342
the diagonals. This line would be the other diagonal. But we only need 1

6
00:00:23,342 --> 00:00:28,639
triangle in order to figure out the side links of our rectangle. We know the

7
00:00:28,639 --> 00:00:33,854
diagonal is 15 inches long so we can label this with 15. We'll let the width of

8
00:00:33,854 --> 00:00:39,250
the rectangle be x. Since we know the length is 3 inches longer than the width.

9
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:44,550
This means that the length must be x plus 3. Here again is another. We're using

10
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,340
algebra to relate two things. We have one unknown which is the width, and

11
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,690
relating to the length. Since the length is three inches longer than the width.

12
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,358
Now we have a right triangle and we're ready to use the pythagoreum theorem to

13
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:04,215
solve for x. Whole squared e to the legs which is this side and this side and

14
00:01:04,215 --> 00:01:08,440
we know if we sum those squares together we'll get the squared hypotenuse or 15

15
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:15,404
squared. We'll combine these like terms together to get 2x squared plus 6x plus

16
00:01:15,404 --> 00:01:20,932
9 equals 225. Next we'll subtract 225 from those sides so I have this quadratic

17
00:01:20,932 --> 00:01:26,416
expression said equal to 0. These terms are all even, so we can divide our

18
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:34,406
equation through by 2. This gives us x squared plus 3 x minus 108 equals 0. We

19
00:01:34,406 --> 00:01:40,608
find factors of negative 108 that sum to positive 3. Those factors are negative

20
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:45,460
9 and positive 12. So, we can write these two factors and then set each one

21
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:51,712
equal to 0 to solve for x. So, X can equal positive nine, or X can equal

22
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:56,248
negative 12. A negative side length wouldn't make sense in this case, so we'll

23
00:01:56,248 --> 00:02:01,472
let X equal 9 here. So, if the width is 9, then we know that the length must be

24
00:02:01,472 --> 00:02:07,206
3 more than the width, or, this would be 12 units. Again, great algebra

25
00:02:07,206 --> 00:02:08,930
thinking if you got these two numbers.
