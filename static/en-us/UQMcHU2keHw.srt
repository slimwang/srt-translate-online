1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,590
Let's talk about it's going to call it weak calibration, and

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:09,370
what I mean by that is we're just assuming that we've got two projected cameras.

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,410
So that they're going to behave like projected cameras, but

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,610
in particular, we don't know anything about focal length or, or their offsets.

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:20,100
But we are going to assume, for example, that we don't have radial distortion.

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,130
We're going to assume that we don't have a non-uniform stretch of the image.

7
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,600
So, but what it's say weekly calibrated that's all we mean.

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,550
We correct for that.

9
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:33,610
So the main idea is that we're going to estimate the epipolar geometry

10
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:39,250
from a set of corresponding points between uncalibrated camera images.

11
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,370
And we'll probably use a large set, so

12
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,590
it's going to be somewhat redundant in order to make this thing more robust with

13
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,190
respect to noise.

14
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,235
All right, so let's get started.

15
00:00:47,235 --> 00:00:52,970
So before, from our all our projection stuff, you'll remember that

16
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:58,191
we had this projection that went from a world coordinate through our

17
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:03,501
extrinsics to our intrinsics to a projective representation of the image

18
00:01:03,501 --> 00:01:10,180
coordinate right and so to get the non-homogenous you had to divide through.

19
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,990
So it's written here like the it's a scale w times the image point is

20
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:20,160
equal to the world point times our extrinsics times our intrinsics.

21
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,820
So phi is just as we did before, we're going to use a three by

22
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,701
four version here since K will be a three by three, where the left hand side is

23
00:01:28,701 --> 00:01:33,967
that rotation matrix and the right hand side is the transformed translation and,

24
00:01:33,967 --> 00:01:38,883
and you'll notice this slightly weird form written here of it's r times t.

25
00:01:38,883 --> 00:01:41,677
And all that's saying is that if you know the translation in

26
00:01:41,677 --> 00:01:44,575
one frame you might have to translate, you might have to express in

27
00:01:44,575 --> 00:01:48,210
the other frame depending exactly on how you're, you're doing this.

28
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,970
Don't, don't worry about that detail, okay?

29
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,010
So that's phi, our extrinsic parameter matrix.

30
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:58,280
And K if you remember, that's our intrinsic calibration matrix.

31
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,210
And the K that I'm showing you here has a focal length and an x scale and

32
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,180
a y scale and of course as we said before they're multiplied together.

33
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,258
You really only need two numbers you've got f divided by sx and

34
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:13,640
f divided by sy, so they, they always appear in multiples like that.

35
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,680
But we have a scale in both directions.

36
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,460
We have the offsets.

37
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,280
But what we don't have is,

38
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,920
we don't have any skew, that is that this value here is 0.

39
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,470
That makes this math a little bit easier and

40
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:31,410
as I said before in general for modern cameras skew just isn't an issue.

41
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,160
All right.

42
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,210
So I'm going to write that this way.

43
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,720
The point in the image,

44
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,190
and this is a homogeneous point, is a point in the world times our,

45
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:46,580
multiplied by the extrinsic matrix, multiplied by the intrinsic matrix.

46
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:52,370
But this, of course, is just the world point put through the extrinsics,

47
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,340
that is the location of the point.

48
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,760
It's a 3D point, but it's in the camera frame.

49
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,480
Remember that the extrinsic matrix maps us from

50
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,360
some arbitrary world frame into the 3D frame of the, of the camera.

51
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,560
Okay, so that, we're going to call that pc.

52
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,840
And so we can write down this very simple relationship that K,

53
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,570
the intrinsics here, maps us from the point in the camera coordinate

54
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:23,000
system to the homogeneous point in the image, okay?

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,440
So p in the image is equal to K intrinsic times p in the world.

56
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,790
It's the point in the world, but expressed in the camera frame.
