1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,630
And of course, here it's time for another quiz.

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:08,200
So my first quiz to you--you can already see there are going to be two--is what is the size of this table?

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:17,710
Is is O(nÂ²), is it O(n<i>v) and you remember v is the sum of all values, or is it even precisely n</i>v?

4
00:00:17,710 --> 99:59:59,999
And of course, I want you to give me the best possible answer here.
