00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,700
Awesome work checking out
incremental build support in Gradle.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,900
Time-stamping build outputs means that
the task that generates those outputs

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,446
can never ever be up-to-date,

4
00:00:08,446 --> 00:00:11,580
since its output file is
changing every single time.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,520
Incremental builds give you a lot
of performance boost for free.

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,500
So sit back, relax and
watch your build log scroll by.
