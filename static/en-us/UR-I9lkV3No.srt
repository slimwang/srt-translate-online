00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, I want to add a new attribute to our form.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This attribute is called action, and this controls where a form submits to.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'll give you an example.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Right now we have our tag form, and it looks like this,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and it has a couple inputs in it, and we have our closing tag,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and this is basically the structure of our document right now.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm going to add a new attribute to form called action, and it looks like this:

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
action equals, and then a URL of where we want the form to submit to.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We can put any URL in here, and when we click submit on our form,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
it will send the data there.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Okay, so for your quiz, what I'd like you to do

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
is add an action attribute to your form element

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
whose value is http://www.google.com/search.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I want you to type some text in the box, click submit,

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and tell me what happens.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Is it nothing?

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Does the URL change with what you entered?

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Does your browser go to Google search results?

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Does it appear as though you've written an entire search engine?
