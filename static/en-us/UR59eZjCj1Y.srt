00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
If the orbit of the spacecraft is not closed even though it has to be in the model,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
we've got some problem with implementations, so that's a verification issue.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The maximum carrying capacity was a model parameter for the fish model,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
so in this case the calibration was done right.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And the other one is a prediction of the model doesn't work out well, so that's a validation issue.
