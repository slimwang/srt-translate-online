1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,250
Let's walk through the changes together.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:06,939
Right now I'm in the documentation for
the authentication/token/new method.

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:09,288
Let's look at an example response.

4
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:16,383
It shows that if the method
returns successfully,

5
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:19,660
we should have a request token,
as shown here.

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,300
Let's go back to the code.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,420
I'm going to go ahead and copy in some
boilerplate guard statements like

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,180
the ones we've been using
in the previous apps.

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,450
So I'll have this function
called displayError.

10
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:30,960
And it'll print out the error, and

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,680
then on the main, it'll set the UI
back to true, or re-enable it.

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,660
And it'll also set the debug text
label to hey, our login's failed.

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,880
And it's because of Request Token.

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,520
And then the first guard statement we'll
make is to make sure that the error

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,050
is nil.

16
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,500
Then we'll make sure that our response
status code begins with a two, or

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,390
that it's successful.

18
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,060
And then we'll make sure that some
data was actually returned and

19
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,310
the data isn't equal to nil.

20
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,970
For parsing the data, we'll use
the tried and true NSJSONSerialization.

21
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,660
And turn the data into
a dictionary that we can use.

22
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,920
And then the last step is
to get our request token.

23
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,450
So for this statement,
we'll look in the parsed results, and

24
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,760
make sure that we have a value that's
stored at the request token key.

25
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,265
If this statement succeeds,
then we have the request token, and

26
00:01:20,265 --> 00:01:21,714
we'll just print it.

27
00:01:26,055 --> 00:01:27,008
Now, let's build and run this.

28
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,306
And I'll just enter in
some dummy username and

29
00:01:35,306 --> 00:01:37,590
password because it shouldn't
matter at this point.

30
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,080
And I'll click Login.

31
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,870
Great, there's our request token.
