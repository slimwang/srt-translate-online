1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,980
So Google Analytics
provides a dashboard where

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,260
you can see information about
how people are using your app.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,660
So here in the overview page,
we see how many users.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,495
How many new users we've
had in the past month.

5
00:00:12,495 --> 00:00:14,830
400 not too bad.

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:19,840
Active users, 1,200, so that's
the new users and the previous users.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,840
We can see where in the world
people are using our app, and

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,140
we can see what devices
they're using to use the app.

9
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,498
So we can drill down a little bit
more into some of these details.

10
00:00:30,498 --> 00:00:33,202
So, for example, where in the world.

11
00:00:33,202 --> 00:00:37,171
We can, like, really drill down,
we can see how many people, oh,

12
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:40,180
we have 770 in New Zealand right now.

13
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:44,140
Oh, one in Madagascar, and then we
can get the actual data for it too.

14
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,130
So, we get the numbers.

15
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:50,450
And this app that we're using here
was developed by my friend, Ian,

16
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:56,020
Ian Lake, and you've probably seen him
in the Android fundamentals two course.

17
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,970
We can look into the language
that people are using.

18
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,080
In this case it's predominantly English,
but

19
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,190
we do have Portuguese,
we do have some French users.

20
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,550
So we can drill down more into
the devices that people are using.

21
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,450
So here we see all
the different devices.

22
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:16,180
And we can see the percentage of
the popularity of the devices.

23
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:20,550
So, the Galaxy S5 was the most
popular recognized device.

24
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:24,370
Some of the unrecognized
devices include the emulator,

25
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,030
as well as devices that
Analytics didn't recognize.

26
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,990
You can see the top network operators.

27
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,942
We can even see the screen
resolutions that people used.

28
00:01:33,942 --> 00:01:35,240
The branding.

29
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:40,200
One of the really cool things I can
show you is the real time data.

30
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,750
You can actually see how many people
are using your app right now.

31
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,780
And actually I have to be honest.

32
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,310
It's not really right now.

33
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,210
It's close to right now.

34
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,450
So it's close to real time.

35
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:57,790
You can see the top locations
where people are using the app.

36
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:02,180
So somebody down here in Melbourne
is actually using the app right now.

37
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,780
We have people in Peru using it.

38
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,270
We have people in
the Philippines using it.

39
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,660
We can see what they're
looking at right now.

40
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,420
And of course, you know, one of the main
things you do want to know about your

41
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,580
app is, what parts of
the app are the users using.

42
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,740
You get that through the screens.

43
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,510
So this is not the real time data,
this is overall in the last month.

44
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,750
We can see all the screens,
which screens the users went to, and

45
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,190
a screen is equivalent to an activity.

46
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,050
We see obviously, that the main
screen is where people went the most.

47
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,870
And then you can see, you know,
where else they went in the app.

48
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:40,950
You can also follow through the flow of
how people navigated through the app.

49
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:46,810
So, you can see where they started,
where they went to next, and so on.

50
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,350
So, I hope I've convinced you that
Analytics can give you all kinds of

51
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:54,030
awesome information about how and
where you're apps being used.

52
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,510
And now, I'm going to talk you through
how you can update your apps, so

53
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,320
that you can get all this
awesome kind of information

54
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,950
about how your app is being used.
