00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:03,920
I'm Kevin, I'm a friend and
programmer here at Udacity.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,070
The most exciting thing about
front end programming for

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:11,770
me is creating a pleasing and
intuitive user experiences.

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:16,540
The most difficult challenge that I face
as a front end programmer is meeting

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:21,440
the requirements of a project as
well as satisfying my own desire to

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,920
have elegant code.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,820
You're always trying to meet a deadline.

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,610
That's a constant struggle of
how perfect can I get this and

9
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,070
still deliver on time.

10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:35,960
The approach I try to take is to really
understand what your product manager or

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:42,860
consumer want and iron out the most
basic functionality first,

12
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,750
get it to a point where they can look at
it, critique it and give you feedback.

13
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,900
In the remaining time you have, that's
where you get to the interesting and

14
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,550
fun work of polishing the experience.

15
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,100
Front end is a pretty diverse field.

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,930
Even when I find myself
with a heavy workload,

17
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:04,099
I find it very easy to stay motivated
and stay engaged in the work that I do

18
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:08,290
because I believe that it does
have a really positive impact.

19
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:12,490
So to me that's kind of a sign that
this is the right path for me.
