1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,230
So when you're looking for a web API,
it's a lot like looking for

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,780
any other framework that you
might bring into your code.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,677
You want to see if it's well supported,
when was it last updated.

4
00:00:08,677 --> 00:00:12,131
If it's a GitHub project,
you can see when the last commit was.

5
00:00:12,131 --> 00:00:15,904
If there's people that are making pull
requests, if it's actively used by other

6
00:00:15,904 --> 00:00:19,347
developers, all these things would be
great signs that this API outside of

7
00:00:19,347 --> 00:00:21,496
what it's functionally
doing is a good call.

8
00:00:21,496 --> 00:00:25,258
And then you want to make sure of course
that it can do what you need it to do.

9
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:28,519
And testing around with it, playing
with it, you could play with a couple

10
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:32,009
different options and find one that
works, and that's how I choose web APIs.

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,140
That's the same way that
I choose frameworks.

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,250
>> So for finding and

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,440
vetting libraries, I tend to
first go to the Apple libraries.

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,860
They tend to be much
better documented and

15
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,100
more highly optimized for the hardware
that you're working on in iOS.

16
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,894
One of the libraries that
I first investigated for

17
00:00:53,894 --> 00:00:58,433
a video player app was
the MPMoviePlayerController,

18
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:04,665
which is a simple implementation of
a view controller for playing a video.

19
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:07,718
It's very quick and
easy to get up and running, but

20
00:01:07,718 --> 00:01:11,180
it doesn't really provide anything else.

21
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,346
I wanted more features that I could add.

22
00:01:14,346 --> 00:01:15,909
I wanted a new interface.

23
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:20,680
I wanted to be able to play
with the video even more.

24
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:26,199
So I looked even further, and
Apple provides the AVFoundation library,

25
00:01:26,199 --> 00:01:31,540
which allows audio, video,
audio-synthesizing, video effects,

26
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:37,810
all these different tools that
MPMoviePlayerControllers don't provide.

27
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,220
And they allow you to create

28
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:46,030
a much more rich user experience for
the people using your app.

29
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:51,370
I used this on an app at
a previous company, and

30
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:56,900
it allowed us to create this user
interface that was unique to our app,

31
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,600
that you can't find anywhere else.
