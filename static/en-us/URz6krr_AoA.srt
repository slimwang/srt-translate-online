00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Here's what statistician do. They choose a random sample.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The sample is the selection of hopefully random withdrawn people from this pool

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
that are representative of the pool at large.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
In this sample, they might derive an estimate on how people are likely to vote.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
They might just report that as estimate,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
but in practice, what they do is they report that the estimate plus a margin of error.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
In this margin of error, means what's really been given back is not singular number like 60%,

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
but an interval--we call this the confidence interval.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Look at these numbers for the blue party or party A and tell me

10
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
what do you think is the lower bound and upper bound in the conference interval in percent.
