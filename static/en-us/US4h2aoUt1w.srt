1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,750
So this command

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:08,310
has the host name en.wikipedia.org
in it in two different places.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,660
Now, the second one is telling
Netcat what address to connect to.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,570
We want to connect to the server
with the address en.wikipedia.org.

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:21,090
And the first one is printed
out into that connection.

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,940
Sent by a printf to Netcat.

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,720
Through the pipe.

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,440
As part of an http header.

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,110
It says what the host name is of
the web page that we want to fetch.

10
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,950
But suppose we wanted to
access a different page.

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,600
Like instead of
Wikipedia Lets access google.

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,140
To do that try changing the host header
and the nc destination from Wikipedia

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,420
to google or
from en.wikipedia.org to www.google.com.

14
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,730
And in the output look for

15
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,300
the server header which tells you
what kind of web server Google uses.
