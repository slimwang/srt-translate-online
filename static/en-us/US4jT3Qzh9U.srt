1
00:00:00,019 --> 00:00:03,649
So let's look at the trend of the step complexity of parallel reduction.

2
00:00:03,649 --> 00:00:10,058
First we're going to look at what happens when we add 1, 2 elements to create 1 output.

3
00:00:10,058 --> 00:00:14,420
So if we have 2 elements in our input sequence, it's going to take 1 step to finish.

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:21,432
If we have 4 elements in our input sequence, it's now going to take 1, 2 steps to finish.

5
00:00:22,124 --> 00:00:25,003
And if we have 8 elements in our input sequence--

6
00:00:25,003 --> 00:00:31,886
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8--we know that it's now going to take 1, 2, 3 steps to finish.

7
00:00:31,886 --> 00:00:34,311
So the quiz is, what is this relationship?

8
00:00:35,157 --> 00:00:37,438
Is the number of steps as a function of n,

9
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:42,395
âˆšn, log2(n), n, or n log2 (n)?
