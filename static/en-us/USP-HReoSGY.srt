Welcome to our course on dealing with challenging problems.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:09,100
First off, I should probably start by telling you what a challenging problem actually is.

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,330
Normally, the situation is as follows: When you want to solve a problem with a computer,

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:18,440
you write some program on your computer to tell it what you want to do with a certain input.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,620
Then you take your input, you feed it into the computer,

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,340
and the computer will work on your problem.

7
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,140
So it'll probably tell you to wait if you've written your program like this,

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,530
might make some noises, and after a certain time the computer will be done,

9
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,550
and it will produce your output.

10
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,570
Now, you would think that computers today are powerful enough

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,870
to basically do this for any problem for which you can write a program.

12
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,050
But you might already know that sometimes this is not the case.

13
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,530
So sometimes problems are so challenging to solve, even for a computer,

14
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,750
even for a very, very fast computer, that you will not get the output.

15
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,310
Instead, all that will happen is that the computer will tell you to wait.

16
00:00:55,310 --> 00:01:00,960
It might make noises again, and it will keep on telling you to wait.

17
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,860
Might make more noise because it's working so hard.

18
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,470
But no matter how long you wait, the computer is not able to produce an output

19
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:13,000
because the problem that you're giving it is just too hard, even for a computer.
