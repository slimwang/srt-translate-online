1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,230
So, show you results of some of their
experiments since they have the results

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,680
easily available on the Web.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,720
Now, when this paper was written,
which was a while ago,

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,310
they were running 30 frames per
second on a 320 by 240 image.

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,090
So now it can go faster because time
passes and machines get faster.

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,830
They are also only using
500 possible samples.

7
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,170
That's 500 possible new proposals.

8
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,050
Now maybe you can do 5,000.

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,650
They use 50 eigenvectors.

10
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,595
Maybe you could use more.

11
00:00:24,595 --> 00:00:26,822
It is the actual numbers
don't matter yet.

12
00:00:26,822 --> 00:00:29,180
The goal it was nice and
it was kind of in real time.

13
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,700
In fact, that's why I put down it runs
at XXX frames per second using Matlab.

14
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,491
Where XXS is, XXX is going to be more
than two and less than 90,000, so

15
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:38,909
it's in there somewhere.

16
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:41,540
It depends on how fast your computer is.

17
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,543
So here's some results
that they show you.

18
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,351
Now up here this is the main image, and

19
00:00:45,351 --> 00:00:47,808
you can see they're
tracking the face there.

20
00:00:47,808 --> 00:00:51,510
What you're going to see here
is going to be mostly about

21
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,150
where the image is being explained best.

22
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,420
We're going to talk about that
more when we talk about occlusion.

23
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,410
And what you're going to see
down here are about 10 of the,

24
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,580
of the eigenbases, right?

25
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:05,590
And you're going to see that they're
changing as the appearance changes.

26
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,590
So if I press, there we go.

27
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,470
All right.

28
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:09,310
And so

29
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:15,400
you can see that it's doing a pretty
fine job of explaining the the face.

30
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,050
Sorry, of tracking the face.

31
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,900
That middle row that I was talking
about, that has to do with

32
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,780
what am I seeing versus how well can I
reconstruct it from the basis set, and

33
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,010
it's using that as its evaluation.

34
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:29,160
And you can see,
with really large lighting variations,

35
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,060
it tracks really well.

36
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,575
You saw it got stuck there at
the very end, and that sort of, as,

37
00:01:33,575 --> 00:01:34,760
as far as it could go.

38
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,345
Yeah, here's another example where
you're going to see a lot of sort of

39
00:01:38,345 --> 00:01:41,141
change in orientation and
change of appearance,

40
00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:43,842
and this is Sylvester
the cat being tracked.

41
00:01:43,842 --> 00:01:47,902
And you can see that it creates a lot
of really sort of creepy lookingSyl-,

42
00:01:47,902 --> 00:01:49,394
Sylvesters on the bottom.

43
00:01:49,394 --> 00:01:51,634
Those are the eigen, the eigan cats.

44
00:01:51,634 --> 00:01:55,660
The images of, of the thing, and, and
that's how it's doing its tracking.
