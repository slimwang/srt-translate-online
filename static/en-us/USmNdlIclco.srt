00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
If you have a probability here you're trying to estimate--and here is the empirical mean--

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
with few data points--you might have a very right confidence interval--but as data increases,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
the boundary of the confidence interval will move inward.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let me contrast to this with a concept that we encountered previously,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
which is the standard deviation.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Suppose you increase the sample size N, how would you expect the standard deviation

7
00:00:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
of the sample to change--will it grow, shrink or stay about the same?
