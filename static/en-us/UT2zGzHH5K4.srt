1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,330
At this point, we've built
an application that got the latitude and

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:05,730
longitude of your device.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:06,939
Well done.

4
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:11,080
Did you notice a difference between
this app and the one we created earlier?

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,030
This app just updated the lat-long once,
and then it left it at those values,

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,470
whereas the previous one
updated the data periodically.

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,860
Now what did we do
differently this time?

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,540
Take a look at the code and see.

9
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,660
There's an important and distinct
difference between the two samples and

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,770
learning what that is will help
you build better location apps.

11
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,190
If you need a hint, take a look
in the unconnected override and

12
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,190
you'll see the difference
between the two apps.
