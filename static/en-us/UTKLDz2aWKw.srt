1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,160
Now that we have some basic familiarity with d3's basic functionality,

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,970
we can begin creating more interesting visualizations, and start applying some

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:12,150
of the things we learned earlier in the lesson with regards to visual encodings.

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,290
To start inserting some SVG elements into this page,

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,830
we might have to make some room.

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,000
As it stands,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,120
it looks pretty cluttered with all of the other elements on the page.

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,660
Since you probably want to watch the instructional video of me guiding you

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,160
through this, let us try not to remove the video frame element.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,580
There does, however, seem to be a sidebar with the discussion that

11
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,370
we might be able to temporarily make our canvas.

12
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,200
Let's now clear this side column inspecting the element we can scroll up

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,380
until we hover over the correct element that highlights the entire box.

14
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,340
In this case, it's a div, but

15
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:52,520
going even higher you can see there's another div with class call-access-three.

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,180
Selecting this element we can inspect what is returned and

17
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,810
indeed again it is the correct element.

18
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:05,080
If we want to wholesale remove this element we can call d3's.remove function,

19
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,920
but since we actually want to insert some SVG and SVG elements into it,

20
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,180
we only want to remove it's contents.

21
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,460
The dot HTML method defined on its selection either returns the inner HTML of

22
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:23,500
a selection, in this care here you can see a string of HTML, or if we patch

23
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:28,220
in an argument it replaces that string of HTML with that value you pass in.

24
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,010
In this case, since we want to empty out the selection,

25
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,150
you simply pass in the empty string.

26
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,130
And as you can see here, the discussion has disappeared and

27
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,370
the DOM elements have been removed from the selection.

28
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,010
Again, if you'd like to know more about the methods and

29
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,590
functions defined on selections or any d3 object,

30
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,050
I suggest looking at the API documents that are linked in the instructor notes.
