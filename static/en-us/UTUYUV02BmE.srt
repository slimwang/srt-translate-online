00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,360
That might have been tricky. The answer should look something like this. There

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,942
might be other ways to do it, but I think this is the simplest one. If you

3
00:00:05,942 --> 00:00:10,245
didn't get this, it's okay. There's more practice coming up. There are some

4
00:00:10,245 --> 00:00:13,740
subtletles to how this method works, so let's go through an example. Let's say

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,610
we have two variables, one for Maria and one for Jamesha. Each of those should

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:24,030
contain a person object with a name and friends. We have string objects. For

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:28,290
Maria's name, Maria's current friends, Jamesha's name and Jamesha's current

8
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:33,470
friends. Let's say we call maria.addFriend(jamesha). We call this method on the

9
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:38,110
maria object and we pass in as an argument the Jamesha object. Now, when this

10
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,320
line runs, the first thing that it does is creates a new string from these

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,890
ones. This will be the new string that's created. It's going to put together

12
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:52,150
friends, friend.name, and a space. Friends is the friends of the maria object

13
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:56,520
because that's what we called the method on. So, we go to the Maria object, and

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,146
friends is currently just TJ, with a space. friend.name is the friend, the

15
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:07,540
argument, which was the Jamesha object, dot name, which is Jamesha. And the

16
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,962
space is just a space. So, when these strings get put together, it'll look like

17
00:01:11,962 --> 00:01:18,599
TJ Jamesha. Now the string created by this part will be assigned into the

18
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:23,170
friends variable. So, the old reference will go away and a new one will be

19
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:28,180
created. And now, Jamesha appears in the friends of Maria. The old friends

20
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:32,780
string that contained just TJ might still be around. And it hasn't changed, but

21
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,342
the friends variable in the Maria object now contains a reference to a

22
00:01:36,342 --> 00:01:38,259
different string.
