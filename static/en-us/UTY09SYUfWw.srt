00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,895
It's good enough to provide a single method present question whose parameter is

2
00:00:03,895 --> 00:00:08,526
a question. A choice question is a special kind of a question, and so, you can

3
00:00:08,526 --> 00:00:13,201
pass a choice question into a method that expects a question. In general,

4
00:00:13,201 --> 00:00:17,674
anytime that you have a subclass, you can give it to any method that expects a

5
00:00:17,674 --> 00:00:23,133
super class object. Go ahead and try this out. Make a quiz that contains a

6
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:27,160
question and a choice question. Just reuse that question that we had before,

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:32,240
that asks who was the inventor of Java. Over here, both of the questions are

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,794
paths to the single presentQuestion method. And in that method, just to make

9
00:00:36,794 --> 00:00:39,890
sure that you got the point, fill in the right type for the parameter.
