Thanks Lauren. As we cans see, we are constantly being bombarded with stimuli

2
00:00:03,918 --> 00:00:08,250
throughout our day. Let's look at a typical mundane example of getting on a

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,196
train and going up to campus. All the different sights, sounds, smells and even

4
00:00:13,196 --> 00:00:18,726
tactile stimuli. Thousands and thousands of sensations. How do we know what to

5
00:00:18,726 --> 00:00:22,977
pay attention to? In Bentley's model, he says we have what's called a central

6
00:00:22,977 --> 00:00:27,784
executive. And a central executive helps us to focus on a particular stimulus,

7
00:00:27,784 --> 00:00:32,944
and different aspects of that stimulus. So the central executive allows us to

8
00:00:32,944 --> 00:00:37,850
pay attention. Now there are three storage systems that aid in this process.

9
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,920
And we're going to head back to Lauren to see what those are.
