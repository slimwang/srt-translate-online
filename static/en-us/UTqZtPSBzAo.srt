1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,520
So far, we've only proven that
one language is unrecognizable.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,860
One technique for
finding more is a mapping reduction,

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,950
where we turn an instance of one
problem into an instance of another.

4
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:16,320
Formally, we say that a language A is
mapping reducible to a language B,

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,700
if there's a computable function F.

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:27,150
Where for every string w, w is in A,
if and only if, f(w) is in B.

7
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:33,120
We write this relation between languages
using the less than or equal to sign.

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,310
With a little m on the side to indicate
that we're referring to mapping

9
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,550
reducibility.

10
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,200
It helps to keep in your
mind a picture like this.

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,260
Here we have the language A,
a subset of sigma star.

12
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,540
And here we have the language B,
also a subset of sigma star.

13
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,280
In order for the computable
function f to be a reduction,

14
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,770
it has to map each string
in A to some string in B.

15
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:02,463
And each string not in
A to some string not in B.

16
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:05,524
The mapping doesn't have
to be one-to-one or onto,

17
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:07,660
it just has to have this key property.
