1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,830
Mobile devices not only have different numbers of actual

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,610
pixels, but they fit very different numbers of pixels

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,560
into each inch of screen real estate. So, to

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,030
get roughly consistent formatting, they pass different numbers of layout

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,290
pixels into the view port. This chart shows the

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,700
number of physical pixels for each device, the device pixel

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,660
ratio. And then the resulting layout viewport. If we

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,420
look at the number of device independent pixels per inch,

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,290
this results in for each of these devices, we'll

10
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,320
note that almost all the mobile devices are very

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,220
close to 160 device independent pixels per inch. This

12
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,960
makes layout design much easier for us. The device pixel

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,040
ratio gives you a clue as to how high

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,080
resolution the screen really is. Not just how many

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,140
layout pixels there are. You can use device pixel

16
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,310
ratio in media queries to control properties like background images.

17
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:54,030
And in fact, this is going to become very interesting in

18
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,390
the next lesson, where we learn about how to use adaptive images.
