00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,589
It was great to hear Dr Griffiths and Dr Doblin discuss their exciting research

2
00:00:03,589 --> 00:00:08,648
with psychedelics. It really is fascinating. Now, in this section of the

3
00:00:08,648 --> 00:00:11,686
lesson, we discuss drugs of abuse and how they produce their psychoactive

4
00:00:11,686 --> 00:00:16,315
effects. And though we discuss the general classes of drugs, there are many

5
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:21,054
specific drugs that we didn't get a chance to cover here. So now its times for

6
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:23,694
you to head over to the instructor notes section and read the additional

7
00:00:23,694 --> 00:00:28,122
material that you'll need for this lesson. There we're going to discuss more

8
00:00:28,122 --> 00:00:32,214
drugs, and we're also going to look at the evaluation process for drugs getting

9
00:00:32,214 --> 00:00:36,736
approved by the FDA. And, finally, we'll finish up with some treatments for

10
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:39,880
drug dependents, so head on over to the instructor notes section.
