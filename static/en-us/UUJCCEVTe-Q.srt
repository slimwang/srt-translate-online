00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,430
In the old days, it was commonplace
to save text as a graphic.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,790
As you can see here,
that doesn't scale well visually and

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,020
adds to the page weight and latency.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,980
Text as graphic can also cause
conflicts with format choice.

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,180
Now in theory you might
want to save text in a PNG

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,620
format because text has solid color and
hard edges.

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,020
But in this example
we've saved as a JPEG

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,980
because we're using text over a photo.

9
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:30,295
Scale that up, and
you start to see artifacts.

10
00:00:31,655 --> 00:00:36,555
Using text as a graphic also means the
text can't be found by search engines,

11
00:00:36,555 --> 00:00:40,135
and isn't accessible by screen readers
and other assistive technologies.

12
00:00:40,135 --> 00:00:45,151
You can see what the current page looks
like in the text only browser Lynx, that

13
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:50,000
gives a good idea of what screen readers
and search engine web crawlers see.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,390
All you can see here is
the alt text on the image,

15
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,050
which says koala and nothing else.

16
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,320
And you can't copy
text as graphic either.

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,340
If you do need to incorporate
text in graphics,

18
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,500
overlay real text over the top.

19
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,560
Simple.

20
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,710
Both the photo and the text display and
scale much better, and

21
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,760
you can select the text.

22
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,560
And it's really easy to
add effects with CSS.

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,700
I'm using the Lovely Lobster font,

24
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,140
which is one of the many
free web fonts available.

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,020
File size is smaller too because we can
save the photo as a nice small JPEG for

26
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,240
the photo, rather than having
to use PNG to cope with text.

27
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,210
On the subject of text and
images, one way to ensure your

28
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:39,350
site is really responsive is
not to have any images at all.

29
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:42,670
Maybe some of the pages on your
website don't need images.

30
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,750
These sites use beautiful
topography CSS effects and

31
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,980
great layout to achieve really
striking graphical effects,

32
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,310
with responsive layouts and
stonkingly fast load times.

33
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,500
Likewise, these sites,
which use images really sparingly.

34
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,380
When you're designing a responsive site,
every time you add a placeholder for

35
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,130
an image,
think about whether you really need it.

36
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,130
Sometimes the best image
is no image at all.

37
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:16,340
In the past, typography on the web was
extremely limited by the number and

38
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,660
quality of fonts available.

39
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,898
With web fonts and modern CSS
implementations, that's all changed.

40
00:02:22,898 --> 00:02:27,830
Web fonts and CSS enable
beautiful typography on the web

41
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,560
without having to resort
to using text as graphics.
