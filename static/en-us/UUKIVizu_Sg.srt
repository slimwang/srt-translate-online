1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,200
If you typed out the code that we gave
you, then when you run it on your phone,

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,160
when you hit the ORDER button, then
the quantity is 2 and the price is $10.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,890
Now let's try to change
the initial value of the variable.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,070
Instead of 2,
let's make it 5 cups of coffee.

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,000
It's just one of those days.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,319
So when we say display(numberOfCoffees),
it's going to display 5 as the quantity.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,450
If we say displayPrice,
then numberOfCoffees is 5, and

8
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,470
5 times 5 should be $25.

9
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:32,800
So, let's run it on our phone to see if
that's what happens, and yes it does.

10
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,210
Now, let's try to change
the variable name.

11
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,850
I'm going to delete this variable name,
numberOfCoffees, and

12
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,260
I'm going to change it to quantity.

13
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,200
It's a lot shorter name so
I like it better.

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,880
Immediately the variable
name is grayed out,

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,750
and we get a warning that says,
variable quantity is never used.

16
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,900
That's because we never actually
refer to the variable quantity.

17
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,950
We just create it but never use it.

18
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,670
But not for long.

19
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,329
We're going to use it.

20
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:02,605
We need to change these two lines of
code to use the variable quantity.

21
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:05,935
Right now there's an error because
it cannot resolve the symbol

22
00:01:05,935 --> 00:01:09,330
numberOfCoffees, because
that's not a variable anymore.

23
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,700
So let's copy over quantity and replace

24
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,110
those references to numberOfCoffees
with the new variable name.

25
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,290
Cool, now there's no more errors.

26
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:19,970
Let's run the app.

27
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,445
When you hit the ORDER button,
the quantity is 5, and price is $25.

28
00:01:25,445 --> 00:01:27,930
This is the same behavior as
the last time we ran the app.

29
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,400
When you change the variable name,

30
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,850
there's no visible
difference to the end user.

31
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,240
The variable name is just for

32
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,850
us developers to use when
we're writing our app.

33
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,900
Since quantity is a shorter name and

34
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,140
it's still accurate in terms of the
information that it holds, quantity of

35
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,760
coffee cups ordered, let's continue
using this variable name going forward.
