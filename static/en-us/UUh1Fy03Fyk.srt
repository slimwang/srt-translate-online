00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now let's multiply every single piece of data by 1.5 and get some new data.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We'll call them Ys.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Can you tell me what is the mean--mu--of the Ys,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
what is their standard deviation--sigma--

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
what is their variance--sigma squared--

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and what is the value of this point--now Yi--

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and what is the standard score--z--of Yi.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Fill in your answers.
