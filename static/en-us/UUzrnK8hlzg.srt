00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,590
For the final project in this course,
you're going to build databased backed

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,740
software to run a particular kind
of game or sporting tournament.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,220
In a Swiss style game tournament,
players aren't eliminated when they

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,390
lose a match, every player,
gets to play in every round.

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,590
And in each round,
each player plays against someone with

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,660
about the same number of wins and losses
that they have, which means that each

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,720
player is likely to be matched against
an opponent with about equal strength.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,890
Ties are broken by looking at how well
the tied players' opponents have done.

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,280
After all beating two
strong opponents counts for

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,940
more than beating two weak opponents.

11
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,880
This system was invented in Zurich,
Switzerland in 1895 for chess.

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,170
But it is now used for a wide variety
of games and sports around the world.

13
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,650
And keeping track of such a complicated
tournament is a good job for a database.

14
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:51,380
In this lesson,

15
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,760
you'll be writing a python module
that uses the PSQL database,

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,830
to pair up players in each round of
a tournament and record their results.
