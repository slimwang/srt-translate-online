00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,960
Is this a data rich or
data poor problem?

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,430
Let's recall the difference
between data rich and data poor.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:11,020
If we have past data on the variable
we're trying to predict,

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,960
then we're data rich.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,610
Otherwise, we're data poor.

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,570
To determine whether we're data rich or

7
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,420
poor we need to look at our data
to get a better understanding.

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:23,350
Looking at our data set,

9
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,640
we see that we have the following
information on each client.

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,070
The average number of tickets
each client submits per week,

11
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,970
the number of employees per client, the
value of the contract with each client,

12
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,150
and the industry of each client.

13
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,470
Since we have the number of tickets for
each client, or data rich.

14
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,320
Moving down the flow chart,
next we need to determine if we should

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,830
use a numeric model, or
classification model.

16
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:54,161
Our target outcome that we're trying
to predict is the number indicating

17
00:00:54,161 --> 00:00:57,088
the average number of tickets
we can expect per client.

18
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,396
Therefore we should use a numeric model.

19
00:00:59,396 --> 00:01:01,251
[BLANK_AUDIO]

20
00:01:01,251 --> 00:01:04,690
Now we're getting closer to
determining which model to use.

21
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,280
But first we need to
determine if a continuous or

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,550
time based model is appropriate for
our problem.

23
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,270
We're looking for an average per week.

24
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,170
So at first glance we might think
this is a time based problem.

25
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,850
If we were looking to forecast
a specific number per calendar week for

26
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,480
a period of weeks, we'd be correct.

27
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,630
However, in this problem,
we just want an average per week and

28
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,480
are not interested in
the specific calendar week.

29
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,640
Therefore, we'll use a continuous
model to solve our problem.

30
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:39,760
For our first model,
let's focus on linear regression.

31
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,850
We'll cover the others later.
