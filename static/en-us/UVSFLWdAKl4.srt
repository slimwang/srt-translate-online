1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,520
So let's move a bit to progress a little
more programming at the question so

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,943
I do want to start you
off with a SQL question.

3
00:00:07,943 --> 00:00:08,480
>> Okay.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,070
>> Let's say we have this table and
maybe I should writer and

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,640
if you want to write it,
but here feel free to.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,170
>> Okay.
>> Let's say you have a table and

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:23,260
list it was called cards right and this
table is going to have several rows.

8
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,300
The first one is going to be an i.d.

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,170
Which is just an integer.

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,509
The second one is going to be
a make of the other vehicle.

11
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,490
Where you can be a character.

12
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,010
Ok.
Or

13
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,020
a set of characters right so
the next one to be the model.

14
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:42,578
Of the vehicle.

15
00:00:42,578 --> 00:00:44,698
Character as well.

16
00:00:44,698 --> 00:00:48,050
>> Do you mean like a stream?

17
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,623
>> I think okay yeah string.

18
00:00:49,623 --> 00:00:50,338
Yeah.

19
00:00:50,338 --> 00:00:51,297
>> Okay so.

20
00:00:51,297 --> 00:00:54,320
Okay I'll remember [LAUGH]
>> And

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,130
the next phase will be how many
cylinders this is ripple have?

22
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,180
Preferably is an Integer.

23
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:06,020
And lastly the horse power.

24
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,968
Of the car is also an integer.

25
00:01:13,848 --> 00:01:18,747
So, okay, so what I would like you to
do is, to write a simple query that

26
00:01:18,747 --> 00:01:23,650
will give me the three vehicles with
the highest number of horsepower,

27
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,610
that have more than
six cylinders in them.

28
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,180
Okay, let me, say that again so
that I can write it down.

29
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,600
The three.

30
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,010
>> The three vehicles.

31
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:35,840
>> Vehicles.

32
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,370
>> That have the highest horsepower.

33
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,810
>> Highest horsepower.

34
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,520
Okay.

35
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,191
>> But at least six cylinders.

36
00:01:49,257 --> 00:01:58,084
>> Okay Okay.

37
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:03,540
So I'm assuming that in
my table I could have

38
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:10,460
I guess what I'm wondering is,
are we talking about vehicles,

39
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,100
as in, with separate id?

40
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,830
Or are we thinking about types
of vehicle, like make and model.

41
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:21,120
Could there be more than one
car with the same make and

42
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,300
model, and presumably, the same
number of cylinders and horsepower?

43
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,858
>> No, no, so this would be different.

44
00:02:26,858 --> 00:02:28,710
Yeah
>> Okay, Okay.

45
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,935
>> This is just information
about to make a model.

46
00:02:30,935 --> 00:02:39,471
>> .Okay Okay so like this would be
specified by like make model here.

47
00:02:39,471 --> 00:02:41,268
>> Yes exactly.

48
00:02:41,268 --> 00:02:42,783
>> Okay cool.

49
00:02:42,783 --> 00:02:45,550
Right okay so.

50
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:52,777
This I need to write out the query but
I'm trying to think of the best order so

51
00:02:52,777 --> 00:02:57,939
let me think through what I
need to do so this three will

52
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:04,177
be a limit three that will probably
be the last thing in my query.

53
00:03:04,177 --> 00:03:07,176
>> Okay.
>> I'll be selecting make and

54
00:03:07,176 --> 00:03:12,592
model from cars where there
are like number of cylinders is

55
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:18,570
greater than or equal to six and
order by i horsepower.

56
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:22,620
And I guess I'll need to figure out,
it'll have to be DESC - descending.

57
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,510
Okay.
>> So.

58
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,892
>> Yeah.
>> Now I need to put that all together.

59
00:03:26,892 --> 00:03:28,470
[LAUGH]
>> [LAUGH] Yeah, that sounds perfect.

60
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:33,709
>> Okay, so select.

61
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:52,827
Make model

62
00:03:52,827 --> 00:03:55,968
from

63
00:03:55,968 --> 00:04:03,039
cars where

64
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:14,455
Number of cylinders is greater than or

65
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:21,699
equal to six and
then I'm going to order.

66
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:28,551
By horsepower

67
00:04:34,432 --> 00:04:37,585
Descending.

68
00:04:37,585 --> 00:04:44,310
And then limit three, semi-colon.

69
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,188
I've run into that problem before.

70
00:04:46,188 --> 00:04:51,220
[LAUGH] So
I think that probably does it.

71
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,070
>> So return a table,
make model from course.

72
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:59,070
All right there's six cylinders,
order by the horsepower we want,

73
00:04:59,070 --> 00:04:59,990
the high is three, limit three.

74
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,160
Yeah.
So that's excellent.

75
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,970
>> Okay.
Great.
