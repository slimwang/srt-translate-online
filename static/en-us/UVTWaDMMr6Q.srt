00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,050
So we have a working application now,
but

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,720
we should probably add some style to it,
if we want it to be appealing to users.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,100
Flask can automatically look for

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,890
CSS, JavaScript, and media files,
if we put them in a folder named static.

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,780
So I will create a folder called static,

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,610
in the same directory as
my project.py file, as so.

7
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,910
I will create a CSS file, and

8
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,360
name it styles.css, and
store it inside of this directory.

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,660
By adding this following
link to my template files,

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,390
I will tell Flask to use this styles.css
file when it renders this template.

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:30,860
When I refresh my browser,

12
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,500
I turn my old unstyled menu page
into one that looks like this.

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,950
Take some time to add some
styles to your menu app.

14
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,270
My CSS file and templates can be found
in the instructor notes for reference.
