Now let's help our users find our app
and get some organic traffic for free.

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:09,130
We can do this by search engine
optimization, or SEO for short.

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,020
We can also do the same
thing in the App Store,

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,550
which is called App Store optimization,
ASO.

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:15,830
>> How does it work?

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:20,350
The search engine uses an algorithm that
scans all of the information on the web

7
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,530
and for app stores, the algorithm
scans all of the information in

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,510
all listings of the App Store.

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,350
The algorithm will decide
what is the most relevant

10
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,860
based on the content of your site and
the most relevant sites and apps

11
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,280
will appear at the top of the results
but under the paid ads of course.

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,790
Let's talk about some of the techniques
you can use for SEO and ASO.
