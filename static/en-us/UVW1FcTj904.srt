00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,390
How is one program, let's say an

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:06,740
email, protected from the misbehavior of another program,

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,760
say the web browser. This is where memory

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,230
related operating system abstractions come into play. In

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,440
particular, the operating system provides address space as

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,640
an abstraction for each process that is distinct

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,870
from one another. So the data and the

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,920
code that corresponds to a particular program is

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,320
contained in a container which is

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,150
called the address space. That's the abstraction

11
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,730
provided by the operating system. And

12
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:37,120
this address space abstraction of the operating

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,040
system is implemented by whatever hardware

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,530
capabilities that the underlying processor architecture provides

15
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,300
you. Processor and memory are the most

16
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,940
precious resources. And, what we've done is

17
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,660
a quick review to understand the abstractions

18
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,550
in the operating system for managing these resources.
