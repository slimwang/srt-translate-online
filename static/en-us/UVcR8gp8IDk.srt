1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,730
So, let's actually do the calculation for each

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,600
season. This time you'll have to copy and

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,119
paste the data into your own spreadsheet like

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,990
we showed you before. Highlight the data by

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:19,150
clicking and dragging from cell A1 all the way down to cell C27 since that will

6
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:25,099
ensure that all of the data is copied. Then type Cmd C or Ctrl+C to copy it.

7
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:30,223
Then go to your spreadsheet that you created in your statistics folder,

8
00:00:30,223 --> 00:00:35,348
and type Ctrl or Cmd+V. Then in any of the blank cells, type your

9
00:00:35,348 --> 00:00:40,530
command. Equal sum, and for Season 1, that would be

10
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,680
A2 to A24. For Season 2, you would type, equal sum

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,310
( B2 all the way to the end cell, then you'd do the same

12
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:55,630
process for the total sum for Season 3. Type in your answers here.
