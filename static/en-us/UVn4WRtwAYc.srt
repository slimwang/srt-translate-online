00:00:00,243 --> 00:00:04,409
Let's start fleshing out or
building out our robots.

2
00:00:04,409 --> 00:00:07,928
When we're done we'll just have
an enemy sitting on top of a platform.

3
00:00:07,928 --> 00:00:12,213
Note that it's not moving or
colliding with anything yet.

4
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:15,090
Our enemy class needs a render
method to draw itself.

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,785
And we'll need to hold on to
a platform and a position.

6
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:22,628
We'll also need to add a collection to
our level to hold on to the enemies.

7
00:00:22,628 --> 00:00:25,250
Finally, let's add some
enemies into our debug level.
