00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,966
We've been together for a while now, and
I just want to take a step back and say,

2
00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:08,298
thanks for bearing with us,
this is a ton of information.

3
00:00:08,298 --> 00:00:11,608
You've learned how to create
some really cool features using

4
00:00:11,608 --> 00:00:15,361
the Google Maps APIs, using a drawing
layer, making unique styles,

5
00:00:15,361 --> 00:00:17,844
showing users distances and
directions, and

6
00:00:17,844 --> 00:00:21,710
getting back detailed places
of interest information.

7
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,350
>> You may be wondering what this is.

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,391
Well, it's Google's gift to you,
and we'll show you.

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,541
[BLANK_AUDIO]

10
00:00:29,542 --> 00:00:32,963
[SOUND] It's the keys to the castle.

11
00:00:32,963 --> 00:00:35,902
You see,
now that you know how to use them,

12
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:39,134
the Google Maps APIs
are yours to use for free.

13
00:00:39,134 --> 00:00:43,768
[SOUND]
>> In the next few lessons, will go over

14
00:00:43,768 --> 00:00:48,219
some important practical details you
need to know while flexing your creative

15
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:52,619
muscles, and using location services,
and visualizations in your sites.

16
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,500
>> So far, you've been using the API
keys you generated in the very beginning

17
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,270
of the course to access most of
the functionality we've covered.

18
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,280
You've also already enabled
the APIs that you've used so far.

19
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,680
>> We're going to go over the other
important things that you can and should

20
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,810
be doing within the Google Developers
Console, now that you're a pro.

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,859
>> The first thing you should be
aware of is the ability to monitor

22
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:18,060
the usage of your API key.

23
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,969
You should know that there is
an allotted number of what we call

24
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:24,849
map loads,
that you can use as a free user.

25
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:29,359
Every time you load a Google map, using
the initialized function that we've seen

26
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,159
to create a map object,
you use one map look.

27
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:36,789
You have more than enough quota to
experiment freely and develop apps.

28
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:41,170
See the documentation linked in the
instructor notes for up-to-date amounts.

29
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:45,385
You can see how many you use over
time within the developer's console.

30
00:01:45,385 --> 00:01:47,403
And we'll practice that soon.

31
00:01:47,403 --> 00:01:51,064
>> Next, in order to increase
the security of your API key,

32
00:01:51,064 --> 00:01:54,361
you can whitelist domains
which are able to use it.

33
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:57,011
For example, after making my site,

34
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:00,607
I could whitelist
EmilysNYCHouseHunter.com.

35
00:02:00,608 --> 00:02:04,320
And then, that will be the only site
that can make requests using that key.

36
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:08,680
When making a request using that
API key, they'll go through.

37
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,590
If any other domain,
like AjaysNYCHousHunter.com,

38
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,240
attempts to do so,
they would get an error.

39
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,090
That way, nobody accidentally
starts to use my key,

40
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,189
using up all my map loads or
not so accidentally.

41
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:24,990
It's always important
to protect yourself.

42
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,480
Quota theft is not a common occurrence,
but we care about security here.

43
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,340
>> Now, as I said, there is a fair
amount of quota given for free.

44
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,490
Most websites and
applications will stay within this.

45
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,360
However, if you consistently
generate a high amount of traffic,

46
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,450
you just limit supply.

47
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:43,799
And you'll need to pay for extra usage.

48
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,686
You can do this by enabling billing
within the developers console.

49
00:02:47,686 --> 00:02:51,990
You can also choose to put
an enforced cap on your usage

50
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,129
to make sure you don't
go over a certain limit.

51
00:02:55,129 --> 00:02:59,159
See the documentation in the instructor
notes for how to do this.

52
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:02,109
>> The next thing to be aware of,
has to do with using the services.

53
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,530
Both client and server side.

54
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,870
In general, there are two types of
caps that we have on service usage.

55
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,110
Queries per day,

56
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:15,240
also known as QPD, which is the total
number of requests made in one day.

57
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,750
And queries per second,

58
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,900
or QPS, which as it sounds is the number
of requests made in one second.

59
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,189
The developer documentation has
specifics on the limitations for

60
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:26,859
each web service.

61
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,770
Remember how we talked about web
service response codes before?

62
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,950
>> Right, we wanted that okay response.

63
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:37,239
If you ever see the over
query limit response code,

64
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,680
it means you've hit one of these QPD or
QPS limits.

65
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,349
Now, try logging into the Google
developer's console and

66
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:47,409
viewing your projects usage so far.
