00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,760
Okay, here are the answers that I came up

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,060
with, let's go over this together. As in our example

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,830
we have one bit for the offset, and then

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,700
the next two are the index. So this here, I'm

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,950
going to look at these two bits, see index 00, and then go over and look at the

6
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:25,510
cache. I see there that the tag is 0 1, and oh that does not match my 1 0 tag of

7
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,580
the part of this address here, so that's a

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,000
miss. For the next one again I begin by consulting

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,380
the index, that's 11, so I go over here, and

10
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,810
I find that the tags part of my address and

11
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,170
of the cache match. So that looks like a

12
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,380
hit. Which of these two's values is it? Well, for

13
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,570
that I'd look at the offset, and I'd see that

14
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,530
it's the second one. So I write the value 99.

15
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:57,110
For the third one, again, the index is here, 1 0. I go and look at that in

16
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,750
my table. I see I have a tag,1 0,

17
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,330
and oh, that matches the tag part of this address.

18
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,130
So it's another hit. Which of these two values

19
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,750
is it? Well I go look at the offset, that's

20
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,748
zero, so it's this first one, 5 7. And

21
00:01:11,748 --> 00:01:16,370
lastly, again we'll start by looking at the index That's

22
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,640
one one, and up, the tags do not match, so that's a miss.
