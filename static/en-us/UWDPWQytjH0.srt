00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,960
we're ready to build rich UIs
for each of our activities.

That means learning about fragments
and how we can use them

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:13,070
to create complex user interfaces 
that can easily be adapted

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,630
to work seamlessly on a range 
of different devices and screens.
