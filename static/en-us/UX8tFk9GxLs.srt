1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,750
Elevator floor buttons and coffee mug handles are both affordances and

2
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:12,440
signifiers, because they both signal that an

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:18,210
interaction can happen, and their physical characteristics allow

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:24,360
the interaction to take place. Also, traffic lights are indeed signifiers.

5
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,966
The lights themselves don't permit an interaction between an object and an

6
00:00:29,966 --> 00:00:33,787
agent. But, by cultural convention, they

7
00:00:33,787 --> 00:00:37,639
do signify that certain actions should and

8
00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:42,280
can take place. The incorrect statement here is statement C.

9
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:51,230
The word pull on a door does not permit action between an object and an actor,

10
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:57,450
and so it's not an affordance. The sign does, however, signify

11
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:02,320
that the door should be operated. We'll talk more about signifiers next.
