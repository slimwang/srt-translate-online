00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,152
>> Early on, we saw that if we have a compound inequality that's written in a

2
00:00:04,152 --> 00:00:08,706
chained form like this, it's really the same as having two inequalities joined

3
00:00:08,706 --> 00:00:13,393
together with an and. We know that with this inequality, x needs to lie between

4
00:00:13,393 --> 00:00:18,053
negative 2 and 6, where 2 is included in the interval. So it's true that both x

5
00:00:18,053 --> 00:00:22,847
is greater than or equal to negative 2, then we have x is less than 6. Let's

6
00:00:22,847 --> 00:00:27,300
graph each of these individually on a number line, and then, the compound

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,740
inequality on a third one. First we have that x is greater than or equal to

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,485
negative 2, or in other words, that negative 2 is less than or equal to x. Then

9
00:00:36,485 --> 00:00:40,903
we have, x is less than 6. And then if we graph these two together, what we're

10
00:00:40,903 --> 00:00:45,323
really doing is finding the shaded part of the number line between the two that

11
00:00:45,323 --> 00:00:49,743
overlaps. So, if for example, I lay this number line on top of this number line,

12
00:00:49,743 --> 00:00:53,964
and I then shade in the part that's overlapping, I get exactly what we have in

13
00:00:53,964 --> 00:00:57,952
the compound inequality down here, because of the and. We have a double

14
00:00:57,952 --> 00:01:02,374
restriction happening, and that further reins in the values that x can equal to

15
00:01:02,374 --> 00:01:06,595
this smaller range than we would have if we had either one of these true on its

16
00:01:06,595 --> 00:01:06,984
own.
