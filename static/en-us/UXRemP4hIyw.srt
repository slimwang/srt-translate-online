00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,880
So one thing, if you remember back to what we did when we

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:07,040
needed to update our map that we forgot to do with the buttons,

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,470
was make sure that we properly update any elements that are no longer active.

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:17,220
I say active, in this sense, to mean any buttons that don't correspond to

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,580
the current year, and any countries that don't correspond to

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,140
the current year of the World Cup that we're looking at, and

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,480
any circles that don't correspond to the current year we're looking at.

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,390
For our map, we did this update through the exit selection.

9
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:36,200
We filtered our data for the year of interest, we removed elements from our

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,590
exit selection and we added elements from our enter selection.

11
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,660
For the buttons, for the sake of simplicity, we can make all the buttons change

12
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,851
to their initial state and then selectively change the one button we need.
