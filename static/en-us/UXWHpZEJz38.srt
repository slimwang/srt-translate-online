00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,140
At the conclusion of this lesson, we'll have a short video after the wrap up

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,950
called the cognitive connection. Knowledge based AI is richly connected to

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,660
cognitive signs. And so many of the topics that we'll cover in

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,520
this class are connected to human reasoning and human learning, and

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,910
human memory. The cognitive connections are not separate from the course. One of

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,050
the goals of this course is to learn how to use the design of AI agents to

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,460
reflect on human cognition. The cognitive connections will serve this purpose.
