Here's my answer. The 4k page size implies a 12 bit page offset. The

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,215
64 byte cache block implies a 12 bit cache block offset. Therefore, we have

3
00:00:11,215 --> 00:00:17,780
6 bits left for the index, leaving us 64 in this use for the cache. Actually,

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,420
the size of the virtual and physical address spaces don't matter at all.
