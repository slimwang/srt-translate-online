1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,298
So rmdir -f junk doesn't work,

2
00:00:03,298 --> 00:00:07,644
since rmdir doesn't
understand -f as an option.

3
00:00:07,644 --> 00:00:12,330
curl -o junk empty, well, this curl
command won't actually do anything.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,210
Curl is for downloading from a web
URL and empty isn't one of those.

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,070
rm -r junk is the right answer.

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,490
The r stands for recursive.

7
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,650
And this is the standard way to
erase an entire directory and

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,460
all of its contents.

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,020
Any files or
directories that may be inside it and

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,280
anything inside those directories,
and so on.

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,120
And mv junk trash will do
one of two different things.

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,470
If there is a directory called trash,
it'll move junk to inside of it.

13
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:44,870
And if there isn't a directory called
trash, it'll rename junk to trash.

14
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,290
So, again the correct answer for

15
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,360
removing the entire junk
directory is rm -r junk.

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,250
And the junk that was there is now gone.
