1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,790
First, the challenge values used
in an authentication protocol

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,820
can be repeatedly used
in multiple sessions.

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,120
This is false.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,630
If the challenge values are repeated
then there's a chance that

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,970
the attacker can capture and replay
the same challenge and response and

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,470
impersonate Alice or Bob.

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,090
Second, the authentication
messages can be captured and

8
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,360
replayed by an adversary.

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,410
This is true.

10
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,820
We should always assume that the
messages that are sent over the Internet

11
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,920
can be captured by the adversary.

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:38,210
An adversary can attempt to replay them
in order to impersonate Alice or Bob.

13
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,880
Third, authentication can be one way,
for

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,610
example only authenticating
Alice to Bob.

15
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,000
This is true, as we have discussed

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,150
the first three steps of the protocol
authenticate Alice to Bob.
