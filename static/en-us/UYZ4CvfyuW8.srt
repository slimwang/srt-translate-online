1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,469
So let's talk about divided attention.

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:03,730
>> You know, I'm going to tell you a little story

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,830
about dorm room Debbie from lesson two. And we're going to

4
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,630
talk about how we create a great experience to not

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,600
violate the constraint of our users having a divided attention. So

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,840
imagine we have dorm room Debbie, she's late for class.

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,130
With a latte in one hand, her smart phone in

8
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,530
the other hand, and carrying a lot of books. On

9
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,330
her way to class she has to cross several busy streets,

10
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,300
so her attention is very split between all these things. Then she gets

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,610
a notification on her Android smart phone. It's from her library app, telling

12
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,180
her she has a book overdue. So imagine you made this library app

13
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,760
for Debbie. How would you notify her that her library books are overdue?
