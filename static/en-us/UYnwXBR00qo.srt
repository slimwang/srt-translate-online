1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, we have a function that depends on two variables.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The temperature depends on time as well as on position.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The typical way to visualize this is to use a 3-dimensional drawing.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
For every time and every position, we go up by the value of the function, and so in the end,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
we get some kind of curve surfers that describes the function.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The partial derivative with respect to time computes the rate of

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
change as time increases, but we leave x constant.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The slope of this tangent line is the partial derivative with respect to time.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The partial derivative with respect to x keeps the time constant

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and only looks at what happens when we change x towards the slope of such a line.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In the end, it boils down to computing regular derivatives and simply leaving

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
all the variables fixed that are not mentioned.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If you form the partial derivative with respect to T, we treat x as though it was a constant.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 99:59:59,999
If you form the partial derivative with respect to x, you treat T as though it was a constant.
