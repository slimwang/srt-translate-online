00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,930
The over operator shows how we can get a transparent effect by blending 2

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,154
objects. However, there's one little catch. How does the Z buffer work when

3
00:00:08,154 --> 00:00:12,222
you're using transparent objects. Think about what the Z buffer is dong. It

4
00:00:12,222 --> 00:00:17,633
stores the depth of the object that is closest to the eye. Say, we draw the blue

5
00:00:17,633 --> 00:00:23,323
far object first, then draw and blend in the red transparent object. This works

6
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:27,366
fine. The blue object's color is taken and blended with the red fragment that is

7
00:00:27,366 --> 00:00:31,806
drawn. However, if we reverse the draw order, we start to get into problems. We

8
00:00:31,806 --> 00:00:35,949
get the red fragment and want to blend it. But we don't even have the blue

9
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:40,257
object in the Z buffer yet. Even if we decide to wait for the blue object, we

10
00:00:40,257 --> 00:00:45,510
get into trouble. When the blue fragment renders, it is considered hidden by the

11
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,183
red filter, since its farther away from the eye.
