1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,280
If we take a look at these commands,
we see that in all of these cases,

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:08,900
there's some content, whether the
content of file, or the string "Hello,

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:14,773
world" that's being written into a file,
/dev/lp0.

4
00:00:14,773 --> 00:00:18,210
'lp' stands for
line printer and 0 stands for

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,580
the first line printer that's
identified by the Linux system.

6
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,300
What these commands mean that
we're printing something.

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,960
So the correct answer is
that each of the commands

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,740
are printing something to
the lp0 printer device.
