>> We should shade region 2. I can use the test point 0,0 and plug in these

2
00:00:05,484 --> 00:00:11,565
values to check. If I plug 0 in for y, and 0 in for x, I get 0 is greater than

3
00:00:11,565 --> 00:00:17,156
or equal to 3. But wait, this isn't true. I know zero is actually less than 3.

4
00:00:17,156 --> 00:00:21,876
Because this point doesn't satisfy our inequality and we wind up with a

5
00:00:21,876 --> 00:00:27,018
statement that's not true, we don't want any of this region. We only want the

6
00:00:27,018 --> 00:00:32,241
other region. Any points on this side of the line or on the line would work. So,

7
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:35,523
here's the final graph of our linear inequality.
