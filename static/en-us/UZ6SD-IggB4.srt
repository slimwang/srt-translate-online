1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Well let's go back and remember our rule for shifting.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It only applies if we have a dot

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
in front of a token,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
so we have sort of 2 possible worlds here: this has a dot

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
in front of nothing, and this has a dot in front of a token.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We are definitely going to use the dot in front of the token.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And then we need to look at that token,

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and it better match the next part of the input.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So we haven't seen anything yet--is the next token an open parenthesis?

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Oh, it is! We're so happy, this is going to work out perfectly.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So then, conceptually, what I do is just

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
shift my finger over one, just a step to the right.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So let's go see which one of those that looks like.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It should have this dot moved in, inside the parentheses.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Well, this does not quite match.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It doesn't have the parentheses at all--this represents using the wrong rule.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Over here, we've got the right rule,

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
but we didn't move the dot.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This is just the parse state we started with previously.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So that's not the result of shifting.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This, however--this is looking very promising.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We've moved the dot over one--

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
so now it's inside,

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and we haven't changed this starting offset.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We're going to put this in chart[1],

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and this information assumes we started with zero tokens .

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Then we saw this left parenthesis and Here's where we are now.

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Finally, in this last one,

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We've mistakenly updated the starting position

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
or the (from) information,

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and this would correspond to some other hypothetical input

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
where we had already seen one token,

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and now we've seen one more open parenthesis

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and we're expecting to see a few more.

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
That's not the input we're currently given.

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
This doesn't match--there are no hidden tokens

37
00:01:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to the left that aren't shown in the rule.
