00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,100
For clarity, a file system is
essentially the system by which

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,890
the permanent storage space
of a device is organized and

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,890
divided up to hold files.

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,150
The type of file system a machine has
is determined by the operating system

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,710
running on that machine.

6
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,070
For iPhones and iPads this
operating system is called iOS.

7
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,710
And similar to the operating
system running on Macs,

8
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:23,320
it dictates a UNIX based file system
made up of a hierarchy of directories.

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,200
With the primary goals of security and
simplicity in mind, the file system for

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,740
iOS was conceived with
the notion of treating all apps

11
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:33,080
as self-contained independent islands.

12
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,845
Each app when it's installed,
is placed in what's called a sandbox, or

13
00:00:36,845 --> 00:00:40,570
self-contained area of the file system
in which to keep all of its stuff.

14
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,830
You can imagine a new app on your
device as a new student at a school.

15
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,430
Let's call her Appigail.

16
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:52,680
The new student is given a locker to
keep books, papers, personal items, and

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,200
whatever else.

18
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,570
The lockers locked so only this
student has access to her own things.

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,380
Likewise, the student doesn't have
access to any fellow studentâ€™s lockers.

20
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,150
The only thing is, imagine that
this is a magical school and

21
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,220
that the lockers maintain
magical properties.

22
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,780
There's an overall finite amount of
space that all the walkers combined can

23
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,320
take up, but until that space limit is
reached, each student's locker will

24
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,200
expand to fit whatever is put into it or
new lockers can be created.

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,980
Whereas if a student has
to store gym bag and

26
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:27,000
large textbooks, as long as the overall
locker system has extra space

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,459
this student's personal locker
will expand to fit his items.

28
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,500
Likewise, you,

29
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,030
the device's owner, get to decide
how you want the space allocated.

30
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,700
Whether you want to keep 12 gigabytes
of photos, and 6 gigs of music, and

31
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,770
6 gigs of small apps,
the choice is up to you.
