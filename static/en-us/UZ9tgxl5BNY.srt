00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,919
With the basic parts of our Sunshine app
finished, like downloading the data and

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,490
displaying it in a UI, your users
might want a little more control and

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,539
personalization over what they see.

4
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:12,096
>> Right, for example, I travel a lot.

5
00:00:12,096 --> 00:00:14,539
And in some parts of the world
outside of California,

6
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:17,320
they have this weird
thing called weather.

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,710
So if I'm visiting friends in New York,
I want to be able to see if it's really

8
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,570
there and then,
maybe the rig got out of storage.

9
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,230
>> Right, and I like to see
my temperature settings and

10
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,960
Celsius degrees instead of
this Farenheit nonsense.

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,210
>> But, for those who us of US,
Bahamas and

12
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,609
Belize, Farenheit will work just fine.

13
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:36,649
So, how do we offer
the sort of customization.

14
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:39,989
Well, you've already seen things
like buttons and edit text.

15
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,984
But as we mentioned when talking
about rotating the app screen,

16
00:00:42,984 --> 00:00:46,206
the state of those values doesn't
always automatically get saved.

17
00:00:46,206 --> 00:00:50,140
>> Because of this, simply adding
views that take input isn't enough.

18
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,740
We need to think of how to save
that input throughout the different

19
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,440
life cycle changes that
the app might throw at us.

20
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:58,149
Including just shutting it
down without any warning.

21
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:00,978
>> In addition, many apps will
have this specific screens for

22
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:03,197
things like app settings and
configuration.

23
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:06,659
>> Luckily, Android provides us with
the tools to both save data, and

24
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,420
easily create a starting screens for
the app.

25
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,989
And how does Android do this?

26
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:11,799
Preferences.
