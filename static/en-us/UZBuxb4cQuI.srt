1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,045
We can remove a factor of 5 tenths and 7 tenths from the numerator and the

2
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:10,065
denominator. 5 tenths divides into 1 and 5 tenths 3 times. And 5 tenths divides

3
00:00:10,065 --> 00:00:15,821
into 2 and 5 tenths 5 times. 7 tenths divides into 4 and 9 tenths 7 times. And

4
00:00:15,821 --> 00:00:20,395
divides into 2 and 1 tenth 3 times. If you're having trouble with the decimals,

5
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:25,705
think about multiplying them all by 10. We know 5 goes into 15, 3 times. 5 goes

6
00:00:25,705 --> 00:00:32,560
into 25, 5 times. 7 would go into 21, 3 times. And 7 would go into 49, 7 times.

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,551
We don't want to use this since it might confuse us with the powers of 10. But

8
00:00:36,551 --> 00:00:39,573
it's another way that might help you think about this division.
