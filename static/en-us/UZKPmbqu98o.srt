1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, we have all the ingredients to that model of a wildfire.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The heat equation in 2D to describe the diffusion of heat. We have a model for heat loss.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We can describe the effect of wind at least in one dimension, but that would be easy to generalize

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
to two dimensions, and we have a simple model for combustion.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In the homework, you're going to put all of these together to model a wildfire.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This boils down to adding the different contributions to a rate of change of temperature.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This is what the result could look like.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
In the region where the fire has started, the wood is depleted so they can't be any combustion going on.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The fire has advanced to the right, a little to the left, and to the top.
