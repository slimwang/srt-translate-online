1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,560
So, the last operator that I want to introduce

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:06,560
you to is unwind. Unwind is really cool. So

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,440
you know that we can have fields that have

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,810
arrays as their values in Mongo DB. Well, what

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:15,210
unwind does for us, is, for every value

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,210
of an array field on which we're using unwind,

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,490
it will create an instance of the document containing

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,340
that array field, for every value in the array.

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,250
So, in this example, we would get three different documents,

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,600
I'm representing the additional fields here using ellipses. But each of

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,880
the individual values for this particular field would be broken out

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,000
one by one into each of these three documents. All of

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,330
the other fields would be exactly the same in each

14
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,740
of the three documents. Now the value of doing something like

15
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,600
this is, well we could run a groupby stage as the

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,560
next stage of the pipeline, where we actually care about what

17
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,410
the individual values are and want to group on those individual

18
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,930
values. Now where would we want to do this? Well, one

19
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,990
example would be, if wanted to group based on the hash

20
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,910
tags included in individual tweets. Hash tags in that data set

21
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,870
are rolled up into an array. We could unwind them, using

22
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,380
Unwind. And do a groupby in the next stage. So that's

23
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,360
our overview of aggregation operators. As we move through the rest

24
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,710
of this lesson we'll be looking at each of these operators in

25
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,480
more detail with some very concrete examples, using the Twitter data set.
