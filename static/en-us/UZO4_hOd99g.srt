00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,230
All right,
welcome back to Computer Vision.

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,770
Last time, we introduced
the notion of image motion.

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,690
We said how motion is actually a,
a construct of your head,

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,840
because there's just a bunch
of static frames, and

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,600
your mind your brain induces this notion
of believing that there's actual motion.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,660
So the question then becomes,
how do we compute that motion?

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,250
And we talked about motion
estimation techniques are,

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,870
are going to be
the methods of doing this.

9
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:27,210
The first one that we mentioned
was featured-based methods,

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,950
where you detect, describe and locate
features in your subsequent frames.

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,300
And we've done a bunch of that in
looking at how we do the sift stuff and

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,670
panoramas and those kinds of things.

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,360
But the other methods were
called direct or dense methods,

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,510
and that's what we're going
to be focusing on today.

15
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:48,050
Direct and dense methods,
what they do is they recover motion at

16
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:52,105
every pixel in the image and
that gives you a dense flow feel.

17
00:00:52,105 --> 00:00:56,330
And it is based upon what we call the
spatial temporal brightness variations,

18
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,380
how the appearances is moving and
it's changing.

19
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:04,450
It can be sensitive to appearance
changes but as long as you're getting

20
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:09,370
sort of, video like sequences where
you have frames sampled regularly and

21
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,980
frequently, it works pretty well
