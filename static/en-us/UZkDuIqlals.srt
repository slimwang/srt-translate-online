Thanks for taking a moment and responding. Now there are several ways that this

2
00:00:04,192 --> 00:00:07,648
disorder can potentially impair a person's life, so let's take a look at this

3
00:00:07,648 --> 00:00:12,490
in more detail. First we see that people with schizophrenia experience a

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:17,610
decline in their overall level of functioning. This means that it can be

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,501
difficult for a person to work at a job that requires a level of skill and

6
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:26,108
concentration that they may have had prior to the onset of the disorder. In

7
00:00:26,108 --> 00:00:31,120
devastating cases, the person loses the ability to be a working individual.

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,512
Moreover, demands such as raising the children, taking care of the house, or

9
00:00:34,512 --> 00:00:38,116
meeting societal demands becomes overwhelming, such that the person is not able

10
00:00:38,116 --> 00:00:40,900
to function appropriately.
