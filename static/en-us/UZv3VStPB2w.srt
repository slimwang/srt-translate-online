1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:00,979
Okay, so here we go.

2
00:00:00,979 --> 00:00:04,885
We're looping over all the conferences
returned from a conference query with

3
00:00:04,885 --> 00:00:08,386
no filters, putting them in
ConferenceForms, and returning that.

4
00:00:08,386 --> 00:00:09,245
So this works fine.

5
00:00:09,245 --> 00:00:11,459
And now we can go ahead and
add some more queries,

6
00:00:11,459 --> 00:00:13,518
like showing conferences
the user created.

7
00:00:13,518 --> 00:00:14,810
Let's do that next.
