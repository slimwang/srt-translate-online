The next question comes from Luca.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Luca wants to know when work with a compiler is really, really heavy

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and you have a really long regular expression, is there any way of dumping out

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
the final set of these low level machine instructions so they can be culled later.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yep. Okay. That's a great question. A couple answers to that.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
One is that within the regular expression module, the re module in Python,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
there is a compile statement that takes a string in

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and returns a compiled version of that regular expression.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So if you're running your program once, you can compile that regular expression once

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
at the very top of your program then use the compiled expression each time.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Now, if you do that explicitly, then you're all set.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
If you don't, the regular expression module does most of the work for you,

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
because what it does is it keeps a little cache--it does something like memoize

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and keeps the last few regular expression that's done and says, I've seen this string before.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I know what it compiles to. I'll just fetch that compiled object. It does that automatically.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That's within one run of your program.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Now, another thing to think about is between runs of your program.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What if you've compiled everything, and then you don't want to have the startup time

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
of compiling it over again?

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
There's another module called pickle. Well, what are pickles?

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
They're ways of storing cucumbers for a long time so they don't get rotten.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That's what the pickle module does.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It takes an object that exists within the running Python interpreter

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and writes it out to disk in a form that can be read back in.
