As we saw Dr Zale using positive reinforcement to increase behavior, sometimes,

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:08,689
we want to decrease behavior, and we can do that through extinction. And you'll

3
00:00:08,689 --> 00:00:12,970
remember that we had extinction in classical conditioning also. For operant

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,778
conditioning, extinction is the process of withholding the reinforcer when the

5
00:00:16,778 --> 00:00:21,647
behavior occurs. Eventually if you take the reinforce away that behavior is

6
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:24,827
going to decrease, so it's a process of removing the reinforcement and a

7
00:00:24,827 --> 00:00:30,700
general decrease in behavior across time. Although it's easy to talk about

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,486
extinction, it can be difficult to implement. And one of the main reasons is

9
00:00:34,486 --> 00:00:37,686
that behavior that's undergoing extinction often results in aggressive or

10
00:00:37,686 --> 00:00:41,694
emotional behavior. And sometimes we originally see an increase in that

11
00:00:41,694 --> 00:00:44,540
behavior, when we start the extinction process.
