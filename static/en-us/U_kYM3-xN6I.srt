00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,300
The answer for this first one,
is that c could be as small as 32,

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,050
the optimum, but
of course it can't be any smaller.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,550
On the other hand,
it could be as big as 64, twice 32, but

4
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:17,310
it can't be any greater by the guarantee
provided by the theorem we just proved.

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,480
Next, taking it as a given,

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,060
that the algorithm returns
a vertex cover of size 50.

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:28,904
Then it might be with the case that the
optimum cover is half of that size, 25.

8
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:32,600
You can't be any smaller, because of the
guarantee that the algorithm provides.

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,820
On the other hand,
it might be as large as 50,

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,230
since it's possible the algorithm
actually found the optimum cover.
