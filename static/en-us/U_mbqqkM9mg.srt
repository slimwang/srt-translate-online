00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,000
So your web browser does a great job of
concealing a lot of the complexities of

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,820
HTTP, such that the user can focus
on the web surfing experience.

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,050
But as developers, we need to be able to
dig deep to see what is going on with

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:12,960
requests and responses.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,870
Luckily there are several tools out
there that we can use to generate

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,220
HTTP requests and view responses.

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,050
In this video,
I will point out two of my favorites.

8
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,980
If you're a big fan of command
line applications, Curl is one of

9
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,230
the most popular command line tools for
sending and receiving HTTP messages,

10
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,350
even though it can also transmit
on several other protocols.

11
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,470
If you prefer a graphical
user interface, Postman is

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:39,250
an easy-to-navigate Chrome extension you
can use to build and view HTTP messages.

13
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,200
Documentation for using these tools
can be found in the instructor notes.

14
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,020
I recommend choosing one of these
tools and getting familiar with it for

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,010
future exercises.
