I said at the start that OCL had constraints, it had collection classes, and

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:09,850
have navigation. Let's say, let's talk for a minute about the navigation aspect.

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:14,630
I also said that OCL typically is associated with a particular class model

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:19,190
diagram. And when you remember that the, each of the OCL constraints has

5
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:24,300
a context clause that says which class or operation you are starting with.

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,440
Well, it's certainly a value to be able to give constraints on the instances of

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,910
a particular class. But it's even more powerful to be able to say, that several

8
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,436
classes are related in certain ways. That means, that in your constraints, you

9
00:00:38,436 --> 00:00:42,888
need to not only be able to specify the attributes of the, the context class.

10
00:00:42,888 --> 00:00:48,370
But the attributes of other classes, as well. Okay? Well, how do you do that?

11
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,740
In OCL, there's the concept of navigation, which allows you to

12
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:57,940
essentially walk your way through the diagram. And every time you take a step,

13
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,940
you add the period and the name of the next class or relationship along the way.
