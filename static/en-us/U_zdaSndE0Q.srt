00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,390
One of the first challenges with developing for mobile devices

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,400
is the display screen. The typically small screen, compared to a

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,810
desktop or laptop display, forces you to focus on what's really

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,080
critical for users. If the user on a phone sees your

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,730
investor relations link on your mobile web app's homepage, you're probably

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,380
doing it wrong. Unless your app is for an investment firm.

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,370
But of course, if you have more surface, you want to

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,510
use it. You don't want the small bit of text in

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,650
a big empty window design either. In fact, this

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,330
has what's led to the recent adoption of the mantra,

11
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,050
mobile first. It's not really about writing a mobile web

12
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,920
app or a page before the desktop one. It's really

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,310
about stripping your app or page down to its core

14
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,850
user functions. And then layering additional gravy back on top,

15
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,730
if you have appropriate room. This lesson and the following

16
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,710
ones are designed to give you tools to build designs

17
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:54,650
that can scale across multiple screen sizes and scenarios.

18
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,800
Now, the complexity of these lessons may lead you

19
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,910
to ask the question, hey, do I need to

20
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,310
be building one site that scales across desktop and mobile

21
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,790
or can I just have a separate mobile site?

22
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,030
No. Okay, that's a little strong, but there are

23
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,070
still problems with having separate mobile and desktop sites.

24
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,340
Which of these might be problems that you would encounter?
