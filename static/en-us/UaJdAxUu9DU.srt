1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,120
If we open up the Gif class in
the Objective-C project, we can see that

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,950
the Gif class inherits from NSObject and
conforms to the and NSCoding protocol.

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:13,820
We're going to need to add both
of those to our swift gif class.

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,910
Remember that in order to be visible
to Objective-C APIs, a swift class

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,718
must inherit from an NSObject and
that's true of the NSCoding protocol.

6
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:29,090
If we open up the gif.m file, we can
see that the two required methods for

7
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,590
the and
NSCoding protocol are implemented here.

8
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:37,090
The methods initWithCoder and
encodeWithCoder.

9
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,200
Naturally, we'll need to implement these
methods in the swift version as well.

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,980
You're going to rewrite the method
initWithCoder, just like you see here,

11
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,500
calling decode object for key for
each property to an unarchive a gif.

12
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,510
And you're going to rewrite the method
encodeWithCoder just like you see here.

13
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,300
Calling encodeObject forKey which
takes the object to be archived and

14
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,750
the key as parameters.

15
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:05,129
So to start off with,
here we are back in our gif.swift file.

16
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,860
And we're going to add NSObject and
NSCoding.

17
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:14,200
And of course the NSCoding
protocol requires two methods.

18
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,860
init with coder, and encodeWithCoder.

19
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:25,800
So, unarchiving is going to
look something like this and

20
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,240
archiving is going to
look something like this.

21
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,010
And I'll let you guys take it from here.
