1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,365
Okay.

2
00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:04,207
We're going to cover one last thing with exponents, and it has to do with

3
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:08,572
squares. In particular, I mean squaring numbers, like 4 squared and 5 squared.

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,779
Specifically, I want to know if 4 squared plus 5 squared is the same thing as

5
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:16,925
the quantity of 4 plus 5 squared. I'm going to draw some squares to help us out.

6
00:00:17,023 --> 00:00:21,107
This square's going to have sides of 4, and this square's going to have sides of

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,564
5. This square is going to have sides of 4 plus 5, or 9. But I'm going to split

8
00:00:25,576 --> 00:00:29,865
it up so that way I can see the side with 4 and then 5. It will look like this.

9
00:00:29,966 --> 00:00:33,579
This side is going to be 4 and this side is going to be 5. I've kind of

10
00:00:33,591 --> 00:00:37,933
exaggerated it, but it's okay. This side is also going to be 4 and this side is

11
00:00:37,945 --> 00:00:38,520
going to be 5.
