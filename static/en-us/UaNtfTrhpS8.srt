00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,560
First, most browsers come
equipped with SSL and

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,660
most web servers have
implemented the protocol.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,620
This is true.

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,640
Second, since TLS is for

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:14,590
the transport layer, it relies on IPSec,
which is for the IP layer.

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:15,760
This is false.

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:21,690
Although transport layer relies on IP
layer, TLS does not rely on IPSec.

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,070
Third, in most applications of TLS or

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,600
SSL, public keys are used for
authentication and key exchange.

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,120
This is true.
