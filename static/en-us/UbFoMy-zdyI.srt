1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,620
And the answer, at least at the time of writing, is 16.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,700
And if it's actually different from 16,

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,520
we'll have our grading script update accordingly.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,517
Let me show you how I arrived to this answer.

5
00:00:09,517 --> 00:00:13,205
All right. So here we are in Python I first import the libraries I need.

6
00:00:13,205 --> 00:00:16,320
URL of two and Mini dom.

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,340
Okay and then I download the New York Times page.

8
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,070
I'm going to use URL lib to URL open and I'm pasting the URL.

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,540
I'm going to go ahead and call read on that to download the contents and

10
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,510
we're going to store that under a variable called contents.

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,330
We can take a peek at contents.

12
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:29,970
There we go.

13
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,000
A lot of stuff and looks like RSS.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,650
We can see the closing RSS tag there.

15
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,970
Now we're going to parse this with Mini Dom.

16
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,410
Okay. That worked, got a variable d, it's got a document instance, and

17
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:45,180
I'm going to use get elements by tag name, item, to find all of those.

18
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,780
So let's give this a whirl.

19
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,730
Success.

20
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,480
And then we just run length on this.

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,350
Okay and the answer's 18 [LAUGH].

22
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,440
So grading this is actually going to be a little tricky for

23
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,920
us, all we wanted you to do is go through this process.

24
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,170
So hopefully, that worked out for you and you got a number.

25
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,080
And hopefully, we managed to grade that number.

26
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,810
That's how you parse some basic XML, I think you can see probably, the value

27
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:12,505
here and that many webpages have XML, interfaces them, or RSS interfaces them.

28
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:14,260
Where you can actually download their content, and

29
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,490
manipulate it, from a program.
