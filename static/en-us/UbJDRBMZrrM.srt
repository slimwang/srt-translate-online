00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
To me the best answer is the last one.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The reason being that this area of the pie most closely resembles 20% of the pie.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Now, closely related is the first one where we cut out a quarter of the pie.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
But a quarter is 25%.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So this is slightly smaller than a quarter.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I think it's the best one to correspond to 20/80 in this pie chart.
