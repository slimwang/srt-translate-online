1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,640
Okay, so we've related our attendees to festivals. So

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,000
here we see the Johnny Concerts going in the Cloudstock,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,040
which is very cool. so in theory if I click

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,890
this, I should be able to see everyone is going.

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,040
>> You should see Johnny and Missy.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,660
>> Right cool. I think I'm really starting to get to know Johnny and Missy.

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:17,660
>>

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,504
[LAUGH]

9
00:00:18,504 --> 00:00:19,004
>> Okay

10
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,440
And it's not a field, it's this other, so fields are up here. Festival name and

11
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,260
all that. But this is something different, and

12
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,030
it's just a list of all these attendees.

13
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,380
>> So that's what came up at the final

14
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,860
step of the Field Creation Wizard. That was adding

15
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,730
this related list, which is just a list of

16
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,730
related records Onto the page layout for the festival.

17
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,280
>> Okay. Okay, so great. We have our

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,990
two attendees, who bought some number of tickets

19
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,760
I assume. But it still, I mean, of

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,510
course, it still says tickets sold as zero. There's

21
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,280
no way it would have known. ideally, I don't,

22
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,980
you know, I don't like that. What can we?

23
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,230
>> Well there is a way that it would have known.

24
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:00,200
And so it's really great that we can create some automated calculated

25
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,200
fields in Salesforce. So, we've kind of brushed upon the different

26
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,970
data types, but we haven't talked about roll-up summaries or formula fields.

27
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:07,280
>> Okay.

28
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,950
>> And so, with a roll-up summary, you're able to summarize information

29
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,350
about related records.

30
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,700
>> Okay.

31
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,160
>> And so, let's create a roll-up summary, based off of the attendees

32
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,720
to show how many tickets have been sold in total at the concert.

33
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,210
>> Okay. And, can we do that? I'd actually,

34
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,600
I don't like how we did this. I would

35
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,010
rather keep track of the VIP tickets sold, and

36
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,160
the general admission tickets sold separately. Can we do that?

37
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,880
>> We can. We can just create a filter on the summary, so.

38
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,320
>> Alright.

39
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,830
>> Super easy. So again, let's just go to the Quick Access menu.

40
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,140
And create a new field.

41
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:44,080
>> Okay, we've got a new field. And you

42
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,540
said roll up summary, but it is grayed out, Sam.

43
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:51,100
>> So this comes back to me just skipping through, choosing lookup over

44
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,320
master detail. you can only create your roll up summary when the relationship

45
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,430
is through a master detail relationship. And since we created a lookup, we're

46
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,360
not able to do rollup summaries. But thankfully, we can change it now

47
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,090
that we've related all of our attendees

48
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,930
to a festival into a master detail relationship.

49
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,720
So let's go back really quickly to the

50
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,330
attendee fields, and we can just change that.

51
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,440
>> Okay. Sounds good.
