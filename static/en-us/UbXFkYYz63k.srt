1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,760
Hey Anthony, what are you working on?

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,760
>> Hey, Georgia.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,200
I'm working on web app to share photos
of my travels from around the world.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,120
I call it, Project Compass.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,530
>> That's awesome, how's it coming?

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,850
>> Actually, I'm a little stuck.

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,460
I worked with a designer and
we made some mock ups but

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,020
I don't know how to take these
designs and turn them into code.

9
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,960
>> That's what front end programmers do.

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,720
Front end programmers take designs
from designers and use HTML,

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,030
CSS and JavaScript to create
full fledged websites.

12
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:32,530
Let's take a look.

13
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,600
We interact with websites on a daily
basis, and we rely on these websites for

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,550
just about everything we do.

15
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:43,730
But how often do we stop and think
about how these websites are created?

16
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,480
Every image, link, and
interaction on a website

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,760
has been intentionally created
by a front end programmer.

18
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,910
Front end developers
solve a lot of problems

19
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,660
that users are faced with every day.

20
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,750
They need to find ways to
optimize website loading speeds.

21
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,790
The Google home page loads quickly
because front end developers have

22
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,800
organized the code in a way
that prioritizes loading speed.

23
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,370
They also think about how websites
will fit on different screen sizes,

24
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,115
which is called responsive design.

25
00:01:12,115 --> 00:01:14,670
Uber's home page is designed so

26
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,300
that the content adopts to
the screen size as it changes.

27
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,810
You can see all the elements and

28
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,960
you can notice the person in the image
is intentionally centered on the page.

29
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,690
They also take design mockups
created by designers and

30
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:32,410
use them to make websites using HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript.

31
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:36,310
Front end of helpers at Udacity took
this mockup created by designers and

32
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:40,840
used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make
functioning and interactive web sites.

33
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,730
Front end developers also work on
many different types of projects.

34
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,330
They use the jQuery library
to add interactivity and

35
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,380
animation to web pages.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,100
The Spotify Year in Music website
uses JavaScript and jQuery

37
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,015
to create interactions and animations
as users scroll on their website.

38
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,130
Many front end developers also
create video games using JavaScript.

39
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:09,720
Front end developers can also use
JavaScript to create games like Foxes

40
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,780
and Shotguns, which was made by Florian,
a former Udacity student.

41
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,660
Finally, they make requests to APIs,
such as Yelp and

42
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,190
design how data will be displayed.

43
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,268
Trulia has added a restaurant's feature
using the Yelp API and front end

44
00:02:24,268 --> 00:02:28,370
developers designed how the structure
and data would look to home buyers.

45
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,260
Front end developers work on many
different types of projects and

46
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,970
solve lots of problems.

47
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,545
Let's hear from Kevin,
a front and developer at Udacity
