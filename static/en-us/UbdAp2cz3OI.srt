00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Suppose you're taking a Udacity class.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And I guess you're taking one right now, so let's drop the suppose.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Among the students that take the class with you, you find the following age distribution.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
From 13 to 19 there are 12,000 students.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
From 20 to 32 there are 96,000 students.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And from 33 on there are 36,000 students.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I now want to construct the pie chart with you. Here's my pie.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I want you to place the separator for the very first class

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
of the age 13 to 19, which is the blue class.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Please check the box on the perimeter of the pie chart

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
that best places the separator.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 99:59:59,999
For example if you check the box over here,
