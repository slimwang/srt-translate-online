00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,520
In the following videos, we're going to do an aside on information theory and

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,770
how it's used in data science, specifically with regard to feature selection.

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:13,690
The purpose of this video is to equip you with the necessary background

4
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,519
knowledge to use information theory as a tool in the future.

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,830
In the next video, we'll go back to building our inter Tweet time predictor, and

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,800
how we can apply information theory to it.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,990
Information theory is a field of computer science developed by

8
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:34,430
Claude Shannon while working at AT&T's Bell labs to understand how to

9
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,060
send reliable digital signals.

10
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:41,680
It quantifies the notion of the amount of information contained in a message.

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,630
The science of information theory is a powerful tool used all the time by

12
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:49,830
data scientists to understand the relationship between parameters.

13
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,730
I want to give an overview of what information theory is all about and

14
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,470
how it's used in data science.
