00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,782
>> So let's say we have this population here. I calculated that the mean is

2
00:00:04,782 --> 00:00:09,964
18.97, approximately, and standard deviation is 5.99. If you want you can go

3
00:00:09,964 --> 00:00:15,374
ahead and see if you get those same parameters. By the way, I randomly generated

4
00:00:15,374 --> 00:00:20,588
these numbers using R. So let's take a sample. Let's say this is our first

5
00:00:20,588 --> 00:00:26,192
sample. It includes 18, 20, 23, 18, 21, 15, 17, 22, and 21. So there are 9 in

6
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:32,104
this sample. Calculate the standard deviation of this sample the way that you've

7
00:00:32,104 --> 00:00:32,846
learned.
