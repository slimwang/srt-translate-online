00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We've seen what search can do for problem solving.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It can find the lowest-cost path to a goal,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and it can do that in a way in which we never generate more paths than we have to.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We can find the optimal number of paths to generate,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and we can do that with a heuristic function that we generate on our own

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
by relaxing the existing problem definition.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
But let's be clear on what search can't do.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
All the solutions that we have found consist of a fixed sequence of actions.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
In other words, the agent Hirin Arad, thinks, comes up with a plan that it wants to execute

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and then essentially closes his eyes and starts driving,

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
never considering along the way if something has gone wrong.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
That works fine for this type of problem,

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
but it only works when we satisfy the following conditions.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
[Problem solving works when:]

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Problem-solving technology works when the following set of conditions is true:

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
First, the domain must be fully observable.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
In other words, we must be able to see what initial state we start out with.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Second, the domain must be known.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That is, we have to know the set of available actions to us.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Third, the domain must be discrete.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
There must be a finite number of actions to chose from.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Fourth, the domain must be deterministic.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We have to know the result of taking an action.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Finally, the domain must be static.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
There must be nothing else in the world that can change the world except our own actions.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
If all these conditions are true, then we can search for a plan

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
which solves the problem and is guaranteed to work.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 99:59:59,999
In later units, we will see what to do if any of these conditions fail to hold.
