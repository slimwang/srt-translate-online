1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:05,400
We've already seen cache first
used to store our app shell.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,800
If the request matches a cache entry,
respond with that.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,980
Otherwise, try to fetch
the resource from the network.

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:18,920
Cache first then network is ideal for
storing commonly used resources.

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,340
Such as storing the key
components of the app shell.

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,380
Be careful when using this strategy for
application data or

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,730
resources that change frequently.

8
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,980
Otherwise you might get stale data.
