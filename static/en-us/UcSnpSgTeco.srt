00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,655
In this last lesson of the course,
I want to provide a brief and

2
00:00:03,655 --> 00:00:08,160
high-level overview of some of the
technical challenges and technologies

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,870
that are relevant to today's internet
scale applications that are popular.

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:18,000
And the underlying data center
systems that support their execution.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,980
Please note my emphasis on brief and
high-level.

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,872
The space of data center technologies is
so vast and so dynamic, that there is no

7
00:00:25,872 --> 00:00:30,910
way we can cover it in sufficient
technical depth in just one lesson.

8
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,930
In fact, there are a number
of courses at Georgia Tech

9
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,540
that devote a substantial percentage
of their content to these topics.

10
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,890
Instead what I want to achieve with this
lesson, is to make sure I provide you

11
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,940
with some context so that you can
understand how some of the mechanisms

12
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,720
that were discussed earlier in this
course, apply to those problems,

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,290
to those technologies that
are in popular use today.

14
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:00,660
Specifically we will describe
the typical multi-tier architectures for

15
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,470
supporting internet skill services and
applications, and

16
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,850
their related management challenges.

17
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,850
Next we will talk about cloud computing.

18
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,430
We will explain what it is and
what is the role that it plays

19
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,440
in addressing the limitations of some
of these traditional approaches.

20
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,240
And finally we will briefly comment on
some of the key technologies that shape

21
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,620
the cloud computing landscape, and
that enable us, with scale and

22
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,680
flexibility, in how we process
large amounts of information.
