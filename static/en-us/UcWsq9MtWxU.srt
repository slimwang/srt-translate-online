00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,968
You have time for a quick story?

2
00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:03,170
Okay, sure.

3
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,672
Anybody here ever use Photoshop?

4
00:00:04,672 --> 00:00:05,707
Raise your hand.

5
00:00:05,707 --> 00:00:06,974
In the older Photoshop or

6
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:10,244
even currently, they have something called the unsharp mask.

7
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:11,445
Okay?

8
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:14,515
And when you apply the unsharp mask, what does it do?

9
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,216
It makes it sharper.

10
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:17,098
Now you might ask,

11
00:00:17,098 --> 00:00:20,254
why would you call an unsharp mask something that makes it sharper?

12
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:21,555
Don't ask.

13
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:22,390
Okay.

14
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,917
In the old days, like when you did things in a darkroom,

15
00:00:25,917 --> 00:00:29,463
you were playing with light and you, chemicals, etc.

16
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:33,034
But you still actually able to add and subtract light.

17
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:36,475
So those of you have ever seen film knows that film were made out of

18
00:00:36,475 --> 00:00:37,638
negatives, right?

19
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:40,718
And so that where it was dark, it would let out hardly any light and

20
00:00:40,718 --> 00:00:42,510
where it was light it would let a lot and

21
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,880
then the, it would reflect on, it would be projected onto paper.

22
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,142
And then whenever a lot of light hit the paper, it would become black and

23
00:00:50,142 --> 00:00:52,620
that's why you had to make it be a negative.

24
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,525
Some very clever photographer figured out the following.

25
00:00:56,525 --> 00:01:01,243
Let's suppose I take a negative and then I put a piece of

26
00:01:01,243 --> 00:01:06,901
wax paper over it and I put another piece of film underneath that.

27
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:07,768
Okay?

28
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:10,905
And I turn on the light for just a split [SOUND] second.

29
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:15,910
I will get a blurry negative of the original negative.

30
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:16,744
Okay?

31
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:19,568
Right? Because it, it becomes a negative, it's a piece of film, so

32
00:01:19,568 --> 00:01:22,623
I, I put the, the good negative, the sharp negative piece of wax paper and

33
00:01:22,623 --> 00:01:25,119
then another negative and there are other ways of making it.

34
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,224
But the idea is that I would get a blurry negative of the negative, okay?

35
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:33,394
So if the negative were all white, this negative would now become all black.

36
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:34,495
All right?

37
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:37,131
It was the negative value.

38
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:40,201
Then what you could do is you'd develop that film, et cetera.

39
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:45,636
You could put that blurry negative of the negative in

40
00:01:45,636 --> 00:01:50,711
with the original film and expose it at one shot.

41
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:55,749
And the math that was being done was exactly this math.

42
00:01:55,749 --> 00:02:00,009
We had our original and because it's a negative of it,

43
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:05,291
we're subtracting off a slightly blurry version of the picture and

44
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,362
that would give you a sharper picture.

45
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:12,381
So that's how you did image processing with chemicals and

46
00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:14,602
film to make a sharper picture.

47
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:19,807
And what do you think that extra negative that you made, okay?

48
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:23,611
That was blurrier was called, it was less sharp.

49
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:29,550
It was the unsharp mask and it would be added to the original picture.

50
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,989
And the unsharp mask would yield for you sharper picture.

51
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:36,383
So now you learned something totally irrelevant,

52
00:02:36,383 --> 00:02:39,059
because you probably haven't even seen a piece of film.

53
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:45,032
But it is why in software today, unsharp masks make pictures sharper.

54
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:47,868
And now you actually know why, why the math works.

55
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:51,355
Right? You're essentially subtracting off a slightly blurry version of

56
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:51,910
the image.
