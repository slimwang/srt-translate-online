00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,692
It must make the graph more narrow, judging from the fact that this green curve

2
00:00:04,692 --> 00:00:09,035
is skinnier than this gray curve. And the only difference between our two

3
00:00:09,035 --> 00:00:13,235
equations is that here, x squared is multiplied by 3, and here, it's just

4
00:00:13,235 --> 00:00:17,729
multiplied by 1. Otherwise, the graph hasn't moved at all. There is no shift

5
00:00:17,729 --> 00:00:22,401
horizontally or vertically. It's just the width of the graph that's changed.
