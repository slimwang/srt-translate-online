1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
All right. How do we work out the answer to this?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Well, the number of times that it gets divided in half before it reaches 0

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
is this expression--log base 2 of a plus 1.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
But notice what's happening.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Each time that we divide it in half, we're actually adding 3 to the pile.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This is not quite right.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We actually need to do 3 times this, which is like this,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
but then when we get to the bottom, there's going to be 1 more added into the sum.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This is the answer.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In this particular instance, we got kind of lucky that we happened to have

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
a recurrence relation that we could analyze using one of the formulas that we already worked out.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
One of the things we're going to do next time is look at these kinds of relationships more generally.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
How do we take a recurrence relation and turn it into a concrete formula without getting

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
bogged down in all of the details.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
One of the things we're going to try to do is ignore some of these pesky constants

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
like the 3s and the 4s and so forth,

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
so we can take a function like T(a) and say, well,

18
00:00:52,000 --> 99:59:59,999
it kind of grows in a log-like manner and not really get too worried about the details.
