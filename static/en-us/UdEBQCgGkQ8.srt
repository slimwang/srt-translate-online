1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,960
Now that we have some example
of different objectives for

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,469
segmenting retail stores, let's think
about other data that could be of value,

3
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:10,559
depending on your segmentation purpose.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,589
For data related to competition,

5
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:17,390
I mention the number of nearby
competitors and distance, as examples.

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,960
But additional data such
as their store type and

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,929
hours, may provide added insight.

8
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:26,905
The actual sales information tied
to each store that would come from

9
00:00:26,905 --> 00:00:29,623
the transaction systems
within the company,

10
00:00:29,623 --> 00:00:31,795
could be a logical set of data to use.

11
00:00:31,795 --> 00:00:35,190
But you might also want to have
access to the history and results for

12
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:38,919
many promotional programs that
have been used in the past.

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,300
In order to understand the shoppers that
actually walk in to each store, some

14
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:47,629
companies can provide rather detailed
data about their regular shopper,

15
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:52,550
through a loyalty or rewards card
program that they may have in place.

16
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:55,109
But if that's not available,
we may want to

17
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:59,149
have access to the general census
data for the area around the store.

18
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:04,090
This would provide some data about the
market size, for example population and

19
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:07,890
number of households in the area,
but also give us some more detailed

20
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:13,000
demographics related to income,
ethnicity, age, and other variables.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,659
Because buying behavior is generally
correlated to demographic categories,

22
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:21,239
having this is usually
valuable in a retail setting.

23
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:25,159
Also helpful could be any
information that we could get

24
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:30,689
around what life stage and social groups
are geographically close to the store.

25
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:35,439
These could include already segment
categories like married with children,

26
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,090
or fresh out of school singles,
as examples.

27
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,359
The point here is to think through
the business purpose for creating

28
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:46,640
the segments, and then find the data
that relates most to that objective.
