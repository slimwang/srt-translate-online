00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,070
In this lesson,

2
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:04,750
we will talk about distributed
shared memory systems for DSMs.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:08,170
These are an an example of
applications that perform certain

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,170
distributed state management operations.

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:12,160
Now, in this lesson,

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,600
a lot of what we will talk about will
be in the context of memory management.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,420
Still the methods that we
will discuss will apply to

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,060
other types of distributed applications.

9
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,960
Specifically, we will present
certain design alternatives,

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,530
with respect to DSM systems.

11
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:31,170
And we will discuss the trade offs that
are associated with those decisions.

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,760
In addition, we will discuss several
important consistency models

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,570
that are commonly used in systems that
manage distributed and shared state
