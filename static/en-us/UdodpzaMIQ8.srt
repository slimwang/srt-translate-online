1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,628
Let's consider the optimizations
we just discussed.

2
00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:04,599
For this half-colored map,

3
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:08,118
which region should we fill in next
in order to minimize backtracking?

4
00:00:08,118 --> 00:00:09,529
There might be multiple answers here.

5
00:00:09,529 --> 00:00:11,932
But choose one of these
optimizations and

6
00:00:11,932 --> 00:00:14,408
choose the region that
matches with that.
