1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,900
All right, pop quiz, Andy, where's that going to be?

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:05,164
>> I'm going to click Related Lists over here

3
00:00:05,164 --> 00:00:09,950
and then drag down Open Activities and Activity History.

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,850
>> Just for good measure, I mean, once you close tasks it'll start showing up

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,350
in the Activity History instead of Open

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,560
Activities, so good to have it all there.

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,080
>> Sure. Now I'm going to Save and not forget

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,870
to Save. Cool, and there's our new maintenance ticket.

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:23,976
>> Awesome. Assigned to you.

10
00:00:23,976 --> 00:00:24,339
>> Yeah.

11
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:25,350
>> Due today.

12
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,070
Not started yet.

13
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,430
>> So if I were a user and I wanted to find my tickets, how would I do that?

14
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,840
>> Yeah, you can see all your open tasks straight from the home tab.

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,582
>> Okay, so home.

16
00:00:35,582 --> 00:00:36,750
>> So, at the bottom of the home

17
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,170
tab, there's this calendar, and it talks about

18
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,200
all of the events or meetings that could

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,470
be coming up. Right there. There's your open task.

20
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,940
>> Very cool. Okay, and if I, oh, I don't even need to, to

21
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,800
click on it. I hover and it tells me the subject, the due date, priority

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,410
and that kind of stuff.

23
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,640
>> Yeah, and you can even mark it as complete right there.

24
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,412
>> Oh, cool, but I won't, because I haven't yet.

25
00:00:56,412 --> 00:00:56,484
>> Mm-hm.
