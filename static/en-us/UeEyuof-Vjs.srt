1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,182
Here are the portions of the domain out of these choices that, when applied to

2
00:00:04,182 --> 00:00:09,164
g of x, would make it have an inverse. If we look only at the portion of the

3
00:00:09,164 --> 00:00:13,854
graph where x is less than or equal to 0, that's this part right here. That

4
00:00:13,854 --> 00:00:17,693
definitely passes the horizontal line test. If we look only where x is greater

5
00:00:17,693 --> 00:00:22,860
than or equal to 3, that's from here, onward, to the right. That also works.

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,518
For negative 2 is greater than x, we have again, a part of this side of the

7
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:30,950
graph. And for 7 is less than or equal to x, we have part of this branch over

8
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:35,740
here, as well. So this is yet another case where looking at only parts of the

9
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,739
domain of a function can make that function have an inverse.
