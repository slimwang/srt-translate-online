Say I'm interested in finding out if giving my coworkers high fives makes them

00:00:03,865 --> 00:00:08,100
happier. I'll set up an experiment. I'll give half of them high fives and the

00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,690
other half no high fives. Then as my measure of happiness, I'll see which group

00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:12,568
smiles more.
