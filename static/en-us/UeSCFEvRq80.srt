00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,184
The equation would be x squared plus y squared equals r squared. Now that's

2
00:00:05,184 --> 00:00:08,690
amazing work if you got this equation. Remember that for any point on our

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:13,609
circle, we can set up a right triangle. So, we'll have this leg squared, plus

4
00:00:13,609 --> 00:00:20,442
this leg squared, equals our radius squared. It works for a point out here. And

5
00:00:20,442 --> 00:00:24,639
it would've worked for this point, down here. We have another right triangle,

6
00:00:24,639 --> 00:00:29,160
here, so we would have X squared plus Y squared equals r squared. Where r is

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,870
the length of our string.
