Design is a very common cognitive activity. Some people even claim that

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:09,000
design is a single cognitive activity that has the most economic value of all

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,570
such activities. Configuration is a type of routine design,

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,200
that occurs every single day. For example, you need to run some errands.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,180
You know the roads, you know the vehicle, you know the traffic patterns.

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,070
Now you need to configure the specific route that can optimize some

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:29,330
constraint such as time. Cooking is another everyday example of configuration.

8
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,000
We know the recipes, which tell us about the high level plans and

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,210
the ingredients we need to assign values to specific variables that can optimize

10
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,330
some constraints such as taste. Notice that we can separate task from method.

11
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,820
Configuration is a task that can be addressed by many methods. We will look as

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,888
several of them, such as [UNKNOWN]. Plant refinement, [UNKNOWN] test, and so on.
