1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,320
Okay so now that we have
Google App Engine installed,

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,110
let's run a tutorial just to get
a hang of using the program.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,770
So back in the window we were in,
we'll click on Python and

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,280
then you will see Python tutorial and

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,180
then you will scroll down a little and
you will see Hello, World.

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,710
We'll click on that and

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,720
we'll see some steps from Google,
on how to run this tutorial.

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,850
So first it says to create
a directory called Hello, World.

9
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,220
We can go to our desktop and
create a new folder.

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,070
And let's call it helloworld.

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:40,990
Okay, so now that we have a folder
created, we can move onto the next step.

12
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:46,910
So it says, that we want to create
a file called helloworld.pi and

13
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,030
give it the following contents.

14
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:55,350
So let's select this, copy it,
and then we can paste it here.

15
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,030
You'll notice that this is still
formatted as a plain text file, so

16
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,830
we can go to file, save as, And

17
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:06,490
we want to choose the folder
that we created on our desktop.

18
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,330
And it says to name the file
helloworld.pi so we'll do that now.

19
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:21,400
Okay, so now you can see the file
is reformatted as a python file.

20
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:21,910
Seen here.

21
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,090
And now let's move on to the next steps.

22
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,480
Okay, so
now we have to create a .yaml file.

23
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,660
So again, we'll copy this text.

24
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:34,240
Copy it.

25
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,170
And then paste it in our sub line.

26
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:46,330
Once again,we'll save as and
then this time we'll call it app.yaml.

27
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:49,790
Great, so now that we have this on our
computer, we're ready for the next step.
