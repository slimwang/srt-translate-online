00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:06,820
Here's an example of an HL7 version two,
EDI/X12 formatted message.

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:12,210
A lab test result as it might be
sent back to the ordering physician.

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:18,310
The OBX line is the most interesting
part since it contains the test results.

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,866
Any idea what 1554-5 is?

5
00:00:21,866 --> 00:00:26,774
What about 182|mg/dl?

6
00:00:26,774 --> 00:00:29,798
Or 70_105?

7
00:00:29,798 --> 00:00:33,010
Here's the same message in XML.

8
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:36,240
While it's still not as obvious
as something designed just for

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:42,690
human reading,
it is much clearer that 1554-5 is a code

10
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,730
LN is the abbreviation for loin,

11
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,910
and 70 and 105 are the low and
high values.

12
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:59,470
And, at least by inference,
182 is the result for this patient.

13
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,760
So H must mean the result is high.
