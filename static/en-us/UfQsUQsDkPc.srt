We are told that the amount Grant wants in account eventually is $1250. So,

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,903
lets substitute this in, in the place of A. That makes our equation 1250 equals

3
00:00:10,903 --> 00:00:19,520
1000 times 1 plus 0.03 to the t. So now we have an equation with just one

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,590
variable, t. And conveniently, that's what we wanted to solve for anyway. So

5
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,210
please solve for t using this equation. Once you have a number that t is equal

6
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,530
to, please round up to the nearest integer or to the nearest year, since

7
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:40,250
interest is paid into the account yearly. One more little hint for you. The

8
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,850
base of a log doesn't have to be an integer. Think about that as you go through

9
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,921
the problem.
