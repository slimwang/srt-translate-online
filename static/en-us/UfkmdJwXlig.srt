00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In this problem set, I want you to create a function that models the orbit of the moon around the earth.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We're going to assume in this case that the moon's orbit is perfectly circular,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
which means that we can model it using just sine and cosine functions.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This assignment should then help you practice translating

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
simple mathematical ideas into expressions in Python.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So if you look over at the supplied code right here, you can see that we've helped you out

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
with some pretty important parts of the code already.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We've already told you that the moon's distance from the earth is 384 million meters,

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and we've also defined a function called orbit for you.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Inside orbit, you can see that the number of time steps that we're going to look at

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
as the moon moves in its orbit around the earth is 50.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We've also created a 2-dimensional array called x, which is initialized with zeros.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The number of rows in x is equals to the number of time steps in the moon's orbit plus 1.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The reason for this is that if you're watching the moon step around the earth 50 times,

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
then the number of positions that we're actually looking at it is 50 + 1.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Looking back at x, we see that there are two columns in the array--

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
one for the horizontal position of the moon compared

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
to the earth and one for the vertical position.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
One important thing to note is that the cosine and sine functions from Python math library

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
that we're using in this problem, take arguments that are measured in radiant not in degrees.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
When you finish filling in your code here and run the program, you should get

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
a plot of a circular trajectory of the moon around the earth.
