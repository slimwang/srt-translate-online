We know that for parabolas that point upward, like the two that I have shown on

2
00:00:04,042 --> 00:00:08,680
the graph here. The vertex is the minimum point on the curve, or in other words,

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,403
the point with the lowest y value. So let's look back at our equation right here

4
00:00:13,403 --> 00:00:18,137
for the green problem. Y minus 5 equals the quantity x minus 7 squared. Let's

5
00:00:18,137 --> 00:00:21,971
take a second to dissect the different parts of our equation. Looking only at

6
00:00:21,971 --> 00:00:25,903
the right side, we have the quantity x minus 7 squared. Now what's the smallest

7
00:00:25,903 --> 00:00:29,790
value that this quantity can have? Think about different things that you could

8
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,618
plug in for x, and what quantities for this whole expression each of those would

9
00:00:33,618 --> 00:00:34,064
yield.
