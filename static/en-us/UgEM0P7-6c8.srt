1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,299
So if we're playing poker, that would
be partially observable, I think,

2
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:07,349
because you can see your own hand, but
you can't see your opponents' hands.

3
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:08,971
>> That's true.

4
00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:09,910
>> It would be stochastic,

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,289
because you don't know what cards
are going to be dealt and when.

6
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:16,308
It would be discrete,
because there are only a theoretically

7
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,960
finite number of hands, although
the number of hands is very, very large.

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,769
And it would definitely be adversarial.

9
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:24,359
You're trying to win,
your opponent is trying to win, and

10
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,419
only one of the two of
you can generally win.

11
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,505
>> Hm, that's true.

12
00:00:27,504 --> 00:00:33,460
Well, recognizing handwritten
text is a pretty hard problem.

13
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,250
Well, let's see.

14
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,520
Is it partially observable?

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,359
Not really, you can,
when given a sample of handwritten text,

16
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:43,299
you can see the whole thing.

17
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:45,031
Is it stochastic?

18
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:49,219
I am going to say, yes, because
the patterns that are generated by

19
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:54,339
human hands can vary a lot, and there
might be a lot of randomness in there.

20
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,220
What about continuous?

21
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,719
One way to think about it is
how many different dates or

22
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,500
conditions the environment could be in.

23
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,340
In this case, if the environment or
the inputs that need to be represented

24
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:12,480
are the image pixels, then there
are a lot of different possibilities.

25
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,420
Although those possibilities
are actually finite in number,

26
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,799
the underlying representation,

27
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,959
the underlying thing that's
creating them is continuous.

28
00:01:23,941 --> 00:01:26,769
Not really adversarial,
it's not really a game, and

29
00:01:26,769 --> 00:01:28,849
we're not competing against anyone.

30
00:01:28,849 --> 00:01:29,559
>> No.

31
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,090
For driving on the road, for
something like a self-driving car,

32
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,680
that's an interesting question.

33
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,240
It can certainly see a lot
about its enviroment, but

34
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:38,099
it can't see it's entire environment.

35
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:41,704
It can't, for example, see whether
there's a car is coming around the next

36
00:01:41,704 --> 00:01:44,590
corner or anything, even though that
already exists in the environment.

37
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:48,370
So I would say it's partially
observable, not completely observable.

38
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:51,990
Whether or not it's stochastic or
deterministic could be a pretty deep

39
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:55,619
philosophical problem about whether or
not humans themselves are deterministic.

40
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,865
But I'll say for
the purpose of the autonomous vehicle,

41
00:01:57,864 --> 00:01:59,512
it's definitely a stochastic problem.

42
00:01:59,513 --> 00:02:01,463
There are definitely things
it can't anticipate or

43
00:02:01,463 --> 00:02:04,609
can't predict even with all
the information in the world.

44
00:02:04,609 --> 00:02:06,319
It's definitely a continuous problem,

45
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:08,855
just because of the nature
of real-world information.

46
00:02:10,189 --> 00:02:12,539
And I'm going to say
it's not adversarial,

47
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:14,530
although if you've ever seen me drive,

48
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,574
you might disagree about whether or
not driving is an adversarial problem.

49
00:02:17,574 --> 00:02:19,842
>> [LAUGH]
>> Okay,

50
00:02:19,842 --> 00:02:23,379
so the last one we
have is playing chess.

51
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:26,150
It's definitely not
partially observable.

52
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,890
It's just like tic-tac-toe,
where you can see the entire board.

53
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,539
And it's also not stochastic,

54
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:35,419
because when you make a move, you know
exactly what the result would be.

55
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:41,070
And since there are only a finite
number of states, again, a huge

56
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:45,819
number of states but still finite,
I would say it's not continuous either.

57
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:49,859
Lastly, it is adversarial, because
you're playing against an opponent.
