1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,730
And the answer here is the last two.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,570
The question of is a program a virus

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,247
is a question about the program's
behavior as I've defined it.

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,970
Also, some programs are viruses and
some aren't, so

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,370
this can't be decided in general.

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:20,080
We can look for specific viruses and we
can monitor the behavior of programs for

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,970
suspicious activity.

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,390
Doing this is a billion dollar industry.

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,760
But we're never going to get
an all purpose virus detector.

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,510
Nor am I ever going to be able
to write the perfect test code

11
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,490
to see if the Turing machine that
you programmed to decide balance

12
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,610
strings actually works.

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,670
I can write test cases,
and detect common errors.

14
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,370
But I could never decide
completely whether your programs

15
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,770
are right or wrong.

16
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:43,700
On the other hand,

17
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,650
I can write a program to test whether
your reduction of HTM to the language

18
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:52,490
of Turing machines that accept
nothing is decidable, I simply reject.

19
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:57,700
Remember that no such reduction can
exist, because HTM is recognizable, and

20
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,170
ETM is corecognizable.

21
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,360
And lastly, this question about
whether a program will halt

22
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,700
in 10 to the 200 steps is decidable.

23
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,960
I just run the program for
up to that many steps.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,090
Of course that number is so large
that in practice, even on the fastest

25
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:17,010
computers, the heat death of
the universe will have occurred by then.

26
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,760
But nevertheless,
the question is decidable.

27
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,180
The reason Rice's theorem doesn't
apply here is because this question

28
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,390
is about machines, not about languages.

29
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,710
The purpose of this quiz is not
to tell you that undecidability

30
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,690
is a concept with no
practical implications.

31
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:36,440
Rather, it is to help you to see
what it does and does not tell us.

32
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,740
Just because a problem is decidable
doesn't mean that it's tractable, or

33
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,790
practical to solve.

34
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:47,740
Also, just because a question
is undecidable in general,

35
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,410
doesn't mean that we can't write
programs to tackle specific cases,

36
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,630
as we do everyday with malware
detection and software testing.

37
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:00,000
It does however say that we should not
expect an all-purpose solution, and

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,460
any attempt to achieve that
end is doomed to fail.
