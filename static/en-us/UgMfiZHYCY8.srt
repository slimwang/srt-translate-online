00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,450
So far,
we have looked at a variety of ways,

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:06,460
how we are going to find information
in images, to do things like alignment.

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,920
Let's also step back a little bit and

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,220
now ask the question how does
image transformation happen?

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,185
How do we actually figure
out how to transform or

6
00:00:14,185 --> 00:00:17,275
warp an image, translate it, rotate it.

7
00:00:17,275 --> 00:00:21,715
Also, look for things like projective
and affine warps and transformations.

8
00:00:21,715 --> 00:00:24,955
In this lecture, we're going to talk
about how we can do this mathematically.
