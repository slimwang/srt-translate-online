00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,810
In this lesson I'll be
talking about focus and

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,000
how you can manage it
in your application.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,119
Now in a nutshell, focus refers to
the control on the computer screen that

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:11,910
receives input from the keyboard and
from the clipboard when you paste.

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,140
You're probably familiar with focus for
text fields.

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,730
In order to type in a text field you
first have to go over with your mouse

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:17,740
and click on it.

8
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,190
Well that act of clicking on the text
field, that's actually what focuses it.

9
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:24,662
You may also know that if you then press
the tab key it will then move focus to

10
00:00:24,662 --> 00:00:26,682
the next text field or
available control.

11
00:00:26,682 --> 00:00:29,766
Now some users drive the computer
entirely with the keyboard or

12
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:31,873
some other type of
discrete input device.

13
00:00:31,873 --> 00:00:34,526
For those users,
focus is absolutely critical.

14
00:00:34,526 --> 00:00:37,788
It's their primary means of
reaching everything on the screen.

15
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:41,069
And so for that reason the Web AIM
checklist states in section 2.1.1,

16
00:00:41,069 --> 00:00:44,142
that all page functionality should
be available using the keyboard,

17
00:00:44,142 --> 00:00:47,423
unless it's something you couldn't
normally do with a keyboard like free

18
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:50,030
hand drawing or something like that.

19
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,050
So this is a great place to start
learning about accessibility because

20
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,050
obviously we all know
how to use a keyboard.

21
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,060
It's very easy to relate to and
test, and

22
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,200
it benefits virtually all of our users.

23
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,160
There's users out there with motor
impairments which could be caused by

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,680
anything from paralysis or
even just a broken arm.

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,700
Those folks may be relying on a keyboard
or switch device to navigate your page,

26
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,040
so a good focus strategy is going
to be absolutely critical for them.

27
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,920
And for the power users out there,

28
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,900
those folks who know every keyboard
shortcut on their machine and

29
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,610
hate having to use the mouse, well,
for them, being able to navigate, for

30
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,580
instance, a form on your site, is just
going to make them more productive.

31
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,120
So well-implemented focus strategy
means everyone using your application

32
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,980
will have a better experience.

33
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,490
And as we'll see in
the next few lessons,

34
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,550
the work that we do today on focus
is actually an important primer for

35
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,570
supporting assistive technology users.
