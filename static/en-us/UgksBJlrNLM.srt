00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,910
You're probably familiar
with Warren Buffett.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,830
He's one of the most
successful investors ever.

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,760
He's made a number of insightful
comments over the years,

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,920
many of which relate to this class.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,970
One of my favorites is,

6
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:17,230
only when the tide goes out do you
discover who's been swimming naked.

7
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,300
That's not the one for
this lesson though.

8
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,940
The one for this lesson is.

9
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,890
Wide diversification is only necessary

10
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,065
when investors do not
know what they are doing.

11
00:00:26,065 --> 00:00:29,300
Mr. Buffett is talking about two things.

12
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,440
Investor skill and breadth or
the number of investments.

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,550
This lesson is about how investment
performance relates to those

14
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,360
two factors.
