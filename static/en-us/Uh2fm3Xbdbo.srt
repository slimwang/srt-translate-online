1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,360
All right. This is what I'm going to do.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,840
I'm guessing it's just like any other field, except

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,500
it's called formula. going to call it Total Tickets Sold.

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,450
Okay, return type. I'm guessing, since I'm just adding

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,700
numbers together, I'm not going to get a date or

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,120
anything, I'm going to get a number. I don't really

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,460
know what this checkbox business is, but I'm not

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,610
going to worry about it. options, decimal places. I don't

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,530
want any decimal places. These are integers,

10
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:33,390
my friend. 'Kay. 'Kay, this is a little

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,680
tricky. okay. General admission, tickets sold. And then

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,390
I'm going to add it. And just write plus.

13
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,420
>> You can. So if you didn't know what kind of operators you could

14
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,070
use, that insert operator there tells you

15
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,250
exactly the simple operations you can do.

16
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,850
>> Add, subtract, yeah makes sense. Okay. So general admission tickets

17
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,670
sold and it's using the Code E version, but we're okay with

18
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:59,520
that. I'm going to add that to VIP tickets sold. And I think that's

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,240
what I want. I'm just going to try this and see if it

20
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:07,730
works. Should I hit this check syntax? no syntax errors found, excellent, next.

21
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,860
>> So you made it visible to everyone, you're going to automatically

22
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,930
add it to the page and let's go look at a record.

23
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,000
>> This is the moment of truth.

24
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,200
When I click, on Cloudstock

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,260
hey, hey, alright. That's pretty cool.

26
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:24,810
>> That's awesome.

27
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,540
>> It's really getting smarter.

28
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:26,540
>>

29
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,285
[LAUGH]

30
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:28,950
>> Okay. an I'm going to just delete this

31
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,910
field as well, cause it's annoying me now.

32
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:30,910
>>

33
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,501
