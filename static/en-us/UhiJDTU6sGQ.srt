1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,680
Tunnel mode is the more
commonly used operation mode.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,820
Suppose we have two end hosts, A and
B, belonging to the same company but

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,780
in two different local area
networks over the Internet.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:18,090
If these IPs are tunneled between the
gateways of the two local area networks,

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,640
then traffic from A to B is
automatically protected by the tunnel.

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,130
That is, A can send unencrypted or
unprotected packets.

7
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,130
And before the packets leave
the local area network,

8
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,690
the gateway adds protection and
sends the packets to the gateway

9
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,670
to B's network which then
unprocesses the packets.

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,650
For example, decrypts the packets and
sends them to B.

11
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:47,701
The gateway of A's network actually
encapsulates traffic from A to B

12
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:52,836
by adding a new IP header that specifies
the gateway as the source IP and

13
00:00:52,836 --> 00:00:56,300
B's gateway as its destination IP.

14
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:01,254
To make sure that the protective packet
is delivered to B's gateway first.

15
00:01:01,254 --> 00:01:05,783
It also includes the IP's header
which contains information about

16
00:01:05,783 --> 00:01:11,340
the protection provided using Or
ESP which we will discuss shortly.

17
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,060
The original packet now becomes the data
or payload of the new IP packet.
