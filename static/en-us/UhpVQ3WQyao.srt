00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,004
Here are the answers.

00:00:02,004 --> 00:00:04,971
I think you can imagine an easy
sequential algorithm for

3
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:06,370
doing this computation.

4
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,226
It would simply start at the front and
go to the back.

5
00:00:09,226 --> 00:00:12,950
It would maintain a current sum and
add values to it.

6
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,740
I think you could see it would
be easy to do in place, that is,

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,000
without creating a separate array.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,220
So a sequential algorithm for
this problem would be super efficient

9
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,670
in time and space, at least from
a sequential point of view.
