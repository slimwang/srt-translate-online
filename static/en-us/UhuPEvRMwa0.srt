1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,290
The goal of working with a model computer instead of a real computer is that

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:10,270
we want to have a machine, which is as easy as possible

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:14,660
but still let us capture the main aspects of a real computer.

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:19,430
And the reason why you want to have a simple computer is that a real computer contains

5
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:24,240
lots of parts that are not really interesting when we want to analyze an algorithm

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,570
and also you might have different computers that run at different speeds

7
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,400
but actually that doesn't really say something about your algorithm.

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,350
In the next year, when the faster computer model comes along,

9
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,430
you can already run your algorithm a bit faster but that doesn't really say

10
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,240
that your algorithm has become better.

11
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:48,280
So our goal here is to strip down a computer that you used to to a model that is as simple as possible

12
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,300
but still has basically the same capabilities as a real computer.

13
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:58,430
So we will do this as a quiz and what I want you to think about is what are the essential components

14
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,250
for having a minimal computer model.

15
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:07,340
And what I mean by essential is that the computer must still be able to solve problems

16
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:13,260
to perform any computation that this machine here could but also not anymore.

17
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,260
So what I would like you do is to check off each of those boxes

18
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:23,260
if you think that this component of a computer is essential to keep in a computer model.

19
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:28,260
So do you need a memory to store your results in?

20
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:33,270
Do you need a graphics card? Some sort of input and output?

21
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,200
Do you need a mouse? Do you need a monitor? Some sort of file system?

22
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,460
An operating system? Programming capabilities? Or a CD-ROM?

23
00:01:42,460 --> 99:59:59,999
And keep in mind that we are looking for a model that is as simple as possible.
