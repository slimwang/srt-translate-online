1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,270
Now that you've decided how to
structure your data, it's time to write

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,530
the code that will write these shopping
list items into the correct location and

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:07,900
read them as well.

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,620
Okay, so on our shopping list page we
currently have a useless button for

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:12,400
adding more items.

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,980
When I click Add Item here it
doesn't really do anything.

7
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,510
Here's what I want you to do.

8
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,780
When you click the fab and you enter
the name of the item, and you press

9
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:27,440
Add Item, what it should do is it should
see what shopping list you're on.

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,120
Go to a node called shopping list items.

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,260
Use the push ID for the shopping
list that you're currently on, and

12
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,450
create an item under that push ID.

13
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:36,770
Did you catch all that?

14
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,410
Let me show you a quick example.

15
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,460
Say I've got a shopping list
with the push ID, 1234.

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,630
When I want to add a new item,
such as bacon to this shopping list,

17
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,410
it'll go to this node
shopping list items,

18
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:52,020
make a node with the same key
as the shopping list up here.

19
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,890
And then put the bacon item there.

20
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:58,330
If I wanted to add lettuce and tomato
to the same list, with the key 1234,

21
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,010
they would also be added to the node
shopping list items, with the child one,

22
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:02,600
two, three, four.

23
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,670
Now, you might have noticed that I
didn't tell you what the keys for

24
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,910
these would be.

25
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,750
What you want to make these keys
is up for you to figure out.

26
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,700
And just to drive what's going on home,
let's say that I have another list

27
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,360
with the push key 1999, and
I wanted to add cooking oil.

28
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,780
That would look like this.

29
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,340
Instead of adding it onto
the list of items in 1234,

30
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:26,460
you would go to the list 1999 and
make a new item there.

31
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,620
Getting the data to add in the correct
place is the trickiest part of this

32
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,670
exercise.

33
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,310
Remember that you should
have saved the list ID in

34
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,100
a member variable called mListID.

35
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,640
Just like when we started to
have multiple shopping lists,

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,550
start by just getting the data to
appear in the Firebase back end.

37
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:45,520
Once you've got the data correctly
adding itself in the back end, then you

38
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,180
should set up a Firebase list adaptor
that will display your items here.

39
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,440
This actually really isn't much
different than when we added

40
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,730
the Firebase list adaptor in
the shopping list fragment.

41
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,230
So you can refer to that if you need to.

42
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,990
I'll send over the spec now.

43
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,450
And finally, sorry, before I forget.

44
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:08,070
You should remember also that when you
delete a list, using this Remove dialog,

45
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,640
that it should also delete all the items
that are associated with the list.

46
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,270
Okay, good luck.
