1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,320
Melissa would need six hours to edit the film and Carlos would only need four

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:08,251
hours. Great thinking if you found these two answers. We'll start solving this

3
00:00:08,251 --> 00:00:12,582
equation by multiplying through by the LCD two and 4 tenths times x times x

4
00:00:12,582 --> 00:00:18,629
plus 2. The product of these three denominators. When we multiply through by

5
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:22,837
the LCD, we can simplify each of the terms. The first term reduces to two and

6
00:00:22,837 --> 00:00:27,768
four tenths times x plus two. The second term reduces to two and four tenths

7
00:00:27,768 --> 00:00:33,641
times x And the last term simply reduces to x times x plus 2. We distribute 2

8
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:39,800
and 4 10ths to get these two terms, and we distribute x to get these two terms.

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,225
Next we combine 2 and 4 10ths x, and 2 and 4 10ths x to get 4 and 8 10ths times

10
00:00:44,225 --> 00:00:49,250
x. Now to clear these decimals, I'm going to go ahead and multiply through by a

11
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:55,982
factor of 10. When we multiply through by 10, we'll get 48x48 8, 10x squared,

12
00:00:55,982 --> 00:01:00,692
and 20x. Now we're ready to move these two terms, to the right hand side of our

13
00:01:00,692 --> 00:01:03,606
equation, so we can get 0 on the left side, and a quadratic expression on the

14
00:01:03,606 --> 00:01:09,150
right hand side. Now, we're ready to divide this equation by 2 since all these

15
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,018
coefficients are even. When we divide each of these terms by 2, we'll get this

16
00:01:14,018 --> 00:01:19,600
new equation. Now we can factor. When we use factoring by grouping, we get the

17
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,245
factors 5x plus 6 and x minus 4. We set each factor equal to 0 and then we can

18
00:01:25,245 --> 00:01:30,481
solve for the values of X. X can equal positive 4 or X can equal negative 6

19
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:36,350
fifths. We know X to the amount of time it takes for Carlos to edit the film.

20
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:41,140
So, it would take him 4 hours we don't use this choice since it's negative.

21
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,930
That wouldn't make sense with our concept of time. So, since it takes Carlos 4

22
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:51,026
hours, it must take Melissa 6 hours. We know this is true since x was 4, which

23
00:01:51,026 --> 00:01:56,272
is the amount of time it takes Carlos. And Melissa was X plus 2, two more hours

24
00:01:56,272 --> 00:02:01,490
than Carlos. If you are ever unsure, go back to the original problem. We knew

25
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:06,408
Carlos time was represented by X, so he would take four hours to edit the film.

26
00:02:06,408 --> 00:02:10,127
Melissa takes two hours longer than Carlos so that means that she needs six

27
00:02:10,127 --> 00:02:15,434
hours in order to edit the film. I know this one was tough, so great work if

28
00:02:15,434 --> 00:02:16,830
you got it right.
