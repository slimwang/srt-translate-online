1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:04,080
You are looking at an HTML document, and

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,860
this is what this document
looks like inside the browser.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,100
The similarities should
be pretty obvious.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,860
You can see this is a heading
here inside the HTML, and

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,120
you can see the same, this is
a heading here inside the browser.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,240
There's a lot here.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,880
But I don't want you to
worry about everything.

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,350
Right now just pay attention
to what you see right here,

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,390
which is coming inside these two tags.

10
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,080
That's a body.

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:36,084
This thing right here with , this is
a heading, and is an HTML element.

12
00:00:36,084 --> 00:00:39,906
And this is a special kind of
element called h1 element.

13
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:44,100
H stands for heading, and
one means it's the biggest.

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,860
That means that there are h2,
h3, h4 tags and so on, and

15
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,280
they're all smaller then each one.

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,840
Specifically, this part is called a tag,
the part with an angle bracket h1,

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,250
and then another angle bracket.

18
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,340
There are many tags in HTML.

19
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:05,580
Here's a p tag, here are some span tags,
and this is an image tag.

20
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,610
Each one of these represents
a different kind of element.

21
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,440
This p, inside this tag,
stands for paragraph.

22
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,190
This whole thing is called
a paragraph element.

23
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,800
Notice that this whole element
has two tags, here and here, and

24
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,970
these tags are slightly different.

25
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,820
There's an opening tag, and
there is a closing tag, and

26
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,780
notice the closing tag
has the slash in it.

27
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,650
Between the opening and
the closing tag comes the content.

28
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,540
This content is generally what
people will see inside the browser.

29
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,300
So here are a few different elements.

30
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,826
Notice that the text in both
tags is always the same.

31
00:01:45,826 --> 00:01:49,226
And notice that they all
start with a less than sign,

32
00:01:49,226 --> 00:01:54,324
they all have some kind of text in here
indicating what type of element this is,

33
00:01:54,324 --> 00:01:57,130
and then every tag has
a greater than sign.

34
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:01,621
And just to point it out again, closing
tags have a slash inside them, but

35
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,510
otherwise they look the same.

36
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:08,120
And the slash always comes right
here after the less than sign.

37
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,600
And then together,
everything here represents an element.

38
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,230
There are some elements, like images,
that are slightly different.

39
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,240
Notice that images do
not have a closing tag.

40
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,290
And that's okay.

41
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,410
It's a special one that you'll
learn more about later.

42
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,860
This is a conceptual way of
representing the same element.

43
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,260
In this case,
the content belongs to the paragraph.

44
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,570
The content in a way is
a child of the paragraph.

45
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,220
This is going to be useful later.

46
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:36,940
Don't worry about it now,

47
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,060
but I just wanted to show you because
you'll be seeing more trees like this.

48
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,780
For the time being, I want you to
write your first HTML element.
