00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,338
So Jake, have you got updates working?

2
00:00:02,338 --> 00:00:07,250
>> Yep, users will now be encouraged to
update to the latest version of the site

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,878
and here's how I did it.

4
00:00:08,878 --> 00:00:12,818
So here we are with our refresh button,
but it doesn't do anything yet.

5
00:00:12,818 --> 00:00:14,170
When the user clicks refresh,

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,618
I'm going to call post message
on the installing worker.

7
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:22,020
Passing a JavaScript object with
property action and value, skip waiting.

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,930
You don't have to use
this specific object.

9
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,370
This is just something I'm going to
read in the service worker later on.

10
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,555
So over in the service worker, I'm
going to listen to the message event.

11
00:00:30,555 --> 00:00:33,650
Event.data is the object
past the post message.

12
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,632
So if .action is equal to skipWaiting,

13
00:00:35,632 --> 00:00:40,340
I'll call self.skipWaiting to make
this service worker take over pages.

14
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,530
Now, I want to react to
skipWaiting being called.

15
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,118
So back in the page controller,
I'm going to listen for

16
00:00:45,118 --> 00:00:47,310
the controllerchange events.

17
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,580
If the controller changes,
I reload the page and that's it.

18
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,790
Done.

19
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,935
To test it, I'm going to
unregister the service worker and

20
00:00:55,935 --> 00:00:58,875
reload the page so
all of our latest JavaScript is cached.

21
00:01:00,335 --> 00:01:04,025
Now, I want to test how it picks up a
change to the service worker in assets.

22
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:06,545
I'm actually pretty bored
of this green theme now, so

23
00:01:06,545 --> 00:01:08,410
I'm going to switch it back to the blue.

24
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:12,072
And so, this change doesn't
disrupt currently running pages.

25
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:15,650
I'm going to bump the version
of the static cache.

26
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:20,590
So now, if I refresh the page,
we get our notification.

27
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,570
And if I click the refresh button in the
notification, we got our theme change.

28
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,930
This is just one possibility when
it comes to handling app updates.

29
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,530
You have access to all the moving
parts so, do what works best.

30
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,630
SVGOMG and an SVG compression tool.

31
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,260
It does something very similar
to what we did for Witter.

32
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,750
Except, if the update lands before
the user is interacted with the page,

33
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:47,440
it just tells us so as work to
take over and refreshes instantly.

34
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,920
If the user hasn't interacted.

35
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,110
Refreshing instantly isn't
disruptive in this case.

36
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,460
You could also ask the server for

37
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,900
a change log between the new version and
the current version.

38
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,410
If your update only
contains minor things,

39
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,240
maybe don't bother the user at all.

40
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,210
Let them get the update naturally.

41
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,885
Or if the update contains
an urgent security fix,

42
00:02:05,885 --> 00:02:09,085
maybe refresh the page no
matter what the user is doing.

43
00:02:09,085 --> 00:02:11,665
That would be an annoying experience but

44
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:15,235
it's better than the user using
something with a major security flaw.

45
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,965
Anyway, it's fair to say
we're well on the way

46
00:02:17,965 --> 00:02:20,455
to a full offline first experience.

47
00:02:20,455 --> 00:02:24,225
We've got the user onto the latest
version as quickly as possible.

48
00:02:24,225 --> 00:02:27,505
Next up, we need to work on
updating the posts the user sees.
