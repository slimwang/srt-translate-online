1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,600
Now, let's go back to
checking out FPS Screens.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,200
In this screen we're doing almost
the exact same thing as in delta screen,

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,200
except instead of displaying delta,

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,280
we're displaying number of frames per
second which we can get using this

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,400
handy Gdx graphics get
frames per second column.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,010
All right,
let's try running this game and

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,710
see how the game slash
screen life cycle works.

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,040
So when we start the app,
first the game is created, and

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,580
then we set the actor
screen to be delta screen.

10
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,545
So delta screen was shown and
then resized.

11
00:00:28,545 --> 00:00:32,343
Now we set this up so that we can hit
space to switch between the two screens,

12
00:00:32,343 --> 00:00:33,501
so let's do that now.

13
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,380
When we switch the screens,
delta screen had hide called.

14
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,290
Then FPS screen had show called,
and it was resized.

15
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,370
Also in that process I accidentally
clicked into and out of the screen,

16
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,310
so pause was called and
then resume was called on the screen.

17
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:54,570
Let's see what happens when
we close out of the game.

18
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,300
When we close out of the game
the active screen is first paused,

19
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,940
then dispose is called on the game which
automatically calls hide on the screen

20
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:02,540
that was active.
