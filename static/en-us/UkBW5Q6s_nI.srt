00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,360
So let's say, here we are wondering
around the file system.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,722
Let's say we end up in var log.

3
00:00:08,722 --> 00:00:13,512
That is to say, /var/log is our current
working directory as printed out by

4
00:00:13,512 --> 00:00:14,630
the pwd command.

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,250
Now, what do you think will happen
to the working directory if we just

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,790
type cd with no arguments?

7
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,794
Do you think that nothing will happen,
it will just stay in var log?

8
00:00:25,794 --> 00:00:27,680
Do you think that it will
go to your home directory?

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,870
Do you think that it will go to
the filesystem root or the /directory?

10
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,670
Do you think maybe the shell stops
having a working directory at all?

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,660
Or maybe it's an error?

12
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,550
Or possibly the shell prompt
turns into a shark and eats you?

13
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,090
Which one of these do you
think is going to happen?
