1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,969
And that's why I said it's really common to

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:06,660
have a version string in your manifest file, and you

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,580
keep updating that version string. This can be quite

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,200
a pain, but it isn't too hard. So once we

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,690
have an app cache on the user's machine, on

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,970
every subsequent load, the resources will be loaded from the

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,690
app cache, even when you're online. If it's an

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,390
HTML resource with the manifest For example, that master page

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,890
we started with. Then we'll start an async update of

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,460
that manifest file at the same time. And then continue loading

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,280
the rest of the page. Now, if the manifest has been

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,050
changed, the browser will update the files in a new application

13
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,980
cache. But remember, it's already loaded the page. It may

14
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,700
be done loading a page by this point since we do

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,230
want to be offline first and we want to make sure that

16
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,620
the page gets loaded as quickly as possible. By the time

17
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,610
the manifest file has been downloaded in the background,

18
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,410
the user is probably already off looking at cat

19
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:59,600
videos out of the application cache. Now, you can

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,190
detect when a new cache has been downloaded and there's

21
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,840
new content available. You can listen for an update

22
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,500
ready event on the window application cache object. The

23
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,010
window application cache represents the application cache system. And

24
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,110
you can get things like the status and progress and

25
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,480
tell it specifically to do things like update

26
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,060
the cache or swap the cache out. So

27
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,590
you have a lot of control over the

28
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,440
application cache. This code here checks for an

29
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,250
update ready event, and if there is actually

30
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,120
an update ready, then it'll actually ask the

31
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:37,110
user, is it okay to reload this. And if so, it swaps the cache out and reloads.
