1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,966
Take some time now and go through these
steps to create and set up your project.

2
00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:07,470
Again, the steps that you will need
to follow are first you got to

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,750
set up billing.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,970
Maps on Android doesn't
occur any charges, but

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:14,270
you still need to set up billing
in order to create a new project.

6
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,726
Two, you create the project.

7
00:00:15,726 --> 00:00:20,110
Once the project is created, you will
then get access to the project console.

8
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,650
And on the project console,
you can enable the Maps API.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,363
And then once you've enabled
the Maps API, you set up credentials and

10
00:00:27,363 --> 00:00:31,454
you use your SHA-1 and your application
name in order to generate an API key for

11
00:00:31,454 --> 00:00:33,330
that application.

12
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,100
Go through these steps now and
check this box when you're done.
