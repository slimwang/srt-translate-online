1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,189
Okay, what do you got?
>> So, for the context,

2
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:07,486
this belongs to the audio
video material class.

3
00:00:07,486 --> 00:00:10,696
And the attribute we're talking
about is the checkout period,

4
00:00:10,696 --> 00:00:12,010
which would be two weeks.

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,895
So, context, audio, video material.

6
00:00:14,895 --> 00:00:17,775
This is an invariant of that class.

7
00:00:17,775 --> 00:00:20,165
That the check out period
should be two weeks.

8
00:00:20,165 --> 00:00:23,185
>> So very similar to the previous one.

9
00:00:23,185 --> 00:00:25,965
This one doesn't have
to be a conditional,

10
00:00:25,965 --> 00:00:27,905
because there's only
one possibility here.
