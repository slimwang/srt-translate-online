1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This robot is located at 0, 10 and it points at 45 degrees.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In doing so, it moves some right and some up.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In fact the same ratio in the x dimension as it will be in the y dimension.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Now cosine of this θ here, is about 0.7071 multiplied by 5 added to 0 and you get 3.5355.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It so turns out that this is also the value of sin θ,

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
so you can add the same value over here to the x value of 10, which gives us 13.5355.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Finally, we find that within 1 second the initial heading is canceled out by the change of heading,

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
so we'll be facing in this direction over here, and that angle is just zero.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If you got those right, this was a somewhat tedious exercise on simple geometry,

10
00:00:56,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but this is the kind of math you need to implement in particle filter equations like those over here in robotics.
