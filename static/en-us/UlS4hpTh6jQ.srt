1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,280
There's another way to
write a network size,

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,700
which is often used in
network configuration.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,510
This is a subnet mask, which is a binary
number made of 1s on the left and

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,990
0s on the right to indicate
the size of the network.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,509
You'll often see subnet masks in
network configurations on hosts.

6
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,519
Now, like IPv4 addresses,

7
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:26,210
subnet masks are 32-bit values that are
usually written as decimal dotted quads.

8
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:32,700
The mask for a /24 network in
binary is 24 1s, followed by 8 0s.

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,877
Now since an octet full of
1s makes the number 255, and

10
00:00:37,877 --> 00:00:43,247
an octet full of 0s makes the number 0,
that means that the subnet mask for

11
00:00:43,247 --> 00:00:48,816
a /24 netblock in dotted quad
notation is 255.255.255.0.

12
00:00:48,816 --> 00:00:52,874
Now you will occasionally see some
systems that spell out their subnet

13
00:00:52,874 --> 00:00:55,500
masks in hexadecimal
instead of in decimal.

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,871
In that case, the same subnet mask
would appear as ff, ff, ff, 00.

15
00:01:01,871 --> 00:01:05,992
Now knowing what you just saw,
what's the decimal subnet mask for

16
00:01:05,992 --> 00:01:07,177
a /16 network?
