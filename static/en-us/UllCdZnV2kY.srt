1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,147
To start this division problem, we want to think about what number, times 3a, is

2
00:00:05,147 --> 00:00:09,833
6a squared, well that must be positive 2a. 2a Times 3a is 6a squared, and 2a

3
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:14,961
times positive 2, is positive 4a. Next we subtract this second expression. When

4
00:00:14,961 --> 00:00:20,446
we do subtraction, we simply change all the signs. We distribute the negative 1.

5
00:00:20,446 --> 00:00:26,036
6a Squared minus 6a squared equals zero, And minus 17a minus 4a, is negative 21

6
00:00:26,036 --> 00:00:31,476
a, then we just bring down our negative 14 to continue long division. Next we

7
00:00:31,476 --> 00:00:36,727
want to think about what number times 3a is equal to negative 21a. The number

8
00:00:36,727 --> 00:00:41,074
must be negative 7, negative 7 times 3a is negative 21a, and negative 7 times

9
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:45,821
positive 2 is negative 14. When we subtract this expression, we really

10
00:00:45,821 --> 00:00:51,589
distribute the negative 1 which changes both of the signs. Adding our like-terms

11
00:00:51,589 --> 00:00:56,883
together, we get 0. 2a Minus 7 is our answer and we can check it by, multiplying

12
00:00:56,883 --> 00:00:57,918
it by 3a plus 2.
