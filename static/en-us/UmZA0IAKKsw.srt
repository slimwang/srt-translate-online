1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,209
We'll start by adding a new activity
called settings activity and

2
00:00:04,209 --> 00:00:07,344
then adding the appropriate
navigation to and from this activity.

3
00:00:07,344 --> 00:00:10,179
Okay, so let's go ahead and

4
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:15,879
create a new empty activity, and
I'm going to call it settings activity.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,285
This activity will extend
from AppCompatActivity.

6
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:22,010
Now, we need to add a menu and
an item for the settings.

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,330
We need a way to open
the settings activity.

8
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:28,729
So, going back to the visualizer
activity, I'm going to want to both

9
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,799
add a menu and an item in that menu for
the settings activity.

10
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,829
You've done this before so
I'm going to move a little bit fast, but

11
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:38,574
you can always check out
the link below this video for

12
00:00:38,575 --> 00:00:41,655
a slower version of when we
added a menu for the first time.

13
00:00:41,655 --> 00:00:46,865
To start, I'm going to add a new
resource folder called menu and in this

14
00:00:46,865 --> 00:00:51,075
new resource directory, I'm going to
add a new file called visualizer menu.

15
00:00:52,155 --> 00:00:55,000
The menu is going to have
one item called settings.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,210
Note that I add the app
namespace up here.

17
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,130
I'm going to make my ID action settings.

18
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,640
I'm going to give it a priority of 100,

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,489
and I never want it to
show in the action bar.

20
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:08,789
Also, for its title I'm
going to make a new string.

21
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:15,019
So over here in the values
folder in my strings.xml,

22
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:17,729
I'm going to add a string for settings.

23
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,460
Okay, and here's that string.

24
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:23,919
Now that I have this finished XML
menu file, I can go back to my app.

25
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,540
So here I am in VisualizerActivity and
I'm going to scroll down and

26
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:32,010
I'm going to override
the OnCreate options menu and

27
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,969
in here, I'm going to replace this.

28
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:38,760
Okay, so
here I'm getting a menu inflater and

29
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,510
I'm inflating that menu
that I just created.

30
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,050
Great, let's run the app.

31
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:45,259
Okay, everything is going okay.

32
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:50,420
And now, I can go up here and
I have a settings item in my menu.

33
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,890
It doesn't do anything so
let's work that part up.

34
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,659
Back here, the VisualizerActivity code.

35
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,734
I'm going to now override
on options items selected.

36
00:01:58,734 --> 00:02:00,831
Back at theVisualizerActivity code,

37
00:02:00,831 --> 00:02:04,265
I'm going to now override
on option items selected.

38
00:02:04,265 --> 00:02:07,862
This is the method that is called when
you select an item in one of your menus.

39
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:08,699
I'm going to get the I.D.

40
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:13,290
I'm going to check if it matches
the I.D. that I created,

41
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:18,739
and if it does, I will use an explicit
intent to open up my settings activity.

42
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,689
Okay, so that's all the basic stuff, but

43
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:24,169
I've got a few more navigation
related quick changes.

44
00:02:24,169 --> 00:02:27,609
I want to make my settings activity
a so-called child activity

45
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:32,930
of my visualizer activity, and that
can be done in the Android manifest.

46
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:37,770
So, down here, I'm going to change this
settings activity so that it now has

47
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,650
a label and it has it's parent activity
defined here as visualizer activity.

48
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:47,250
I'm also going to change the
VisualizerActivity to have a launchMode

49
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,849
which is singleTop.

50
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:52,159
Let's make sure that when you
navigate back from SettingsActivity

51
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:54,180
it doesn't remake
the VisualizerActivity.

52
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,930
Finally, there are few more changes that
I'm going to make in SettingActivity

53
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,379
itself I'm going to override the back
button so that it looks like

54
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:07,669
an up button and so that it goes back to
the main visualizer parent activity and

55
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:09,099
does not exit the app.

56
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:14,479
To do that I will get the action bar and
then If the action bar

57
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,060
is not equal to null,
I'll set DisplayHomeAsUpEnabled.

58
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:23,049
I'm also going to override
the settings menu here to get the ID,

59
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:27,250
check to see if they pressed the home
button and then navigate them up.

60
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,379
Okay, now that we sorted out
the navigation, let's run the app again.

61
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:34,460
Okay, here I am in
the visualizer activity.

62
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:38,770
I'm going to press the menu,
go to the settings activity, and

63
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,090
then I can also navigate back.

64
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,000
Great, so I'll hand you over to
Asir to start fleshing out the rest

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,930
of settings activity.
