1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,540
We definitely need to define 
fragment detail

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,840
in the base layout folder, 
then we override it

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,170
in the layout-land folder, 
so that we can achieve

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,266
this layout on phone 
landscape orientation.

5
00:00:09,266 --> 00:00:12,222
Tablet landscape view would work fine
because of this folder,

6
00:00:12,222 --> 00:00:15,100
but then tablet portrait
would fall back to this layout

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,680
so we should just define it 
in the layout sw600dp folder

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,280
so that all tablets,
regardless of orientation,

9
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,000
use this layout.
