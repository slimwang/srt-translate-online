00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,880
Hopefully this question wasn't too
difficult since list_of_words1

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,884
needs to be equal to the split string1,
we just had it equal to string1.split().

3
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:13,350
And since list_of_words2 needs to
be equal to the split string2,

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,490
we just set it equal to string2.split().

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,400
And there we have it.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,670
Our strings are now converted
into lists of words.
