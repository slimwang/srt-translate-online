1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
It shouldn't be too hard to figure out the answer in this case.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
All you have to do is try these examples that I've got here with these functions.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The one that works is this floor log base 2 of x plus 1.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
If you don't know what the log base 2 of x is, well, that's essentially what it is

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
that we're learning about here.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Log base 2 of x is easy to define for powers of 2.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's just what power of 2 it is.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The log base 2 of x is 0 for 1, 1 for 2, 2 for 4, 3 for 8, and 4 for 16, and so on.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What's happening in this case is the log base 2 of x is something less than 2 up until here.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We round it down. We get these as--

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Well, let's do that. Let's do the floor.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
That gives us 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, and so on.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We need to add 1 to it to capture this notion.
