00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,375
This is our simplified expression, 8a divided by the quantity a plus 5. We can

2
00:00:05,375 --> 00:00:09,947
start factoring the numerator by removing a common factor of 8a from each term.

3
00:00:09,948 --> 00:00:14,870
This leaves us with a second factor of a plus 4. This denominator is actually

4
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,774
identical to the last problem we looked at. The x has been replaced with a. So

5
00:00:18,774 --> 00:00:25,036
we have the same factors, a plus 5 and a plus 4. We just have a instead of x. We

6
00:00:25,036 --> 00:00:29,489
cancel the common factor of a plus four in the numerator and denominator,

7
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:33,634
leaving us with eight a divided by a plus five. Keep in mind these are both

8
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:37,367
positive ones, so we wouldn't need to change anything in terms of signs.

9
00:00:37,368 --> 00:00:41,472
Sometimes our two factors might reduce to negative one. In that case we would

10
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:46,156
need to multiply our expression by a negative one. We would have a negative sign

11
00:00:46,156 --> 00:00:46,813
in front.
