00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,805
Here the correct answers are negative five thirds and positive one third. Great

2
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:08,167
work if you found these two. I know fractions aren't always the easiest to work

3
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:13,175
with but let's see how we got these two answers. FIrst we'll let u equal x plus

4
00:00:13,175 --> 00:00:18,948
one. This will allow us to perform the u substitution in this step so we'll

5
00:00:18,948 --> 00:00:25,788
have 9 u squared mini s6 u minus 8 equals zero... Now that we have a quadratic

6
00:00:25,788 --> 00:00:30,012
expression, we want to find factors of negative 72, the A times the C, that sum

7
00:00:30,012 --> 00:00:37,392
to negative 6 are B value. Those factors are negative 12 and positive 6. So, I

8
00:00:37,392 --> 00:00:42,476
use these two to rewrite the middle term here. We use factoring by grouping to

9
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:48,114
get 3u plus 2 times 3u minus 4 equals to 0. We set each of these factors equal

10
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:52,965
to 0 so we'll have u can equal negative two thirds or u can equal positive four

11
00:00:52,965 --> 00:00:58,586
thirds. Now if you got this far and solved for these values of u great work,

12
00:00:58,586 --> 00:01:02,362
keep in mind though we need to solve for the values of x, the original variable

13
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:08,972
from our equation. We use our two solutions for u, and the fact that u equals x

14
00:01:08,972 --> 00:01:14,794
plus 1, to solve for the original variable x. So, we'll have x plus 1 equals

15
00:01:14,794 --> 00:01:21,132
negative two thirds, and we'll have x plus 1 equals to four thirds. We subtract

16
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:26,248
1 from each side of the two equations to get these statements. Here, we have x

17
00:01:26,248 --> 00:01:31,714
equal to negative two thirds minus 1. So,since I have negative two thirds and

18
00:01:31,714 --> 00:01:36,713
negative 1, I have negative 1 and thirds. This is the mixed number. If I change

19
00:01:36,713 --> 00:01:41,704
it to an improper fraction, I'd have negative five thirds. For the other value

20
00:01:41,704 --> 00:01:46,417
of x, we'll have x equals four thirds minus 1. When I subtract 1, I get to

21
00:01:46,417 --> 00:01:51,035
choose what this 1 looks like. Since I have thirds over here, I want to make

22
00:01:51,035 --> 00:01:56,418
sure that I subtract three thirds, a form of 1, over here. Four thirds minus

23
00:01:56,418 --> 00:02:01,794
three thirds equals one third, and here are our two solutions: negative five

24
00:02:01,794 --> 00:02:04,945
thirds and one third.
