00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay, so why don't we take a look at some bit more famous bugs

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
that kind of fit this basic flowchart.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So let's talk about a bug that happened to the Mars Climate Orbiter.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The Mars Climate Orbiter was sent off to Mars in 1998, and there were some miscommunications,

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
let's say, between NASA and the people they contracted out to which was Lockheed Martin.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And by the time the Mars Climate Orbiter actually got to Mars which was in 1999,

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,000
quite a while later, there had been some problems that caused the orbiter to drift off course enough

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
that it basically ran into a suicide mission and crashed into the Martian atmosphere

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and broke up and crashed in the planet.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What happened was a basic unit error.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,000
See, NASA expected units in metric, for example--meters per second,

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and Lockheed Martin programmed in English units,

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
for example--feet per second and neither of these are wrong.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I mean there are both entirely valid ways to program a rocket and the underlying code

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
was actually correct at least in terms of this bug didn't have anything to do with the underlying code.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But because the NASA software was expecting units in meters per second,

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and the Lockheed Martin software was sending feet per second English units.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That miscommunication caused its drift off that caused the Mars Climate Orbiter

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
to crash into the Martian atmosphere and into the planet.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So why don't we go ahead and turn this into a quiz.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Is this a bug in the software under test that is the actual software of the Mars Climate Orbiter?

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Was it a bug in the acceptability test when they tested the actual software earlier on?

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Was there a bug in the specification, was there actually an underlying bug,

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and how they plan on operating the Mars Climate Orbiter?

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Or is there a bug in the underlying hardware or libraries

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
or compiler or the operating system of the rocket?

27
00:02:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So go ahead and mark your answer here.
