1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,106
Along the way, you've picked up some useful tools for model building and

2
00:00:03,106 --> 00:00:03,760
data analysis.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,440
We've gained some insight in how the amount of data relates to

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,920
accuracy in our models.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,082
We've learned to look for structure in our data.

6
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:18,829
Sometimes, there is no functional relationship in data and

7
00:00:18,829 --> 00:00:22,656
what you're seeing is the simple result of a random process.

8
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:23,456
In which case,

9
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:27,030
the best performing model we can come up with is a fit to that process.

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,770
We've seen how to identify non-linear relationships between variables.

11
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:37,220
Sometimes, these relationships cannot be picked up by linear model tools,

12
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,300
such as linear regression.

13
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,520
We've seen that information gain is a more general and powerful tool for

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,770
identifying relationships.

15
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,750
And finally, we've learned how to quantity and

16
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,270
communicate the uncertainty in our model using confidence bands.
