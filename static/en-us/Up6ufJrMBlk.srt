00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's do another one quiz on BTB and BHT interactions.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,076
Again we have the same BHT, 16 entries and perfect. BTB's four entries and

3
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:12,600
perfect. Same program as before. The question for

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:18,350
you now is how many times do we access the BTB this time for each instruction?

5
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,860
So, how many times, when we fetch this instruction, do we access the BTB.

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,620
How many times, when you fetch this instruction, do we access the BTB,

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:30,540
and so on. Remember that these two instructions execute only once.

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:35,650
This loop has 100 iterations, so all these instructions execute 100 times,

9
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:40,570
except for this one, which executes 101 times. The question for you now is,

10
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,850
how many times do we access the BTB for each of those instructions?
