1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,990
Now let's start here,
with the desktop computer

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:07,560
many of us have spent countless hours
working with to build and use software.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,340
It looks conventional and familiar
only because we've each spent so

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,770
much time with it.

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,200
But something you'll notice about all
these devices when you look at them

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,340
without anything else in the picture.

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,010
It's hard to see the human.

8
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,780
Now one of my favorite thought
experiments is by the VR

9
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,110
pioneer, Jaron Lanier.

10
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,460
You may have heard this before, so
just bear with me for a moment.

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,420
What if aliens came to Earth and people
were nowhere to be found, and what if

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:39,060
these aliens tried to figure out what
we were like based on our computers.

13
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,450
What would they think?

14
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,710
DI mean do we have a hundred and
two fingers and one big eye?

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,710
Now if they look to the hammer,
he'd make more sense.

16
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,730
You can almost see the arm that would
wield this tool and hammer in nails.

17
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:51,890
But this computer?

18
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,150
I mean, just look at that keyboard,
it's not really built for us,

19
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,100
in fact, it's not even built for
us to type fast.

20
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,070
Back when this keyboard
layout was designed,

21
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,900
it was intended to keep
us from typing so fast,

22
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:09,210
that these tight bars would get caught
together and screw everything up.

23
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,880
But this, is what evolved
into the modern keyboard.

24
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,630
Now this is a very physical difference
between a person and a machine.

25
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:20,810
Let's look at a less physical
difference that's just as dangerous.

26
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,610
Now what's wrong with this picture?

27
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:23,620
In many ways,

28
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,920
this is our relationship to technology
today, it gives us a lot of value.

29
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,480
However, we're adapting our lifestyle
to the technology that assists us,

30
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,190
and there's a heavy cost, distraction.

31
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,010
We pay that cost frequently.

32
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,260
But what if we didn't have to?
