1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,200
For our purposes,

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,660
we won't have to work with the most
general satisfiability problem.

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,070
Rather, we can restrict ourselves to
a simpler case, where the boolean

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:13,160
formula has a particular structure
called, conjunctive normal form, or CNF.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,490
Like this one here.

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,270
First, consider the operators.

7
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,880
The v indicates a logical or.

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,840
The wedge indicates a logical and.

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,160
And the bar over top of one of
the variables indicates logical not.

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,750
For one of these formulas we need to
define a collection of variables, x, y,

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,189
and z, in this example.

12
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,860
And these variables appear
in the formula as literals.

13
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,850
A literal can be either a variable,
or the variables negation.

14
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,807
For example this x or this y bar, etc.

15
00:00:43,807 --> 00:00:46,265
At the next higher
level we have clauses,

16
00:00:46,265 --> 00:00:48,880
which are disjunctions of literals.

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,800
You could also say
logical ors of literals.

18
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,720
One clause is what lies in
between a pair of parenthesis.

19
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,310
And finally,

20
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:00,550
we have the formula as a whole,
which is a conjunction of clauses.

21
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,510
That is to say,
all the clauses get anded together.

22
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,850
Thus this whole formula is
in conjunctive normal form.

23
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,590
In general, there can be more than
two clauses that get anded together.

24
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,990
That covers the terms we'll use for
the structure of a CNF formula.

25
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,170
As for satisfiability itself.

26
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,960
We say that a boolean
formula is satisfiable

27
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,900
if there is a truth assignment for
the formula.

28
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,730
A way of assigning variables true and

29
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,560
false such that the formula
evaluates to true.

30
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,030
The CNF satisfiability problem is,

31
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,400
given a CNF formula, determine if that
formula has a satisfying assignment.

32
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,440
Clearly this formula is in NP.

33
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,460
Since given any truth assignment,
it takes time, polynomial, and

34
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,290
the number of literals
to evaluate the formula.

35
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,630
Thus we've accomplished the first part
of showing that satisfiability is

36
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,170
NP complete.

37
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,050
The other part,
showing that every problem in the NP is

38
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,330
polynomial time reducible to it,
will be considerably more difficult.
