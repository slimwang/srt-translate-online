1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,945
First, we divide both sides of our equation by 5, to get x squared equals

2
00:00:03,945 --> 00:00:08,281
positive 6. Next, we take the square root of both sides and we indicate the

3
00:00:08,281 --> 00:00:12,956
plus or minus sign here. This gives us our answer of positive root 6 and

4
00:00:12,956 --> 00:00:17,643
negative root 6. You could have also written the answer like this, root 6,

5
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:22,748
negative root 6. Or switch the order of these 2. So solving this equation isn't

6
00:00:22,748 --> 00:00:26,280
that much harder, you just have new symbol of plus or minus.
