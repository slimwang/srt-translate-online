00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So for the second part of this quiz,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
the question is what multiple of Romania's population

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
is the population of China?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
To solve this, you need to divide the population of China,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
which you can extract from the countries variable,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
by the population of Romania, which you can also extract from the countries variable.
