00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,910
We can make a small adjustment in
our code to prevent excessive churn.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,590
Let's take a look at a comparison view.

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,880
Rather than concatenate one cell value
at a time to build each row, let's use

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,580
a StringBuilder instance, and construct
each row using a single string.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,400
Note that the StringBuilder's
instantiated outside the loop, and

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,050
thus its memory is allocated once.

7
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,960
And then we simply use
it as a buffer for

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,200
each iteration of the loop where we
first clear it, and then we append

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,420
a single string of ints to represent
the row for that loop iteration.

10
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,250
Now see the instructor notes for
more details into this code segment.

11
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,490
All right, now it's time to verify.

12
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,880
You want to go ahead and
load the improved branch of code,

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,240
which is called memory_churn_optimized,
into both trace view and memory monitor

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,690
to confirm we've reduced the amount of
GC's occurring in the short time window.

15
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,620
You may also use allocation
tracker to verify.

16
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,250
If you use allocation tracker, or

17
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,770
if you got something unexpected
in trace view, or memory monitor.

18
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,710
Share a screenshot of your
output in the discussion forums.

19
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:51,920
We're interested in
seeing what you've got.

20
00:00:52,925 --> 00:00:58,715
Now for us, even with these changes,
the Perf pirate still pauses.

21
00:00:58,715 --> 00:00:59,745
But this time for less time.

22
00:01:00,755 --> 00:01:03,365
Now this point, this also might mean
that this function is probably a good

23
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:04,515
candidate to be backgrounded.
