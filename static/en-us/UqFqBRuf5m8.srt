1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,980
Here's the solution that
uses querySelectorAll.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,840
First things first, the class
toggled is toggled on the body.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,119
Then, I look for

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:12,080
every element on the page with
class box, using querySelectorAll.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,900
And then with this clever
iterator i plus equals 2,

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:20,110
I go over every other element in this
list and toggle the class grade.

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:24,760
There's a second parameter here which
should resolve to either true or false.

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,990
It's looking to make sure that
the body contains the class toggled.

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,640
If it doesn't, then don't do this.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,630
But if it does, then do it.

11
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,280
The class gray is pretty simple.

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,650
Gray simply changes
the background color.

13
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,660
So now the selectors
are pretty simple and

14
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,560
all the iteration is
happening with JavaScript.

15
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,290
I want to see how this performs.

16
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,720
I'll hit the Record sign,
click, and then stop recording.

17
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,870
It looks like the action's here,
so I'll zoom in.

18
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,740
Here's the click and
the Recalculate Style is happening

19
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,320
in just under 5 milliseconds,
which is way faster than before.

20
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,260
In this case,

21
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,080
a little bit of JavaScript and
a little bit less CSS went a long way.
