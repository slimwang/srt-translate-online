1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,360
This algorithm performs an all to one
reduce leaving the final result on

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,930
rank zero.

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:09,030
And it works provided
P is a power of two.

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,250
That seems like an annoying restriction
let's see if we can get rid of it.

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,910
When P is not a power of two I
claim you can patch the code

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,160
by inserting something here.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,100
So what I want you to do is come up
with a patch and stick it in there.
