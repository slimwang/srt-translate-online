00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,855
>> So now we have an equation in slope intercept form that takes into account

2
00:00:03,855 --> 00:00:07,631
both that our slope is m and that we have the point s,t on our line. This is

3
00:00:07,631 --> 00:00:11,772
really cool, but I don't think this looks very pretty right now. And you know me

4
00:00:11,772 --> 00:00:15,742
and how I like things in our equations to look pretty. So, let's see if we can

5
00:00:15,742 --> 00:00:19,707
clean it up a little bit. In an effort to make this look a little bit neater,

6
00:00:19,707 --> 00:00:23,737
what happens if we move t from the right hand side of the equation to the left

7
00:00:23,737 --> 00:00:27,903
hand side of the equation? Of course, we need to obey the rules of Algebra. But

8
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:31,809
if I said I only wanted the term with t on the left, what equation would we have

9
00:00:31,809 --> 00:00:32,104
now?
