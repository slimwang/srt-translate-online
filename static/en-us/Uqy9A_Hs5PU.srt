When I say stress I know you know what I'm talking about. Everyday we hear

2
00:00:04,322 --> 00:00:07,074
people talk about how stressful different things are, and the fact is we live

3
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:11,695
in a stressful world. That's why this lesson is so important and relevant to

4
00:00:11,695 --> 00:00:15,165
your everyday life. It's important to understand what stress is and how to

5
00:00:15,165 --> 00:00:18,180
manage our stress levels, because of the psychological and physiological fact

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,230
stress has on us. And we're going to break this lesson into three main chunks.

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,124
First, we'll talk about what stresses psychologically and the physiological

8
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:30,846
effects it has on us. Then we'll talk about different ways to deal with stress

9
00:00:30,846 --> 00:00:34,516
which is what we called coping. And, at the end, we'll talk about how stress

10
00:00:34,516 --> 00:00:36,750
and coping affect our health.
