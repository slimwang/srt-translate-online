If you got this as your polynomial, great work. This question was pretty tricky.

2
00:00:04,384 --> 00:00:08,650
So don't worry if you got it wrong the first time. I've rewritten the like terms

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,820
in this line. And here's the detail that we really need to watch out for. Here

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,091
we have 3m cubed. And here, we have 2m squared. Not like terms. Just because you

5
00:00:17,091 --> 00:00:20,857
see two trinomials. That doesn't mean you should add each term in its

6
00:00:20,857 --> 00:00:25,964
corresponding position together. Sometimes, they're not like terms. When I add

7
00:00:25,964 --> 00:00:28,881
my like terms together, I get this result.
