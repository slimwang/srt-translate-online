00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,060
For this exercise, you need to create a similar scatter

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,850
plot that had friend count mean against age with months. We'll

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:10,320
use ggplot to create our figure. I'll pass age with months

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,570
to x, and I'll pass friend count mean to y. And

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,360
then I just need to remember to wrap this in AES.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,900
Now comes the data frame. I need to be careful that

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,590
I don't use pseudo Facebook users, since I really want this

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,380
data frame that we just created. Now that I've got my

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,310
data frame, I need to subset it. I'll only take the users

10
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,598
whose age with months is less then 71. Then, I'll tell ggplot

11
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:35,372
what type of geom I want, in this case geom live. So

12
00:00:35,372 --> 00:00:39,540
here's our much nosier plot, a friend count mean versus age with months.
