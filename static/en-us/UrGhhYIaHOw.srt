1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We have three answers--we can quickly rule out these because these should be less likely

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
from a loaded coin that's disproportionately heads since they each have more tails than heads.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We can also say that if four heads in a row is sufficient evidence

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
that we have a loaded coin 10 and 20 heads should be two.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So let's just evaluate this for the four heads' case.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So the probability of having four heads in a row from a loaded coin is going to be 0.6561.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Whereas the probability for a fair coin is 0.0625 but remember

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
this just gives us the probability of flips given fair and given loaded.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What is we have to multiply each of these by the probability of fair

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and the probability of loaded and so those are.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So we can see here the probability of having a loaded coin times the probability of the flips

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
given the loaded coin is 0.06561 and the probability of having

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
the same flips with a fair coin times its probability is 0.05625.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Together they are equal to P of flips.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So only one of these divided by that can be greater than 50% so it's going to be the bigger one

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
that's going to be P of loaded, and if P of loaded given flips is greater than 0.5

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
then P of fair must be less.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is true which means this is true and this is true.
