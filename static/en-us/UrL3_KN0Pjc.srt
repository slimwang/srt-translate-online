00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's do something that isn't quite correct semantically but we can do anyhow.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Suppose the null hypothesis is 73,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and with a two-sided test, using a 95% confidence threshold

4
00:00:12,000 --> 99:59:59,999
would we accept or reject the null hypothesis? Just pick one.
