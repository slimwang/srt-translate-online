1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,540
When we do a Fourier transform, all we're doing is computing a basis set.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,740
And I'll show you what I mean by that.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,210
See this ugly, ugly integral here?

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:14,030
Ok, what I've got is, I've got the sine of one function, and

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,460
the sine of another.

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,662
Two different frequencies, a and b.

7
00:00:17,662 --> 00:00:22,390
Okay and I'm integrating this all the way from minus infinite to plus infinite.

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:27,890
And I claim here that it equals zero if a does not equal b.

9
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,470
Now why is that true?

10
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:30,350
Any guesses?

11
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,619
Well let's just think about this intuitively all right?

12
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:35,790
If I have some sinusoid.

13
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,820
And now I've gotta do one of a different frequency.

14
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:38,465
That's easy.

15
00:00:38,465 --> 00:00:41,580
[LAUGH] Boy, that's beautiful, huh?

16
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,240
Essentially, at some point when this is positive and

17
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,930
this is that same positive value, I'm going to try to find,

18
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,140
hopefully there's some positive, I have to make one up.

19
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,180
Yeah, let's pretend the red thing went down here like that a little bit, right?

20
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,750
That when the, the red is same positive.

21
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,080
The yellow was the negative of it.

22
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,470
So the product of those two numbers and then some together is going to

23
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:08,760
cancel each other out and that sort of a hand wavy way of saying that

24
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,800
this entire integral is going to be zero as long as a does not equal b.

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,980
But you might ask what happens when a does equal b?

26
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,000
>> What happens when a does equal b?

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,630
>> Let's start with assuming they're in the same phase, exactly the same phase.

28
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,630
Well, then it's just sine squared.

29
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,880
Sine squared is positive.

30
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,030
Sum that over infinity, what do you get?

31
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,720
You get infinity.

32
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,320
So, if you have two sinusoids that are the same frequency,

33
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,410
you'll get an infinite value.

34
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:39,250
Unless they're perfectly pi over 2 out of phase,

35
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,100
in which case it's going to be 0.

36
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,930
In other words, sine times cosine keep going.

37
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,400
But the bottom line is the way of thinking about this is that the,

38
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,640
if I integrate a function, if it's made up of a sinusoid that's different than

39
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,310
omega, when I take the sine of omega and I do that full interval I get nothing.

40
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,450
But if it's equal to that sine, I would get infinity.

41
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,840
And that's going to be written like this.

42
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,700
So let's just do a simple example.

43
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,186
Suppose I've got a simple function: f of x as cosine of 2 Pi Omegax.

44
00:02:10,186 --> 00:02:11,412
All right?

45
00:02:11,412 --> 00:02:14,720
Well then, let's pick some frequency and

46
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,850
we'll call it u here just keep things simple, right?

47
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:23,150
If I take this integral, okay, that's going to be infinite if u

48
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:27,950
is equal to that same omega, all right, and it's going to be zero otherwise.

49
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,290
So that looks like this, okay?

50
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,530
So we just have these two member impulses.

51
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,590
We just have these two infinite spikes here.

52
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:39,470
And that's referred to as an impulse that corresponds to the cosine.

53
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,900
You see that they're positive this way, and that's because it's cosine.

54
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,900
If we have a sine, because sine of negative x is negative sine of x,

55
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,930
that would look like it would be up here and that would be down there.

56
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,050
That's what the sine is, okay?

57
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,630
That's, and that's kept us the imaginary part.

58
00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:00,280
So we're just computing a basis set of saying how much of this,

59
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,370
sinusoid is in there, all right?

60
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,370
And we can do that for all frequencies.

61
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,310
But then you might ask, well don't we also have to do it for all phases?

62
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,610
>> Don't we also have to do it for all phases?

63
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,130
>> She studied that one.

64
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,250
Well, the short answer is no.

65
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,960
One of the cool things is if I have cosine of omega x and

66
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,850
sine of omega x, right?

67
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,540
So one is 90 degrees or power of two phase out of phase.

68
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,950
I can make any phase by a linear combination of those.

69
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,370
You can show that, it's just true, we can do a little demo.

70
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:37,500
But basically, if I have a sinusoid of any phase, if you just tell me sort of

71
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,570
what its integral is with respect to cosine and what its integral is

72
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:45,020
with respect to sine, I can tell you what the phase of that sinusoid is.
