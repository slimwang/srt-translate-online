The other thing I've introduced here is Named Arguments. The way we've called

2
00:00:03,831 --> 00:00:07,800
functions so far, we just pass in a list to values and they automatically get

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,832
matched up one by one with the names of the parameters of the function that was

4
00:00:11,832 --> 00:00:15,594
defined that we're calling. If we want we can optionally put the names in

5
00:00:15,594 --> 00:00:19,311
ourselves and this looks really like an assignment and that's sort of what it

6
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:23,072
is. We're passing in arg1 that means we're assigning the value to param1 here to

7
00:00:23,072 --> 00:00:27,123
whatever this evaluates to. We'll see having Named Arguments like this becomes

8
00:00:27,123 --> 00:00:30,994
very useful when we define functions with lots of arguments. Some of which might

9
00:00:30,994 --> 00:00:31,503
be optional.
