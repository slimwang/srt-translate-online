2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,180
we need to model any events the internal states respond to.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,450
The most interesting such event is when the clock time reaches the alarm time.

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,566
After all, that's why you have a clock radio, right? You want it to go off in

5
00:00:13,566 --> 00:00:17,900
the morning and wake you up. What response should the the,

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:23,384
the radio, the clock radio have when those times when,

7
00:00:23,384 --> 00:00:27,100
when the clock time reaches the alarm time?
