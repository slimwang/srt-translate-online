1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,250
>> So Isabelle, what input sources did you come up with?

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,882
>> Well the first one would be the light sensor.

3
00:00:04,882 --> 00:00:06,040
>> Got it.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,750
>> The accelerometer, the gyroscope the compass, and the fingerprint reader.

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,360
>> That's a great list. Some Android devices

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,370
have more sensors, some have fewer sensors. But

7
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:16,760
the important thing to note is that, these

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,950
sensors are not available, typically, on web and desktop.

9
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:20,490
>> Exactly.

10
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,830
>> Which is what makes Android such an amazing platform

11
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,590
to create really amazing experiences on. And in the rest

12
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,810
of the lesson, we're going to tell you how

13
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,560
to use these sensors and create really awesome maps.
