1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We apply Newton's Law -- F = m * a.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The mass is 1 kg ; the acceleration is 9.81 m/s².

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So in total, we have about 10 kg times m/s²,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
which is 10 N.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This gives you an idea about this unit of 1 N.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The weight force of a mass of 100 g

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,690
is almost equal to 1 N.
