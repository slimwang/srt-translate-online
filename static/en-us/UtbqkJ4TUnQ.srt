00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,870
One of the easiest things you can do,
to contain the table in the view port.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,570
Is to wrap it in a div.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,240
And set the width to 100%.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,660
And overflow x to auto.

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,950
Then, instead of breaking
out of the view port.

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,800
The table will instead,
take up the same width.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,410
But will scroll within the view port.
