1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,700
So now let's talk about how to reduce the waste,

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,140
how to have fewer than 2 to the nth counters

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,460
and yet have a long history. So, we will talk

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,116
about the history-based predictor with shared counters. So again, the

5
00:00:13,116 --> 00:00:16,379
motivation for this is that with N-bit history, the way

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,760
we've just seen it, we will need 2 to the

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,548
nth counters per entry, if we want to do things the

8
00:00:21,548 --> 00:00:26,400
way we've just done them. And we also know that

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,590
for repeating patterns, only about N counters out of 2

10
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,409
to the N are really used. In reality we are

11
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:35,450
using about N plus 1, but basically the important thing

12
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,950
is that we are using the number of counters that is

13
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,917
proportional to the size of the history. But we need

14
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:43,500
to have 2 to the nth counters, because we don't

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,270
know which histories will be important. So the idea here

16
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:51,680
is to share these two-bit counters between entries instead of dedicating

17
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,350
2 to the nth two bit counters to each entry.

18
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,660
We will have a pool of two bit counters that

19
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,828
entries will then use, but it is possible that different

20
00:00:59,828 --> 00:01:03,854
entries with different program counters and different histories end up

21
00:01:03,854 --> 00:01:06,331
using the same two bit counter. So there is a

22
00:01:06,331 --> 00:01:09,386
possibility of conflict, but if we have enough of these

23
00:01:09,386 --> 00:01:12,831
two bit counters, because each entry really doesn't need too

24
00:01:12,831 --> 00:01:15,790
many of them usually, we will have very few conflicts
