1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
US cash definitely has universally recognized value.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
At least in the US, essentially everyone accepts it,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
but even in other parts of the world, many people accept US cash.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It is easy to transfer.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You don't need to go to a bank or even interact with a bank in order to be able

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
to transfer cash between individuals.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's sort of anonymous and untraceable--and I didn't check this one.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's definitely not designed to be untraceable.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Each bill has a unique number in it, and you could trace that number.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's untraceable in practice, because people don't tend to record those bill numbers,

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
but it's not untraceable technically.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's certainly the case when banks are robbed, and there's a sequence of bills

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
that were marked in the same order,

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
that's one of the ways those bills might be detected.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's not light and portable. The largest currency in the US is a $100.00 bill.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
That weighs the same as a $1.00 bill, which weighs about a third of a gram.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That means if you can carry 1 kilogram, that's only 2740 bills,

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
which would be over a quarter million dollars--

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
not a bad amount of money for an individual to carry around,

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
but it certainly could become a factor if you're talking about large corporate transactions

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
where 1 kilogram weighs a quarter of a million dollars.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This is one of many reasons why very few large cash transactions are done

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and you see scenes in movies were someone needs a whole briefcase full of money

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
in order to do things.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The last question is whether it's hard to copy or forge,

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and I think the answer to this is also really no. It's just paper.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The reason that it works is that the penalties for getting caught copying or forging are high.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The real answer is that it is hard to copy or forge in large quantities without getting caught.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Enforcement of counterfeiting is taken very seriously.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's done by the Secret Service that's also responsible for protecting the president.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The only people who can get away with forging US currency in large quantities,

32
00:01:59,000 --> 99:59:59,999
are hostile countries where US law doesn't reach.
