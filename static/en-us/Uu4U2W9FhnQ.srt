1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,480
You're now ready for lesson three.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,740
In lesson three we're going to use
a new API called The Movie Database

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,570
to build the My Favorite Movies app.

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:08,980
This app will let users select and

5
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,200
mark their favorite movies from
a few popular movie genres.

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,520
To build the app we're going to
cover a topic of growing importance,

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,340
authentication and security.

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,590
Well let's see how it works first.

9
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:20,800
When I launch the app,

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,830
I log in and then I select from one
of the movie genres here below.

11
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:29,150
Then I can select a movie, and
I can add it to my favorites list.

12
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,400
And if I go to Favorites, there it is.

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,920
So join me in lesson three as we
build the My Favorite Movies app.
