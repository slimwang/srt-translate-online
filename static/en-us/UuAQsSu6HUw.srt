1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,620
In sort of a related way,

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,120
there's a lot of technology these days involving object recognition.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,220
So there was this company.

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,170
There is this company, Evolution Robotics, that had developed this thing called

5
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,500
Lane Hawk, which basically prevented some of you.

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,490
None of you.

7
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,790
From putting stuff on the bottom of a basket and

8
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,130
then wheeling it out and forgetting to mention to the cashier that it was there.

9
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,180
This is actually a huge problem.

10
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,790
And the system, you can see the camera here.

11
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,142
Right, see, that's a camera down here, looking at this.

12
00:00:27,142 --> 00:00:30,722
I wonder if we're going to have to, like, erase that that's a beer.

13
00:00:30,722 --> 00:00:31,990
Yeah, you see, now nobody can see.

14
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,400
Okay, you can't tell what that is.

15
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,580
Okay. And it can detect what that is, which is not only pretty cool.

16
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,190
But if you go on their website they'll tell you that five years later,

17
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,460
that product was bought by a different company.

18
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,860
So, there's money to be made in computer vision.

19
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,590
Go do a really cool startup.

20
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,890
Object recognition used to require a lot of computing power.

21
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,810
It's, the computing power has gotten smaller.

22
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,240
And it allows us to now operate in smaller packages.

23
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,390
So, there's this whole area of augmented reality and

24
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,640
object recognition by mobile devices.

25
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,870
So, here's a system of where you, you're showing it a picture of this statue.

26
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,790
It recognizes who this is and what the monument is.

27
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:08,690
And here's an old picture from Nokia, where you can actually go off to the web,

28
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,160
pull out information and display it to you.

29
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,150
So for a while we were talking about doing this on smart phones,

30
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,640
now it sits on your face.

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,660
This is Professor Thad Starner, a Georgia Tech professor as well.

32
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,710
He was instrumental in the developement of Google Glass.

33
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,640
And one of the things that Glass does is you've got a camera looking out of

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,800
what you're seeing.

35
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,800
And can, through the same object recognition methods,

36
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,810
can give you information about what you're looking at.

37
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,850
And this is also part of computer vision.
