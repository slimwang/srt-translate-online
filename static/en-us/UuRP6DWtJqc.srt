1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,850
In this introduction, we've covered what
machine learning is and what it can do.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,850
We've covered how to evaluate whether or
not you're ready, and

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,450
what you're going to cover
over the next several months.

4
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,030
Now it's time to get started.

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,620
In the introduction to this Nanodegree
we're going to cover some of the big

6
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,780
picture ideas in machine learning.

7
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,110
You're going to hear
from Charles Isabel and

8
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,450
Michael Littman's
machine learning class.

9
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,640
You're going to hear from
Sebastian Thrun's intro to machine

10
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,700
learning class.

11
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,810
You'll hear from Ashok Goyal and

12
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,740
my knowledge based artificial
intelligence class.

13
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,680
These are all materials meant to
give you a big picture view about

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,210
what machine learning is and
what it can do.

15
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,890
And that's really the learning goal for

16
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,950
this particular unit of
this Nanodegree program.

17
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,230
You don't yet need to worry about
how you do machine learning.

18
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,340
You need to start off with
understanding of what machine learning

19
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,860
actually can do.

20
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,810
So, try and
focus on what machine learning can do in

21
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:42,860
these first few videos.
