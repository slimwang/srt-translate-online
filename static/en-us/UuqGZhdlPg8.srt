00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,900
We've given you codes for the beginnings
of a weather provider class within

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,800
the data package that
extends content provider.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,330
One of the tools that Android provides
to help write a content provider

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,105
is a UriMatcher,
which we are going to write shortly.

5
00:00:14,105 --> 00:00:19,215
Filling out a UriMatcher is the third
step in building our content provider.

6
00:00:19,215 --> 00:00:21,925
Content providers implement
functionality based upon

7
00:00:21,925 --> 00:00:23,905
URIs passed to them.

8
00:00:23,905 --> 00:00:27,232
Our content provider will
implement four types of URIs.

9
00:00:27,232 --> 00:00:30,692
Each one of these URIs will be used to
execute different types of operations

10
00:00:30,692 --> 00:00:34,122
against the underlying SQL databases.

11
00:00:34,122 --> 00:00:35,752
For ease of implementation,

12
00:00:35,752 --> 00:00:40,490
content providers typically tie each URI
type internally to an integer constant.

13
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,960
These integer constants have already
been added to the provided weather

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,640
provider class.

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,750
Android provides a UriMatcher
class to help match incoming URIs

16
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,380
to the content provider
integer constants.

17
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,110
This is important because we need to
have a way of knowing which type of URI

18
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:00,130
is passed into our content provider so
we can perform the requested operation.

19
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,660
Once we have the integer constants,

20
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,105
we can easily use them
in switch statements.

21
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:08,670
UriMatcher provides for an expression
syntax to match various URIs that

22
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,290
works a bit like regular expressions.

23
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,180
Hash symbols will match a number.

24
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,240
And an asterisk will match any string.

25
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,360
Here are some examples
