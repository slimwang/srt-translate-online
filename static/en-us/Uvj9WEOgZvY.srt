00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,890
Tap targets should be bigger
than the average finger.

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,130
So, to ensure that all of your
elements are at least that size,

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:13,720
add min width 48 pixels, and min height
48 pixels, to every tappable element.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,720
Simply using width and height,

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,020
alone can be a little dangerous,
because it won't allow the element to

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,130
resize if the content inside of
it is bigger than the container.
