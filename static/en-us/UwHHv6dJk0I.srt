1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,460
We can use Tag Manager to publish the
daily special in different languages.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,140
Not everyone speaks English after all.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,380
I'll show you the process and
then you will do it.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,170
Let's take a look at the built
in variables in Tag Manager.

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,890
Go to variables, and

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,020
you see them grouped by application,
utilities, and device.

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,640
We'll be using the language variable.

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:25,300
Make sure that it's selected,
the little check box is green.

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,473
We're going to use the language built
in variable to define a trigger that

10
00:00:30,473 --> 00:00:33,452
determines which version of
the daily special to show.

11
00:00:33,452 --> 00:00:38,966
[FOREIGN].

12
00:00:38,966 --> 00:00:43,965
So next rename the daily special
variable to daily-special-en,

13
00:00:43,965 --> 00:00:47,910
because it's going to
have the English version.

14
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,510
So the name of the variable is just for
your use.

15
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,110
The code doesn't refer
to the name of variable.

16
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:58,280
What the code refers to is the key in
the value that you've configured for

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,010
the variable.

18
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,110
So, here it's daily-special,
and we can't change that.

19
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,170
Then create a custom
trigger by clicking Custom.

20
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,848
Click New.

21
00:01:07,848 --> 00:01:11,910
And we're going to call the trigger,
english-trigger.

22
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,170
So it's a custom event, and that's fine.

23
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,000
Here in Fire On, in this first menu,

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,040
you see a list of the built in
variables that were enabled.

25
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,930
So go ahead and choose Language,
and then in this middle field,

26
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,360
we don't want it to be contained.

27
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,919
Just set it to equals.

28
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,410
And over here, the last field enter en.

29
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,870
If you wanted more rules for
the trigger, you'd enter plus and

30
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,450
add then but
we're not going to do that right now.

31
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,460
And then save the trigger.

32
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,339
And down here,
click the X to delete Always

33
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,530
because we don't want to use
this trigger Always any longer.

34
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,810
We only want to use it when
the user's device is set to English.

35
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,470
And save the variable.

36
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,400
So over here in the trigger screen,
we see the english-trigger.

37
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,200
Now make a copy of it, and

38
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,080
rename the copy the french-trigger.

39
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,540
And in this case we want it to
fire when the language equals fr.

40
00:02:19,713 --> 00:02:20,780
And Save Trigger.

41
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,540
Now we have two Triggers.

42
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:31,727
Now back in the variables screen, make
a copy of the daily-special-en variable.

43
00:02:31,727 --> 00:02:39,180
Copy it, call the copy daily-special-fr.

44
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,040
This variable's going to hold
the French Daily special, so

45
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,360
we need a French translation.

46
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,167
So copy the value.

47
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:51,329
If you speak French, obviously just go
ahead and translate it, but otherwise

48
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:54,940
copy the value and go to Google
Translate to translate it to French.

49
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,480
I'm going to copy this and
go back to Tag Manager.

50
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,530
So, you have to leave
the daily special as it is.

51
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,060
Don't translate the key, just the value.

52
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,810
The one thing to notice here is that
my menu included the word d'epice.

53
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,481
And it has a d'.

54
00:03:14,481 --> 00:03:17,295
These kind of apostrophes
show a plush in French but

55
00:03:17,295 --> 00:03:19,820
here is the value of the variable.

56
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:24,660
This apostrophe's actually going to
be interpreted as the closing

57
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,100
delimiter of this string.

58
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,360
So we need to escape
the apostrophe with a backslash.

59
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,622
Oh, and there's another one, [FOREIGN].

60
00:03:36,622 --> 00:03:39,312
Now see the innate,
it says Enable When english-trigger,

61
00:03:39,312 --> 00:03:41,270
well we don't want that.

62
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:44,840
We want the french-trigger,
not the english-trigger.

63
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,360
And now, Create Variable.

64
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:51,980
So, to summarize,
I've got two variables, one for English,

65
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,500
one for French.

66
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,320
And I've got two triggers, one for
English and one for French.

67
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,438
We have the English and
French versions of the daily special.

68
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:03,070
And we've defined triggers for
each language.

69
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,750
Got to publish the changes.

70
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,910
Now it's your turn.

71
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:12,920
Make sure that in the built in
variables, that language is selected.

72
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,108
Then go to the variables screen and

73
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:19,956
rename the daily special
variable to daily-special-en.

74
00:04:19,956 --> 00:04:24,129
And while you're editing
the daily-special-en variable,

75
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:29,220
create the english-trigger and
delete the Always trigger.

76
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,585
Create the french-trigger,
create the daily-special-fr variable and

77
00:04:34,585 --> 00:04:38,200
get the french translation
of your daily special.

78
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,060
Don't forget to publish your changes.

79
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,090
Strangely enough,
that's an easy one to forget to do.

80
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,790
So go ahead and do these steps.

81
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:52,290
Check boxes as you go and then in
the next video, we'll try it out.
