1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,440
This app was built using the animate
camera method that you saw in

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,930
the previous video.

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:06,450
Note that it has three buttons,

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,890
just like in a previous
application that you built, and

5
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,570
each of these buttons animates map
movement to a different location.

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,410
So, for example, I'm now looking
at a map of the United States, but

7
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,610
if I tap on Seattle you see
the camera is going to animate.

8
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:22,260
As I zoom into Seattle,
taking a few seconds to do so.

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,390
It's a really cool effect.

10
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,861
So once I'm in on Seattle, there you
can see some of Seattle, including,

11
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:32,522
you can even see here an indoor map of
the Pacific Science Center in Seattle.

12
00:00:32,522 --> 00:00:35,289
I can for example then touch on Tokyo.

13
00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:39,076
And you'll see I'll fly up and
out into orbit, and

14
00:00:39,076 --> 00:00:44,700
then back down over the Pacific
until I land on Tokyo, like so.

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,248
And again,
you can see I'm now in downtown Tokyo.

16
00:00:47,248 --> 00:00:50,545
And if I so desire,
I can also go to Dublin.

17
00:00:50,545 --> 00:00:53,878
Now here there's a case of I haven't
pre-cached some of these tiles, so

18
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:56,840
you're just seeing blank
as it's flying over.

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,990
And it'll soon land on Dublin.

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,900
So if I zoom out of Dublin, you can
see those tiles are getting cached.

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,190
So none of these tiles were
pre-cached for testing the video,

22
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:11,200
and that's why we couldn't see
when we flew from Tokyo to Dublin.

23
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,210
If I just zoom out and
effectively cache the tiles,

24
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,700
I'm not doing anything
myself to cache them.

25
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,410
This is just how
the application is running.

26
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:24,410
And so the map fragment itself
will cache the tiles for you.

27
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:29,051
So here you can see Japan, and
if I go back somewhere over Ireland and

28
00:01:29,051 --> 00:01:33,366
now I tap on Tokyo, you'll see
that the orbit will change, and

29
00:01:33,366 --> 00:01:35,332
I'll drop down onto Tokyo.

30
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:44,173
And now if I try to go to Dublin,
you'll see I fly out of Japan,

31
00:01:44,173 --> 00:01:47,701
up over the surface of the Earth,
over Asia, over China,

32
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:51,600
back over western Europe before
dropping down and onto Dublin.

33
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,500
So you know have everything you need
to build this application yourself.

34
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,670
You've all the tools.

35
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,370
Why don't you give it a shot?

36
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,070
If you have any trouble, the source
code is linked to the speaker nodes.
