1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,690
Check it out,
this is me completing the exercise.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:07,100
On the left side I'm typing without
using keyboard shortcuts and on

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,710
the right side I'm doing the same thing,
but this time with keyboard shortcuts.

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:15,690
Notice how much faster I am on the right
side using keyboard shortcuts.

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,140
On the right side I'm almost done and
on the left side I've hardly started.

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,490
If I speed this up,
you can see it took me only1 minute and

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,860
38 seconds to complete the exercise
with keyboard shortcuts.

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,689
But on the left side
I'm still typing away.

9
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:33,260
If I fast forward to the end it took
me another 84 seconds to finish

10
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,100
the exercise without keyboard shortcuts.

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,769
That's a huge difference.

12
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,220
By using keyboard shortcuts you will no
doubt increase the amount of code you

13
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,379
can write in a given period of time.

14
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,280
And as you continue to practice and

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,670
adopt more keyboard shortcuts
you will only improve.
