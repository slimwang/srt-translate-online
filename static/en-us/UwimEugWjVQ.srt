1
00:00:00,602 --> 00:00:03,990
Requirement 6 recall, says, "Books are checked out for three weeks unless they

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:09,490
are currently bestsellers, in which case the limit is two weeks." Okay, what's

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:14,980
happening a key that points to an issue here is that they're explicit numbers.

4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,880
And if they're explicit numbers then typically that means there has to be some

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,950
kind of a check. And if there's a check, where you going to express the check

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,570
okay. It turns out that UML provides a way to express requirements like this and

7
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,960
associate them with elements of the diagram, and this part of UML is called

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,050
the Object Constraint Language, or OCL. It's an official part of the language.

9
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:44,090
It's available and supported by tools, including drawing tools

10
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:49,300
that you can then annotate various parts of the diagram with, with the OCL.

11
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:54,720
It provides, that is OCL provides sufficient expressive power

12
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,890
to convey to any level of detail the functional requirements of a system because

13
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:03,080
it's essentially equivalent. In power to the first order of logic,

14
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:08,570
okay? So, let's see how we would express Requirement six using OCL
