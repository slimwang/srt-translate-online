Hi everyone, it's Jared.

2
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:05,359
I'm going to be joining you
this weekend for iOS Things.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,750
Let's take a peek into the future and

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,129
see the final version of the app
you'll be building with Firebase.

5
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,120
This is Friendly Chat.

6
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:14,969
Friendly Chat is a chat app that allows
you to chat with friends in real-time

7
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,400
and send texts and photo messages.

8
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:21,089
So as we can see, we're logged in to
the main Friendly Chat interface, and

9
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:24,300
there are a few text messages
as well as some photo messages.

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,958
I'm going to go ahead and
send a message myself right now.

11
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:31,042
[BLANK_AUDIO]

12
00:00:31,042 --> 00:00:32,804
And this is sent in real-time, but

13
00:00:32,804 --> 00:00:36,447
it'd be even cooler to show that I can
send a message from another device or

14
00:00:36,447 --> 00:00:40,650
another simulator, and have it appear
here in my simulator in real-time.

15
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:41,729
So I'm going to go off screen.

16
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:45,479
You're not going to see this step, and
send a message from another simulator.

17
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,729
And we should see it populate here.

18
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,390
Awesome, and there it is.

19
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,579
Now, this isn't the only screen.

20
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:55,125
Let me log out and
show you the log in screen.

21
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:57,774
On the login screen,
we'll be working with various

22
00:00:57,774 --> 00:01:01,155
ways to authorize ourselves
to use the Friendly Chat app.

23
00:01:01,155 --> 00:01:05,015
And we can log in with just a regular
email, or even with Google.

24
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:05,864
And that's Friendly Chat.
