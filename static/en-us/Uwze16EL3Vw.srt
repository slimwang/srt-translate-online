1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:05,070
If you follow the stock market, you may
have noticed that when news comes out

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:09,520
about a particular company its stock
price can change considerably.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,740
Why is that?

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,630
Well, the stock price is of course
the main mechanism by which

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:22,500
investors can essentially let
their view of the stock be known.

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,180
In other words, If they think
that the company is buying less,

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,990
they're going to sell and
the prices are going to go down.

8
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:34,030
If investors think the value
of the company should go up,

9
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,530
they're going to buy the stock and
the prices are going to go up.

10
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,440
Now, why is it that this information or
news affects the stock price.

11
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,890
It's based on these things that we've
covered up to now in the lesson.

12
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:50,250
In other words intrinsic value,
book value, and

13
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,320
well of course, market capitalization.

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,120
But let's take a look at how it affects,
say, intrinsic value.

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,970
Consider a company run by this CEO and
assume for the moment,

16
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:09,720
that his business, his company,
is to grow and sell coconuts.

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,630
What if the following news comes out?

18
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,326
The CEO is ill.

19
00:01:13,326 --> 00:01:18,090
Maybe he has cancer, maybe he has
something else that prevents him

20
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,780
from collecting those coconuts as
effectively as he might otherwise do.

21
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:28,370
Well, certainly that should affect
the stock price downward because

22
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:34,210
the probability that we are going to get
dividends in the future is decreasing.

23
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:38,000
Either that or the amount of
the dividends is going to decrease.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,429
So, if you think back to the intrinsic
valuation that we talked about.

25
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,640
The potential for

26
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:49,310
reduced future dividends reduces
the value of the company significantly.

27
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,510
Now consider another scenario
where's there's an island

28
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:56,120
with our original company and
another company.

29
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,909
And news comes out about the soil
on the island being contaminated.

30
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,350
That news is going to affect not
only our original company, but

31
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,110
also all the other
companies on the island.

32
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,130
So you can think of this sort
of news as being sector news.

33
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:18,450
In other words it relates to the sector
of growing coconuts on this island and

34
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,240
it affects all the companies
in this sector.

35
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,010
Lets consider one last
scenario were we have many

36
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,830
islands with many
companies on those islands.

37
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,250
And news that might effect all
of them like sea level rising,

38
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,720
that is going to negatively
impact all of these companies.

39
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,080
So we have examples here of
companies specific news that affects

40
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,731
the price of an individual company.

41
00:02:42,731 --> 00:02:46,050
Sector-specific news that effects, say,

42
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,880
the companies on a particular island or
in a particular industrial segment.

43
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,620
And market-wide news that affects
all the companies in the market.

44
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,980
So that's how news can effect
the prices of the stock.

45
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:06,080
Primarily because they reduce
the expectation of future dividends.

46
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,210
We've seen how that can affect
the intrinsic value and

47
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:13,580
accordingly, why people would
want to pay less for that stock.
