1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,510
The first one says,
we are traversing the ACL and

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:08,800
we run into an ACE that says, this user
does have access to this resource.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,660
You can stop right there.

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,795
So this talking about termination
of traversal that we are doing.

5
00:00:13,795 --> 00:00:15,960
Saying, you stop right there and

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,940
grant access to the user
who's making the request.

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,580
Oh, this is not correct, because we
said, there is a possibility that there

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,820
is another ACE that
contains a negative access.

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,380
So we said all students has positive,
Alice had negative, so

10
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,720
then we have to go to
Alice's ACE as well.

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,280
So we can't stop at the first one,
positive one that we run into.

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,550
So this one, is not a correct answer.

13
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,300
The next one, a negative or
deny ACE is found,

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,740
you actually can stop right there
because negative takes precedence.

15
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,262
If there's a negative ACE, then maybe
a positive somebody else in the list,

16
00:00:49,262 --> 00:00:50,570
it doesn't matter, okay?

17
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,700
Because this is going to
take precedence anyway.

18
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,300
Or, sometimes we may have
to traverse unless use or

19
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,960
implement a list in a smart fashion,
that actually Windows does do that.

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,019
But and it does that by putting negative
ACE's in the front of the list.

21
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,300
But if you don't do that optimization or
that smart thing that I just mentioned,

22
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:12,270
then you have to actually traverse the
entire list to make sure that there is

23
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,830
no negative or
deny access ACE anywhere in the list.
