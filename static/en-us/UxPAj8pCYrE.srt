00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,666
Here is an example from UML. It concerns a a machine,

2
00:00:04,666 --> 00:00:10,075
that's either heating or cooling. It's some kind of air-conditioning system.

3
00:00:10,075 --> 00:00:16,081
And on the lower right is a nested state called heating.

4
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:20,632
Heating is just a two state sub-system.

5
00:00:20,632 --> 00:00:23,976
One of the states is activating, and the others is called act,

6
00:00:23,976 --> 00:00:29,160
active. Okay, it's got a default state which is the activating state, and

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,630
it's got a transition which occurs when the activating is ready.

8
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,680
And it the action that takes place is to, to turn things on.

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,630
This nested state is part of the larger system, which at the top

10
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:50,010
level has three important states. It has an idol state, a cooling state, and

11
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,850
this nested heating state. The default state for the larger machine is idle, and

12
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:01,387
the final state is a shutdown state. And there are transitions

13
00:01:01,387 --> 00:01:06,820
between the various outer states. But notice also the transitions that

14
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,780
from the nested heating state, go only to the boundary of that state and

15
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:19,670
not into the internals of that state. Thereby saving duplicate copies

16
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,980
of the lines coming from each of the internal states in the heating state.
