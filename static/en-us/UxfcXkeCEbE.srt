Here the answers were negative 3 plus or minus 5i, imaginary solutions. We

2
00:00:05,066 --> 00:00:09,098
start by simply completing the square, we have our x squared term here and our

3
00:00:09,098 --> 00:00:14,385
x term here. The b value is positive 6, so we find b over 2 which is 3 and then

4
00:00:14,385 --> 00:00:19,394
square this which is 9. We add 9 to both sides of our equation, so that way we

5
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:24,342
can complete the square on this side. We rewrite our trinominal as the quantity

6
00:00:24,342 --> 00:00:29,720
x plus 3 squared, and then add these two together to get negative 25. We use

7
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,945
our square root method to take the square root of both sides. So x plus 3 can

8
00:00:33,945 --> 00:00:38,684
equal positive or negative 5i. Keep in mind we have a negative radicant here,

9
00:00:38,684 --> 00:00:43,942
so the square root of 25 is 5 and the square root of negative 1 is i. And,

10
00:00:43,942 --> 00:00:47,281
finally, to solve for x, we simply subtract 3 from both sides to get our final

11
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:48,650
answers.
