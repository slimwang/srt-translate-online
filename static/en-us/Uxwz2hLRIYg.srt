There are many ways you could have answered this correctly.

00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,710
This is just the approach that I took. A warehouse

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:08,550
app could begin with a warehouse object. It would also

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,690
have an object called items. This would have fields like

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:16,990
item name, price, description, etcetera. Each record would be an

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,020
individual item. I would create a one to many relationship

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,910
between warehouse and items. Which would let me add a

8
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,800
role of summary field to my warehouse object. It could

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,890
keep track of the total number of items I have.
