1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,330
I chose to also ask a machine
learning question because

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,640
machine learning is a very big part of
data science and any data analyst job.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,700
And it presents some unique,
some inequalities, right.

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,920
When you're trying to solve
a machine learning problem,

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,910
you really have to
think about how to make

6
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:26,530
that problem I'm presenting the way that
a computer can actually learn from it.

7
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,010
And that is something that
is not very easy to do.

8
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,701
You definitely need to understand
what machine learning is.

9
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,761
And also have that wit to come
up with the right features, and

10
00:00:37,761 --> 00:00:39,926
that's what I'm looking for, that wit.

11
00:00:39,926 --> 00:00:45,900
So in her case, she immediately
came up with one of the features.

12
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,890
Her first feature was whether
this person had received an email

13
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:50,550
from the same person.

14
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,930
That is an excellent feature, and
that's exactly what I'm looking for, for

15
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,640
the user to come up with
a good set of features,

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,990
which don't have to be
excellent by the way.

17
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:03,100
I just really want the person to be
able to come up with a couple features.

18
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:08,010
I want that ability to convert
a thought into a number.

19
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,900
And I also want a couple
of them to be really witty.

20
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,410
And a couple I mean one or two,

21
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:16,170
like the case of whether this person
had received an email from them before.

22
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,147
After coming up with some features,
then I asked her about what algorithms

23
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:26,045
she would use to fit this, what machine
elements she will use to interpret

24
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:30,850
these features and
actually come up with a classification.

25
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:36,439
I think this is a tricky
part of the question because

26
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:44,000
in this question I'm actually looking
to test her in machine learning.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,009
I think this was the point
in the activity where she

28
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:54,017
struggled the most because the trick is,
right,

29
00:01:54,017 --> 00:01:59,540
and I think she came up with
a quick algorithm first.

30
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,980
She said nine-based algorithm, and

31
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:07,800
this algorithm is a very,
very simple algorithm.

32
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,163
There's maybe not too much to talk
about when you have a nine base.

33
00:02:12,163 --> 00:02:14,498
Yeah, so then I asked her to try
to come up with something deeper,

34
00:02:14,498 --> 00:02:15,523
I was looking for anything.

35
00:02:15,523 --> 00:02:17,696
Actually, it doesn't have
to be anything too deep.

36
00:02:17,696 --> 00:02:21,697
Right from the beginning I was looking
for anything that sounded like logistic

37
00:02:21,697 --> 00:02:24,499
regression which is one of
the most basic algorithms.

38
00:02:24,499 --> 00:02:26,929
She said support vector machines,

39
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:30,984
which are an excellent
classification algorithm as well.

40
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,024
I think the part where it was
a little bit problematic for

41
00:02:34,024 --> 00:02:36,547
her is that she said
support vector machines,

42
00:02:36,547 --> 00:02:40,445
but maybe wasn't completely familiar
with support vector machines.

43
00:02:40,445 --> 00:02:45,102
And my recommendation to anybody doing
a machine learning question is to almost

44
00:02:45,102 --> 00:02:49,829
never mention an algorithm that you're
not very familiar about because you're

45
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:52,830
definitely going to start
getting tested on this.

46
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,550
The algorithm portion of the machine
learning question is usually a test,

47
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,750
more than a thought process.

48
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:03,750
And I think that's the part
that gives trouble the most.

49
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,470
But definitely be familiar with
whatever shape or algorithms you

50
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:10,030
suggest you will be using, or
you have used in your projects.

51
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,110
It definitely correlates with
the first question where I asked here

52
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,360
what is the project that you worked on?

53
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,656
If you used an algorithm
in that project,

54
00:03:19,656 --> 00:03:21,810
you should definitely be very
familiar with how it works
