1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:03,400
As always we're going to
start with a hand simulation.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,450
I'm going to look at line one first.

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:09,360
So, we declared a new variable called
raspberryPrice and set it to 5.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,138
Okay, now this one's a little bit
interesting in that we have three

5
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:17,000
display areas this time,
display1, display2, and display3.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,490
And we're just going to pretend that
there's three different text boxes.

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,351
Okay, so in text box 1 we're
going to display 1 box: $ and

8
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:31,120
then whatever the current value
of raspberryPrice is, which is 5.

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:36,801
Okay, in the next display area, we're
going to say 2 boxes: $ the current

10
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:42,500
value of raspberryPrice, 5, multiplied
by 2, which is going to be 10.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:48,208
And in the third text box
we're going to say 3 boxes: $,

12
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:55,267
the current value of raspberryPrice
times 3, it's going to be 15.

13
00:00:55,267 --> 00:01:00,866
So again, this is going to
print 1 box: $5, 2 boxes: $10.

14
00:01:00,866 --> 00:01:03,967
It doesn't print any of this math,
it just prints the end value.

15
00:01:03,967 --> 00:01:06,544
And then 3 boxes: $15.

16
00:01:06,544 --> 00:01:11,430
And since raspberries are $5 a box,
well, that seems to work out.

17
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,570
So it looks like this code
is correct in this case.

18
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,920
There's one important thing
that I want you to note though,

19
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,950
which is really that there's only one
way to change the value of a variable,

20
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,400
and that's using
the assignment operator.

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,460
In these cases where we're
displaying some sort of math,

22
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,470
we're not actually changing
the value of raspberryPrice.

23
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,050
So throughout this program, the value
of raspberryPrice remains at 5,

24
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,750
even though we're printing 10 and 15.

25
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,980
That's because we're not using the
assignment operator anywhere but here.

26
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,380
All right,
let's look at the next question.
