00:00:00,175 --> 00:00:04,420
Let's do another quiz on locality
this time about spacial locality.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:09,120
If we have the same code as in
the previous quiz, and the question now

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,790
is which of these memory locations
has spacial locality in this code?

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,180
Check all of those that do.
