1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,163
The answers are, from left to right, parallel, neither, perpendicular, and

2
00:00:05,175 --> 00:00:10,123
perpendicular. We can see right off the bat that for the first pair of lines,

3
00:00:10,236 --> 00:00:15,208
they have the same slope, 3. In the second pair of lines, it might at first look

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:20,624
you have similar situation, but because of this coefficient of 7 in front of our

5
00:00:20,636 --> 00:00:26,830
y term in the 2nd equation, we actually end up seeing that we have a slope of 3

6
00:00:26,842 --> 00:00:33,479
over 7 when we divide both sides by 7. So these lines are not parallel, nor are

7
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:38,852
they perpendicular. For the third pair, negative 3 times 1/3 is negative 1. Or

8
00:00:38,864 --> 00:00:44,379
equivalently, 1/3 is equal to negative 1 over negative 3. Either way you look at

9
00:00:44,391 --> 00:00:48,962
it, these lines are perpendicular. And last but not least, to figure out the

10
00:00:48,974 --> 00:00:53,636
slope of this top of this equation, you need to divide both sides by two, which

11
00:00:53,648 --> 00:00:58,599
gives us a slope of 1/2. In the second equation you see a coefficient in from of

12
00:00:58,611 --> 00:01:05,999
the x term, of negative 2, and negative 1 over negative 2 is equal to 1/2. So

13
00:01:06,011 --> 00:01:09,256
these two lines are perpendicular.
