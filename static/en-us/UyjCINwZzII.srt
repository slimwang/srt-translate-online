Of course, I will focus here is on constraint propagation,

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:07,430
not on computive vision, we are simply using some aspect of computive vision

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:12,190
to illustrate constraint propagation. In particular, let us zoom into

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:18,150
a specific subtask of object recognition, In this subtask, lines

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:23,350
are grouped into surfaces and the orientations of the surfaces are identified

6
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:27,000
via the perpendiculars. The method we'll use for this task is called,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,240
line labelling, the method of line labelling makes extensive use of constraints.
