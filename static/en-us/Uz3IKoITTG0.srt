1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And yes the answer is 22, which is the mean of the remaining numbers.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And what's really helping is--is that the real age of each club member.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
There is a relationship to the age in the database, but sometimes

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
the age in the database gets corrupted.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Something as simple as a typo and perhaps there's a certain chance of a typo, may be 10%

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
but then any number in the database can be explained either by the real age or by the typo.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
If you have a sequence that reads 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 211, I would submit

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
given what we know about the real ages the score over here is a result of a typo.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And therefore we should not consider it in the calculation of the mean.
