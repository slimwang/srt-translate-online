00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,550
This first graph represents f minus g of x, and this last graph represents g

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:09,212
minus f of x. For f minus g here, we see something very similar to what

3
00:00:09,212 --> 00:00:13,732
happened when we added f and g together. Since we're just subtracting a

4
00:00:13,732 --> 00:00:17,380
constant function from this linear one, we end up with the same exact graph as

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,790
f. We can see that this line is parallel to this one, except this one is

6
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:27,491
shifted down three units. G minus f is a bit more complicated. In this case,

7
00:00:27,491 --> 00:00:31,390
we're subtracting our linear function from our constant one. This means that

8
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,800
the resulting graph isn't just going to be a shift of f. Instead, for each

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:41,535
value of x. [INAUDIBLE]. We measure from the x axis to the line of f. Then, we

10
00:00:41,535 --> 00:00:45,462
look at the graph of g. And we move it down by the positive distances between

11
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:50,855
the x axis and f, shown by these lines right here. And up by those distances

12
00:00:50,855 --> 00:00:56,215
between the x axis and the part of f that lay below it. We're adding this

13
00:00:56,215 --> 00:00:59,438
positive distance because we were subtracting a negative one before. If we

14
00:00:59,438 --> 00:01:02,000
connect the tops of all these lines together, we can see that we will end up

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,820
with a graph that looks just like this one, to the far right. What's

16
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,436
interesting, is that now our slope is negative. It's not positive or zero, like

17
00:01:10,436 --> 00:01:13,274
either of our two original functions.
