1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,150
The same concept of a conjugate applies in this case,

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,320
as it did when we were working with complex numbers.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,480
Both cases may use of this reverse property of the difference of squares. Now,

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,520
similar to how we end up with a real number if we square an imaginary number.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,340
When we square a number that has a square root sign over it,

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,330
we end up with just the number that's under the root. In other words,

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,250
a rational number, instead of an irrational number.

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:31,615
This is really usual. What we might call the conjugate of this denominator here,

9
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:36,000
1 minus the square root of 2, we can find by just switching the sign,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,570
here in the middle. So that gives us 1 plus the square root of 2.

11
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,490
We know we don't want to change the value of this over here, so

12
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:48,390
we need to multiply it by 1 in the form of 1 plus the square root of 2 over 1

13
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,690
plus the square root of 2. Let's do some math and see what that gives us.

14
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:57,720
We can find our new numerator, by just distributing the 6 to both terms here.

15
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,500
So we have 6 plus 6 times square root of 2.

16
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,890
The denominator ends up looking pretty simple too. Our first term is 1 and

17
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:10,710
then since 1 times the root of 2 is cancelled out by a negative root 2,

18
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,120
we don't have any achy middle terms. That's exactly we saw appear with

19
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,830
the difference of squares. They may just have negative square root of 2,

20
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:23,210
times square root of 2. Which means we are just subtracting the square root of

21
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:28,020
2 squared. That means our denominator is really just 1 minus 2.

22
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,420
Now 1 minus 2 is just negative 1. Is that means that all this really is,

23
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,190
is the numerator multiplied or divided by negative 1.

24
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:41,820
That means our final answer is just -6 minus 6 times the square root of 2.
