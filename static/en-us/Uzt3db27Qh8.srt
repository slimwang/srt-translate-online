1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,270
Along with all the other changes
that you've been making in the app,

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,230
now that you know who the owner is,

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,270
you can start implementing some
rudimentary premissioning.

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,820
For example,
there are some things in the app

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,200
that only the owner of
a list should be able to do.

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,640
I'll start with two pretty simple ones.

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,575
Only the owner of a list should
be able to edit the list name,

8
00:00:17,575 --> 00:00:20,652
and only the owner of a list should
be able to remove that list.

9
00:00:20,652 --> 00:00:23,396
Now if the person looking at that
list isn't the owner of the list,

10
00:00:23,396 --> 00:00:26,480
they shouldn't even have the option
to be able to do these things.

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,410
You know who's logged in,

12
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,290
and you should be able to grab
list data for the database.

13
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:33,330
So, could you write the code that will
only show these options if the user is

14
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,460
the owner of the list?

15
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,780
I'll send over the full spec now.

16
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,280
Take a look.
