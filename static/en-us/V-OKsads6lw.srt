1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,810
To get the what's for dinner app, go to
udacity's GitHub repo for analytics and

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,230
tag manager.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:10,590
So we've provided Android Studio
projects for the start of each lesson,

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:16,120
and also for the very final project,
which would be DinnerApp_FINAL.

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,370
You can download everything by
clicking the Download ZIP button, and

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:25,190
then the zip file downloads with all
the Android Studio projects in it.

7
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,130
So then,
find the downloaded zip file and

8
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:31,890
move it to the folder where you
have your Android Studio projects.

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,010
Expand the zip, and inside you'll
see the different directories for

10
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:36,840
the different projects.

11
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:44,096
So then, go to the Android Studio and
open DinnerApp_BEGIN.

12
00:00:44,096 --> 00:00:47,540
And then compile it.

13
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:53,640
So one handy hint is if the Gradle files
get out of sync, you can force a resync

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,990
by going to Tools > Android >
Sync Project with Gradle Files.

15
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:04,090
And as you work through the course, you
can continue working in the same app, or

16
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:07,790
you can get the Android Studio Project
for the start of each lesson.

17
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,500
Okay, let's go do some work in the app.
