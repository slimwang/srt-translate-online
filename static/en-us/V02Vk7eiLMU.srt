1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,350
So, to do this even risk assessment,
we said we needed to know two things.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,440
One is, we need these loss functions.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,070
We need these costs, right?

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,260
Somebody has to tell me,

5
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,610
because I can't know that, it's not
defined intrinsically in the data.

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,720
It's the cost of, you know,
either societal cost,

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,330
economic cost, you know, whatever.

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,570
As I said before, the cost of
somebody calling somebody stupid,

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,410
who's really smart and
large might be much

10
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:31,540
worse than the cost of calling somebody
smart whose actually stupid and large.

11
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,940
Think about that one, okay?

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,480
The, but the basic idea is that
the cost come from outside the data.

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,860
But the other thing that I need is that
I actually need to know the probability

14
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,690
that something really is
a four given some measurement.

15
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,590
The probability that really is
a nine given some measurement.

16
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,140
All right?

17
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,540
And we need to be able
to evaluate those.

18
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,320
The way we did that,

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,830
if you recall, is that we, we talked
about estimating the likelihood.

20
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,250
That's the probability of
the measurement given that it's,

21
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,800
here we were doing skin colors.

22
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,420
Given that it's a four or nine, or
given that it's skin or not skin.

23
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:08,220
And then, how did we go from likelihoods
to actual probabilities posteriors?

24
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,310
Well, remember we used Bayes rule.

25
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,770
Okay, and Bayes rule would allow us
to take these likelihood, right?

26
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,960
The probability of getting the
measurement given the class, skin, etc.

27
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,774
Multiply that by this prior,

28
00:01:19,774 --> 00:01:23,197
just what's the probability
of getting a four or nine?

29
00:01:23,197 --> 00:01:25,024
Or, in this case,
of getting a pixel being skin.

30
00:01:25,024 --> 00:01:27,800
Or getting a pixel not being skin.

31
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,760
And you multiply them, and
you have to normalize them.

32
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,870
And you get this posterior,
which was the thing you wanted, okay?

33
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,517
And that's what this
equation down here says.

34
00:01:34,517 --> 00:01:37,967
The probability of skin, given x,
proportional to P of x, given skin,

35
00:01:37,967 --> 00:01:39,564
the likelihood times the prior.

36
00:01:39,564 --> 00:01:43,127
And of course, then, the question came
up of, where does that prior come from?

37
00:01:43,127 --> 00:01:47,220
And again, we had to learn it
somehow from training data.

38
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,340
So we showed an example.

39
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,950
This is from Garrett Bradsky
of classifying skin color.

40
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,850
At the end of the day,
you would basically take this value and

41
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,900
you would compare it to some threshold.

42
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,930
And you'd say okay,
if it's higher than the threshold,

43
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,320
I'm going to call it skin,
otherwise it's not.
