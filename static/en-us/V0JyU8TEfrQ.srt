1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,665
This wave has the largest, what we call, amplitude which is this distance from

2
00:00:03,665 --> 00:00:08,273
this imaginary middle line up to the peak. All these other waves have smaller

3
00:00:08,273 --> 00:00:11,636
amplitudes. It's this amplitude of the wave that controls the loudness and the

4
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:15,045
loudness of a sound is measured in something called decibels.

5
00:00:15,045 --> 00:00:18,990
>> So, is amplitude the only way a wave can be different?

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,545
>> Well, you tell me. Amplitude affects the volume of a sound. Is volume the only

7
00:00:22,545 --> 00:00:24,530
property of sound that we can hear?

8
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:28,050
>> Well, no, some are really low and some are really really high, like high pitch

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,910
voices compared to low pitch voices.

10
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,265
>> Exactly, and you've said yourself. You used the word pitch and pitch is

11
00:00:34,265 --> 00:00:37,415
actually controlled by what's called the frequency of a wave.

12
00:00:37,415 --> 00:00:39,545
>> Well, Andy, what exactly is frequency?

13
00:00:39,545 --> 00:00:42,338
>> Well, remember have we said that waves will be caused by these little

14
00:00:42,338 --> 00:00:44,060
vibrations? >> Yeah.

15
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,620
>> Well, frequency just measures how many vibrations are happening each second.

16
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,980
So, if something's vibrating slowly, or if it's vibrating quickly. And we

17
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,844
measure this with a unit called Hertz. So, if these vibrations are slow, we get

18
00:00:55,844 --> 00:01:00,188
a low frequency wave. If they're fast, we get a high frequency wave.

19
00:01:00,188 --> 00:01:02,204
>> I see.
