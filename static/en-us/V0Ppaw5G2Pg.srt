1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So with the heuristic function I've given you of simply the minimum number of steps

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
it takes to get to the goal in the absence of obstacles,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
you can now construct an algorithm that implements a star

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
by maintaining not just the G-values but also the F-values,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
which is G plus the heuristic.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Out should come an expand table that looks exactly like this

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
that are signs -1 not just to the obstacles but everything over here

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
that has not to be expanded according to the heuristic.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That's your task for the next quiz.
