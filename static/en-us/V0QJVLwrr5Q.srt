Before students choose
a monetization model,

00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,880
it's a good idea to research how
competing products monetize.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,600
Where would you start this research?

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,800
>> Try to search for
similar products in the stores.

00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,600
The play store or app store of Apple.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,820
If you are on the web, try web search
and see what the competitors are doing.

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,800
Try to analyze,
what are the numbers that will make

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,070
their businesses cash flow positive and
profitable?
