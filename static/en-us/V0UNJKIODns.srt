00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's go back to probability and go back to our simplest of all examples--that of a coin flip.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Assume that p is the probability that the coin comes up heads and assume we flip the coin N times--

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
that is the same as saying that a sample size of N.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It gives us N outcomes and in the past, we computed the empirical mean, the variance,

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
but now I will let you compute the confidence interval.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's start--I'm going to ask you a series of questions, most of them are fairly challenging,

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and at the end you'll be able to compute the confidence interval for a sample size N of coin flips.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let me begin. What is the expected mean outcome when you flip this coin?

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Suppose one is heads, 0 is tails--either comes up, it's is 0.5 chance.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This could be a number where the number scales between 0 and 1.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It would be 0 if the expected outcome is always tails and be 1 if the expected outcome is always heads.
