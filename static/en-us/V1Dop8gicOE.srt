1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,420
Congratulations.

2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:04,310
You should be extremely proud
of the work you've accomplished.

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:08,170
Can you believe that a short time ago
Angular was this other worldly entity?

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,290
Now not only have you worked through
a lot of Angular's complicated concepts

5
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:12,740
like scopes and services.

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,710
But you've built several
applications in Angular.

7
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,530
We've been discovering
what Angular offers and

8
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,920
how it works I encourage you
not to stop here though.

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,410
There's so much more to angular that
makes it a fantastic framework.

10
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,560
Go on and learn about the differences
between services and factories.

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,590
The application bootstrap cycle.

12
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:33,740
The details of two way data binding by
looking at how Angular Digest works.

13
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,760
And creating your own custom directives.

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,500
Let me know what you find.

15
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,720
What are you still doing here?

16
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,320
Go build something amazing.

17
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,540
In the next lesson we'll
be taking a look at Ember,

18
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,630
a framework that helps you build
ambitious web applications.

19
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,440
Come back and check it out.
