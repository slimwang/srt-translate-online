1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,540
This first answer is simply false. 
Both objects are translated by some

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,810
amount from the origin. 
The second answer is true.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,890
If you scale by the same scaling matrix, 
the objects are the same size.

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:12,800
They may be in different positions, but 
they'll have the same dimensions.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,974
The objects is not in the same position. 
If you scale up by a million, then move a

6
00:00:16,974 --> 00:00:20,838
foot, you've moved a foot for case A. 
If you move a foot, then scale it up by a

7
00:00:20,838 --> 00:00:24,270
million, its origin will essentially move 
a million feet, for case B.

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,860
This next one could be true or false. 
It depends on the scale factor.

9
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,460
If the object is growing larger, then 
it's true, B would move farther than A.

10
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,203
If the object is shrinking, A would move 
farther than B.
