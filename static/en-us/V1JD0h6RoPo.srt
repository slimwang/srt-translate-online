Here are my answers to the questions.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:08,463
For the first question, I got the cross
product was the vector -11.205,

3
00:00:08,463 --> 00:00:14,430
-97.609, -105.685.

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:21,625
For the second question, the area
of the parallelogram is 142.122.

5
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:28,370
Finally, the area of
the triangle is 42.565.

6
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,770
Now, let's take a look
at the Python code.

7
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,090
The first code I wrote was
the cross function where I more or

8
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,750
less just copied
the formula from earlier.

9
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,010
The meat of this function is in
some exception catching clauses

10
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,940
in case self or
V isn't a vector in three dimensions.

11
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,640
I won't take too much time to go
through them except to say that in my

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,130
implementation.

13
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:52,860
If both vectors are in two dimensions
I add a Z coordinate of 0 to each.

14
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,700
And then take the cross product
of the resulting vectors.

15
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,580
Otherwise the function
raises an exception.

16
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,230
The remaining two
functions are much smaller.

17
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,110
To find the area the parallelogram, I
first take the cross product of the two

18
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,280
vectors and return its magnitude, and
to find the area of the triangle,

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,540
I just return one half
the area of the parallelogram.

20
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,220
After coding all the functions,

21
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,650
I ran this code here to find the answers
to the questions asked earlier.
