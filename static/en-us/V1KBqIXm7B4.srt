1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,399
In the last two lessons of our course, we're going to discuss two topics that

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:08,540
many people that are the sum of psychology. That's mental disorders and their

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,062
treatments. However, as we talked about in last 14 lessons that this isn't all

4
00:00:13,062 --> 00:00:17,910
psychology has to offer. And as we've said before, many psychologists have

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,910
different opinions on different things And mental disorders and their

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,712
treatments are two of those things. In fact, many government agencies question

7
00:00:25,712 --> 00:00:31,020
the way we diagnose mental disorders, but we'll get into that in a little bit.

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,481
For now, let's go to Susan for an important note on the upcoming lessons. As

9
00:00:34,481 --> 00:00:38,193
we've discussed with many of the topics such as consciousness, arousal, and

10
00:00:38,193 --> 00:00:42,360
stress. We can use the idea of a continuum to look at what is considered

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,558
normal, and what is considered not normal. And that's what makes diagnosing

12
00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:51,654
mental disorders so problematic and challenging. In that we have to determine

13
00:00:51,654 --> 00:00:56,416
what is too far on the continuum to be considered normal. Now here when we say

14
00:00:56,416 --> 00:01:00,056
normal, we're talking about this in a statistical sense and not necessarily a

15
00:01:00,056 --> 00:01:05,408
value judgement. Now psychologist who study mental disorders do so to

16
00:01:05,408 --> 00:01:10,395
understand, treat and prevent human misery. When behavior falls outside of the

17
00:01:10,395 --> 00:01:15,018
normal range on that continuum. Many people find this area of psychology very

18
00:01:15,018 --> 00:01:19,219
interesting. And although the way society has treated people with mental

19
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:22,770
illness has evolved greatly, there are still cross cultural differences in the

20
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,150
way people, view and treat individuals with mental illness.
