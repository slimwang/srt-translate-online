00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:08,932
Euler's number and the exponential function based on that number are of vital importance in the theory of differential equations.

2
00:00:08,933 --> 00:00:16,065
Whenever we are dealing with exponential growth or exponential decay, and whenever we deal with oscillations,

3
00:00:16,067 --> 00:00:22,099
Euler's number plays a big role. This is a brief and informed introduction to that topic, for which we need a minimum

4
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:29,166
amount of prerequisites. In particular, you should know that five to the first power equals five.

5
00:00:29,167 --> 00:00:38,632
Five to the zeroth power equals one. Five to the minus second power equals one over 25.

6
00:00:38,633 --> 00:00:43,599
Five to the power of one half equals the square root of five.

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:53,566
Five to the third power times five to the fourth power equals five to the power of three plus four--seven.

8
00:00:53,567 --> 00:01:01,566
And five to the third power to the fourth power equals five to the power of 12--three times four.

9
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:04,932
This is what you need to know about powers of numbers.

10
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:13,032
In addition, you should have an idea about derivatives in this D, DX notation--for instance, the derivate of X squared

11
00:01:13,033 --> 00:01:20,333
with respect to X equals 2X. And you should have an idea of how this is connected with the slope of the tangent line.
