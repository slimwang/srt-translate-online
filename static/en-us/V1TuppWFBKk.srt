1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Consider this histogram displaying counts of numbers from 1 through 11.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Note that each bar is centered at the value listed,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
so you can assume that that's the average of the values in the bar.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So you can interpret this to mean there are 3 points with a value of 3,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
2 with a value of 4, 1 with a value of 6, 1 with a value of 5, and so on.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What I'd like you to tell me is where the mean, median, and the mode are in this data.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
There's only 1 right answer for each.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check the circle for each of mean, median, and mode.
