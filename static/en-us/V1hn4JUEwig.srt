1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,062
Grant also didn't know how these ordered
cancellations would affect the total

2
00:00:04,074 --> 00:00:07,971
amount of money he would make. We can't
really help Grant with his business

3
00:00:07,983 --> 00:00:12,233
issues, but we can help him with the math
he needs to know about. So which of these

4
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:16,402
expressions down here should replace the
question mark right here, to create an

5
00:00:16,414 --> 00:00:20,514
equation for the future earnings that
Grant will have after all of these orders

6
00:00:20,526 --> 00:00:24,826
are paid for? Remember that we need to
take into account, both the money that he

7
00:00:24,838 --> 00:00:28,931
thought he was going to make from all of
the orders he originally received, and

8
00:00:28,943 --> 00:00:32,947
then also, the money that he will no
longer make from the orders that have now

9
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:37,255
been cancelled. Please assume that money
from all original orders, and money from

10
00:00:37,267 --> 00:00:40,747
cancelled orders down here are positive
when written on their own.
