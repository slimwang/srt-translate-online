00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,860
Let's take a look at some examples, some toy examples and

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:04,270
then some real examples.

3
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:08,900
Here we have a cartoon example of an image on the left that just has a bunch of

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,260
dots in it and those dots happen to all lie on a line, which is good.

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,510
So this is a noise-free Hough example of which there are none in

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,930
the real universe, but I made, I've got one here.

7
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,770
No, I was about to say I made one, no, I stole this one.

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,210
Others I made, these I stole.

9
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:24,370
So on the left here,

10
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:28,700
in image space, we have a bunch of points that all lie on the line.

11
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,700
And they lie on a perfect line, so that's how you know this is a cartoon

12
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,530
example, because that never actually happens for real.

13
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,550
What we have on the right are the votes.

14
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:43,340
And what you can see here is that each dot is creating a particular trace.

15
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,490
And you'll notice that those are parts of sinusoids.

16
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,040
Kay, here's another one.

17
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,420
And that comes from that equation that I was saying before.

18
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,690
And what's most important is all the votes over here line up.

19
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,390
And that's how we would know that's where the line is.

20
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:00,210
See?

21
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:00,710
So cool.

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,209
All right, suppose I showed you the picture of a square.

23
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:07,470
All right? And I ran an edge detector on it.

24
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,190
What would you expect to see in Hough space?

25
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,680
Well let's see, how many lines do we have in a square?

26
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,490
That you learned hopefully before seventh grade.

27
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,760
There would be four lines, okay, and you would get a Hough accumulator array,

28
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,230
a bonding thing that looks like this.

29
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,650
And here you see that there are four peaks.

30
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,450
It's a little hard to see sometime in the image, but

31
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,980
the idea is that the values there are much higher than the values elsewhere and

32
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,560
you can see how the votes overlap.

33
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,740
So here you would know that there are four lines and

34
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,120
you'd be able to pull them out.

35
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,090
Okay?

36
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,800
Here's another blocks world scene.

37
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,080
You can see that there's a bunch of edges there, and here's the Hough array, and

38
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,180
you see there's sort of sinusoids dancing all over the place.

39
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,030
Here by the way you see one really big, bright spot.

40
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,100
What's that spot going to be?

41
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,800
Well, that's going to correspond to this nice, big, long edge.

42
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,370
There are other spots.

43
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,190
And that makes sense because there are other lines.

44
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,510
But this big bright one is going to be the longest one.

45
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,790
Because it has the most votes.
