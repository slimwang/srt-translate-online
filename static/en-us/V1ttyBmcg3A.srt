1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,207
We explored some of the US laws
that have been developed for

2
00:00:04,207 --> 00:00:09,235
dealing with cyber crime and
theft of proprietary online information.

3
00:00:09,235 --> 00:00:12,880
Now these laws could be different
across different countries.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,280
But one thing we saw is that enforcing
them has some serious challenges.

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,290
We also discussed ethical behavior

6
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:27,280
when it comes to our online activities
that impact cyber security.

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,282
In the end, we explored online privacy.

8
00:00:31,282 --> 00:00:36,832
In particular, who can collect
information about what we do online?

9
00:00:36,832 --> 00:00:40,230
What can they do with such information?

10
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,220
Who can they share it with?

11
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,770
And what options do we
have in the use and

12
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,290
sharing of information about
our online activities?
