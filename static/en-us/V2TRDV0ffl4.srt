00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,919
Let's talk a little bit about the Bayer filter on the sensor.

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:06,209
So in essence, a Bayer filter is nothing else but

3
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:11,100
different types of color filters that are above the photo diodes.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:16,340
And most of the time you'll actually see two greens and a blue and

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,430
a red, so this would be the four region here, that represents one pixel.

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,650
Four another here, that represents another pixel, four here and so on.

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,470
Of course, depending on the convention of the Bayer filter used,

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,145
sometimes you might have two reds and a green and a,

9
00:00:33,145 --> 00:00:37,580
a blue, and also two blues and a green and a red.

10
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,620
Depends again on it, but

11
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,060
knowing exactly what is the Bayer filter is essential because we need to

12
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,300
know this to have to compute and then, come up with a final image.

13
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,920
Basically what happens with the Bayer filter is each one of them lets only

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,490
a specific light through.

15
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,430
So when the light is hitting the red, basically, the blue and

16
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,420
green are prevented from going through.

17
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,850
Red goes through.

18
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:58,975
Same thing with green.

19
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,370
Just the green goes through.

20
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,490
Same thing with blue, only the bo, blue goes through.

21
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,200
So, in essence, we create three different patterns.

22
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,590
Of course the photo diodes then store the intensity for each and

23
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,620
every one of them.

24
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,360
But, this coding scheme,

25
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,940
pretty much lets us know which one of the bins is actually blue, green, or red.

26
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,820
Then of course it's the combination of these three channels that gives us

27
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,690
the final image, and this is the one that we need to then decode and

28
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,800
save for our final things.

29
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,100
One of the questions that's important is,

30
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,660
how is the raw input in a Bayer mosaic format converted to an image?

31
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,650
What's the process to be able to then get basically the RGB color values,

32
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,730
that is, the RGB as we have discussed when we

33
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:43,900
talked about the image processing pipeline, the three channels separated out?
