00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,480
Now queries in monodb are based on the document model

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,730
as well. In order to find items of interest, we

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,130
want to specify a document that resembles those we're looking

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,750
for. So let's take a look at an example with

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,460
the autos data set. If we want to find all

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,770
autos that have a manufacturer of Toyota We construct a

7
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,840
query document like this. The general principle here is that

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,170
we construct the query document, having the fields and values for

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,490
those fields that we'd like to see in every document

10
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,350
in our results set. One additional thing I'll point out

11
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,650
here is, that we're simply looping through our results and

12
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,290
printing out each one of them. Okay let's run this.

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,210
Okay, so we can see that in the documents

14
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,860
we got back, we have a manufacturer value of Toyota.

15
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,400
And if we were to scroll through this entire result

16
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,280
set, we'd see that all of them in fact do.
