1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What we do is we make a matrix and also a vector.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We label the matrix, which is quadratic, with all the poses and all the landmarks.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Here we assume the landmarks are distinguishable.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Every time we make an observation, say between two poses,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
they become little additions, locally,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
in the 4 elements in the matrix defined over those poses.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
For example, if the robot moves from x0 to x1,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and we therefore believe x1 should be the same as x0, say, plus 5,

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
the way we enter this into the matrix is in two ways.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:42,000
First, 1 x0 and -1 x1--add it together should be -5.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So we look at the equation here--x0 minus x1 equals -5.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
These are added into the matrix that starts with 0 everywhere,

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and it's a constraint that relates x0 and x1 by -5. It's that simple.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Secondly, we do the same with x1 as positive, so we add 1 over here.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
For that, x1 minus x0 equals +5, so you put 5 over here and a -1 over here.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Put differently, the motion constraint that relates x0 to x1 by the motion of 5

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
has modified incrementally by adding values the matrix for L elements

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
that fall between x0 and x1.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We basically wrote that constraint twice.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
In both cases, we made sure the diagonal element was positive,

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and then we wrote the correspondant off-diagonal element as a negative value,

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and we added the corresponding value on the right side.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Let me ask you a question.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Suppose we know we go from x1 to x2 and whereas the motion over here

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
was +5, say, now it's -4, so we're moving back in the opposite direction.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What would be the new values for the matrix over here?

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'll give you a hint.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
They only affect values that occur in the region between x1 and x2 and over here.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Remember, these are additive.
