00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,352
Grant has decided that he wants to diversify his product base. He's created a

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:08,557
new kind of wiper set to add to his glasses family. This is the Deluxe Duo, a

3
00:00:08,557 --> 00:00:13,126
set of glasses wipers unlike any other every created. They have superior wiping

4
00:00:13,126 --> 00:00:17,663
power and non function curly qs for decoration on the ends of them. With them.

5
00:00:17,663 --> 00:00:22,035
Now, as silly as these glasses wipers might seem to you or me, Grant has a

6
00:00:22,035 --> 00:00:26,941
reason for creating them. He can charge a lot of money. In fact, of just one set

7
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:31,365
of deluxe duo glasses wipers, he can charge $75. This is big money in the

8
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:36,352
glasses wiper business. If we let the number of deluxe glasses wipers sold equal

9
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:41,070
m, and Grant's total profit in dollars from them equal p. Then I've created an

10
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,358
equation for you that describes his profit based on the number of deluxe glasses

11
00:00:45,358 --> 00:00:49,505
wipers he sold. You know $75 is how much he charges per pair of deluxe glasses

12
00:00:49,505 --> 00:00:53,470
wipers, and $5000 is the amount of money that he had to put down to invest in

13
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:57,766
the materials and everything he needed to start building these. So, we have an

14
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,151
equation, and we have a wonderful product.
