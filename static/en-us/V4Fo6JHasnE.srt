1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,470
This best describes the machine learning
base approach, to intrusion detection,

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,500
because it detects attacks,
similar to past attacks.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,174
And we can add that, we can codify
behaviors, similar to past,

4
00:00:14,174 --> 00:00:19,040
observed normal behaviors,
because by definition

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,380
a machine learning base approach
uses label changing data,

6
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,580
that is, it uses past examples,
in order, to view a model.
