00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,770
So, I've opened up jsonlint.com
which will tell us whether or

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,100
not this JSON is in the right format.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,012
Go ahead and copy this object
in just using the curly braces.

4
00:00:11,012 --> 00:00:12,880
I don't need to copy var education.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,716
Paste it in and click Validate.

6
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:22,718
And scrolling down we can see that
this is, in face, a valid JSON.

7
00:00:22,718 --> 00:00:24,215
>> What if there were errors?

8
00:00:24,215 --> 00:00:27,732
Like what if we erase this comma,
right here?

9
00:00:27,732 --> 00:00:31,112
>> Well, JSONLint would tell us where
the error is, which is a big help.

10
00:00:31,112 --> 00:00:36,382
Let's see, I'll come over here, I'll
delete this comma, and click Validate.

11
00:00:36,382 --> 00:00:41,107
And we can see that there's an error
on Line 11 because we forgot the comma

12
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:42,534
that comes before it.

13
00:00:42,534 --> 00:00:46,763
The good news is that text editors like
Sublime Text also highlight errors and

14
00:00:46,763 --> 00:00:49,380
help us figure out where
our syntax went wrong.
