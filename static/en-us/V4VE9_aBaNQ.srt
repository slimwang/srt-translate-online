1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,390
Attackers can also use denial
of service attacks to disrupt

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,020
the network intrusion detection process.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,260
Similar to denial of service attacks on
a network server such as a web server,

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:16,930
an attacker can send a lot of
traffic to the IDS to process.

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:21,620
The result is resource exhaustions,
for example, in CPU memory and

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,070
network bandwidth.

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,800
In other words, the network IDS may
not be able to analyze traffic and

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,840
such traffic may contain actual attacks.

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,323
That is, the attacker can first
denial service the IDS and

10
00:00:34,323 --> 00:00:37,020
then launch the real attack.

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,550
Another attack approach is to abuse the
reactive nature of intrusion detection.

12
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,330
The intrusion detection
process is reactive because

13
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:51,840
when the IDS outputs an alert, the
security admin must analyze the alert.

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,800
Therefore, the attacker
can send a lot of traffic

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,640
that would trigger the alerts, for

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,090
example, by crafting packets that on
purpose contain signatures of attacks.

17
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:06,860
The goal is to overwhelm the response
system and the security admins.

18
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,910
And then the attacker can send
the real attack traffic that even if

19
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:16,060
it triggers an alert, the alert
will not be acting upon in time.

20
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:22,040
That is because the security admins are
so busy analyzing alerts of fake attack,

21
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,870
the real attack is not
analyzed until it's too late.
