00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:01,980
My name is Gregor Mendel, and I think

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,000
I can explain what Hypocrites' blending inheritance model cannot.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,840
>> Okay how's that?

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,300
>> Well, as a monk, I have quite a bit of quiet time, so I did some breeding

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,590
experiments with pea plants that were published in 1866,

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,170
which I think have some serious implications on human traits.

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,960
>> Well, what was your model called?

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:23,290
>> I call it Particulate inheritance.

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,650
Particulate inheritance means that characteristics can

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,010
be passed down from generation to generation through

11
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,250
individual units. I believe you call them genes nowadays?

12
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,480
>> Wow! I can't believe you figured all that out using just pea plants!

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,130
>> Why does everybody doubt the pea plants? Think about organisms collection

14
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,460
of genes, being more like a deck of cards rather than a pail

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,660
of paint. A red and white paint can be mixed and the result

16
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,100
would be pink, but passing that down, you'll never get true red again.

17
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,370
Genes are more like cards, that can be sorted and

18
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,790
passed along, generation after generation in an undiluted form. Sometimes,

19
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,720
the cards can be covered up so that they don't

20
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,570
appear at all until they're passed down to the following generation.

21
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,830
>> That's a pretty clever description. Which

22
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:08,550
of the following examples do you think

23
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,500
can be explained by particulate, but not

24
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,260
blended inheritance? Check all the boxes that apply.
