1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,320
We will use again a visual metaphor to describe what a process is.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,390
Continuing with a toy shop as an example,

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,660
you can think of a process as an order of toys.

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:16,309
An order of toys has its state of execution, it requires some parts, and

5
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:20,678
a temporary holding area, and even may require some special hardware.

6
00:00:20,678 --> 00:00:25,010
For instance, it's state of execution, may include the completed toys, the toys

7
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:30,310
that are waiting to be built, that are part of that order, and other things.

8
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:34,720
Building the toys may require various parts, like plastic pieces, wooden pieces,

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,170
and these come in different containers, or

10
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,940
we may require some other temporary holding area for the pieces.

11
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,650
And, finally, to actually build a toy, we may need some special hardware.

12
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:49,610
We may need sewing machines, glue guns, or other types of tools.

13
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:54,450
So, how does all of this then compare to a process in an operating system?

14
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,900
Well, a process also has a state of execution described with

15
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,400
the program counter, the stack pointer.

16
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,879
All this information is used by the operating system to decide how

17
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,160
to schedule the process, how to swap between multiple processes, and

18
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,080
for other management tasks.

19
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,110
In order to execute, the process needs some data.

20
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,280
There's some state in registers.

21
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,160
And, it also has some temporary holding area.

22
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,860
For instance, it occupies state in memory.

23
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,495
Finally, executing a process may require some special hardware like

24
00:01:24,495 --> 00:01:28,060
I/O devices like discs, or network devices.

25
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,760
The operating system has to manage these devices and

26
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,480
control which of the processes that are perhaps executing concurrently at

27
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,070
the same time gets access to which hardware components.

28
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,560
This is similar to what would happen in a toy shop where the toy shop

29
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,870
manager has to control how the special hardware, like the sewing machine or

30
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,360
the glue gun, are used.

31
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,798
Which particular order of toys will get to be assigned the usage of

32
00:01:54,798 --> 00:01:57,010
these more designated hardware components.
