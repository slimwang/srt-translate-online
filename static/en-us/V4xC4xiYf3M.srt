1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,260
Let us now look at the solution.

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,910
The sensitivity is given by the true positives divided by

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,109
the true positives plus false negative.

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:16,210
In my case, the answer is 53 divided by 53 plus 1, which is 0.98.

5
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:21,790
The specificity is true negatives divided by true negative plus false positive.

6
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,980
1 over 1 plus 33, which gives me 0.03.

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,950
Now notice you might have gotten a little bit different answer for

8
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,050
the sensitivity or even the specificity.

9
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,740
I would like you to think why your answer may be

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,710
slightly different from the answer here in the lesson.

11
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,820
We can discuss this further in our forum.
