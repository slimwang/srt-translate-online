1
00:00:00,026 --> 00:00:03,810
So that ends the lesson on extrinsics or extrinsic.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,341
Not really calibration, because we're going to do the calibration part.

3
00:00:06,341 --> 00:00:09,987
So I should change the title of the, that was about extrinsic geometry.

4
00:00:09,987 --> 00:00:12,985
Later we're going to do extrinsic calibration where we

5
00:00:12,985 --> 00:00:15,722
figure out how a camera is oriented in the world.

6
00:00:15,722 --> 00:00:19,755
We're going to have to revisit this whole thing when we talk

7
00:00:19,755 --> 00:00:25,432
about mapping from world points to a location on an image plane, all right.

8
00:00:25,432 --> 00:00:28,982
But before we can do that, we're going to have to talk about,

9
00:00:28,982 --> 00:00:32,106
once I have the location of a point in a camera frame,

10
00:00:32,106 --> 00:00:34,599
where does that point end up in the image?

11
00:00:34,599 --> 00:00:37,540
And that's the intrinsic and we're going to do that at the next lesson.
