1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,280
To answer this question, let's look at
the execution scenario in this system.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,170
T3 is the first one to
arrive in the system, and

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,950
it will be the only task for a while.

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,630
So, T3 will be the first
one to be scheduled.

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:17,310
At time, T3 it will be preempted,
and task T2 will start executing,

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,500
because it has higher priority than T3,
at time T5.

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,300
Task 1 will arrive, and
that one will execute for three seconds.

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:30,300
T1 will preempt the execution of T2,
because T1 has higher priority than T2,

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,020
according to this assumption.

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,990
And then, we have two more seconds
to finish the execution of T2,

11
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,690
followed by the execution of
the lowest priority task, T3.

12
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,990
So, that one,
we had one more second remaining.

13
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,850
So, the finishing times of the three
tasks according to this diagram

14
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:51,020
are going to be 8 seconds,
10 seconds and 11 seconds, respectively.
