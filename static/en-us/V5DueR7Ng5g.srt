00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,402
Let's say you meet a new classmate and you agree at a local coffee shop to

2
00:00:03,402 --> 00:00:08,441
study. You've met this person at the coffee shop three different occasions, and

3
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:13,630
on each occasion the person's late. After the third time the person comes late

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:18,802
you think to yourself that this person is just lazy. Or maybe they're selfish

5
00:00:18,802 --> 00:00:21,574
because whatever they're doing must be so much more important than meeting you

6
00:00:21,574 --> 00:00:26,710
on time. This is an example of dispositional attribution, because you're

7
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,538
explaining the person's behavior from an internal cause, that is that they're

8
00:00:30,538 --> 00:00:36,532
lazy. So dispositional attributions are when we explain other people's behavior

9
00:00:36,532 --> 00:00:40,612
as being due to something from within the individual, such as a person's

10
00:00:40,612 --> 00:00:47,592
personality, talent, attitude, or motivation. So let's take this example again

11
00:00:47,592 --> 00:00:51,207
of a person being repeatedly late to a study session. Perhaps you think the

12
00:00:51,207 --> 00:00:54,155
reason why the person's late is because they've gotten caught up with something

13
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:58,672
at work and couldn't leave on time. Or perhaps because there was traffic or the

14
00:00:58,672 --> 00:01:02,092
person was home helping their sick mother. If you were to use one of these

15
00:01:02,092 --> 00:01:05,483
reasons for explaining the individual's tardiness, then you would be using

16
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:10,604
situational attribution. A situational attribution, is when we think that

17
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:14,234
something outside of a person, such as the nature of a situation or

18
00:01:14,234 --> 00:01:18,470
circumstance is the cause of the behavior.
