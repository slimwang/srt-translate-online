00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,126
Let's sum this up. The surface color is then computed with the emissive

2
00:00:04,126 --> 00:00:08,151
component, plus the ambient component, those are both solid colors. And then for

3
00:00:08,151 --> 00:00:12,105
each light, there's a diffuse component which depends on the light's direction

4
00:00:12,105 --> 00:00:15,999
and the specular component which depends on the light's direction and the view

5
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:19,810
direction. If you haven't seen it before, this Greek letter sigma is the

6
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:24,560
summation sign. It means to sum up all the diffuse and specular contributions

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,349
for each light. Putting math in any lecture is often considered the kiss of

8
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:31,572
death. The good news is that you can mostly ignore this equation here. It's just

9
00:00:31,572 --> 00:00:35,544
another way of showing all this previous text. I put this math notation here

10
00:00:35,544 --> 00:00:38,706
mostly because you'll run across this summation term a lot when looking at

11
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:42,688
material reflection models. The emissive and ambient terms are pretty simple. So

12
00:00:42,688 --> 00:00:46,592
our focus for the rest of this unit will be in looking at the diffuse and the

13
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,983
specular terms in depth.
