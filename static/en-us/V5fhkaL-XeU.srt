1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,360
You know, I'm one of those people
that likes to finish something

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,660
as soon as I think of it.

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,090
If I think about something like
let's say picking out a flight.

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,850
I'll just take out my phone and
start picking dates.

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,220
And I found that I pretty often
encounter dropdown menus, usually for

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,460
things like dates.

7
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,520
This seems reasonable, right?

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,300
Okay, I want you to watch this counter
that just popped up on your screen.

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,170
It's going to count the number of taps
it takes for me to search for a flight.

10
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,160
Are you ready?

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:25,660
Watch.

12
00:00:31,209 --> 00:00:32,418
Did you catch that?

13
00:00:32,418 --> 00:00:35,209
Three taps to select a month.

14
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:36,501
Not a great start.

15
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:37,668
Here, let me finish.

16
00:00:57,834 --> 00:01:00,917
[SOUND] Did you see how
many taps that took?

17
00:01:00,917 --> 00:01:02,418
It's ridiculous.

18
00:01:02,418 --> 00:01:05,545
Clearly, there must be a better
input than a dropdown.
