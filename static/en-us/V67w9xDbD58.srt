Your task in this problem is to write a regular polygon creator. A regular

2
00:00:04,288 --> 00:00:09,446
polygon is one that has equal angles and equal length sides. When you create the

3
00:00:09,446 --> 00:00:13,602
polygon, sucessive points will be counter clockwise. Your job is to form the

4
00:00:13,602 --> 00:00:17,598
minimum number of traingles that triangulates this surface. Your draw function

5
00:00:17,598 --> 00:00:22,083
is called polygon draw function in the code. It takes as an input the number of

6
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:26,615
sides desired. I'll provide you the basic trigonometry function for generating

7
00:00:26,615 --> 00:00:31,096
the polygons points. This code the produces x and y creates the polygons

8
00:00:31,096 --> 00:00:36,610
vertices. For example when the loop variable point is at 0, the 2D point at x

9
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:41,965
and y is going to be the point 0,1. Your job is to save the vertices, then use

10
00:00:41,965 --> 00:00:47,500
these vertices in a loop that generates the faces for the polygon. Here's what

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,953
your aiming for, a regular polygon centered around the origin.
