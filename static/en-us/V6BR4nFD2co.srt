00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,320
So the true meaning of absolute value is the distance from 0. Let's take a

2
00:00:05,332 --> 00:00:10,904
closer look at this. If I had the absolute value of 6, I would want to know the

3
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:16,324
distance of 6 from 0. Okay here's a number line, here's 0 and here's 6. If I

4
00:00:16,335 --> 00:00:22,527
count the distance from 0 to 6, I know I got 1, 2,3 4, 5, 6. So 6 is 6 units

5
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:30,889
away from 0. So the absolute value of 6 is 6. For negative 9, I want to find the

6
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:38,787
distance of negative 9 from 0. Here's 0, and here's negative 9. If I count the

7
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:43,422
distance or units from 0 to negative 9, I know that I'll go 9 units all

8
00:00:43,434 --> 00:00:48,852
together. So this distance is 9. The absolute value of negative 9 is positive 9.

9
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:54,334
For absolute value, I know that the absolute value will always be positive. I'm

10
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:55,872
referring to distance.
