00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,640
The other two kinds of constraints are pre and post conditions.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:10,050
These are used for expressing precisely what it means to use an operation

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,510
that belongs to some class. The key words here are P-R-E for pre, and post for

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:21,087
post. In a given, constraint, you can have one of these or both of these.

5
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:26,440
Or you could have two constraints, one with pre and one with post in it.

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:31,540
Preconditions says the circumstances under which it's allowed that a particular

7
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:38,100
operation to take place. Post conditions says what is the results of executing

8
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,070
this particular operation. Typically that means, what's the relationship of

9
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:48,620
the return value to the input parameters? However in an object-oriented language

10
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,890
it might also mean what are the effects on any attributes of

11
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,260
the classes that take place because of the operation has been invoked.
