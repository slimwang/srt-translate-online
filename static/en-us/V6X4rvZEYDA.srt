1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,730
So, I'm pretty sure we showed this
before when we were talking about motion

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,620
and perceptual organization.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,760
And as it says here,

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,940
even an impoverished motion
data can evoke a percept, and

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:15,350
presumably, you all see these moving
dots as a person walking, right?

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:22,180
So, you're not recognizing this as a
person from the appearance of the dots.

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:27,020
You're recognizing this as motion and
then you see that it's a person.

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,900
And in fact, I can prove that to you
looking at some work that was done by

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,640
myself and
Jim Davis now professor at in Ohio.

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,170
And so I'm going to show you here.

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,790
So when you take a look at this picture,

12
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,200
unless you've seen this demo before,
you probably don't know what that is.

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,830
When I put this thing in motion,
what do you see?

14
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:50,380
What you all probably saw,
was somebody sitting down.

15
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:55,900
And what's interesting is, now when the
video is done, you can sort of see that,

16
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,410
oh, this is a person standing
up right here, right?

17
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,331
In fact, there's some sort of
a blackboard behind them, and

18
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:06,533
then once they sit down, they're
head is here and the body is here,

19
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:09,050
because there's actually
a chair over here.

20
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:13,780
But until that motion happens,
you can't actually recognize that.

21
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,090
So we did a little bit of work on
some technology that would let you

22
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,900
recognize this, and we created this
thing called motion energy images.

23
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,140
So here you see a picture of a person,
this is a clear video,

24
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,548
all right,
where the person is sitting down.

25
00:01:26,548 --> 00:01:30,220
That's, by the way, Claudio Pinhanez,
who also got a PhD in Computer Vision,

26
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,510
now doing great stuff down in Brazil.

27
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:38,500
And what these are representing
are cumulative images of how,

28
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,610
of where stuff has moved, okay?

29
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,830
So the idea is, when you're all done,
this is area in which stuff has moved.

30
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,557
And, you know, the question is,
that's somehow indicative,

31
00:01:50,557 --> 00:01:52,727
that something about that pattern and

32
00:01:52,727 --> 00:01:56,882
how it moved in there is indicative
of the actual motion pattern itself.

33
00:01:56,882 --> 00:02:00,040
So, can we recognize that explicitly?

34
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:05,287
So we created this thing called
motion history images which

35
00:02:05,287 --> 00:02:08,720
becomes the motion energy images also.

36
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,640
Which are a function of
the temporal volume, and

37
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,135
what I mean by temporal volume is
that same thing, right, x, y, and t.

38
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:18,285
So I've got a collection of video.

39
00:02:18,285 --> 00:02:21,374
And it's really a very simple
recursive computation.

40
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,916
This is an MHI image,
motion history image, and

41
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,658
the way it works is quite simple.

42
00:02:25,658 --> 00:02:30,500
As each new frame comes in, in this
particular case you run some algorithm

43
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,872
to tell me,
which pixels are moving in that frame.

44
00:02:33,872 --> 00:02:36,942
Now, of course, this is under
the assumption of a static camera.

45
00:02:36,942 --> 00:02:40,102
And if you're not using a static camera,
you'd have to compensate for the motion

46
00:02:40,102 --> 00:02:44,092
of the camera, threshold out the motion
of the person, all the usual caveats.

47
00:02:44,092 --> 00:02:47,792
But then when you do that,
you get this very simple operation.

48
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,290
If a pixel is moving,
set that location at time t,

49
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:56,520
to some maximum value tau,
and you're going to pick tau.

50
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,440
Maybe tau is 15.

51
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,160
I'll tell you why 15 in a minute, right?

52
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,760
And if it's not moving, that's the
otherwise, I'm just going to decrement,

53
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,030
whoops, over here,
decrement the value, okay,

54
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,070
from the previous time, but
I don't go any less than 0.

55
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,300
So the image on the right is an example.

56
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,870
The brighter pixels like over here,
they've moved more recently.

57
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,570
So this is time t,
maybe they've moved at time t minus 1,

58
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,890
they just moved before.

59
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,720
So they started out as tau.

60
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,602
So maybe tau is 15x, let's make it 30,
that example will work better.

61
00:03:29,602 --> 00:03:31,850
It was 30, so now it would be 29.

62
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:38,910
But the pixels up here, they move, the
last time they moved is 15 frames ago.

63
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:43,560
So its value would be now,
tau minus 15, so if tau were 15,

64
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,180
it would be 0, so that would be black,
that's why it didn't work so well.

65
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,820
But if tau were 30t minus 15,
it would be now down to 15, right?

66
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,930
It would have counted down to 15.

67
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,070
So these areas are nice and
bright white because they just moved.

68
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,560
These areas are darker gray because, it
was a longer time ago that they moved.

69
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,460
And so the way you can think
about this motion history image,

70
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,100
is that it both shows you
sort of where stuff is moved.

71
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,480
And it also shows you sort
of how stuff is moved,

72
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,690
because you can tell that the stuff
up here moved a long time ago, and

73
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,500
stuff down here is moving more recently.

74
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,399
It's a recursive filter, that is,

75
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:25,490
I only have to keep track of i of
tau of x, y, and t minus, of t.

76
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,250
And I can create the new one
when the next frame comes in.

77
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,300
So I don't have to
remember my old frames.

78
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,370
The other thing is,
where did tau come from?

79
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,520
Well, the pixels go from tau down to 0.

80
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,280
So, let's suppose I'm bringing
in 30 frames a second.

81
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,580
So if I set tau to 30, then from 30
to 0 is the range over a second.

82
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,760
And what that would mean it that

83
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,640
anything that happened longer than
a second ago, I'm not worrying about.

84
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,510
So I'm recognizing action
that's length of a second.

85
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,680
Suppose you wanted to check whether
something could happen slowly, right?

86
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,370
Like, he sits down slowly,

87
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,400
it takes him a full second to sit
down because he's really slow.

88
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,890
Or somebody sits down quickly,
right, because they go like this and

89
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,720
they, it's not Megan
playing with the video.

90
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,900
Anyway so they can do it in a tenth
of second, so sorry, in a, in, in a,

91
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,960
a third of a second, so
that'd be tau of ten, right, 10 frames.

92
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,930
Well one of the kind of cool
things about motion history images

93
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,690
is if you give me the motion
history of image of tau, right?

94
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,590
So everything goes
from let's say 30 to 0.

95
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,800
I can just, if I wanted the motion
history image for tau equal to 20,

96
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,780
I could just subtract 10 from it,
right, so 30 becomes 20.

97
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,930
And anything that's less
than 10 just becomes 0.

98
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,980
So it only looks back 20 frames.

99
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:47,840
So it's trivial to compute I I of tau 20

100
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,530
from motion history tau 20
from motion history tau 30.

101
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,070
So I only have to keep one around,
whichever one's the longest one, and

102
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,410
I can check all of those time
windows at the same time.

103
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,100
And then also as should be clear,

104
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,600
if this is the motion history image
that goes from white to dark.

105
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,850
If I just wanted the motion energy
image where anything has changed,

106
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,740
all I can do is just threshold
that picture, right?

107
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,570
Anything greater than 0,
make a 1, otherwise it's a 0.
