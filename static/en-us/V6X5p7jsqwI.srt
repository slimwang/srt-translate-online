1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,888
Unlike the Z and T tests, the distribution of the F-statistics is not

2
00:00:03,888 --> 00:00:09,223
symmetrical. The F distribution is positively skewed, meaning it peaks on the

3
00:00:09,223 --> 00:00:15,526
left side and is stretched off to the right side. This distribution peaks at 1.

4
00:00:15,526 --> 00:00:19,878
This is because if there are no differences in the population means, in other

5
00:00:19,878 --> 00:00:25,824
words the between group variability is. Expected to be 0. Then the mean of each

6
00:00:25,824 --> 00:00:30,925
sample will still, likely differ by chance. Since the difference, then, is due

7
00:00:30,925 --> 00:00:35,637
to chance. The same way that each subject in each sample differs by chance, as

8
00:00:35,637 --> 00:00:41,256
measured by the within-group variability. Then the between group variability

9
00:00:41,256 --> 00:00:46,564
and within group variability will be the same. Therefore, when we divide them

10
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:51,739
we get 1. And that's where this distribution peaks. Also note that when we're

11
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:56,759
doing an F test, this will always be non-directional. Whereas when we were

12
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:00,851
doing the Z and T test, our alternative hypothesis could have been that one

13
00:01:00,851 --> 00:01:06,613
population mean is less than another. With the F test, we only know if there's

14
00:01:06,613 --> 00:01:11,932
a significant difference. Our critical region will always be out here in the

15
00:01:11,932 --> 00:01:17,698
upper tail. But everything else is essentially the same. We choose an alpha

16
00:01:17,698 --> 00:01:22,279
level, usually 0.05. And then we find out if our F-statistic lies in the

17
00:01:22,279 --> 00:01:27,469
critical region or not. If it lies in the critical region, we know that at

18
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:32,450
least two population means will be significantly different.
