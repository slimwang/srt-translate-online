00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Norvig] The simplest way to do planning is really the exact same way

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
that we did it in problem solving.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We start off in an initial state.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So P1 was at SFO, say, and cargo, C1, was also at SFO,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and all the other things that were in that initial state.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And then we start branching on the possible actions,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
so say one possible action would be to load the cargo, C1, onto the plane, P1, at SFO,

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and then that would bring us to another state

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
which would have a different set of state variables set,

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and we'd continue branching out like that until we hit a state which satisfied the goal predicate.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So we call that forward or progression state space search

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
in that we're searching through the space of exact states.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Each of these is an individual world state,

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and if the actions are deterministic, then it's the same thing as we had before.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
But because we have this representation,

16
00:01:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
there are other possibilities that weren't available to us before.
