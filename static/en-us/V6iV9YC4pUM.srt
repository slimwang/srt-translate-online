1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,600
All right,
welcome back to computer vision.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,510
Today we're going to do
just a little bit on video.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,440
Today and I guess next one will be our,

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,410
we're only going to talk two
of these lessons on video.

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:17,310
One could do almost an entire class on
computer vision as applied to video and

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,230
the things that are different.

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,860
But we're,
we're not going to do a lot of that.

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,970
A lot of what you've learned
can be applied obviously to

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,610
each of the individual images.

10
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,120
And some of what you have plearned,

11
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,000
what you've learned where they're
essentially two dimensional operators.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,320
You can apply those same
operators in three dimensions.

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,790
Or other ways of thinking about video.

14
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,230
But we're only going to do a little.

15
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,770
In fact talking about
the three dimensions.

16
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,750
Video, we're going to think of as
a three dimensional signal, all right?

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:51,560
So video as, as shown here is,
I have this image x y and as time moves

18
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:56,440
forward, time could also go that way,
it is that I've got this volume of data.

19
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:03,500
And so a pixel inside a video is
actually a function of x, y and t.

20
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,127
All right so sometimes you'll see
me going like this for video and

21
00:01:06,127 --> 00:01:07,390
I'm talking about x, y and t.

22
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,330
You know that,

23
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:13,552
that's the way I think of video: I
think of video as a volume of data.

24
00:01:13,552 --> 00:01:19,950
So, let's talk a little bit about
some basic computer vision in video.

25
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,150
So, one might be object detection.

26
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,200
So, suppose your goal, and we'll talk
a little bit about this next time,

27
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,940
is activity recognition.

28
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,880
Right, you want to
recognize what's going on.

29
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,139
So you're going to recognize
the activity of objects,

30
00:01:32,139 --> 00:01:33,550
of people that's there.

31
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,711
But, but there are these
entities doing something, so

32
00:01:36,711 --> 00:01:38,940
you might have to find these entities.

33
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,440
That is, what are the things
in here that are moving,

34
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,820
that are doing something that I need
to try to label what their activity is.

35
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,620
You know, nominally, or
notionally, you can think of as my

36
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:53,470
goal is to find the independently
moving things that are in this video.

37
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,590
So here I've labeled this thing
called a background subtraction, and

38
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,060
it's you know, just example.

39
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,280
I mean here you have a, a scene
where there's some cars moving, and

40
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,790
the idea would be well, you know,

41
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,050
we'd like to be able to find all
of these moving blobs, all right?

42
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:10,180
In this particular case, all these
moving blobs are the moving objects.

43
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,020
Generically, background
subtraction is used a lot.

44
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:19,260
It used to be that people thought that
background subtraction was trivial and

45
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,330
then they thought it was hard and then
they stopped thinking about it at all.

46
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,890
It still, this notion of separating out

47
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,390
the entities is still a fundamental
research area in computer vision.

48
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,280
We're going to talk about
some simple stuff here.

49
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,400
So, the, the most straightforward
background subtraction is where you have

50
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,950
a static camera.

51
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,780
So the camera's not moving,
and the idea being that

52
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,350
if nothing is changing in the scene
then nothing is moving their either and

53
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,980
there's nothing to do, so
you should go home and get some rest.

54
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,830
All right?

55
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:49,820
Background subtraction
as sort of simple and

56
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:54,210
overly simplistic as it is,
it is used a lot in commercial systems.

57
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,490
Traffic monitoring where they're,
you know, counting cars, or, or

58
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,700
monitoring other things going on.

59
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,980
Various human action recognition
where you have people coming by and

60
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,432
you want to be able to say something
about walking, running, whatever.

61
00:03:06,432 --> 00:03:08,210
Human-computer interaction.

62
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:12,050
So, people will build systems where
humans interact with a big display, and

63
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:15,340
to pull the humans out from
the background, they have to

64
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,590
remove the background somehow, and
sort of object tracking in general.

65
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,510
So, sometimes there, what you'll do is,
you'll compensate for

66
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,790
the motion of the camera, so
you'll move the whole image back.

67
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,860
As if you had the camera sta,
stationary and

68
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,200
then you do background
subtraction on that.
