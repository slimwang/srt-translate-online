1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,120
And the correct here is that you should put this one here B, C, F and G.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,230
Now, I've chosen the sizes and values so that this is not that difficult for you to figure out

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,030
even though it is an NP complete problem in the general case.

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,700
I suppose you have seen that there's lots of objects here, which have

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,820
a comparably small size and a very large value.

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,960
So probably putting in F and G is rather obvious and also I would presume putting in B

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,790
and then once you're there, you can see what else you got and you've already used up

8
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,780
5 of your size units so you cannot put an E anymore.

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,900
And then the best value of the remaining objects--A, C and D is given to you by C,

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:42,090
which has a value of 5 as oppose to 4 and 2, and also you cannot put in more than one.

11
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,140
So that makes C the only candidate to also put into that container,

12
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:52,770
and for that, you get a total value of 3+5+5+2, so you get a value of 15 in your container.

13
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,820
Actually, not using up all the space in the container because you only have

14
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,250
size 2, 4, 2, and 1, which is the total size of 9.

15
00:00:59,250 --> 99:59:59,999
So when a container of size 10, you can carry a value of 15 given these objects over here.
