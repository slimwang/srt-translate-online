The definition of pipe and filter from Wikipedia is a chain of

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,850
processing elements called filters arranged so that the output of

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,970
each element is communicated by a pipe to become the input to the next.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,100
Layered architectures according to MSDN,

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,440
the Microsoft Developers Network, is the grouping of functionality into

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,080
distinct layers that are stacked vertically on top of each other.

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,300
Communication between layers is explicit and loosely coupled.

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,180
Blackboard architecture, out of the artificial intelligence world,

9
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,870
according to Wikipedia, is a common knowledge base.

10
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:40,530
Is iter, is iteratively updated by a diverse group of specialist knowledge

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,089
sources, starting with a problem specification and ending with a solution.

12
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:50,420
The object oriented architectural style according to MSDN is the division of

13
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:55,610
responsibilities into individual reusable and self-sufficient objects each

14
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:59,260
containing the data and the behavior relevant to the object.

15
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:04,010
Note that object oriented architectural style is somewhat different than what we

16
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:08,900
talk about an object oriented program or object oriented process for

17
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,876
developing programmers.

18
00:01:09,876 --> 00:01:13,650
Finally, implicit invocation, according to Garland and

19
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,920
Shaw, is a component can broadcast events.

20
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,160
Other components in the system can register interest in those events,

21
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:27,170
by associating a procedure that should be called when the event is detected.

22
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,110
When the invent is announced by the system, the system itself invokes all of

23
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,230
the procedures that have been registered for the event.
