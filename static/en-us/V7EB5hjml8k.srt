00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,627
When it comes to solving equations, we've learned a lot of different techniques

2
00:00:03,627 --> 00:00:07,636
to solve the quadratic ones. We saw the square root method, where we could take

3
00:00:07,636 --> 00:00:11,457
the square root of both sides of the equation. We used plus or minus to

4
00:00:11,457 --> 00:00:17,064
indicate the positive and negative root for this side. So here, x could equal

5
00:00:17,064 --> 00:00:21,540
positive or negative 3. We also could set the equation equal to 0 by

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:27,827
subtracting 9 from both sides. This led us to factor. We could factor x squared

7
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:35,239
minus 9 as the difference of 2 squares. So we have x minus 3 times x plus 3.

8
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:39,705
Setting each factor equal to 0, we would get x could equal positive 3 or

9
00:00:39,705 --> 00:00:44,536
negative 3. So the square root method and factoring were two of the tools in

10
00:00:44,536 --> 00:00:49,452
our arsenal to solve this type of equation. We could even use the quadratic

11
00:00:49,452 --> 00:00:54,519
formula. If we subtract 9 from both sides. We'll have x squared minus 9 equals

12
00:00:54,519 --> 00:01:02,450
0. This equation has an a value of 1. A b value of 0. And a c value of negative

13
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:08,458
9. If we plug in 0 for b in the quadratic formula. And a value of 1 and a c

14
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:14,720
value of negative 9. This evaluates to plus or minus 3. Notice that any way we

15
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,070
solve the original equation, we still get the same answers. Plus or minus 3

16
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,140
each time.
