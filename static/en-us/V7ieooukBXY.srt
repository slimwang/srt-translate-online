1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,570
If laundry were implemented as a class,
darkColors.speed would be low.

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,630
darkDelicates and

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:12,605
darkColors both refer to the same
instance of the laundry class.

4
00:00:12,605 --> 00:00:16,230
darkDelicates.speed being set to low

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,810
changes the value of
that underlying instance.

6
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,780
If laundry were implemented as a struct,

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,010
the value of darkColours.speed
would be medium.

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,740
In this case,
darkDelicates.speed being set to low

9
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,110
does not affect the value
of darkColors.speed.

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:39,040
Because darkDelicates and darkColors
are structs, they're distinct copies.
