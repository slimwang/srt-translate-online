1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,040
All right.
So

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,530
I've imported the project
into Android Studio.

3
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,870
I'm going to go ahead and
Run button here.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,990
I'm going to run this in my emulator so
you can see it.

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,385
Boom, right away, we got some red logs.

6
00:00:14,385 --> 00:00:15,955
Let's go look at the app and
see what happened.

7
00:00:15,955 --> 00:00:19,796
And indeed, I can see the error
dialogue shows up with the text,

8
00:00:19,796 --> 00:00:22,585
Unfortunately, Did You Feel It
has stopped.

9
00:00:22,585 --> 00:00:24,534
[BLANK_AUDIO]

10
00:00:24,534 --> 00:00:28,405
So let's look for what might have
caused this error to happen.

11
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:32,910
By the way, if horizontal scroll bars
drive you crazy as much as they do me,

12
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,310
you can click on the use soft
wraps button on the left side of

13
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:41,560
Android Studio's log panel and
that'll wrap the text around here.

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,580
So now all we have to do
is scroll up and look for

15
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,310
where all this nonsense started, and
here we see Fatal Exception main.

16
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,540
That's nothing to be afraid of.

17
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,042
Did you know that bugs are more
afraid of you than you are of them?

18
00:00:56,042 --> 00:00:59,876
And indeed here's the likely
candidate right here.

19
00:00:59,876 --> 00:01:02,400
[BLANK_AUDIO]

20
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,558
You might have to scroll
horizontally to see this but

21
00:01:05,558 --> 00:01:10,240
it says NetworkOnMainThreadException,
so that's what caused our crash.

22
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,780
So the answer to our quiz should
be NetworkOnMainThreadException.

23
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,270
Okay, so now that we know that
the cause of our crash is

24
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,730
NetworkOnMainThreadException which
we do about it.

25
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,890
We'll explore the solution to
this problem in the next lesson.
