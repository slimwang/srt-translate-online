1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,990
I'll start off by calculating how many
of the pairs of data points are in

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:05,480
the same direction relative
to their respective means.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,770
That is, both above the mean or
both below the mean.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,600
To do this, I'll first create
an array called is_same_direction,

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,650
which contains a boolean for
each pair of data points.

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,830
Now there are two cases for how the
pairs could be in the same direction.

7
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,570
They could either be both above their
means or both below their means.

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,580
So I'll create two separate arrays
of booleans for those two cases.

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,700
I can use this code to check
whether each value of variable1 is

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,560
greater than the mean of variable1, and

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,900
each value of variable2 is greater
than the mean of variable2.

12
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,490
Again make sure you add the parentheses.

13
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,880
It's important to do the comparisons
first and then do the logical and.

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,250
The code to check whether both variables
are below the mean is identical

15
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,230
except with less than signs
instead of greater than signs.

16
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,610
Then two variables are in the same
direction, if they are both above or

17
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,610
both below their means.

18
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,476
Like I mentioned in
the instruction video,

19
00:00:57,476 --> 00:01:00,310
you can add up an array of booleans
to see how many of them were true.

20
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,321
So I can find the number of pairs that
are in the same direction by calculating

21
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:05,961
is the same direction dot sum.

22
00:01:09,351 --> 00:01:14,017
Finally, I can calculate nom different
direction by taking the len of variable

23
00:01:14,017 --> 00:01:18,020
one minus the number of
pairs in the same direction.

24
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,980
Last, I'll need to
return the two numbers.

25
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,940
Now if you ran this function for the
life expectancy and GDP arrays given in

26
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:29,115
the programming exercise, you should
have seen that there were 17 pairs that

27
00:01:29,115 --> 00:01:32,485
went in the same direction, and
three that went in different directions.

28
00:01:32,485 --> 00:01:35,885
The fact that most of the pairs went in
the same direction indicates that these

29
00:01:35,885 --> 00:01:38,165
two variables are positively correlated.

30
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:41,655
That is, when one is higher,
the other tends to be higher as well.

31
00:01:41,655 --> 00:01:45,150
If the first number had been small,
and the second number had been large,

32
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,100
that would indicate that the variables
are negatively correlated.

33
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,450
When one tends to be large,
the other tends to be small.

34
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,580
And if the two numbers
had been roughly equal,

35
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,670
then that indicates that there
might not be a strong relationship.

36
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,420
It's about equally likely for

37
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,080
one variable to be positively correlated
with the other as negatively correlated.
