00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,120
Let's take a moment to process the speed doubling implications of computer

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,040
technology. Let's do that by comparing the speed of trains and of processors

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,270
between 1971, when the train speed record was 380

4
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:21,112
kilometers per hour. This was the French TGV train or as they say,

5
00:00:21,112 --> 00:00:26,170
[FOREIGN]. I will also tell you since 1971 until 2007,

6
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:31,390
processor speed has doubled every two years on average over this time

7
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:36,660
period. So if train speed was doubling every two years between

8
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,410
71 and 2007, the train speed would have been in 2007.

9
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:45,130
Put your answer here in kilometers per hour to make it easy.
