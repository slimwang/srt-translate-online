1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,410
To answer the question,
willing to add the correct CSS.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,050
Conveniently, the class selectors have
already been written out for us, so

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,770
we just need to add the right
properties and their values.

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,970
I'll go ahead and add those,
and let's see what they do.

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:15,790
If I save and

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:21,120
refresh the page, you can see that our
divs now look a little bit different.

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,530
The first div no longer extends
from end to end on the page.

8
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,910
But instead,
covers up this 100 pixel space.

9
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,520
That's because we've changed
the width to be 100 pixels.

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,580
Next, the second div looks
twice as tall as it used to be.

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,890
This makes sense because we've doubled
its height from the a hundred pixels,

12
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,620
I set it to originally.

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,330
Looking at the third div,
we now see one of space around the div.

14
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,700
This comes from the use
of the property margin.

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,110
We'll cover the property margin in
more detail later in this course, but

16
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,160
try experimenting with it to
see exactly what it does.

17
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,840
And finally, the paragraph in
the fourth div is now using a font size

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,950
double its previous size.

19
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,250
That's because we've set
the font size to be 2em.

20
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,860
If the font size was set to 1em,
then the font size of the paragraph

21
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,700
would be exactly the same size as
the paragraph in the third div.

22
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,750
But by setting the font size to 2ems,

23
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,410
we are effectively doubling
its normal default size.
