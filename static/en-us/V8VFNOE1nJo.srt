1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,765
So the answer is the only thing that search depends on about crawler, is how the

2
00:00:03,765 --> 00:00:07,721
index and ranks are represented. It doesn't depend on how they're created as

3
00:00:07,721 --> 00:00:12,010
long as they represent the web quater piece in the way search expects, search

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,862
will work correctly. It doesn't depend on how the links are extracted and we saw

5
00:00:15,862 --> 00:00:19,762
that we can change the crawler to use beautiful soup. We replace to get our

6
00:00:19,762 --> 00:00:23,122
links procedure in a way use beautiful soup, but we didn't have to change

7
00:00:23,122 --> 00:00:27,442
anything about search when we did that. It doesn't depend in crawler on what add

8
00:00:27,442 --> 00:00:31,075
to index does in crawler. In fact it doesn't even depend on add to index

9
00:00:31,075 --> 00:00:34,760
existing, none of the names defined in crawler are visible in the search because

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,246
there's no import here. It doesn't depend on how the ranks are computed, as long

11
00:00:39,246 --> 00:00:42,906
as the values in this ranks object that's passed into search, correctly

12
00:00:42,906 --> 00:00:47,055
represents something about how popular a page is. But it does depend on this

13
00:00:47,055 --> 00:00:50,780
one. On how the index and ranks are represented and that's a big complex

14
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,496
dependancy.
