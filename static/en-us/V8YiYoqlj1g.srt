1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,800
So of course, we are invested in looking at the Fourier

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,130
transforms of the two images, the left and right image of this parts, so

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,590
let's look at the Fourier transforms of those images.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,350
But this image, this is the Fourier transform.

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,560
It does have a little bit of a dominant structure, but

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,720
as you notice, it's got a lot of spectral frequencies distributed around it,

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,170
because it does have, while it has reputations in x and y.

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,220
It does have a distribution of this thing because it's not the most

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,350
structured image.

10
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,840
Similarly, for the other one,

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,830
of course, here you notice it should have more frequencies.

12
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,420
These are larger objects or larger spots.

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,550
These are smaller spots.

14
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,650
When you have smaller spots like this,

15
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,950
you expect the frequency diffusion to be much thicker.

16
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,000
And, of course, it does have the directions but not as strong as in this one.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,770
So, of course, this has more frequency.

18
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,600
This has less frequency in it.

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,620
So, continuing to look at the same to examples of the Fourier transform of

20
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,640
this on the left and the right spots here.

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,693
We have these two different frequencies of spectra, we can compute those.

22
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:03,697
So we would compute the fast, the Fourier transform.

23
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:08,402
Here as an FFT, which is fast Fourier transform which is, and this is so

24
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,130
far the same thing.

25
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:15,260
And this is the left image which give us Fl, and similarly we do this for

26
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,400
the right image which gives us Fr.

27
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,190
What we can do now is actually, again if you recall from the last lecture,

28
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,670
we can decompose this into different frequency spectra.

29
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:29,390
So we can take the left image and break it into it's F1, F2, F3, all the way.

30
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,550
And we can do the same thing for the right image, F1, F2, F3, F4,

31
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:37,650
and that gives us another whole set of you know

32
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,940
information that is actually now separated out into its different bands.

33
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,130
Now to help us generate these images what we can do is we can

34
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,550
feather corresponding octaves.

35
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,210
Now I know I haven't covered the concept of feather.

36
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,110
I'll talk about that in just a few seconds.

37
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,780
What we actually want to be able to do is feather.

38
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,600
That basically in essence means is we want to kind of merge the right kinds of

39
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,000
things from two different images.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,510
We want to do this now in the frequency domain.

41
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:04,020
So we want to take the frequency, the fast,

42
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,350
the Fourier transforms of the left and the right.

43
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:10,877
And we want to do the corresponding octaves, remember the F1, F2, F3, F4.

44
00:02:10,877 --> 00:02:13,000
For the left and then the same for the Fr.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,240
But we want to do the combination of the F1 for the left and

46
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,440
the F1 of the right.

47
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,680
And, do a feathering between them, and do it for each and every one of them.

48
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,940
And then use that to reconstruct the signal.

49
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,310
So in essence, what we want to do is, we want to compute the octaves,

50
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,480
feather them, and then compute the inverse fast Fourier transform.

51
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,210
And that will allow us to feather everything in the frequency domain and

52
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,240
actually the output would be in the spatial domain.

53
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,040
So now what we can do is basically sum the feathered octave images in

54
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,370
the frequency domain and we actually have a very nice smooth image.

55
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,420
Let's look at that example.
