1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,778
Now looking at the code we just wrote, what we really want to do is change this

2
00:00:03,778 --> 00:00:06,970
from querying the value of KEY.W to move-up, which is the actual game

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:13,160
information we care about. In order to do that, we need to bind keys to events

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,218
in our game engine like so. In order to enable this functionality, what you're

5
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:22,930
going to need to do is to modify the input manager class just a tad bit. First

6
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,352
thing, what you'll need to do is actually add a bind function. Now the bind

7
00:00:26,352 --> 00:00:29,250
function will need to take the key value, and attach it to the action, via the

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,591
bindings dictionary value that we placed up here. Secondly, you'll actually

9
00:00:33,591 --> 00:00:36,693
have to modify your onKeyDown and KeyUp events, such that the keyCode actually

10
00:00:36,693 --> 00:00:40,950
modifies the state in the array. Now, we've left these two functions as

11
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,770
exercises for you to figure out. Good luck.
