00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,620
Now you might be going through these
exercises, and they seem pretty logical

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:10,210
to you but you're still staring
at a barren desert of zero ideas.

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,450
That's okay, seriously,
it happens to the best of us.

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,734
And when this happens to me,
I actually go outside.

5
00:00:16,734 --> 00:00:19,890
I go for a walk or swim or
I just sit in the park.

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,040
And I find that just being outside
really helps me get creative,

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,980
but this might not work for you.

8
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,790
You might want to browse Reddit and
look at funny pictures or

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,470
get inspiration from friends or family.

10
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,820
If you don't have any ideas right now,

11
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,560
the important thing is just
do whatever works for you.

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,840
Find some way to get into
a creative mindset and

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,020
really just start brainstorming.

14
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,550
Don't worry if your ideas are stupid,

15
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,660
don't worry if you don't
think you can implement them.

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,770
Write anything down because you'll
never know what might come of it.
