1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's try another example.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This one is called the Game Console Game,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and the story is that there is a

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
game console manufacturer called Acme,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and it has to decide whether its next console

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
is going to play Blu-ray discs or DVD discs.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And then there's a game manufacturer called Best,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and they similarly have to decide whether to put out their next game

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
on Blu-ray discs or DVD discs.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And the payoffs are if they're both on Blu-ray,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
A gets a +9, and B is also a +9.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If they both choose to go with DVD, it's not quite as lucrative.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
A gets a +5. B gets a +5.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And if they disagree, then they'll be in trouble, and they'll take losses.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
A gets a -4, and B gets a -1,

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
while here A = -3 and B = -1.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The first question is is there a dominant strategy?

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And is there one for A?

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Click here if yes.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And is there one for B?

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Click here if yes, and if there's none at all, click here.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
There may be both A and B. It's your choice.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And then the next question is is there an equilibrium?

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Click on any of these 4 outcomes

25
00:01:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to indicate whether there's an equilibrium.
