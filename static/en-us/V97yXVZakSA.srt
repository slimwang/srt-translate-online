1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,830
So now, we are going to start talking about how we blend or

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:05,720
merge two different images together.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,840
Remember different types of things we have looked up before,

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,150
where we can do different types of processes of enhancing the quality of images,

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,880
or being able to do additive information on images.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,960
Now, we're going to look at how we can actually take two images, put

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,090
them on each other and be able to kind of get the pixels registered and actually

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,970
provide you a much more crisper information after that blending is done.

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,310
We will look at some concepts of both Fourier analysis we've looked at and

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,470
see how we can actually apply this to things like panorama building, and use

11
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,550
that concept to build further to hold technology of how we can do blending and

12
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:38,450
merging of images.
