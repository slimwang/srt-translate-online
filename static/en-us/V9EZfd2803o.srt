1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,900
I'm sitting here with Carl
the UX engineer from Google.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,290
>> Hey Jay.
Thanks for having me.

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,100
>> So Carl, let's talk a little bit
about how to get useful feedback

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,619
from our users when we're
sitting down with them to test.

5
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:11,877
>> Hm, so sitting down with users,

6
00:00:11,877 --> 00:00:15,273
there's a variety of ways
that we can go about it.

7
00:00:15,273 --> 00:00:19,058
I think I like to start out with
when we're looking at paper,

8
00:00:19,058 --> 00:00:22,420
I like to start out kind
of an informal setting.

9
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,850
I like to leverage
folks that are nearby.

10
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,490
And involve them in
the brainstorming process

11
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:32,430
as we start to flesh out
features through our prototype.

12
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,260
>> Ok, and do you start with
a task that you want them to do,

13
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,820
do you start with just like
a flow that you've designed,

14
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,080
do you start with
a blank piece of paper?

15
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,540
>> Sometimes it's actually all three.

16
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,540
It could be any of the above.

17
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,540
There are certain times when you're
trying to conceptualize new features,

18
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,460
things like that.

19
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,259
Simple sketching is
the right place to start.

20
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,360
Just drawing boxes and
arrows and circles, and

21
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,430
things like that on paper is
a really good way to start,

22
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,950
especially when you have folks
that are in non-design roles.

23
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:02,910
Making them feel comfortable with
paper is a really important part of

24
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,820
the prototyping process, but we want to
collect as many ideas as we can.

25
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,990
So, we want to make sure
that we include those folks.

26
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,360
So, paper sketching is
a good way to start.

27
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,300
We can then evolve into
looking at specific tasks.

28
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,020
So, we might choose to
prototype a specific task.

29
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,320
We might choose to
look at holistic flow.

30
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,370
We might choose to do that
through a set of drawings or

31
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,940
through high fidelity mocks,
maybe that we print out.

32
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,640
And then we can walk through
specific screens within that flow.

33
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,910
>> Awesome.

34
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:37,660
So, pretend for a moment that I'm
a user and I've sit down with you.

35
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,140
How do you get me to give you
the feedback that you need?

36
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,900
>> So that's a great question.

37
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,800
We like to be really,

38
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,450
really specific about the feedback
that we're looking for.

39
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:55,230
We really want to make sure that we
don't just leave an open slate, because

40
00:01:55,230 --> 00:02:01,100
when we leave an open slate, folks will
tend to focus on maybe design elements.

41
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,640
Oh, I don't like
the color of that thing,

42
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,210
I don't like the position of that thing.

43
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,690
So we want to very specific with
the feedback that we're looking for.

44
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:13,370
The best thing to do is come up with a
set of directed questions that will lead

45
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,490
the user in the direction that
you're wanting them to go anyway.

46
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,770
>> Okay.
>> Maybe through a flow or

47
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,470
with a specific screen.

48
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,720
>> Okay, so you'll ask me a set
of directed questions and

49
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,510
I'll sort of go through and
talk about them.

50
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,890
When I'm stuck or confused,
you ask me to do a certain task,

51
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,320
at what point do you intervene and
say the button's right here?

52
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,250
Do you ever do that?

53
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,000
Do you say,
just let them be confused and

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,390
record that you're confused
about where this menu button is?

55
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,970
>> Actually it's a really good
thing to record confusion, right?

56
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,430
So when a user gets stumped,

57
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,560
we want to do our best to help
them move through the flow.

58
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,160
But we also really need to capture that
the user got stumped in that case.

59
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,720
The value there is that we can
understand why they got stumped.

60
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,260
We can probe just a little bit more,

61
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,930
understand the difficulty that
they came across with that UI.

62
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,680
Was a particular affordance missing,
is there something that we can do,

63
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,300
maybe highlight it with a different
color, make it bigger, make it bolder,

64
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,390
that kind of thing?

65
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,364
But it also is good to nudge
the user through a flow.

66
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:18,945
>> Mm-hm.

67
00:03:18,945 --> 00:03:20,474
>> If they do become hung up,

68
00:03:20,474 --> 00:03:23,681
you want to progress through
the entire test, right?

69
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:26,793
You need to address all of the research
questions that you set out with.

70
00:03:26,793 --> 00:03:27,374
>> Right.

71
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:32,416
>> And so, letting your user get stuck
and spin in a particular area or

72
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:36,850
on a particular screen is
something that we want to avoid.

73
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,770
>> So let's talk a little bit about the
questions that we might want to answer.

74
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,850
We've got, you said we need to go
through the entire set of questions,

75
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,800
what kinds of questions do we
want to be asking about an app.

76
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,880
So we've got some design in our head or
on mocks already.

77
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,346
What kinds of questions do we want
to be asking about those mocks,

78
00:03:55,346 --> 00:03:56,633
about that prototype?

79
00:03:56,633 --> 00:03:58,160
>> Sure.
Questions will tend to be

80
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,960
very specific to the prototype itself.

81
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,190
And so you are going to look for things.

82
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,330
Particular interaction
questions might come out.

83
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,080
Does the user know how to get
from screen A to screen B?

84
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,730
Do they know where to find button A?

85
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,440
Can they complete a specific task or

86
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,459
something along those lines
going through a flow?

87
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,860
Can they find something that maybe is
buried three or four screens deep?

88
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,220
>> Right.
>> Those are the types of questions we

89
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:26,895
want to start with.

90
00:04:26,895 --> 00:04:28,720
>> Okay, perfect.

91
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,980
So in our example app,

92
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,270
we might have questions like,
can a user check off this task?

93
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,960
Does a user know where
the menu button is?

94
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,528
Things like that?

95
00:04:36,528 --> 00:04:37,217
>> Mm-hm.

96
00:04:37,217 --> 00:04:38,019
>> Perfect.

97
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:38,519
>> Yep.
