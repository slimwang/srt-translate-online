00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,882
So we found for European television that you have 20 milliseconds per frame

2
00:00:04,882 --> 00:00:09,470
update. This is an incredibly small amount of time and isn't even the fastest

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:14,156
time strived for by games. If you have a CPU running at say 2.8 gigahertz,

4
00:00:14,156 --> 00:00:19,687
that's 2.8 billion instructions per second. Turning 20 milliseconds, this comes

5
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:25,017
out to be 56 million cycles for that single CPU. This sounds sizable, but if

6
00:00:25,017 --> 00:00:30,231
there are million pixels on the screen, this leaves just 56 cycles per pixel per

7
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:34,382
frame, not a lot of time. Later in this unit, we'll see that the CPU usually

8
00:00:34,382 --> 00:00:38,474
takes care of creating and positioning objects in the scene, these objects are

9
00:00:38,474 --> 00:00:42,504
then sent to a graphics processor which is particularly tuned to graphically

10
00:00:42,504 --> 00:00:43,283
display them.
