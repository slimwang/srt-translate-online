00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,280
Matt, what are some of the most popular visualizations that you see on Poly?

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:11,050
>> yeah, I think just kind of like the most often used ones because they're so

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:15,560
familiar and also because, you know, they're kind of the classics.

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,760
We see a lot of line charts, bar charts and

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,700
scatter charts and then a lot of histograms.

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,390
But it also depends a lot on the user.

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,410
Like certain users will only make bubble charts, or only make,

8
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,940
you know, hit maps.

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,810
so, if you scroll through our feed,

10
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,210
you can see a lot of different types of graphs.

11
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,330
But those are the, the most often made types.

12
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:37,460
>> Okay.

13
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,990
And other any unconventional chart types that you see?

14
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,170
>> Yeah. So one fun thing about Plotley is

15
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,510
you can kind of invent your own chart types if you like to.

16
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,450
We've tried to make it a really flexible environment for being able

17
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:56,030
to use different languages or different programs to be able to draw your graphs.

18
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,570
So we don't natively support maps, for example.

19
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:04,390
But people have made maps using different packages from Python or R.

20
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,370
People have made network visualizations, which we don't natively support,

21
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:13,020
but Someone has made a couple of those using a language called Julia.

22
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,660
And then we've also seen people make sort of

23
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,460
just their own out of the box data visualizations.

24
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,780
That mimic some type of event that they'd like to show a visualization of.

25
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,440
That doesn't even necessarily have a name with a graph type.

26
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:27,940
>> Okay.
