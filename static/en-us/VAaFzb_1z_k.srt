00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:05,030
Several differences that we saw in the OCL from the First-Order Logic. It uses

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:10,940
the vertical bar, not only, to get at the length of things, but I'm sorry.

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:15,940
Not not as we saw in the First-Order Logic to indicate the length of things,

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:21,030
but it serves the role as the dot we saw before to separate the part which is

5
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:25,230
saying. What the, what the variable is from the remainder.

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,230
The limitations on the value of i appear as part of the proposition itself.

7
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,870
The limitations on the value of i are separated from the proposition itself,

8
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,970
by the use of the implies OCL keyword. I've also cheated a bit,

9
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,550
by using OCL's built in sequence class instead of vectors.

10
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,060
OCL doesn't have vectors, it has sequences, but those are essentially the same.
