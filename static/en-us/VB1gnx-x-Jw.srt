00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,700
So, this is the Doge version that Sarah can't stop playing. It's polite to

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,070
>> I need points.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,100
>> So, this is based on

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:07,800
>> Still scoring.

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,860
>> The internet mean the Doge dog um,and this is just one

6
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,590
of you know, a ton of different modifications of this game that

7
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,580
is out here and you will have one yourself. How long do

8
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,500
you think it took the guys who made this to do this?

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,820
>> Honestly, for experienced programmers, probably like ten minutes. [LAUGH]

10
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:25,210
>> That's,

11
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,020
that's so cool. How long do you think it

12
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,680
will take our students to have their own version working?

13
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,970
>> Maybe a little more than ten minutes. Maybe like an hour. [LAUGH]

14
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,460
>> Okay,but to even just to make some little changes how long?

15
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,035
>> I could be doing that in minutes ,yeah.

16
00:00:38,035 --> 00:00:40,730
>> Okay,so literally, this stuff isn't that hard. That

17
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,400
was, what was the most mind blowing to me when

18
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,160
I started going over how this all works and you'll

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,909
have your own version in ten minutes, so keep watching.
