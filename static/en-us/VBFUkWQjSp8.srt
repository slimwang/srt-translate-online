1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,510
The profile class is in the package com.google.devrel.training.conference.domain

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:13,050
and the conference API class is in com.google.devre.training.conference.spi.

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,090
Now the conference API class contains functions that are

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:21,050
exposed through endpoints and you'll see that the package it's in is spi.

5
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:26,200
A convention has developed to use SPI to indicate endpoints.

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,580
I think it's got something to do with

7
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,950
the original internal name for the endpoints project at

8
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,590
Google but don't quote me on that but just

9
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,830
remember when you see spi it usually means endpoints.
