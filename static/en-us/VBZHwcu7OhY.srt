1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,538
The correct answer is 5 times root 5 plus 10. Nice thinking if you got it. This

2
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:09,140
would be an alternate form of the correct answer as well. You could have

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,548
factored a 5 from each of these terms to have 5 times the square root of 5 plus

4
00:00:12,548 --> 00:00:16,960
2. Keep in mind that you need parenthesis around this entire quantity since

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,154
you're distributing the 5 to each of hte terms. We start rationalizing this

6
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:25,343
denominator by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate.

7
00:00:25,343 --> 00:00:31,858
The conjugate of root 5 minus 2 is root 5 plus 2. We distribute the 5 to each

8
00:00:31,858 --> 00:00:36,414
of these terms to get 5 root 5 plus 10 in our numerator. For the denominator

9
00:00:36,414 --> 00:00:41,160
we'll use the difference of squares pattern to do a squared minus b squared.

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,836
The A is route 5 and the B is positive 2. This leaves us with 5 minus 4 in our

11
00:00:45,836 --> 00:00:52,710
denominator. 5 minus 4 equals 1 and anything divided by 1 is itself. So we're

12
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,193
left with our final answer.
