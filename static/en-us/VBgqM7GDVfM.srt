1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
If we graph this with the probability as the horizontal axis and P(data) as the vertical axis.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Then, for 1/2 we get a certain value. For 2/3, we get a larger value.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
For 1/3, you might be down here. And for the extremes of 1 and 0, you end up down here in 0.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So we effectively are getting a cliff but as we find out P is exactly at 2/3

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and goes to 0 in both extreme so this point, 2/3, is the one that maximizes the likelihood of the data.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Therefore, it's called the maximum likelihood data estimator or MLE.
