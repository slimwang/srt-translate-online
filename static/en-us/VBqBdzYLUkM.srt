1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,879
We're going to use the n-Queen's problem
again to talk about genetic algorithms.

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:08,169
But before we do that, we need to create
a convention to represent a given board.

3
00:00:08,169 --> 00:00:09,789
>> We'll use the one in the book.

4
00:00:09,789 --> 00:00:13,739
Since there can only be one queen
in each column, we can code a board

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,640
with a number per column that
indicates where the queen is.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,882
So for this board,

7
00:00:19,882 --> 00:00:25,152
the encoding would be 8, 6,

8
00:00:25,152 --> 00:00:30,032
4, 2, 7, 5, 3,1.
