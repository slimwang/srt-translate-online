1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,990
The client interacts with the rest of this pattern

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,860
through an abstract interface.

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,180
For example, if your application provides the end-user a way of

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,940
drawing diagrams, then the abstract interface might have the name Graphic.

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,440
If you were modeling an organization and

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,660
its employees, you might use the term Unit.

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,220
To indicate the general nature of the pattern, GoF uses the term component.

8
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:30,290
In the diagram you can see that the client class talks to the component class,

9
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:35,580
and that the component class is abstract because its name is in italics.

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:40,440
The component class has a variety of operations as well as the ability to add

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,060
and remove children and access any of the children of the component that exists.
