1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,160
This first step is
fairly straightforward.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,880
Modify the build.gradle and
the app build.gradle.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,090
Then add the CheckPlay Services helper
method I just showed you to the bottom

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,440
of main activity.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,400
And add a placeholder check in
onCreate that will call this method.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,410
So that in later steps,

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,580
we can control our app flow based
on the result of this call.

8
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,270
You'll also need a request code for
Google Play Services.

9
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,743
So to see these changes check
out the GitHub commit linked in

10
00:00:24,743 --> 00:00:26,140
the instructor notes.

11
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,350
You'll need to implement all
of them in your app, and

12
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,430
once your code is ready
