00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,920
We have spent sometime talking about
how to prepare data for modeling.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,700
And now we're going to shift to the fun
stuff and focus on building out models.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,620
And in this lesson,

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,690
we're going to be building out Binary
Classification Models in particular.

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,800
We're going to start off by
discussing two types of models,

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,082
Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.

7
00:00:18,082 --> 00:00:20,573
Then we're going to talk
about model comparison,

8
00:00:20,573 --> 00:00:23,980
which helps us figure out which of
the two models fit the data best.

00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,499
