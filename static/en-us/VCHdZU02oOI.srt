1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,980
Okay, so how many views
are there in this screenshot?

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:04,750
Well, we have two text views and
one image view.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,870
So that makes three views.

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,670
But then also remember that
a view group is also a view.

5
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,850
So that's actually four total views.

6
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,240
So we write that in here.

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,960
Sorry, I know that was
kind of a trick question.

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,950
But now you will remember it next time.

9
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,700
Next, the mountain image is a child or
parent of the red ViewGroup.

10
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,660
If I draw in the faces, hopefully
you will remember that the image

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,390
view is a child of the red ViewGroup.

12
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,150
So I circle this one in.

13
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,930
Number three, the red ViewGroup is the
child or parent of the Hiking TextView.

14
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,240
If I draw in more faces,

15
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,330
then we see that the red ViewGroup
is the parent of Tommy Textview.

16
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,870
So we circle this in.

17
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,510
Number four,
which views are siblings of each other?

18
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,110
Well, the three of these views
are siblings of each other.

19
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,737
So, we have the mountain ImageView and
the two TextViews.
