00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,240
Guys, that's it.

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:05,050
It's the sad moment that where we're reaching the end of the class.

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,190
>> It's been a pleasure for us to teach this class for you.

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,550
I hope you had as good of a time learning as we've had teaching.

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,078
And we're really excited to see you again either working here in Silicon Valley

6
00:00:14,078 --> 00:00:17,352
as a machine learner or the awesome projects that you're going to go and do.

7
00:00:17,352 --> 00:00:20,380
And hopefully, you post them online and we can see them there.

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,460
>> And it's, every time we reach this point in class,

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,870
I'm really sad because it's been such a great experience to have you in class.

10
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,390
Fun too, I have, see, Katie do most of the work.

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,200
But, but, but you brought something, right?

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,070
>> I did. I did.

13
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,630
I was inspired by our conversation during the intro video about winemaking.

14
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,370
So after that, here we go, I actually made my own wine.

15
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:41,940
>> Your own wine?

16
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,580
>> My own wine.

17
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,970
This is the first bottle of it that we've opened.

18
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,334
We'll see how good it is.

19
00:00:46,334 --> 00:00:49,832
I'm sure it's not as good as the stuff I'll eventually be making but,

20
00:00:49,832 --> 00:00:52,944
you know, there's a first time for everything, so shall we?

21
00:00:52,944 --> 00:00:53,969
>> Cheers.

22
00:00:57,703 --> 00:00:59,040
It's pretty good.

23
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,540
>> Surprisingly drinkable actually.

24
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,260
>> Wow.

25
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,570
>> So it's been a pleasure teaching you and we hope to see you again soon.

26
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,740
>> And don't forget, there's many more courses on Udacity of course,

27
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,510
but there's also really great jobs here in Silicon Valley.

28
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,830
Machine learning people are in very short demand,

29
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,820
and Udacity's standing by to help you develop your career.

30
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,700
>> So we'll see you again soon.
