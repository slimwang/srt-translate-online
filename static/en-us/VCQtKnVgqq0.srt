1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the answer here is that all 3 statements are actually correct.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,470
So the strongest one is probably this one here,

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,040
so if you just happen to show just one

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,100
single NP complete problem to be solvable in polynomial time,

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,610
then all NP complete problems

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,670
are solvable in polynomial time on a deterministic RAM,

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:21,400
so on your home computer, basically.

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,500
If all NP complete problems are solvable in polynomial time,

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,200
because they are NP complete

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,100
that also means, of course, that all problems that are an NP

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,980
are solvable in polynomial time.

12
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,350
So this one here is true, as well.

13
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,020
Some problems in NP can be solved in polynomial time, yeah.

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,850
We already know that, and actually, that's the weakest of the 3 statements,

15
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,660
so if all problems are solvable in polynomial time,

16
00:00:44,660 --> 99:59:59,999
yes, some problems are solvable in polynomial time.
