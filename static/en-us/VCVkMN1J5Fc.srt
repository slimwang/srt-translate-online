00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Here's the problem. I was careful about doing the here case.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I made up this nice expression, but then I did a copy and paste,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and I edited the expression, and I swapped around the here and the there in this part.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
When I created the new state, I did that correctly.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
But down here I'm iterating over the people that were here.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm trying to have candidates move from there to here,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and I'm iterating over people that are here. That doesn't make any sense at all.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I've got to fix that.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Now the question is is it going to run this time.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I found a bug. I fixed it. Is the program correct now?

11
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Yes, no, or not enough information, you can't tell yet?
