00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,070
Given a machine with
a two-level memory hierarchy,

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,520
what does an efficient
algorithm look like?

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,766
That's the topic of this lesson.

4
00:00:06,766 --> 00:00:10,180
Input/output avoiding or
I/O avoiding algorithms.

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,640
In this case, I/O refers to
the transfers of data between slow and

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,240
fast memory.

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,610
Now in this lesson, you'll assume that
these I/Os are the dominant cost,

8
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,995
and you'll ask how to minimize them.

9
00:00:21,995 --> 00:00:26,380
You'll also see examples of how to argue
lower bounds on the number of IOs so

10
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,050
that you can see whether a given
algorithm you've got achieves

11
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,470
the lower bound.

12
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,625
So, let's go avoid some IOs.

13
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:34,994
