1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,519
If our critical region is only up here, above the mean. Then, any sample mean

2
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:11,168
in this yellow, or orange, area will be considered likely. However, with a z

3
00:00:11,168 --> 00:00:17,370
score of negative 2.59, would we necessarily consider that likely? So instead,

4
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:23,940
let's split the critical region in 2. Again, let's focus on just the alpha

5
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:30,760
level of 0.05 for now. If we split 0.05 in 2, then that means 2.5% is on this

6
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:38,716
side. I drew this 2.5% disproportionately larger just so you can see. But let's

7
00:00:38,716 --> 00:00:45,135
just pretend that this area in blue is 2.5%. And that also means that 2.5% is

8
00:00:45,135 --> 00:00:52,499
on this side. So in total they make 5%. So this is for an alpha level of 0.05.

9
00:00:52,499 --> 00:00:57,576
So this means we have different z critical values. What is this z critical

10
00:00:57,576 --> 00:01:03,163
value that should go here? Just write it as a positive value.
