1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,236
Multiplying the right-hand side out, gives us the expression 3x squared minus

2
00:00:04,236 --> 00:00:08,226
30x plus 75. So, what was the point of multiplying this out? Well, we can see

3
00:00:08,226 --> 00:00:12,510
now that the right-hand side doesn't really tell us anything clearly about where

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,582
the vertex is. And if we subtracted 2 again from both sides and got this fully

5
00:00:16,582 --> 00:00:20,806
in the standard form for the equation of the parabola, then we would really have

6
00:00:20,806 --> 00:00:25,286
no idea right away where the vertex was. Keep these two different forms, which

7
00:00:25,286 --> 00:00:29,641
are equivalent ways of writing the equation for this curve, in mind, as we move

8
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:30,181
forward.
