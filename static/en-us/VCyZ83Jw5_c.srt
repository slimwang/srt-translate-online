00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,630
Looking at this definition and
the cloud computing requirements that we

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:08,740
discussed already, here are how these
phrases map to these requirements.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,650
When we think about elastic resources,
that means that these are on demand

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,670
network resources, whenever we
need them they will get created.

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,860
They come out of a shared pool of
resources, so that's how we can support

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,890
this requirement, and
this provisioning happens rapidly.

7
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:29,622
When we think about API-based,
that really means that the resources,

8
00:00:29,622 --> 00:00:33,210
the cloud computing resources
are ubiquitously available.

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,330
They need to be professionally managed,
so that's the definition,

10
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:40,730
the part of the definition that talks
about minimum management effort.

11
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,520
There really isn't anything
in this statement that

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,040
talks about the pricing aspect of
cloud computing and in principle,

13
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,210
there really isn't a solid
well-established definition of what

14
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:55,420
cloud computing is,
that the entire community subscribes to.
