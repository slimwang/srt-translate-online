00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,520
We've now completed our review of
data and interoperability standards.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,830
This is an immense field, and we've
only skimmed the surface in an effort to

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:13,940
equip you with a working knowledge
of the areas being standardized,

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:18,320
the approaches and technologies being
used, and the potential benefits.

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,730
You should recognize that for
the most part health informatics

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,490
standards have been developed
within the industry and

7
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:30,140
have only recently begun to adopt
approaches such as XML and web services.

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,120
You should also appreciate
the inevitable attention

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,240
that exists between the need many feel
to create very detailed standards for

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,240
everything and
the complexity that creates.

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,260
Often this complexity gets in
the way of the real objective,

12
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:50,520
which is implementation and use of the
standards in day-to-day patient care.

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,050
And the increasing recognition of that
seems to be leading to a new willingness

14
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,955
to look outside of healthcare and
to adopt more facile and

15
00:00:58,955 --> 00:01:01,520
easy-to-implement approaches,
such as FHIR.
