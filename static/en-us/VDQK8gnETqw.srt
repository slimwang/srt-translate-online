1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,249
And the answer is zero. It’s zero for any other

2
00:00:02,249 --> 00:00:08,598
number. 179.99, 179.98 and so on, each

3
00:00:08,598 --> 00:00:11,990
angle has probability zero. That’s because

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,575
getting that exact angle right with exact the

5
00:00:14,575 --> 00:00:18,575
right decibels, you just won’t be able to get there.
