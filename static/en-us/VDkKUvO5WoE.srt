00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,150
If you search for a solution, it's very
likely that you found more than one.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,115
But here's one that was easiest,
shortest and worked the best for me.

3
00:00:09,115 --> 00:00:11,821
I just setup another gulp.watch, but

4
00:00:11,821 --> 00:00:17,157
this time it isn't watching the original
index.html, but the copied one.

5
00:00:17,157 --> 00:00:20,146
And every time that
the copy operation is done,

6
00:00:20,146 --> 00:00:25,260
we can now execute browserSync.reload
to reload the whole page.

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,730
Make sure this works for you.

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,928
Then we can move on with
the JavaScript processing.
