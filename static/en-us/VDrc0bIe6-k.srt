00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,650
To review, we need four permissions,
and four class declarations.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,490
Internet is already in the manifest.

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,780
So, add the permissions for
wakelock, receive, and message.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,153
Then, declare our for new classes,
the GcmReceiver, the GcmListener,

5
00:00:14,153 --> 00:00:18,000
an InstanceID listener, and
a registration intense service to help.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,350
To see what these changes should be,

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,230
again, check out the GitHub commit
linked in the instructor notes.

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,390
You'll need to implement
them in your app now.

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,780
And once your manifest is ready,
click here to move on.
