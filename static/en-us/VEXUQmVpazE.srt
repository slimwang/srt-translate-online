00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,750
The answer is the Brewery.

00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,939
Looking at the map, you'll notice that Edward Street and

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,480
Portland Street have a couple deaths along them.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,710
The Workhouse shows exactly five deaths over here,

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:15,460
but the Brewery has no deaths along its borders.

00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,030
So what is exactly so special about the Brewery?
