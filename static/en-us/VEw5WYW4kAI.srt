00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here's a code that's pretty simple.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,000
All we do is we iterate the variable F over all the possible values of filling in the formula.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
If we say that filled-in formula F is valid, then we should go ahead and return it.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Otherwise, when we get through the end of the loop, we automatically return None.
