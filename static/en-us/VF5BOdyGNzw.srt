00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,810
I left one thing out when I said that the dot prototype objects that come for

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,700
free on functions were just as uninteresting as any other new object that we

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,520
could use for storing methods.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,490
In fact, these prototype objects come with one

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,328
extra convenience property that almost no other object has.

6
00:00:17,328 --> 00:00:22,400
Every dot prototype object has a .constructor property which points back to

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,760
the function it came attached to.

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,520
Thus, there is a mutual linking between any new function and

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,380
it's companion dot prototype object, because car links to dot prototype object,

10
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,030
and prototype links back to the car object.

11
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,390
Car dot prototype dot constructor is car itself.

12
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,830
The main use for this feature is so

13
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:44,130
that you can figure out which constructor function built a certain object.

14
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,640
All instances of a class delegate their field lookups to their prototype,

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,550
and so they should all report as having the same constructor function.

16
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,340
What do you think would be logged as Amy's constructor property?
