1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,638
For the coefficients, we just divide them. We know 8 divided by 2 makes 4. For

2
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:09,158
the bases of x, however, we want to subtract their exponents. We have 7 minus

3
00:00:09,158 --> 00:00:13,730
positive 1, which is 6. Another way to think about it is we would have x to the

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:18,312
6th left in the numerator. So 4x to the 6th is our first term. 6x to the 4th

5
00:00:18,312 --> 00:00:23,867
would be our second term. 12 divded by 2 makes 6. And x to the 5th divided by x

6
00:00:23,867 --> 00:00:28,624
to the 1 makes x to the 4th. Our last term should be negative 3x squared. 6

7
00:00:28,624 --> 00:00:33,331
divided by 2 equals negative 3. We know it's negative because the sign is

8
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:38,790
negative. And then x to the 3rd divided by x to the 1 is x squared, or x to the

9
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:44,915
2nd. Here's the answer to dividing this polynomial. Great work if you got it

10
00:00:44,915 --> 00:00:45,510
right.
