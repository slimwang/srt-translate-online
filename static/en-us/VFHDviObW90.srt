00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,073
Let's try another kilometer problem. You walk 3/8 of a kilometer and 3/7 of a

2
00:00:04,085 --> 00:00:08,032
kilometer one day, how far did you walk? Before we solve this problem like the

3
00:00:08,044 --> 00:00:12,162
others, let's make a prediction. Did you walk less than a kilometer, exactly a

4
00:00:12,174 --> 00:00:16,285
kilometer, or more than 1 kilometer? Use the 2 number lines to help you out. We

5
00:00:16,297 --> 00:00:20,495
have 1 full kilometer, and this is 3/8 of that kilometer. I have three out of

6
00:00:20,507 --> 00:00:24,480
eight parts of the kilometer. Here, the kilometer has been split into seven

7
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:28,625
equal pieces and I have 3/7 of the kilometer length. Choose the best one.
