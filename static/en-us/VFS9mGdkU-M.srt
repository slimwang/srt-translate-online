1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,977
Well, you can see that negative 2.59 is less than the z critical negative 1.96

2
00:00:05,977 --> 00:00:12,757
at the alpha level of 0.05. Since its in this critical region, we can say that

3
00:00:12,757 --> 00:00:18,388
it is unlikely to have gotten a mean engagement score of 7.13. However, this

4
00:00:18,388 --> 00:00:23,335
mean engagement score does fall in the critical region. However, there is

5
00:00:23,335 --> 00:00:27,678
evidence that my singing made students less engaged. Perhaps I should just

6
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:31,964
stick to talking when I teach a lesson. And we can also say that a mean

7
00:00:31,964 --> 00:00:38,676
engagement score of 7.13 is significant at probably less then 0.05. The

8
00:00:38,676 --> 00:00:43,574
probability of getting an egagement score this far from the mean in either

9
00:00:43,574 --> 00:00:49,342
direction is less than 0.05. That's basically what that means when we do a 2

10
00:00:49,342 --> 00:00:54,694
tailed test. So let's say we got a sample mean that is about here. When we

11
00:00:54,694 --> 00:01:00,831
determine whether or not this sample mean is significant at 0.05. We want to

12
00:01:00,831 --> 00:01:05,211
know if a probability of obtaining a sample mean this far from the mean of

13
00:01:05,211 --> 00:01:11,660
means is less than 0.05. And it doesn't matter what direction. So if we have

14
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:16,259
this z score, the probability of getting a z score that far below or above the

15
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,220
mean is the area here and here.
