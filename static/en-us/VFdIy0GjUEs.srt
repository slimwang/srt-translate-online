00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,800
Before we go any further, I need to

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,110
jump in here. Catherine has already said that

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,410
the refresh button is for debugging only, but

4
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,600
let's look at why. In real life, you

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,720
should always seek to eliminate the refresh button

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,970
from your app. A good app should work

7
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,560
like a good butler, giving you what you want before you even have to ask for

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:19,860
it.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,720
Much like the Save button, it's a relic of a

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,370
bygone age. That's the best a reassuring safety blanket for those

11
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,370
of us who grew up with floppy disks. With the ability

12
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,670
to run background tasks or send messages directly from the server

13
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,860
to our app, there's really no reason to force users

14
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,960
to manually hit refresh. But the app is up to date

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,300
and sync with the cloud should be a given. But like

16
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,230
we said, this is for debugging, so like print line it's

17
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:51,370
acceptable for this particular purpose. Let's also take a look at

18
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,650
our background threading model, which of the following is potential an issue?
