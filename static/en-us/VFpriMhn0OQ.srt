00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,360
What if we want to run
two versions of nginx.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,740
What happens when we install it again?

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:10,070
Using our Package Manager,
let's try to install nginx again.

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:13,400
It says it's already installed and
we have the newest version.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,420
So, that's not how you do it.

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,510
Let's try starting nginx again and
checking the status.

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,950
I still only see one
instance of nginx running.

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,680
And we can confirm this
using the ps command.

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,140
I can see that there is only one
nginx process and it's worker.

10
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,100
So that tells me there's only one main
instance of my application running.

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,105
So, without going into all the details,
to create two instances of

12
00:00:41,105 --> 00:00:46,195
nginx using native OS tools,
we'll need to modify init scripts.

13
00:00:46,195 --> 00:00:47,995
It takes a lot more work.

14
00:00:47,995 --> 00:00:51,297
In particular,
you have to modify this file.

15
00:00:51,297 --> 00:00:54,367
We'd also need to manage ports
because two instances can't

16
00:00:54,367 --> 00:00:56,247
bind to the same port.

17
00:00:56,247 --> 00:01:00,377
There's a lot of complexity here and
that's not even considering how

18
00:01:00,377 --> 00:01:03,538
to run a newer and
older version of nginx at the same time.

19
00:01:04,678 --> 00:01:07,448
Most OSs only allow you
to run one version.

20
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:12,698
So we're going to have to change things
up a bit and take a different approach.

21
00:01:13,718 --> 00:01:14,788
So let's stop nginx.
