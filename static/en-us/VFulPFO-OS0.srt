1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,570
So now we know how to find the right bucket. Let's

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:06,440
look at how to define the add procedure. So we are going to

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,990
first define add, we'll make hashtable add, that takes a hashtable,

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,880
a word and a value. And first we'll define a simple version

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,040
of that, that says we are going to add the new entry

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,430
to the bucket even if it already exists. So we'll find the

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,610
right bucket. And we'll add the new entry at the end. So

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,922
your goal is to define a procedure, we'll call it hash table_add.

9
00:00:25,922 --> 00:00:29,230
Takes three inputs: a hash table, a key, which is the

10
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,085
word, and a value, and it adds that key to the

11
00:00:32,085 --> 00:00:35,340
hashtable, making sure to put it in the correct bucket with

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,904
the associated value that was passed in as the third input.
