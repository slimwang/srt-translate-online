00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,560
Alright. So now we know how to parseJSON data. How do we actually retrieve that

2
00:00:06,572 --> 00:00:13,446
from our server? This is where XMLHttPRequest come in. An XMLHttpRequest allows

3
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:19,875
our Javascript code running in a browser to fire a request off to our server to

4
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:26,060
a specific URL. We can also specify a function call once the server responds to

5
00:00:26,072 --> 00:00:32,078
our request. Now, there are a few steps to this. First, we need to create a new

6
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:39,006
XMLHttpRequest object, and we do this using the new keyword, followed by

7
00:00:39,018 --> 00:00:45,500
XMLHttpRequest with the parentheses. Now, note that case is sensitive here.

8
00:00:45,633 --> 00:00:52,261
Next, we need to call the XMLHttpRequest open method. First, we need to specify

9
00:00:52,273 --> 00:00:58,396
the HTTP method to use. In our cases, we're pretty much always going to want to

10
00:00:58,408 --> 00:01:03,532
use GET. Second, we specify the URL to call out to. For example, if we were

11
00:01:03,544 --> 00:01:09,200
requesting a JSON file, we would specify the file name that we were interested

12
00:01:09,212 --> 00:01:14,620
in. Finally, we specify a Boolean value that is set to true if we want the call

13
00:01:14,632 --> 00:01:19,806
to be asynchronous. We pretty much always want the call to be asynchronous.

14
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:25,482
Next, we specify the onload parameter, which is a function that we define that

15
00:01:25,494 --> 00:01:31,010
gets called once the server responds to our request. Finally, we need to call

16
00:01:31,022 --> 00:01:36,782
the xhr.send method. This will actually kick-off the request. Note that we need

17
00:01:36,794 --> 00:01:42,446
to do all of these things first, before we can call send. Otherwise, the request

18
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:47,850
might hit the server and respond before we can specify our onload function. And

19
00:01:47,862 --> 00:01:52,650
if that happens, we won't actually know what to do with the response yet.
