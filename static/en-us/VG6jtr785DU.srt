1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,560
But what I'm going to do is show you.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,220
It's sort of a simple version of what's
called the likelihood ratio test.

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:08,315
And here, we're basically assuming that
the cost of calling a skin pixel not

4
00:00:08,315 --> 00:00:11,820
skin, is the same as cost
calling a not skin pixel, skin.

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,880
We can re-, we can re-weight these
things if the costs are different.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,930
The likelihood ratio test
says basically, look.

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,280
It's just exactly what you think,

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,410
if the probability that it's
skin given the skew measurement,

9
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:27,180
is greater than the probability that
it's not skin, what am I going to do?

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,350
I am going to call it skin, right, that
assumes that the costs are, are equal.

11
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,570
So using Bayes rule,

12
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:39,990
p of skin given x is just p of
x given skin times p of skin.

13
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:45,230
P of not skin, given x, is p of x,
given not skin, times p of not skin.

14
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,640
So if this quantity is greater
than this whole quantity,

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,200
we're going to classify x as skin.

16
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,780
This is just a direct
use of Bayes' rule.

17
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,940
And as I said before, we would change
the weights on two sides of that

18
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,020
equation if, if the costs of making the,
the mistakes were not symmetric.

19
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,270
Allright?

20
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:05,970
So problem is that I really don't
know the prior of being skin.

21
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,080
Allright, I mean, I,
I dunno [INAUDIBLE] Where is the prior?

22
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,110
So, the one thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to assume is it's a constant.

23
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,780
I'm going to assume it has some number.

24
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,310
Allright?

25
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,050
So the prior for a whole bunch
of pixels that I'm looking at,

26
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:21,170
that are maybe of people or in an office
where there are people around.

27
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,620
The probability that something
is skin is some number.

28
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,680
Here's it's written as omega.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,070
So if you give me enough training data,

30
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:33,540
that is you pay enough undergraduates to
circle all the skin areas on an image or

31
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,790
you do Mechanical Turk on Amazon to
indicate, to have the world out there

32
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:42,140
for a penny and a half a click to
say what's skin and what's not skin.

33
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:47,120
You could estimate the prior
that any given pixel is skin.

34
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,580
So, with this training data I
can also estimate that prior and

35
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,270
I can measure those likelihoods, right?

36
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,900
Those are the likely densities,
those histograms that I built,

37
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,260
and remember I need two histograms.

38
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,490
I need P of X given skin.

39
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,690
What are the hues that
I get on the skin?

40
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,355
And P of X given not skin.

41
00:02:05,355 --> 00:02:07,590
Allright, so with that same
training data that I used for

42
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:13,160
estimating the prior, I can also
estimate my likelihoods, allright.

43
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,910
Which means I can more or
less come up with a rule.

44
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:20,070
Basically what I'm going to do is, I've
got my priors, I've got my likelihoods,

45
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:24,570
so I can just evaluate
p of x skin given x.

46
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,160
And if it's bigger than some number,
some theta, okay?

47
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm going to classify this
thing as skin, allright?

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,880
That's it.

49
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,780
Given some new image,
I want to label all my pixels.

50
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,060
And here is a picture, this is
actually a picture of Gary Bradsky and

51
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,230
the thing on the right is showing you
the probability of something being skin.

52
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,770
And Gary actually was using this to
build perceptual user interface where

53
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,360
you can move your head around And
the world that you

54
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,950
are looking at in some virtual rendering
will change as you move your, your head.

55
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:59,000
And in fact here's two more pictures
showing you the orientation, right so

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,040
here it's pretty much straight up,
here he's, he's turned his head and

57
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,280
all it's doing is tracking the skin
pixels of his face, that's all, alright?

58
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,920
And in fact, Gary made use of this in
a cool little, track, remember we talked

59
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,450
about mean shift tracking just recently
actually, just a couple of lectures ago.

60
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,830
Gary did sort of a different
version of that called cam shift,

61
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,770
which was maybe a little easier to
implement sometimes, that's a pretty

62
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:28,140
highly cited paper, and it was basically
using these color distributions.

63
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,500
In order to be able to track your
head and change what was rendering.

64
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,470
In fact, the picture on your right comes
from his paper, where they were using

65
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,470
the Quake engine for
controlling a first-person shooter, and

66
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:43,870
if you just turned your head, okay, the
thing would just movie with you, okay?

67
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,430
And it was just done by,
by tracking the skin pixels.
