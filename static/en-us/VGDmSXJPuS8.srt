00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,980
They found that students who were not asked to list their race performed well,

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,284
and as for the students who were asked to list their race they found that

3
00:00:07,284 --> 00:00:11,036
African American students became really anxious and performed poorly on their

4
00:00:11,036 --> 00:00:16,896
test. This is what we meant earlier about stereo types possibly perpetuating

5
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:20,581
themselves, here we see that stereotypes can influence an individual to behave

6
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:26,964
in a way that confirms the stereotype. So why is this important? Well, think of

7
00:00:26,964 --> 00:00:31,239
a stereotype such as girls don't do well in math or science. Or men aren't

8
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:35,147
emotionally aware. If you're in one of these categories, for example a girl,

9
00:00:35,147 --> 00:00:38,929
and you're aware of the stereotype it can actually influence your overall

10
00:00:38,929 --> 00:00:44,030
performance. This is quite fascinating and important to be aware of because the

11
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,254
stereotype girls are not good at math might prevent girls from going into a

12
00:00:47,254 --> 00:00:50,686
field that's heavy in math or even may cause individual girls to perform poorly

13
00:00:50,686 --> 00:00:57,280
on a math exams. Can you think of any stereotype groups that you may belong to?

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,578
And how this could possibly affect your performance on different tasks? This is

15
00:01:01,578 --> 00:01:04,946
a great topic for the discussion forums. However, it's a sensitive topic so

16
00:01:04,946 --> 00:01:08,473
please be respectful. Now, let's go to Susan who has an example for us.
