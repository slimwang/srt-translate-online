1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,100
So, for step one, in your layout file,

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:08,660
add an instance of
com.google.android.gms.SignInButton.

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,850
Then also add two more normal buttons,
that don't have to be the Sign In

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:15,070
button, and label them Sign Out and
Revoke Access.

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,150
You saw them in the UI earlier.

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,200
When you're done with this,
check this box.
