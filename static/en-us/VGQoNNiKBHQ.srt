1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,763
The answer is, the curve I'm calling D, which is this purple one up here.

2
00:00:04,763 --> 00:00:09,568
Replacing x with x minus 2, meant a shift 2 to the right, from the original

3
00:00:09,568 --> 00:00:14,470
equation, y equals x squared, who's graph is this grey one right here. And

4
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:19,368
replacing y with y minus 3, meant shifting that curve up 3, so if we move this

5
00:00:19,368 --> 00:00:24,112
curve over 2 and then up 3, we end up with this purple one, right here. Note

6
00:00:24,112 --> 00:00:28,784
that just as we saw in the example with Grant, we replace x with something else

7
00:00:28,784 --> 00:00:33,164
like x minus 2 in this case, that entire quantity has the same operations

8
00:00:33,164 --> 00:00:37,796
applied to it, as x had. So this entire thing is squared, not just the x part.
