00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,110
Here in the presentPreview method you
can see that once we have the caption,

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,570
we need to recreate the GIF
following these steps.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,480
Here in this line we recreate
a new instance of Regift.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,730
After that, we create a new
GIF including the caption and

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,270
save it to a URL variable.

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:23,570
With the URL to the newGif,
we create an instance of the GIF class.

7
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,690
Then we assign that instance of the GIF
class to the preview view controllers

8
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,260
GIF property and

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,020
push the preview ViewController
onto the navigation stack.
