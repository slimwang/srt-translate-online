If you said 10, nice work. This is a little bit tricky, so let's walk through

2
00:00:04,145 --> 00:00:07,896
how to actually do this. I'm going to show you two ways to find the common

3
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:11,836
denominator. The first way is listing out the multiples. I have 5 for one

4
00:00:11,848 --> 00:00:15,919
denominator, and I have 10 for the other. I'm going to start by listing out the

5
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:21,581
multiples of 5. I have 5, then 10, then 15, 20, and so on. To get to the next

6
00:00:21,593 --> 00:00:27,591
multiple, I just add 5. For 10, I can list out its multiples as well. 10, 20,

7
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:33,965
30, 40, and 50. And it keeps going. To find the denominator, I want the lowest

8
00:00:33,977 --> 00:00:39,941
number that both 5 and 10 go into. When I think about the lowest number they

9
00:00:39,953 --> 00:00:45,086
both go into. I see that it's 10. So I know I'm going to need to split this bar

10
00:00:45,098 --> 00:00:49,878
into tenths, and this one into 10ths. Luckily, this one's already in tenths.

11
00:00:49,987 --> 00:00:54,839
Another way to find the common denominator is to find the factors of 5 and 10.

12
00:00:54,948 --> 00:00:59,756
I'm going to use a factor tree. I know the common factors for 5 and 10 are 5. So

13
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:04,769
I put that in the middle. The other factors are 5, or 5 and 1. Because 5 times 1

14
00:01:04,782 --> 00:01:09,915
makes 5. The other factor of 10 has to be 2, because 5 times 2 makes 10. If I

15
00:01:09,927 --> 00:01:15,115
multiply all these numbers together, 1 times 5 times 2, I get 10. Either way, I

16
00:01:15,127 --> 00:01:17,665
can still find the common denominator.
