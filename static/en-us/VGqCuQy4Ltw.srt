1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So let's go over the answer to this

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
or 1 possible answer together.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We're trying to write a program to interpret

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
if-then-else statements,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and the big concept here about control flow is

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
that we don't want to execute both the then branch

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and also the else branch.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Instead, we'll have to pick one.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So the first think I'm going to do is evaluate

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
the conditional expression in the same

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
environment in the same set of evaluations

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
to variables that we currently have.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If it comes out true, I'll want to execute the then statements.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
If it comes out false, I'll want to execute the else statements,

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and if you like, this if statement is

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
the same as one where I checked to see if

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
the result of evaluating the expression is equal to true,

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
but if you have a little experience with propositional logic,

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
that's actually the same as just checking

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
the value of this variable directly.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So if the conditional expression evaluates to true,

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I will evaluate all of the statements in the then branch.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
In our running example, that was A and B.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
In our current environment there haven't been any intervening

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
assignment statements so the value of the variables hasn't changed.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Otherwise, if the value of the conditional

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
expression wasn't true,

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
presumably it was false, we'll go over here

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
to the else branch, evaluate the else statements

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
in the same environment,

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and note that no matter what happens,

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
we're either evaluating the then statements

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
or the else statements, but not both,

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and that decision is made based on the

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
value of the conditional expression, and that's it.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
These 4 lines suffice to evaluate

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
an if-then-else statement in java script.
