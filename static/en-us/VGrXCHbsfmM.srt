1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Because fluid dynamics is so hard,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
many people try to come up with toy models to at least get a glimpse

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
of what's happening.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
One of these toy models--a particularly interesting one--is the Lorenz system.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
By the way, this name is not to be confused with that of the physicist who spelled with "tz."

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This is what is described by this model.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
There is a layer of incompressible liquid between a surface of constant high temperature

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and a surface of constant low temperature.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We've got some melting ice-cubes here.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The velocity field in that liquid is described by three highly abstract parameters,

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
called x, y, and z.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
They describe the relative amount of different sorts of motion.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Even though this is a very sketchy and abstract description,

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
some people have succeeded in implementing these equations

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
with an actual water wheel.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The idea about studying these equations is that they may be telling us something

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
about every system in which convection is present.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
When we plot the solutions of the Lorenz system in 3D this is what we get--

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
a very intricate butterfly-like pattern.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Here we're seeing two solutions--one in green and one in blue--

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
starting from almost the same point--something to explore in the next section.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The trajectories make some turns on one ring, then jump to the other ring,

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
jump back to the first ring and so on.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The number of turns they take per ring seems to be almost unpredictable.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
There is one more thing.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Even though both trajectories have almost the same starting point,

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
you can see that they quickly diverge in the course of time.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We're going to study that in the next segment.
