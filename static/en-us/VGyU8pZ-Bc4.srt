1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,774
The correct answer is the first one. The 1st mystery demo gives a precise draw

2
00:00:03,774 --> 00:00:08,080
order. First the blue object, then red, then green. The 2nd mystery program

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,960
sorts the objects in the opposite order that we'd want to use for the painters

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,866
algorithm. It orders them so that the closest are drawn first. While this order

5
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:18,550
is good when the z buffer's on, in that less shading computations are then

6
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,190
needed, it gives a consistently wrong look.
