00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,976
And the beginning of this lesson, we talked about classes and methods, and

2
00:00:03,976 --> 00:00:07,746
about the fact that a method should always belong to a particular class, who's

3
00:00:07,746 --> 00:00:14,748
objects are responsible for carrying it out. Sometimes that's not as easy as it

4
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:21,880
sounds. Let's go back to a program that you saw in lesson five. In the elevator

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,150
demo, we write in a number, and then we first checked whether it was a valid

6
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,630
integer, whether it was within range, and only then were we able to do any work

7
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,269
with it. It would be nice if we could put all of this code in a separate

8
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:41,153
method. And then I would like to call that method, in somewhat this fashion, so

9
00:00:41,153 --> 00:00:44,865
I want to read a number between 1 and 18, I want to read it from this scanner

10
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:51,409
and I want to have the prompt to be floor. And of course the reason I want that

11
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:55,189
is, then I can reuse the readBetween method again, when I want to read some

12
00:00:55,189 --> 00:01:03,294
other value that's maybe between one and 100 and maybe it's the temperature. So

13
00:01:03,294 --> 00:01:06,570
like so many of us, the readBetween method is probably wondering, where do I

14
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:14,220
belong? Well in which class do you think the readBetween method should be put?

15
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:20,200
The system class? The scanner class? The ElevatorDemo, or maybe somewhere else.

16
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,937
Just think about it and give me your best guess.
