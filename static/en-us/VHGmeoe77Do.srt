00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,160
Before we talk about how to move on
to high fidelity prototypes, and

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,290
bring new people in on the creation
process, I want to step back for

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:07,770
a moment and
talk about what you can now do.

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,780
You've learned the fundamentals
of an iterative process for

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,820
making a better prototype.

6
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,900
By repeating this cycle, you will arrive
at a great prototype for a great app.

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,940
And you'll accrue feedback,
both positive and negative.

8
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,320
Also, remember from the product design
course, you may use your design sprint

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,850
skills to create new features or
parts of your product.

10
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,350
We've only gone along with you for
two iterations of this process, and

11
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,780
it's important to give yourself
room to iterate, learn and grow.

12
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,930
Many great apps went through 5, 10,

13
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,785
15 cycles of this process
before being built.

14
00:00:38,785 --> 00:00:41,520
These cycles of prototyping
allow you to fail quickly and

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,090
get those bad designs out of the way.

16
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,670
Remember that every time
you go through cycle,

17
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,090
there are a few steps
you need to follow.

18
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,650
Define what information
you are looking to find.

19
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,990
Modify your current prototype to match
whatever feedback you've already gotten.

20
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,520
Put your prototype in front
of three to five users.

21
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,140
Collect their feedback.

22
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,850
And then analyze the feedback to see
whether you got the right information.

23
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,030
As you get better at this process,
you'll benefit from learning more tools

24
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,870
in order to build the right prototype
for the right step in the process.

25
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,380
We'll spend the next few videos
talking about those tools.
