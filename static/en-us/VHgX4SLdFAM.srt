00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,683
So I want to start by showing you two paragraphs. Here's the first one. They're

2
00:00:03,683 --> 00:00:07,362
all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot. He noticed once

3
00:00:07,362 --> 00:00:11,538
even before he was introduced. When I was in the DBC with Poldy laughing and

4
00:00:11,538 --> 00:00:15,868
trying to listen, I was waggling, my foot. We both order two teas and plain

5
00:00:15,868 --> 00:00:19,580
bread, and butter and I saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters, when

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:23,060
I stood up and asked the girl, where it was, what do I care with it dropping

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,714
out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy, takes you half an hour

8
00:00:26,714 --> 00:00:30,368
to let down, wetting all myself, always, with some brand new fad every other

9
00:00:30,368 --> 00:00:38,302
week. Here's the second one. This creation in which we live, began with the

10
00:00:38,302 --> 00:00:43,352
Dominant Nature as an Identification Body. With a completed evolutionary Strong

11
00:00:43,352 --> 00:00:48,406
Material creation in a Major Body Resistance Force. And is fulfilling the

12
00:00:48,406 --> 00:00:52,111
Nature Identification in a Like Weaker Material Identification creation in

13
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:55,531
which two major bodies have already fulfilled radio body balances, and

14
00:00:55,531 --> 00:01:02,652
embodying. A third material identification embodiment of both. So, what do you

15
00:01:02,652 --> 00:01:06,584
think about these two paragraphs? Is either one creative, or both, or are

16
00:01:06,584 --> 00:01:10,330
neither? Check whichever one you feel is creative.
