1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,450
So we talked about security planing sort
of, consist of many different parts,

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,530
the last one was we
talked about controls.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:12,160
Next, we talk what we call
a security policy that you have.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,800
Who talking daily about
enterprise security policy.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,690
You could have policies at national
level or something like that.

6
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:23,600
Federal government may have one
across its different agencies, and

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,570
each agency may have its own and things
like that, but if you think about this

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,370
in the context of an enterprise,
security planning requires that you have

9
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:35,700
some sort of a security policy,
what exactly is a security policy.

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,450
A security policy really sort
of at the high level articulate,

11
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,850
what are the security objectives are?

12
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,470
What is that want to?

13
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,270
What goals do we have?

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,752
We want to maintain confidentiality.

15
00:00:48,752 --> 00:00:51,970
We want to make sure that
sensitive is not disclosed

16
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,060
to parties not authorized to see it.

17
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,620
We want our systems to be available.

18
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,900
We don't want our data to be corrupted.

19
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,340
We don't want sensitive
data to get into the hands.

20
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,430
We want to be legally compliant or
whatever.

21
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,220
Cause you can think of all the kind of
security objectives somebody might have.

22
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,920
Which actually motivate
what a policy is.

23
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,230
So often this high level articulation
requires it would include

24
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:19,310
some sort of a legal, business and
regulatory rationale for

25
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,610
why the policy has what it does.

26
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,980
While legal and regulatory you
don't really have lot of choice.

27
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:29,370
Business, reasons tell you why it's good
for the enterprise or for the company.

28
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,470
And what's good for the company,
of course, is good for its employees.

29
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:36,620
So that's the articulation of
the outlined reasons why we want to

30
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,020
have the kind of policy that we do.

31
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:44,090
So the policy is really what you
should do and what should not be done.

32
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,070
So we talked about passwords,
for example.

33
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,830
What kind of password you should choose,
what the size and

34
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,300
length of your password,
things like that.

35
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,540
We may have web and
email policy, for example,

36
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,260
can use surf the web
while you're at work.

37
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:01,800
The policy actually might say, if
something were to go wrong there is some

38
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,580
security event that occurs, what sort of
response is that we're going to have.

39
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,930
Do you need,
if your machine gets compromised.

40
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,300
Do you had informed somebody for
example.

41
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,680
The security policy or
the dos and don'ts, and

42
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,470
we saw some examples of those, of course
they may have to do with prevention, so

43
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,750
bad things don't happen.

44
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,470
They may have to do with detection, so
compromise how you find out that there

45
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,430
was a breach may have to do with how
we respond to that sort of a thing and

46
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:35,320
how remediation occurs, and of course
it must address the concerns and

47
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,650
impact and
that could any of these things have.

48
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:44,050
So rationale, articulation of why things
need to be the way the policy says

49
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:49,600
they should be and if it doesn't sort
of address the concerns and needs and

50
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,100
impact it may have on users of course
the policy may not be well accepted.
