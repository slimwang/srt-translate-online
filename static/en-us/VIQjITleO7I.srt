1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This brings us to the end of unit 3.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
As long as we have a channel with integrity, we have a solution to our key distribution problem.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We can use the Diffie-Hellman protocol where at the end of the protocol

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
we've established a shared secret.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Once we're established that shared key we can use it to send messages,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
using our symmetric encryption operations from the previous two units.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We still haven't solved many of the important problems that Diffie and Hellman identified

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
in this 1976 paper.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The one that I highlighted at the beginning was digital signatures.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We can't do digital signatures this way because the key is shared between Alice and Bob.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That couldn't be used to sign something since either Alice or Bob

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
would be able to make that signature.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
To have digital signatures, what we need is asymmetric crypotography.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That's the main topic for Unit 4. Hope to see you there.
