1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,564
If you remember from the lesson on learning, we talked with Dr. Zeligs. She

2
00:00:04,564 --> 00:00:08,686
took some time out to talk with us about animals and personalities. So before I

3
00:00:08,686 --> 00:00:11,502
move forward, let's take a look at what she had to say about the personalities

4
00:00:11,502 --> 00:00:16,224
of some of the animals that she's worked with. So some people are surprised to

5
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:19,302
know that animals have distinct personalities. And you have a ton of experience

6
00:00:19,302 --> 00:00:21,798
with animals, so can you tell us a little bit about your experience with their

7
00:00:21,798 --> 00:00:26,582
personalities? Now, what's amazing is animals run the same gambit of

8
00:00:26,582 --> 00:00:31,811
personalities as you see with human beings. You have animals who are really

9
00:00:31,811 --> 00:00:35,764
excited and engaged and task-driven. You have animals who are really

10
00:00:35,764 --> 00:00:39,537
relaxation-driven, who like to sit back and enjoy and be quiet. You know, what

11
00:00:39,537 --> 00:00:46,934
motivates someone runs across the gambit of things. So some are, are motivated

12
00:00:46,934 --> 00:00:52,170
by curiosity and some are motivated by food and some are motivated by activity.

13
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,394
And all of these things make up some of what inspires, and then what makes up

14
00:00:55,394 --> 00:00:59,800
their personality, what, what attracts their attention. And what kinds of

15
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,465
things they choose to engage in. So Sharkie, the sea lion is one of the most

16
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:11,486
focused working women I have ever met in my life. And she would like to just

17
00:01:11,486 --> 00:01:17,615
have her job going on 12 to 14 hours a day. And as long as we could focus on

18
00:01:17,615 --> 00:01:22,798
making sure she's a star 12 to 14 hour, she's a diva. That, that's her, her the

19
00:01:22,798 --> 00:01:27,341
best life in the world for her. Callie on the other hand is a little bit more

20
00:01:27,341 --> 00:01:32,610
cuddly, she's a little bit more playful. She's not so much about needing to do

21
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,195
a task as she is just being. She's got that relationship thing. She really

22
00:01:37,195 --> 00:01:41,490
wants to be with her best friends. And that's kind of what motivates her.

23
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,194
>> What kind of things do they do when, like, if Sharkie is not working. What does

24
00:01:45,194 --> 00:01:48,676
she do when she wants to be working? Like, does she try to get your attention,

25
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:49,280
or.

26
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,587
>> Yeah, Sharkie will, will do all kinds of behaviors to try to get your

27
00:01:53,587 --> 00:01:58,132
attention. And she'll also take out her frustration on her environment when

28
00:01:58,132 --> 00:02:01,964
it's not going her way. She's got that real diva thing, you know? So she'll

29
00:02:01,964 --> 00:02:06,132
take her toys, and beat them side to side. Darnit, darnit, why isn't it my turn

30
00:02:06,132 --> 00:02:10,238
to be paid attention to. She'll give herself a job by swimming really

31
00:02:10,238 --> 00:02:13,694
frantically or doing spectacular jumps or, you know, trying to keep herself

32
00:02:13,694 --> 00:02:18,457
busy. She's definitely not a couch potato animal and then other the other hand,

33
00:02:18,457 --> 00:02:23,397
I've known loads of animals that sit back and relax and chill out when. When

34
00:02:23,397 --> 00:02:26,320
it's not their turn, they're perfectly fine with that.

35
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,442
>> How about any other types of animals other than sea lions?

36
00:02:28,442 --> 00:02:32,170
>> It's the same. I mean I can't say I've ever worked with an amoeba but even the

37
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,509
quote unquote lesser animals that I work with, even fish I have trained have

38
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:40,341
distinct personalities. Some of them want to hover over here and like this kind

39
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:43,764
of security and feel like they need security. And others of them are

40
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:48,840
extroverted. And are very attentive and curious. And that's, that's with

41
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,724
monkeys, with tortoises with otters, with everything that you can imagine. They

42
00:02:53,724 --> 00:02:57,420
have just a different natural set of ways of interacting with their

43
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,314
environment. And you see it in terms of whether they act out in their

44
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:06,523
environment or whether they're more wary. How playful they are. How active they

45
00:03:06,523 --> 00:03:10,780
are. What kinds of things they like and don't like. So where you see the most

46
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,749
extreme of personality is the long lived super social animals. And so that's

47
00:03:15,749 --> 00:03:20,165
because natural history sort of require the most complexity in order to work

48
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:26,374
with their world. Their broad social world is, is a big component of it. So

49
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:31,650
that's where you see the, just the most diversity of it. Less, less programming

50
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,980
and more learning from the environment is what's, what's going on. You see, the

51
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,319
sort of, least personality in the animals that have a much more fixed action

52
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:44,867
pattern type of life history. So, a snake or a lesser bird. But even in those

53
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:49,151
you'll see preferences and attitudes towards collecting prey you know, certain

54
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:54,630
snakes will need it to move and other snakes don't really care. And you know

55
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,680
and what they like the warm rock but as long as it's high up here or that, you

56
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,890
know. So there's, there's all of that and it goes across the animal spectrum

57
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:02,999
for sure.
