We now know how pipelines work and how they need to balance the increasing clock

00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:10,410
frequency versus the stalls and flushes caused by hazards. Nowadays almost every

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,110
processor uses pipelining. So, we will use

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,239
our pipelining knowledge over and over as

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,100
we look at some of the more advanced topics in the next few lessons.
