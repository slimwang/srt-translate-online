00:00:02,643 --> 00:00:05,225
My gosh, you are so annoying.

3
00:00:05,225 --> 00:00:07,860
>> Ow, ow, I didn't, why am I.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:08,570
You.

5
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:09,810
Stop.

6
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,600
>> Roommates, cut it out.

7
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,180
All right.

8
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,300
Now.
What has gotten into you two?

9
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,850
>> Some anonymous owner has
gotten into my grocery list and

10
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,310
changed it all to components.

11
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,160
>> I swear, I didn't do anything.

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,410
Lila, we need a way for each of us
to have a separate shopping list.

13
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,010
>> All right, all right.

14
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,410
Well, I'm going to work on user
accounts in the next version, so

15
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:30,860
I can't do that right now.

16
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,110
But what I could do is give
you guys multiple lists.

17
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,055
>> Yeah, that sounds reasonable.

18
00:00:35,055 --> 00:00:36,055
>> Fine.

19
00:00:36,055 --> 00:00:39,071
>> Good, now why don't you two make up.

20
00:00:39,071 --> 00:00:41,211
>> I guess I can forgive you.

21
00:00:41,211 --> 00:00:44,191
>> Good, Grace?

22
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:46,110
There, isn't that beautiful?

23
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,840
All right,
now we can all get back to work.
