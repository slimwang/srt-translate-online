00:00:00,029 --> 00:00:02,012
[Dave] Welcome back for Unit 2!

2
00:00:02,012 --> 00:00:04,379
I hope everyone is getting confidence in the things you learned in unit 1.

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:08,429
We're going to continue to build on those in this unit as well as in rest of the course.

4
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:12,845
Our main goal for this unit is to make the web crawler, instead of just finding one link in the page,

5
00:00:12,845 --> 00:00:14,878
to find all the links on a page,

6
00:00:14,878 --> 00:00:18,163
so that we can follow these links and collect more and more pages on the web.

7
00:00:18,163 --> 00:00:21,111
To do that we need two big new concepts in computer science.

8
00:00:21,111 --> 00:00:26,313
The first is procedures. Procedures are a way to package code so that we can reuse it more easily.

9
00:00:26,313 --> 00:00:32,929
The second is control. We need a way to be able to make decisions, and to do repetition, to find all those links on a page.

10
00:00:32,929 --> 00:00:38,896
What we saw at the end of Unit 1 was a way to extract the first URL from a web page--

11
00:00:38,896 --> 00:00:42,063
that's great--we could find the first target.

12
00:00:42,063 --> 00:00:43,829
But if we want to build a good crawler,

13
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:45,313
we don't just care about the first one,

14
00:00:45,313 --> 00:00:47,762
we care about all of the links on the page.

15
00:00:47,762 --> 00:00:49,662
We need to extract all of those links--

16
00:00:49,662 --> 00:00:51,945
figure out where all of those links point to--

17
00:00:51,945 --> 00:00:55,147
so we'll find many more pages to crawl than just the first one.

18
00:00:55,147 --> 00:00:58,095
So, that's the goal for this class as far as building a web browser.

19
00:00:58,095 --> 00:01:01,480
To do that, we're going to learn two really big ideas in computer science.

20
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,695
The first is about procedures,

21
00:01:03,695 --> 00:01:06,579
and that's a way to package up code so we can use it

22
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:09,445
in a much more useful way than we could before.

23
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:11,345
The second is about control.

24
00:01:11,345 --> 00:01:14,445
Control structures will give us a way to keep going

25
00:01:14,445 --> 00:01:16,612
to find all the links on a page.

26
00:01:16,612 --> 00:01:20,394
So, let's remember the code we had at the end of Unit 1.

27
00:01:20,394 --> 00:01:24,112
We solved this problem of extracting the first URL from the page--

28
00:01:24,112 --> 00:01:28,512
we assumed the page was initialized to the contents of some web page.

29
00:01:28,512 --> 00:01:31,112
We initialized the variable "start_link"

30
00:01:31,112 --> 00:01:34,612
to the result of invoking "find" on "page,"

31
00:01:34,612 --> 00:01:37,796
passing in the start of the link tag.

32
00:01:37,796 --> 00:01:40,362
Then, we initialized the variable "start_quote"

33
00:01:40,362 --> 00:01:43,545
to the result of finding, in the page,

34
00:01:43,545 --> 00:01:47,211
the first quote following that link tag.

35
00:01:47,211 --> 00:01:49,946
Then, we initialized the variable "end_quote"

36
00:01:49,946 --> 00:01:53,112
to the result of invoking "find" on "page,"

37
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:56,762
to find the first quote following the start quote.

38
00:01:56,762 --> 00:01:58,929
And, then, we assigned to the variable "url"--

39
00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:01,045
extracting from the page--

40
00:02:01,045 --> 00:02:03,396
from the character after the "start_quote,"

41
00:02:03,396 --> 00:02:06,112
to the character just before the "end_quote,"

42
00:02:06,112 --> 00:02:08,961
we could print out that URL.

43
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:10,161
This worked to find the first URL on the page.

44
00:02:10,161 --> 00:02:15,029
If we wanted to find the second one,

45
00:02:15,029 --> 00:02:17,529
we could do it all again.

46
00:02:17,529 --> 00:02:20,262
We could say, now we want to advance

47
00:02:20,262 --> 00:02:23,629
so we're only looking at the rest of the page.

48
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:26,578
We could do that by updating the variable "page,"

49
00:02:26,578 --> 00:02:33,329
assigning to it the result of the rest of the page, starting from "end_quote"--

50
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:36,146
and, remember, when there's a blank after the colon

51
00:02:36,146 --> 00:02:40,046
that means select from this position, to the very end--

52
00:02:40,046 --> 00:02:41,778
and then we can do all the same stuff.

53
00:02:41,778 --> 00:02:45,731
We'll do "start_link" again; ...

54
00:02:45,731 --> 00:02:55,444
we'll do "start_quote" again; ...

55
00:02:55,444 --> 00:02:58,063
Now we've got code that's going to print out the first URL--

56
00:02:58,063 --> 00:03:00,579
keep going, updating the variable "page"--

57
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:02,094
and then doing the exact same thing--

58
00:03:02,094 --> 00:03:03,879
printing out the second URL.

59
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,612
If we wanted to print out the first three,

60
00:03:05,612 --> 00:03:27,563
we could do it again...

61
00:03:27,563 --> 00:03:31,746
So now, we've got code to print out the first three

62
00:03:31,746 --> 00:03:32,995
URL's on the page--

63
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:35,029
let's scroll all the way up--so you've got--

64
00:03:35,029 --> 00:03:39,829
print out the first one--keep going--

65
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:44,445
print out the second one--keep going--

66
00:03:44,445 --> 00:03:46,879
so this can go on forever.

67
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,744
The reason we have computers

68
00:03:49,744 --> 00:03:52,730
is to save humans from doing lots of tedious work.

69
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,812
We don't want to make humans do lots of tedious work--

70
00:03:54,812 --> 00:03:57,829
certainly, typing this out, over and over again,

71
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:59,594
would be really tedious,

72
00:03:59,594 --> 00:04:01,646
and it wouldn't really even work that well.

73
00:04:01,646 --> 00:04:03,695
We have pages with hundreds of links,

74
00:04:03,695 --> 00:04:07,045
but there are other pages with only one or two links.

75
00:04:07,045 --> 00:04:09,711
So, it wouldn't make sense to copy this hundreds of times.

76
00:04:09,711 --> 00:04:12,045
There's always going to be some web page that has more links

77
00:04:12,045 --> 00:04:13,813
than we have copies of it--

78
00:04:13,813 --> 00:04:16,777
and any page that has fewer copies, we're going to run into problems

79
00:04:16,777 --> 00:04:20,978
because we're not going to be finding any of those links.

80
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:24,979
So, our goal today is to solve all of those problems.
