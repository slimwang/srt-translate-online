1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,925
We want the value of x when y equals 850, since remeber y in this situation

2
00:00:04,937 --> 00:00:10,000
stands for the total cost to Grant. And x stands for the number of gallons of

3
00:00:10,012 --> 00:00:15,175
cleaning fluid he'll get. If we follow the line y equals 850, over to where it

4
00:00:15,187 --> 00:00:20,525
intersects other lines, we'll be finding the points on those lines that have a y

5
00:00:20,537 --> 00:00:25,679
coordinate of 850. From there, we can find the x-coordinate that goes along with

6
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:28,294
those points, and we'll have our solution.
