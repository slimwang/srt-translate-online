00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,561
The equation that we ended up with at the
end of the last quiz for Grant's total

2
00:00:03,573 --> 00:00:07,317
future earnings, taking into account the
two updates to the number of orders he has

3
00:00:07,329 --> 00:00:10,681
received, is definitely helpful. But I
think that we can still make it look

4
00:00:10,693 --> 00:00:14,292
better. In fact, I know we can because I
see that there are some like terms here

5
00:00:14,304 --> 00:00:17,851
that have not yet been combined. Using
your understanding of the distributive

6
00:00:17,863 --> 00:00:21,703
property and just simplifying expressions
in general, please simply this expression

7
00:00:21,715 --> 00:00:25,215
as much as you can. You'll notice that I
actually, in the last quiz, already did

8
00:00:25,227 --> 00:00:27,918
part of it for you. So, see if you can
remember how to do this.
