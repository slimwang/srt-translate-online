00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,540
Well it turns out it would be best to subtract 30a from both sides. I know

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,380
there's a lot of different options here, so lets see why. We've seen factoring

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,418
quadratic equations in this form. The variable was x and the numbers were a, b,

4
00:00:10,418 --> 00:00:19,179
and c. In this case, my variable isn't x. It's a. And my numbers are 2, 30, and

5
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:25,504
112. If I can move this 30a to the other side, then I'll have my quadratic in

6
00:00:25,504 --> 00:00:30,774
this form. 30a is not like with a squared or 112. So, I'm going to list it here,

7
00:00:30,774 --> 00:00:35,436
so that way it falls in the middle of the 2 terms. I'll get 0 on the right, and

8
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:41,051
then 2a squared, minus 30a, plus 112 on the left. Now this is something I'm

9
00:00:41,051 --> 00:00:43,113
familiar with and we can factor it.
