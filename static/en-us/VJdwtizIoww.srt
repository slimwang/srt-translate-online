1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,557
This app right here doesn't know
anything about the Firebase SDK right

2
00:00:03,557 --> 00:00:03,859
now.

3
00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:07,772
I'm going to quickly fix that by adding
a few key dependencies to Gradle.

4
00:00:07,772 --> 00:00:09,870
In the project's root Gradle file,

5
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:13,870
I'm going to add the required
Google services plugin.

6
00:00:13,869 --> 00:00:17,829
Over here in the documentation for
adding Firebase to your Android project,

7
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:19,949
I could scroll down and
get that exact plugin.

8
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:22,759
So I'm going to copy it,
and I'll add it right here.

9
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:26,381
Now I'm going to go to
the apps build.gradle file.

10
00:00:26,381 --> 00:00:29,080
And I'm going to scroll
down to the bottom, and

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,634
again copying from the documentation,
I'm going to get this

12
00:00:32,634 --> 00:00:37,618
apply GoogleServices plugin, and
I'll add it right here at the bottom.

13
00:00:37,618 --> 00:00:41,570
The Google Services plugin is what
reads the configuration information for

14
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,469
the google-services.json
file that you added before.

15
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:45,310
Now once you go ahead and

16
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:50,820
sync, you effectively added the
Firebase SDK dependencies to your app.

17
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,090
If you scroll down further
in the documentation,

18
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,210
you'll see this list of
available libraries.

19
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,000
These are further dependencies that
you'll need to add when you want to

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,869
enable certain features.

21
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:00,429
So cool,

22
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:04,299
at this point you're pretty much ready
to start using Firebase in your app.

23
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:08,009
So let's get our users chatting by
adding our first Firebase feature,

24
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,290
the Realtime Database.
