00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,010
Looking closely at this screen shot,
we have two text views and one button.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,850
The reason why I say we have two text
views is because they are styled

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,390
a little bit differently.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,920
For example, the text color is
different for each of these.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,330
So let's fill that in for
this first step.

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,030
The second step is position the views.

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,040
The question asks which view
group will be the root view.

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,160
From this screenshot it looks
like the views are shown

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,290
in a vertical column, like this.

10
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,060
So, from what we learned in lesson one,

11
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,900
a vertical linear layout
would be a smart choice.

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,950
So, I wrote down that we need a linear
layout as a parent view group

13
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,730
with three children views and we'll
set the orientation to be vertical.

14
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,310
If you said relative layout here,
that's okay.

15
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,740
That would work as well but

16
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,180
it would just be a lot more code
to have to define view IDs for

17
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,700
each of these and then position
them relative to each other.

18
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,510
So for
our use case a vertical linear layout

19
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,720
would be a little more concise and
easier to use.

20
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,930
Lastly, for
step 3 we want to style the views.

21
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,220
For the most part these views
look pretty standard but

22
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,070
we can make some slight adjustments.

23
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,080
For example, we notice that the quantity
header here is in all caps.

24
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,060
The quantity number down
here is in black font color

25
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,590
as opposed to the grey default color.

26
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,850
We also notice that there's a little
bit of space in between these views.

27
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,760
Which can be accomplished
with padding or margin.
