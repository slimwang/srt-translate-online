00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,700
As we wrap up, I want to welcome
you one more time to CS6460,

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,560
Educational Technology.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,390
We'll be running most of the class
through announcements and

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,660
through interactions on the forum, so
I'd recommend you check those often.

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,780
And in fact, I'd really recommend
you check in at least once per day,

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,350
if only for a few minutes.

7
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:17,880
Part of the goal for this course is to
develop a community of collaborators,

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,900
and communities really
thrive on frequent activity.

9
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,370
You'll definitely see us there and
we hope to see you there as well.

10
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,260
Beyond that, we're really excited
to see what you come up with, and

11
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,120
we're looking forward
to getting started.

12
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:28,640
I hope you are, too.
