00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,172
Multiplication of expressions was something we focused on, pretty early on in

2
00:00:03,172 --> 00:00:08,486
the course. But, division didn't come up until much more recently. Let's say

3
00:00:08,486 --> 00:00:13,880
this time, that f of x is equal to 2x cubed, plus 12x squared, minus 8x, minus

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:21,942
48. And g of x is equal to 2x minus 4. What do we get then if we say, f of x

5
00:00:21,942 --> 00:00:27,080
over g of x? Make sure, as before, to simplify your answer.
