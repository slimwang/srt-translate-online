Packages are for reducing coupling. A package encapsulates a set of names and

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:09,930
requires the programmer to explicitly import those names in order to

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,810
get access to them. So a module can't get access and

4
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:17,540
depend upon the names in another module unless it's been explicitly imported.
