1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,350
The third issue has to do with Extensions.

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:07,415
Components are often extended by adding new features.

3
00:00:07,415 --> 00:00:08,880
Recall that we met features and

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,290
features diagrams when we looked at architectural views.

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,338
When the vendors add new features complicating situations may arise.

6
00:00:16,338 --> 00:00:21,340
For example, the particular situation might require that there

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,650
be exactly one instance of that particular component.

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,410
This is sometimes called a singleton extension.

9
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,870
If there are multiple components involved, we might want to ensure that at

10
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,580
most one of the, one has this new feature added to it.

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,460
Related to that is what happens if there are parallel extensions of,

12
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,370
of multiple components in the same dimension.

13
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:43,810
If we do allow the same feature,

14
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,050
feature to be configured into multiple components, we may need to be aware of

15
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,430
the possibility of resource contention, if each version,

16
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,760
version of that component is trying to get access to the same resource.

17
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,880
Sometimes there are non-orthogonal extensions, and

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,780
we have to be careful of possible feature interactions,

19
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:04,569
if a customer configures in more than one new feature at the same time.

20
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:07,050
And then there are recursive extensions.

21
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:12,490
Some component models support adding components that can themselves be extended.

22
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,630
This may mean that the component vendor loses control of what

23
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,220
components are actually deployed.
