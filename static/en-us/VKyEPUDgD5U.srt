00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,558
The answer is the form of the equation. All of the equations on the left-hand

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:09,207
side start out with y equals, and then on the right-hand side, have a constant

3
00:00:09,219 --> 00:00:13,080
term and a term with x to the first in it. The two equations in this right-hand

4
00:00:13,092 --> 00:00:17,754
column do not fit the same form. We'll talk a lot more about the form that these

5
00:00:17,766 --> 00:00:19,843
equations are in as we move forward.
