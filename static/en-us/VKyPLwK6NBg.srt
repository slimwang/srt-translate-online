00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:02,123
Hey, Jeremy.

2
00:00:02,123 --> 00:00:06,360
What are you working on?

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,200
>> Just developing.

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,040
>> Really?

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,400
>> Yeah, it's actually going super well.

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,492
Thanks for all the help with Gradle.

7
00:00:14,492 --> 00:00:15,150
>> Sure.

8
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,640
>> Yeah, it's really helped
me keep my bill organized.

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,980
>> Well, I'm glad to help.

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,300
>> You know what?
I think I'm actually finished.

11
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,294
Well, nice work.

12
00:00:24,294 --> 00:00:28,775
>> Yeah, my plans for
world domination are complete.

13
00:00:28,775 --> 00:00:30,728
Thanks, Mark.

14
00:00:30,728 --> 00:00:35,130
Oh hey, do me a favor though,
will you meet me at the radio tower and

15
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,720
bring along some chicken wire,
a frying pan, and two AA batteries?

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,646
>> Sure.
>> All right.

17
00:00:40,646 --> 00:00:41,343
Thanks, Mark.

18
00:00:41,343 --> 00:00:42,560
You're the best.

19
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,060
>> Sure.
Wait, what?

20
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,640
Well, I hope you learned
something in this course.

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,570
Familiarity with Gradle
will serve you well,

22
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,600
no matter where your
development journey takes you.

23
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,620
Testing and build automation
make even the largest projects

24
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,980
easy to create and deploy.

25
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,967
This is Mark from Gradle, signing off.

26
00:01:00,802 --> 00:01:03,720
Jeremy, what'd you mean
by world domination?

27
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,541
What did you build?
