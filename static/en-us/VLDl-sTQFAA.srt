00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,850
Now let's begin the discussion on sexual attraction and the qualities we look

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:08,162
for in potential sexual partners. Now according to the sexual strategy theory,

3
00:00:08,162 --> 00:00:12,237
men and women approach relationships differently. And perhaps you can reflect

4
00:00:12,237 --> 00:00:16,501
upon this in some of your own relationships experiences. In terms of how you

5
00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:20,973
may have approached a relationship differently than your partner. We see that

6
00:00:20,973 --> 00:00:24,621
in almost all societies, people engage in one night stands, or what we like to

7
00:00:24,621 --> 00:00:30,422
call, short term meetings. We also have long term meetings, which include

8
00:00:30,422 --> 00:00:35,885
marriage or extended companionship. So our committed long term relationships

9
00:00:35,885 --> 00:00:41,437
often result in marriage. In one study conducted in the United States, they

10
00:00:41,437 --> 00:00:45,903
found that 86% of women by the age of 40 and 81% of men by the age of 40 will

11
00:00:45,903 --> 00:00:51,853
marry. If you recall from our earlier lesson on development, we had a question

12
00:00:51,853 --> 00:00:56,209
on the forums about the age your parents got married. And we discuss the change

13
00:00:56,209 --> 00:01:00,722
across generations, in regards to the age people marry. Now this is just one

14
00:01:00,722 --> 00:01:06,440
study in the United States. But long term relationships occur in most cultures.

15
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:11,059
They may do so at different times or ages, and for different reasons. For

16
00:01:11,059 --> 00:01:14,610
example in some cultures marriages are arranged, so the individuals have no say

17
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,706
in the matter. But in other cultures people often marry for love, that is they

18
00:01:18,706 --> 00:01:21,372
fall in love with one another and then they decide to spend the rest of their

19
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,270
lives together.
