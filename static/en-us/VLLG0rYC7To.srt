1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And the answer is 0.8.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
As I'm sure you noticed in the case where there is cancer, the possible test outcomes add up to 1.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
In the where there isn't cancer, the possible test outcomes add up to 1.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.
