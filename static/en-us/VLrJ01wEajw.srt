00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,296
The problem that we'll use for this lesson was one that was suggested by one of

2
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:08,508
our students for the make practice for unit two. And this is the one that we'll

3
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:12,352
use and it was a problem that was suggested by Matias Wexen from Sweden, as a

4
00:00:12,352 --> 00:00:17,002
practice problem for unit two. And here's how he stated the problem. This is

5
00:00:17,002 --> 00:00:20,479
days old number two and it says given your birthday and the current dates,

6
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:24,688
calculate you age in days. You have to beware about leap days. Dates are

7
00:00:24,688 --> 00:00:28,916
complicated things. And you can assume that the inputs are correct dates. And

8
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:33,268
then, there's an example here to say that, well, if you were born on January 1,

9
00:00:33,268 --> 00:00:37,200
2012, and the date today is January 2, 2012, you're 1 day old. So, this is a

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,038
great practice problem. Thanks, Matias for suggesting it. And it's generated

11
00:00:41,038 --> 00:00:44,482
lots of discussion on the forums. So, I wanted to step through how I would solve

12
00:00:44,482 --> 00:00:48,204
this problem. If you have not tried it yourself, I would strongly encourage you

13
00:00:48,204 --> 00:00:52,032
to do so. There's a link to the problem in the additional homework to try it

14
00:00:52,032 --> 00:00:55,221
yourself. And I'd suggest keeping notes on how you solve it. Whether you're able

15
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,940
to solve it or not, I hope you'll come back and watch the rest of this lesson.

16
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,800
If you got stuck, this lesson will give you some ideas of how to get unstuck.

17
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,424
And then, when you get unstuck, go back to trying to solve it on your own before

18
00:01:03,424 --> 00:01:06,750
continuing with the lesson. If you were able to solve it yourself, that's great.

19
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,928
This is quite a challenging problem. But I hope you'll still come back to see

20
00:01:09,928 --> 00:01:13,312
how I solve it. I think you'll, perhaps, learn some things from the way I would

21
00:01:13,312 --> 00:01:16,580
approach it and probably I can learn some things from the way you approached it.

22
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,658
So, I hope you'll post on the forum about how you approached it that was

23
00:01:19,658 --> 00:01:20,213
different.
