1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:01,880
Let's practice.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:06,370
For this quiz, I want you to try using
some properties that require units.

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,640
I've created this web
page as a sandbox for

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,330
you to sample different CSS properties.

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,970
I've also added some styling, so

6
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,075
that you can see the different
elements on the page.

7
00:00:16,075 --> 00:00:19,495
Mostly this includes, setting the height
of the elements to a hundred pixels and

8
00:00:19,495 --> 00:00:21,735
giving them unique background colors.

9
00:00:21,735 --> 00:00:22,705
To complete this quiz,

10
00:00:22,705 --> 00:00:27,045
you will need to set the width
of the first div to 100 pixels.

11
00:00:27,045 --> 00:00:30,370
The height of the second
div to 200 pixels.

12
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,830
The margin of the third div to one M and

13
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,930
the font size of
the forth div to two Ms.

14
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:37,430
Good luck.
