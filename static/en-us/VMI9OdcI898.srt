00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,838
But what if we want to divide by something other than a monomial? What if I

2
00:00:03,838 --> 00:00:08,035
wanted to do this? Here we're dividing a polynomial by a binomial. You might not

3
00:00:08,035 --> 00:00:12,045
know it, but you already have the skills needed to solve this problem. Let's

4
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:16,004
look at how. We're going to compare this to a division problem that you've seen

5
00:00:16,004 --> 00:00:20,602
before. We're going to divide 4 into 852, and I want you to fill in the boxes

6
00:00:20,602 --> 00:00:25,595
for the division problem. Don't just put the answers here. Complete everything

7
00:00:25,595 --> 00:00:27,944
as if you were doing the long division.
