00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,806
There are any number of ways to figure out how much light arrives at each pixel

2
00:00:03,806 --> 00:00:07,397
to form an image. In theory, you could fully simulate the world around you.

3
00:00:07,398 --> 00:00:11,497
Photons start from a light source, hit atoms, and they're reflected, absorbed,

4
00:00:11,497 --> 00:00:14,756
and so on. You would a camera in this scene, and whatever very few photons

5
00:00:14,756 --> 00:00:18,852
actually happen to enter the camera's lens would then determine the image. As

6
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:22,817
you might guess doing so would take a huge amount computation for even the most

7
00:00:22,817 --> 00:00:27,598
modest scene. A back of the envelope computation for a 40 watt bulb, shows that

8
00:00:27,598 --> 00:00:30,663
it emits about 10 to the 19th photons per second.
