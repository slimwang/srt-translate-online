1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,300
The first option actually is
the only one that is correct.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,510
As the system goes in complexity,

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,250
it's going to be difficult to cover
all executions because in testing,

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,090
you want to cover as many
possible executions as you can.

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:17,400
So, size, complexity grows,
this is going to be more difficult.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,100
Testing can actually never
show the absence of a problem.

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,670
So that it can not do.

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,290
So, we're not going to pick
the second option here.

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:29,650
It can show the existence of problems,
but not the absence of problems.

10
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:34,610
So, this and that we have here makes
the second option an incorrect option.
