1
00:00:00,069 --> 00:00:04,241
In the last quiz, we talked about the performance characteristics of the serial program.

2
00:00:04,241 --> 00:00:07,609
Now we're going to look at the performance characteristics of the parallel program.

3
00:00:07,609 --> 00:00:09,190
The same two questions.

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,249
How many multiplications will this code perform?

5
00:00:12,249 --> 00:00:16,027
And assuming that each multiplication operation takes 10 nanoseconds

6
00:00:16,027 --> 00:00:20,290
and we have enough GPU hardware resources to run all the multiplications in parallel

7
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,925
and everything else is free,

8
00:00:21,925 --> 00:00:24,728
how long will it take to compute the entire computation?
