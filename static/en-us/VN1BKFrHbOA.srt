1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,750
Both the web browsers and

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:05,230
web service are vulnerable,
because they need to execute or

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:09,168
generate dynamic content based on
user input, which can be malicious.

4
00:00:09,168 --> 00:00:14,190
In cross-site scripting, the attacker
injects a script into a website, and

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,730
the user's browser executes this script.

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,420
In cross-site request forgery,

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,060
the attacker tricks the user's
browser into issuing a request.

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,590
And the website executes this request.

9
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:29,020
In SQL injection, the attacker
injects malicious query actions.

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,780
And a website's backend database
server executes this malicious query.
