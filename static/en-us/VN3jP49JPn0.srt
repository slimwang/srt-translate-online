00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,150
Now that we've had a look at the five qualities that we're going to be

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,926
digging into, let's also look at the architectural styles we're going to

3
00:00:06,926 --> 00:00:09,400
compare them with, okay?

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,290
In particular, we're going to examine be examining the effect

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,230
of the five selected non-functional qualities on system architecture for

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,160
each of these five styles.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,425
The five we will look at are pipe and filter, layered architecture, blackboard,

8
00:00:23,425 --> 00:00:29,060
object-oriented software architectural style, and implicit invocation.

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,640
So first, let's take a minute to recall the features of

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,070
those particular architectural styles.
