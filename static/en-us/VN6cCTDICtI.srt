00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,140
Look at this one little
bitty itty Lego piece.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,770
Did someone painstakingly put each
of these little circles on top, or

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,840
take a huge piece of plastic and
chisel it down to this?

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,980
Did someone carefully mix the colors
together to create just this right

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,440
shade of green?

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,329
Now think about asking
these same questions for

7
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:18,810
every single one of these pieces.

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,210
There's no way that each
piece was made by hand.

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,110
They used a mold or template.

10
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,750
Using a mold, you can make thousands
of pieces incredibly quickly.

11
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,990
Depending on which mold you use,
you've already determined the size and

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,560
shape of the pieces.

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,650
One thing that the mold can't
decide though is color.

14
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,050
It's dynamic and is chosen near the end.

15
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,530
So a template gives you a starting point
with a default structure and content.

16
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:42,570
But just like color,

17
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,200
you might need to provide specific
information before it's usable.
