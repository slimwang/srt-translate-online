1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,550
Another thing you can look at
is the Sales Performance Report.

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:11,085
You go to Conversions,
e-commerce, Sales Performance.

3
00:00:11,085 --> 00:00:14,400
In this report,
groups results by transaction.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,050
You can drill down into a transaction

5
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,400
to see what the products
included in the transaction.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,660
Here I've only got one
product per transaction,

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,510
because our app assumes that the current
dinner is the only product in the cart.

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,110
But here's an example from a different
app with more transactions, so

9
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,610
drill down into this transaction ID.

10
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,300
And you see that the customer
bought several things in a single

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,390
purchase transaction.

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,100
And the revenue for the transaction
is the sum of the prices for

13
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,790
the products included
in the transaction.

14
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,310
In this transaction, the customer
bought several different shirts.

15
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:53,030
So the total revenue is the sum
of the cost of all of the shirts.

16
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,240
That's a lot of shirts for one person.

17
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,199
I hope they all fit.

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,600
So far in our app,

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,610
when the user hits the purchase button,
they buy the currently selected dinner.

20
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,230
And they pretty much have
no choice about that.

21
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,800
But usually customers like to
buy things by the cartload,

22
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,580
rather than selecting and
paying for items one by one.

23
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,650
So to tell analytics that
the user bought multiple products

24
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,340
in a single transaction,

25
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:24,090
you just add whatever products you need
to the hit to be sent to analytics.

26
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,170
Create a product object for

27
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,220
each product in the cart, set the name,
set all the other details and so on.

28
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:37,160
Then you create the product action,
you set the action to ACTION_PURCHASE.

29
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:42,830
Set the TransactionId and then you can
optionally set a ProductActionList,

30
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,250
if you want to group all
the products into a list.

31
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,060
You don't have to do that though.

32
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,080
And then you get the tracker, as before.

33
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,190
And you add each of
the products to the tracker and

34
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,530
then you build and send the hit.

35
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,470
And this is pretty much the code that
you've already learned how to write.

36
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:06,010
The only difference, really,
is that you can add multiple products.

37
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,370
Now I know some people say it's not
polite to talk about money in public,

38
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,970
but I really do want to bring up
a couple of matters to do with money.

39
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,540
Every product has its own price.

40
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,040
This shirt costs 10.

41
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,040
And when you send an action
purchase hit to analytics,

42
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,950
the total price of the transaction
is automatically calculated

43
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,760
from the price and the quantity of
the products in the transaction.

44
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,900
That's cool, right?

45
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,730
Kind of what you'd expect, sure is.

46
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:40,220
But if you take a look at the API
reference for product action,

47
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:45,680
you'll see there are methods for setting
the revenue, the tax and the shipping.

48
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,570
If the tax and
the shipping are relevant,

49
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,280
you'll need to write the code
to add them to the transaction.

50
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,220
Remember I said that you can
set the name of the list

51
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,850
that's associated with
a given set of products?

52
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:02,180
If applicable, by setting the
ProductActionList on the ProductAction.

53
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,290
The list name shows up on
the product list performance page.

54
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,540
And in this case there
is two product lists,

55
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,010
one without a name, and
the other one is all the things.

56
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,730
And then if you drill
down into all the things,

57
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,910
you see the products that
were in the product list, and

58
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:24,290
you can find out what they contributed
to the product revenue for the list.

59
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,660
I don't have a coding exercise for
you related to calculating taxes or

60
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,980
setting product lists, but
feel free to explore on your own.

61
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,680
Up next though, you do have a quiz.
