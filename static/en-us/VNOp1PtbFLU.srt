1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,270
Okay, hopefully this
wasn't too difficult.

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,780
You used the textColor attribute.

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,070
Now, just as a little bit of
a reminder of what this value is,

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,930
we use @android:Color to get access
to the standard Android colors,

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:17,560
and then /white specifies that we're
looking to use Android's white color.

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,460
Really, there aren't a lot
of standard Android options.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,390
If you want a specific color,
it's a lot easier to use a hex code,

8
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,310
like we talked about in the lesson.

9
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,870
A good resource for hex codes is
the material design color web page

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,800
from the Android developer website.

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,522
That web page is linked
in the instructor notes,

12
00:00:32,522 --> 00:00:34,470
if you'd like to take a look at it.

13
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,348
But enough about color.

14
00:00:35,348 --> 00:00:36,740
We're using Android's white, and

15
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,210
let's go over to Android Studio to
take a look at what that looks like.

16
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:44,270
All right, we're back at our trusty old
activity_main.xml, and you're probably

17
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,660
used to adding attributes right now,
so I'm just going to go ahead and

18
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,070
start typing in
the Happy Birthday Ben TextView.

19
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,885
Again, the attribute
I'm using is textColor.

20
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,876
All right, and the drop down
actually gives me some options.

21
00:00:55,876 --> 00:00:59,792
It's @Android:,

22
00:00:59,792 --> 00:01:05,750
then color/white, and
almost immediately my preview updates,

23
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,950
and it's white, so
it's kind of hard to see.

24
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,290
But again,
that's what we wanted it to do.

25
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,976
All right, let's do the same
thing to the other TextView.

26
00:01:13,976 --> 00:01:17,009
going to click here,

27
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,944
android:textColor="".

28
00:01:21,944 --> 00:01:29,273
Quotations, important,
important quotations, @android:/color.

29
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,660
And once I'm finished typing this,

30
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,270
I can see that, well,
this TextView disappears as well.

31
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,380
Again, expected, because it's
a white text on a white background.

32
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:43,041
But I can see from
the vew outline here and

33
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:46,950
here that the text does
in fact still exist.

34
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,510
And for the sake of thoroughness,
let's go ahead and run it on our phones.

35
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,280
Okay, now those of you viewing at home
might find it a little bit hard to see,

36
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,820
but I can just barely see my white
text on my light gray background.

37
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,570
So it looks like we did a good job.

38
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,960
That's one more off our list.

39
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,120
Let's move on to the next step.
