1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Well, let's go through 1 possible answer together.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We're assigning to the variable, regexp, a regular expression.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Those start with r and then double quotes.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The first thing I want to do is match the function name. That will be [a - z]+.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Now I want to match immediately an opening parenthesis.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I will escape that opening parenthesis just to make sure that it works.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Now I can possibly have spaces or not,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
so I could have 0 or more spaces, so I'll leave a space

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and then put a star.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The star will refer back to the space, and we can have 0 or more of these.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Then there's a numerical argument--1 or more digits--

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and then more space, 0 or more, more spaces.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I close off the parenthesis, escaping the closed parenthesis just to make sure.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,870
Now I'm done, and this regular expression works well in practice.
