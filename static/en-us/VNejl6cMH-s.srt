00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,190
There are other ways of drawing with the canvas as well and

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,040
I'm going to go ahead and demonstrate one right here.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,750
It begins with this command,

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,210
BeginPath which we're calling on the context of the canvas.

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,420
BeginPath tells the canvas that we're about to draw a new shape.

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,350
Then we use this command MoveTo.

7
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,680
Now with moveTo and LineTo it makes actually a lot of sense to

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,865
think about a pen actually moving on page.

9
00:00:21,865 --> 00:00:26,260
MoveTo moves a pen to a specific location on the canvas which is designated by

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,300
the x and y coordinate here.

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,370
So this command moves the pen to 10, 10 which is going to be about right here.

12
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,810
You can think of move to as just moving the pen but

13
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,770
the pen isn't making a mark yet.

14
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,940
We're just deciding where we want to put it down on the page.

15
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,800
But then when we call LineTo we actually put the pen down.

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,850
And make his mark or in this case align to this position.

17
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,750
So this line here with MoveTo 10,10.

18
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,270
Moves the pen or hovers it over 10,10.

19
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,120
Then when we call LineTo, we put the pen down and

20
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,600
then move it to the position of 50, 50.

21
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,560
Then we move it again and move it again.

22
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,860
If we refresh the page we'll see that there's nothing there

23
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,260
despite the fact that it looks like we made a shape that eventually goes back to

24
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,890
where we started at 10, 10.

25
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,930
That's because we need to call either a fill or

26
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,050
a stroke command to finish up this path.

27
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,860
Let's start by doing fill.

28
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,920
I will go ahead and uncomment this line and save, come over here and

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,280
hit Refresh.

30
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,550
And we see that we create a filled shape.

31
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,350
This made a triangle, so now we see a filled in triangle.

32
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,230
If we comment in fill and then un-comment stroke, let's see what happens.

33
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,480
We'll save.

34
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,420
Come over here and

35
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,220
hit Refresh and now we see a stroke triangle that's not filled in.

36
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,040
There are many other drawing commands that you can use in the canvas and

37
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,910
check out the link in the instructor notes if you want to learn more about them.

38
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,600
But most of them behave similarly to what we see here.

39
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,200
For this quiz we want you to recreate the shape that you

40
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,330
see here with the canvas.

41
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:51,870
I've gone ahead and

42
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:56,080
marked a few points on the outside square and the inside triangle.

43
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,370
This should make your life a little bit easier as you try to recreate it.

44
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,410
After you've finished it, check this box to continue.
