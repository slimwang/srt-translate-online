1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's check our individual hypothesis.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So double quotes are always stripped from tag input.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Well, here's double quotes. They're stripped. This is correct.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Next, tags in double quotes are not stripped. Well, if we have tags over here, they are stripped.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
If they are in double quotes, they are not stripped. So this is correct as well.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The tag bold is always stripped from the input. Not the case. Let's see over here. So not correct.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And four-letter words are stripped--well, actually we don't know this

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
because we don't have a four-letter word in here, but at this point,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
there's no reason to believe that four-letter words would be stripped.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You can still try this out yourself.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What we have now is two hypothesis which are consistent with our observations so far.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
These maybe two separate issues, but chances are that they are actually tied to each other.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Let's focus on the first hypothesis because it's simple.
