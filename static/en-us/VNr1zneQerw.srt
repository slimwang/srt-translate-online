00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,350
If you've been on the internet for a few years you've probably noticed that

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:07,250
some websites look or act differently on different browsers.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,910
And trying to open a modern website on an older browser sometimes yields

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,330
a buggy experience.

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,430
Obviously as web developers we want to ensure that our users have

6
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:20,050
the same awesome experience regardless of their browsers or operating systems.

7
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,300
This has been a problem since the beginning of the web and

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,760
there are solutions available to manage cross-browser compatibility.

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,470
If you search for

10
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:32,119
CSS resetting or CSS normalize, you'll run into this style sheet, normalize.css.

11
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,730
Let's take a look at it.

12
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,780
This will help ensure that your CSS styles are interpreted the same

13
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,040
across all browsers.

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,210
To take advantage of CSS resetting, simply link to the CSS style you see here,

15
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,100
like so, and

16
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,010
you can be confident that your styles will work the same across all browsers.
