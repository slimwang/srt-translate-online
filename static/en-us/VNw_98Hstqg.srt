1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,761
Okay Michael, so what I have here on
the screen is two formulas that tell you

2
00:00:04,761 --> 00:00:09,527
how to compute the probability that
a particular action a is the optimal one

3
00:00:09,527 --> 00:00:12,810
given some evidence which
I'm calling the d sub a.

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,779
That is the, d is the data set of labels
a number of times you said yes or

5
00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:22,751
no for a b in the optimal action in
both the general case where there can

6
00:00:22,751 --> 00:00:25,924
be any number of policies
that are optimal,

7
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:31,069
that is any number of actions in
a particular state that could be optimal

8
00:00:31,069 --> 00:00:36,428
versus the case where there can be
only one, the Highlander case, okay?

9
00:00:36,428 --> 00:00:38,939
So I'm just going to kind of read this
out to you and you can just ask as many

10
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:41,110
questions as you want but
we'll sort of see where it goes.

11
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,380
So, we should read the first
equation in the following way.

12
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,800
So all of these are for a particular
state and you just can apply this in

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,350
a given state because we're living in
Markov decision process and then we'd

14
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,580
have to worry about all the other states
where by the state we happen to be.

15
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,680
This is the probability for a given
state, action a is the optimal and

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,190
given a sequence of labels that say, yes
this is optimal, no this is not optimal

17
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:08,890
is equal to this quantity C is just
the probability, the human is correct,

18
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:13,660
which was 0.8 in our last quiz and
was one in the quiz before that.

19
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,240
Raised to the power delta sub a.

20
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,570
Now what is delta sub a?

21
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,580
Well, delta is just the difference
between the number of times you said

22
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,690
yes, and the number of times
you said no to action a.

23
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:27,880
Now what does that really mean?

24
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,710
Well remember as you said, when you
were kind of thinking this out loud for

25
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:38,090
the first one, that what we really
got is multinomials and binomials.

26
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,840
A binomial is a special
case of multinomial.

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,340
So what we really has is multinomials.

28
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,200
What we're really doing
is flipping coins.

29
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,340
So every time you sort of flip a coin,
you're getting some evidence of whether

30
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,050
the coin comes up heads or
tails more often.

31
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:56,020
And so what you have here is
delta basically is a sufficient

32
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:00,240
statistic that summarizes
the entire sequence that you get.

33
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,840
Now what this means in practice,
is that every time I say yes and no,

34
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,260
it's as if they cancel each other out.

35
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,710
They drag me back towards
the uniform distribution, or

36
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,210
whatever your prior happens to be.

37
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,320
Now a lot of people find it difficult
to wrap their heads around.

38
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,570
It feels like if I flip a coin twice and
it comes up heads once and

39
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,080
tails once,
that's evidence that it's a half.

40
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,540
But if I flip a coin 1000 times and
500 times it says yes and 500 times it

41
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,160
says no, that's somehow more evidence
that it's a half and that's true but

42
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,080
actually in both cases, the maximum
likelihood answer is still one half.

43
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,025
It's just in the second case,
you're even more confident about it and

44
00:02:35,025 --> 00:02:38,478
what we're doing here is we're measuring
basically the mean, not the variance.

45
00:02:38,478 --> 00:02:39,218
Does that make sense?

46
00:02:39,218 --> 00:02:39,838
>> Yeah.

47
00:02:39,838 --> 00:02:40,438
I think so.

48
00:02:40,438 --> 00:02:42,448
Right.
So, in some sense,

49
00:02:42,448 --> 00:02:46,760
it's not telling us how
sure we are of the answer.

50
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,778
It's really just saying what the answer
is that best guesses the answer.

51
00:02:49,778 --> 00:02:52,807
>> Exactly right and and
what this delta kind of summarizes for

52
00:02:52,807 --> 00:02:56,503
you is the only thing that matters is
how many times you said yes versus how

53
00:02:56,503 --> 00:03:00,130
many times you said no, not how
many times you said yes on its own.

54
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,472
So, in the general case,

55
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:05,132
what we're really saying here is
something kind of neat which is that we

56
00:03:05,132 --> 00:03:08,488
can we can treat every single
action as if they're independent.

57
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,584
And so the probability that a is optimal
depends only upon what you told me

58
00:03:11,584 --> 00:03:13,930
about a,
it doesn't depend upon anything else.

59
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,270
Because as we did in the first example,
if you tell me that

60
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:22,270
the first action is optimal but
all of them could be optimal.

61
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,760
There's multiple optimal policies, then
the fact you told me something about

62
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,520
that action doesn't actually tell me
anything about any other actions.

63
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,580
And so what we have here is,

64
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,070
basically the probability that I
would see that many times you said

65
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:39,570
yes normalized by the probability I
would see that many times that you would

66
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:43,580
say yes versus I would have said all
those times and been wrong about it.

67
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,820
So C to the delta a is a sort of under
the assumption that you are correct.

68
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,420
And 1 minus c is under
the assumption you are not correct.

69
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,170
And that just falls out of
the binomial distribution.

70
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,390
And if we plug in our original answers,

71
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:58,990
you would see that you end up with
the same thing that we got before and

72
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,550
the special case where
you've only seen one label.

73
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,490
You with me?

74
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,160
>> Yeah, that's cool, yeah I think so.

75
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,760
So, because it's the binomial case,

76
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,850
one per action,
we're not looking at any other actions.

77
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,366
So the denominator there
comes from essentially,

78
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:17,740
the count of how likely it is that we'd
have those, that number that delta

79
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,890
number versus that if we were wrong,
we would have that delta number the 1-C.

80
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,180
So yeah, I think that feels right to me.
