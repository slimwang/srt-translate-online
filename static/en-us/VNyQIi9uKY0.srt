00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,390
Another big economic place for computer vision is sports.

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,350
If you watch any sort of professional sports on TV,

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:10,610
you see them leveraging computer vision sometimes in powerful ways,

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,320
sometimes in simple ways but are really useful.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,890
So here, this is Sportvision first down line for American football.

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,410
I say American football because sometimes when I go to Europe and

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,740
I say football they think a ball is round.

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,640
We know that footballs are not round.

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,610
And what's interesting about this line here is this is the line that he has to

10
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,290
cross to make a first down.

11
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:32,720
Of course that's not on the field, it's drawn in there.

12
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,750
The only interesting computer vision that's going on here is you'll notice that

13
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,280
that line does not go through him.

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,530
So the system had to separate out the player from the background, okay?

15
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,860
And even though, by the way, kind of greenish color in there,

16
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,710
it's able to separate the grass from the player.

17
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,760
In fact, if you ever watch one of these games when it's rainy and

18
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,830
it's an outdoor field and

19
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,120
it gets all muddy, the first down line stops working so well.

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,140
Because the grass is now mud and it doesn't look like grass anymore and

21
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,000
it can't tell the players and the whole thing doesn't work so well.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,920
And you can see a computer vision failure right there.
