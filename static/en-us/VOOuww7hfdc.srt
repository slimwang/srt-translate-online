Hi, I'm Ankur, the head of
developer education at Amazon.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,416
>> And I am Cezanne and
I'm a course developer at Udacity.

3
00:00:07,416 --> 00:00:11,630
In this course we'll look at different
ways to monetize your game app.

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,920
>> We'll show you how to
make money from your game,

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,510
which is a subject a lot of
developers leave as an afterthought

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,160
rather weaving into the fabric
of the game from the very start.

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,820
>> So far you've been learning about
how to program your own mobile game but

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,170
it's also important to be able
to share it and make money.

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,150
Ankur, what are some examples
of monetization in action?

10
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,670
>> Well,
if you have played any mobile games,

11
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,260
I'm sure you've already
seen a bunch of examples.

12
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,670
It goes into everything from what
a game looks like to ads and

13
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,240
items that you can buy in the game.

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,940
>> And remember,

15
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,940
that there's no guidebook to tell
you the perfect ways to monetize.

16
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,780
There are lots of different ways.

17
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:52,300
After this course, you'll be able to
choose what works best for your game.

18
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,960
Let's take a look at the different
strategies we'll be learning about

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,600
in this course.
