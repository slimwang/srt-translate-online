1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,649
The correct answer is viewDidLoad.

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:04,139
viewDidLoad is called when your

3
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:06,269
UIViewController is first loaded into

4
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:08,400
memory, even before it’s shown on screen.

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,910
ViewWillAppear however is only called

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,558
when the View Controller is about to be

7
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:15,630
presented on screen, but before it is

8
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:22,160
actually on the screen.
