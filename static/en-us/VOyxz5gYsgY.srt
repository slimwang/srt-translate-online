In summary, UML provides a rich vocabulary for modeling system structure.

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,210
And the UML class model diagram exhibits many, many different features.

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:17,310
However, there's no need for you to use all of its affordances. Particularly at

4
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,640
the start of the modeling process. Never the less, each affordance implies

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,140
a question to be answered. What is the multiplicity? Are these values ordered?

6
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,420
What's the qualifier? Does the system that you are modeling,

7
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,640
exhibit the property expressed by that affordance? One of the important

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,580
benefits of modeling, is that it encourages you to face these questions early,

9
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,360
in the development process. Because if you forget and they,

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,120
they may later come back to haunt you.
