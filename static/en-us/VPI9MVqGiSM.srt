1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,350
So this last bit of code with the legend, we've put our circles in.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,260
Now we want to append text.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:13,510
For the text SVG instead of cy it's simple y, there's no center to the text.

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,730
Instead of cx, it's simply x,

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:21,570
since we only need to specify the y and the x of where we want to draw the text.

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:27,280
In here, while it may seem somewhat arbitrary we've actually drawn the text

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,080
at the same position i times 30 as each of the circles, but

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,920
this is actually going to draw the text.

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,200
Slightly higher, since it's going to draw the bottom of the text

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,050
at position i 30, and we actually want the center of

11
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,560
our text to be in line with the center of our circle.

12
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,350
So in our case, the default text is 10 pixels tall, so half of 10 is five,

13
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,760
and this will position it perfectly.

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,310
In line with the circle, and for the radius what might seem arbitrary of five,

15
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:04,879
we simply drawn it five radii over from the circle itself, and

16
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,760
again, for these values, they might seem hardcoded here.

17
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,710
We can simply experiment and change them up or

18
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:16,560
down to achieve a different effect and once we visually are happy we

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,540
can set them in our code or abstract them into variables higher up.

20
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:27,060
The last bit here simply changes the text attribute of the text SVG element.

21
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,450
And since we've bound strings as data.

22
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,820
D, in this case, is simply a string, either home team or others, and

23
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,970
we can just return the datum itself without any further transformation.

24
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,110
Saving our file, let's go back to the browser.

25
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:47,030
And voila, we now have proper labels, home team and others, so that our

26
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:52,010
readers know which the red circles represent, what the blue circles represent.

27
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:56,390
It can draw their own conclusions given the information we've presented them.

28
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:01,810
Well we may have seen red circles early on being much higher attended.

29
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:06,130
Every reader might interpret this chart and find something different and

30
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,196
new depending on where they're coming from.

31
00:02:08,196 --> 00:02:10,820
What their pre-existing biases are, and

32
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,770
what relation they might have to the data.
