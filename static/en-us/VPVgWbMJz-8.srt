00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,590
Here the solutions are negative 5 plus or minus 2 root 6 all divided by 3.

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:09,426
Great algebra skills if you got this one correct. You may have also entered

3
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:13,760
this as your answer. This is correct as well. You would of divided 3 into the

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,390
first term and 3 in the second term. Since there's no common factors we just

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,698
list these two terms as fractions. With a plus or minus symbol in between. To

6
00:00:21,698 --> 00:00:25,909
start this problem, we take the square root of both sides of our equation. And

7
00:00:25,909 --> 00:00:29,570
we indicate the plus or minus sign for this root. So we'll have 3x plus 5 on

8
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:34,184
the left. And positive or negative root 24 on the right. Next, we want to

9
00:00:34,184 --> 00:00:39,368
isolate this 3x by subtracting 5 from both sides. We'll get 3x equals negative

10
00:00:39,368 --> 00:00:44,744
5, plus or minus root 24. And finally, to solve for X, we divide both sides by

11
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:49,775
the coefficient 3. This leaves us with 1x equal to negative 5 plus or minus

12
00:00:49,775 --> 00:00:54,315
root 24, all divided by 3. We want to look to see if we can simplify any

13
00:00:54,315 --> 00:00:59,860
radicals, if possible. The square root of 24 is simplifies to 2 times root 6.

14
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,260
So we can replace this here in our final answer.
