00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,870
This answer here, that the profile stores conference

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,370
names not keys, is wrong. We do store the

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,940
conference keys. However, we store them as strings.

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,940
So, this answer is correct. The profile stores the

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:18,070
conference keys as strings. So because they're strings,

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,570
we have to convert them into keys, before we

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,860
can use the key to load the entity from

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,910
the data store. The reason that we use strings

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,050
for the keys, is that you can't parse actual key entities

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,490
around inside of JSON. So we create a web safe version

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,670
of the key as a string. And this answer is wrong.

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,970
Yeah, I know, it would be, it would be nice just to

13
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,760
simply return the value of the property, but it's not going to

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,760
work. So you can find the finished code for getConferencesToAttend in

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,330
the lesson four folder, if you need a bit of help

16
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,500
writing the code. So go take a look if you need to.
