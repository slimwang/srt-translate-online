00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now, I'd like to ask you about the relationship between bar charts and scatter plots.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Both of these were used to plot two different sets of data against each other.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:23,000
For example, home prices and home sizes. So a bar chart might look like this.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
For this bar chart, I'd like you to tell me which of these scatter plots looks most similar

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
as if it could represent the same underlying data.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Is it this one, this one, this one, or this one? Please check whichever one looks closest.
