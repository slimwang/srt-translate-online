1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,349
And the answer here may be surprisingly is that using this random assignment here

2
00:00:05,349 --> 00:00:09,030
we will on average already get half of the variables right

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,620
and that is of course because we have a 50% chance for each single variable

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,830
of actually getting it right when we do it by coin flip

5
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,730
because if in a satisfying assignment this variable needs to be set to false,

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,170
there's a 50% chance that a random assignment will also set it to false

7
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:31,890
and if it needs to be set to true, there is also 50% chance that we actually set it to true

8
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,090
using this randomized assignment.

9
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,600
Now, of course, sometimes we might get more variables correct and sometimes less

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,770
but especially if N is large we can expect to get about half of the variables right in an average run.

11
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:49,680
Now, the success-factor II, once we are half way there so to say

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,440
what are the chances that using this process here will get us through the satisfying assignment

13
00:00:54,440 --> 99:59:59,999
again, if the original Boolean formula actually has one of those.
