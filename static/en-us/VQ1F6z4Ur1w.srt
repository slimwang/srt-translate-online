1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,102
So how should we modify the code, so

2
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:05,840
that list items have different
background colors based on the category.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,170
I'd like you to take a moment
to think about your mental model

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,200
of the Miwok app code base.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,930
Where could the background
color information be stored?

6
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,860
Well, we could store it
in all of these files.

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,400
However, that would be an inefficient
use of memory resources.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,720
Remember that every variable
takes up space in memory.

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,020
So to be a good citizen in Android,
we should minimize the memory usage and

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,800
store it in the minimal number
of places where it's needed.

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,930
So this also minimizes the amount of
places that know about this color.

12
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,714
So should we show the color as
a variable inside the Word class?

13
00:00:38,714 --> 00:00:39,600
Or maybe inside the WordAdapter class?

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,240
Or maybe inside each
individual activity?

15
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,420
So take a look at the screenshots below
and try to make your best educated guess

16
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,470
out of these three choices and
then explain your reasoning below.
