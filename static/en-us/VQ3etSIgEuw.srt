1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Here I have written six possible JavaScript statements.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I ask you which are valid stmt according to our grammar.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That is, if you start from the statement nonterminal,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
which of these six can you derive using all the rules that we've seen in our grammar so far.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This is the happy-fun quiz.
