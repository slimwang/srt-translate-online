00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,030
The meta, paper concludes by having a case study using

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,790
the Linux operating system.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,780
Case study was concerned with higher-order connectors.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:15,640
In particular, a operating system like Linux provides several major

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,160
elements in support of all the applications they're going to run on the system.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,520
One key component is the file system.

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,600
Another is shared memory.

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,650
And the third is process, support, support for processes.

9
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:31,520
As far as the files are concerned, the underlying hardware doesn't have files.

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,470
Right? The.

11
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,140
It has bytes.

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,300
There may be a mechanism by, for, for blocking those bytes into groups.

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,580
But the operating system self provides some kind of facade,

14
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,030
that makes it look like there are files there.

15
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,330
And in so doing, it ne, needs to deal with contention.

16
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:53,000
If there are multiple, accesses to the file, are you allowing them

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,480
to take place concurrently or is there some kind of synchronization.

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,220
required.

19
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:03,430
And it's the operating system's job to provide these arbitration, adaptation,

20
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:08,330
and coordination connectors to get a composite file facade connector.

21
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:13,170
Shared memory, is a data-access type connector but there are issues there,

22
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,000
synchronization as well.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,040
And finally, in terms of process scheduling,

24
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,410
okay, processes are all about controlled access to resources so

25
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,670
an arbitrator type connector is required there.
