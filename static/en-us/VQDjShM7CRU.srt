00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,467
We know that we can solve a system of equations graphically. Let's consider some

2
00:00:04,467 --> 00:00:08,647
rental car companies again. This time, we're going to look at a new one called

3
00:00:08,647 --> 00:00:12,825
Lucky Cars. Lucky Cars is going to charge $12 for a registration fee and $7 per

4
00:00:12,825 --> 00:00:17,219
hour. Car-nival, the one we seen before, charges $10 for a registration fee and

5
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:21,428
$10 per hour. Let's look at these graphs. Here are the two equations for the

6
00:00:21,428 --> 00:00:25,587
cost of the rental car. And here are the two lines. So, when looking at this

7
00:00:25,587 --> 00:00:29,897
graph, we can see that the intersection lies somewhere in this region. Based on

8
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:33,862
our graph, which of these points represents the intersection or when the

9
00:00:33,862 --> 00:00:35,270
companies cost the same?
