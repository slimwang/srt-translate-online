00:00:00,024 --> 00:00:03,690
The Pearson product-moment correlation measures the strength of relationship

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,340
between any two variables, but there can be lots

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,204
of other types of relationships. Even other ones that

4
00:00:09,204 --> 00:00:12,520
are monotonic, either increasing or decreasing. So we also

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,650
have measures of monotonic relationships, such as a rank

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,270
correlation measures like Spearman. We can assign Spearman to

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,380
the method parameter and calculate the correlation that way.

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,210
Here we have a different test statistic called row,

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,830
and notice how our value is slightly different as well.

10
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,400
You can learn more about the assumptions and uses of the

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,810
different methods in the instructor notes. From these last couple

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,980
correlation videos, the main point I want to make here is that

13
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,150
single number coefficients like this are useful, but they are

14
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,640
not a grid substitute for looking at a scatter plot and

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,743
computing conditional summaries like we did earlier. We have a

16
00:00:46,743 --> 00:00:50,400
richer understanding by looking at such plots like this one for

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,853
friend_count and age.
