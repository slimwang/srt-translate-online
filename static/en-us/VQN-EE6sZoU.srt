1
00:00:00,578 --> 00:00:04,689
With our JSON data converted into
a foundation object, how do we use it?

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,880
Let's go back to the postman
tool to see where to start.

3
00:00:11,668 --> 00:00:13,090
In our JSON response,

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:17,400
if you look at the very beginning we can
see that it starts with the curly brace.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,420
And if we scroll down to the bottom,
the very bottom on line 251,

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,340
we can see that it ends
in a curly brace as well.

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,840
This is indicative of a JSON Object,

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,570
which in SWF is comparable
to a dictionary.

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,320
This means that when we call
the JSONObjectWithData method,

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,540
that we should be getting
some kind of dictionary back.

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,480
It's actually an NSDictionary and

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,120
we can interact with it
just like a SWF dictionary.

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,650
So the next thing we need to do if
we know that we have a dictionary

14
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,890
is that we need to identify the key
value pairs that we're interested in.

15
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,510
Ultimately we know that we want to
get one of the url_m values and

16
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,080
then also the title value.

17
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,210
We need the URL in order to
display the image to the user and

18
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,880
we'll need the title for
the title label in the U.I.,

19
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:12,350
but, to get at these values,
we have to take a top down approach.

20
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,500
Because at the highest level,

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,690
we have this photos key value
pair that contains everything.

22
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:21,566
And we can see that the photos value
starts with the curly brace and

23
00:01:21,566 --> 00:01:26,265
ends with a curly brace, so
this is just another JSON object and

24
00:01:26,265 --> 00:01:29,650
it can be represented
in SWF as a dictionary.

25
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:35,098
So back in our code let's create
a photos dictionary and we'll

26
00:01:35,098 --> 00:01:39,840
want to populate this dictionary with
the values stored at the photos key.

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,090
So this constant is the same
thing as photos like this.

28
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,210
But I'll leave it as a constant for now.

29
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:51,080
And then we want to try to convert
it to a string AnyObject dictionary.

30
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:57,297
And we'll use this if let syntax in case
somehow our response doesn't have this

31
00:01:57,297 --> 00:01:59,677
key value pair, then it won't crash.

32
00:02:01,992 --> 00:02:05,292
Also, know that the reason that
we're using the String and

33
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:08,526
any object dictionary is because
we know that the JSON keys

34
00:02:08,526 --> 00:02:12,970
themselves are strings, but then the
values, they could be any other object.

35
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,340
They could be a JSON object,
which is another dictionary.

36
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,340
It could be a number.

37
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,200
It could be a string.

38
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:18,700
We don't know.

39
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,441
And we'll just print
the photosDictionary.

40
00:02:32,203 --> 00:02:34,252
Awesome, our output looks similar and

41
00:02:34,252 --> 00:02:37,241
we're starting to get closer
to the values that we want.

42
00:02:39,882 --> 00:02:44,214
Now, back in Postman, the next key value
pair that we want to target is for

43
00:02:44,214 --> 00:02:45,290
the key, photo.

44
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,320
This value starts with a bracket and
it ends with a bracket.

45
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:56,070
And that's indicative of a JSON array,
which is comparable to a SWF array.

46
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,390
But then the question becomes,
what type of array?

47
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:04,220
Well, if we look closely it looks like
each element here in the array is itself

48
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,420
another JSON object, and
each item is separated by a comma.

49
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:14,080
So we have a JSON object here, and
actually I'll just collapse it,

50
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,300
and we have a comma,
then we have another JSON object.

51
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,140
Another JSON object, and so forth.

52
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,080
This means in SWF,
we can use an array of dictionaries.

53
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,780
So back in our code,
let's get the array of dictionaries, and

54
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,960
we're going to call
this the photo array.

55
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:37,150
That's stored at the photo key, and this
is critical, of the photos dictionary.

56
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,810
Remember it's contained
within the photos dictionary.

57
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:45,530
And then we'll create
an array of dictionaries.

58
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,630
Notice the outer brackets
denote the array itself.

59
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,160
And within the brackets
we have the array's type,

60
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,360
which are string any
object dictionaries.

61
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,693
And to make sure this works,

62
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:58,204
let's try printing the first
photo dictionary in the array.

63
00:04:09,012 --> 00:04:10,670
Nice it works.

64
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,680
We're almost there.

65
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,709
But before we continue forward I want to
make sure you can follow my steps.

66
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:21,550
That is, get the photos
dictionary at the photos key.

67
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,430
Then in the photos dictionary,

68
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,430
get the array of photo
dictionaries at the "photo" key.

69
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,780
I know, this sounds confusing, but this
is the way the results are returned.

70
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,630
And finally,
print the first photo dictionary.

71
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:39,436
When you're done,
check this box and continue.
