00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let me write down for any possible outcome of the binomial, the corresponding probability.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So just for our little Python program implementing the familiar expression

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
of binomial distribution and with this program, I'll get the following.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Practically speaking, all the first ones have zero probability.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This is about something times 10 to the minus 5 and then over here, very small probability has come up,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and they go all the way to 0.34 for 14, somewhere between 13 and 14 is the most likely outcome,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
but even those numbers aren't huge because there are so many of those up to 15.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So you've build these tables before, I spared to the work this time around

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and the very basic logic here is to not draw a line such that the total probability

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
contained on top of the line and it's this, doesn't exceed 5%.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So here's a question for you, where would you draw the line?

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
If you draw it here, for example, then give me the number just on top of the line, 3.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If you're going to draw over here, it will be 13. Neither of those are correct.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Draw the line where the probability contained above the line doesn't exceed 5%.
