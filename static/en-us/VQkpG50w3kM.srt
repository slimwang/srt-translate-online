Surprisingly there is only one way to triangulate this figure. Because of the

2
00:00:04,634 --> 00:00:10,842
deep concavity, we can't add edges here or here, as these edges are outside of

3
00:00:10,842 --> 00:00:16,844
the figure. Instead the only place to add edges is here and here, giving the

4
00:00:16,844 --> 00:00:22,276
only possible triangulation. The good news is, that no matter how complex the

5
00:00:22,276 --> 00:00:27,012
form, any polygon can be triangulated into triangles, so it can be displayed

00:00:27,012 --> 00:00:27,844
using a GPU.
