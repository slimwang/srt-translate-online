00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So just to recapitulate some of the stuff we talked about in this unit,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
ultimately, we talked about various different kinds of graphs,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
various different kinds of growth rates,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
the whole notion of Big Theta and Big O notation

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
to capture asymptotic growth rates

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and connecting these things up with various kinds of recurrence relations.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
There ended up being kind of a nice correspondence

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
between several different kinds of graphs,

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
several different kinds of recurrence relations,

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and several different growth rates.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
These growth rates are obviously important for

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
understanding how these graphs work,

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
but they are really important for algorithm analysis, as well,

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and we're going to see algorithms with various run times

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
that look like these as we proceed. See you next time.
