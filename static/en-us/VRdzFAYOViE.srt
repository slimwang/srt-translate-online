1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:02,140
Okay, so I've got it now.

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,550
Now that we have
the application packaged up,

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:07,120
it's got to be time to copy
down to the server and run it.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,550
>> Slow down there Cowboy,
while you could do that,

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,960
it kind of defeats the point the whole
point of using Docker was to make it

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,740
easy to distribute your applications.

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,730
What you propose works for
a small set of machines but

8
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,530
won't scale to say a hundred machines.

9
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,730
The right thing to do in this case
is to push your container images

10
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,780
to a remote repository and leverage
tools like Docker to fetch those images

11
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,940
from a central place
when we need to run them.

12
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,570
>> Okay, I think I've heard of those.

13
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,350
Are you talking about Docker Hub?

14
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,280
>> Yes.

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,220
>> But if I use that can't
anyone access my containers?

16
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:44,480
>> Yes, all images you push to
the Docker Hub are public by default.

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,530
But don't worry, you also have the
option to make those images private and

18
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,140
limit access to them.

19
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:55,050
You also have the flexibility to share
some images public and others private.

20
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,840
This often is the case when companies
have open source projects they want to

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,470
share with the world but
keep their secret sauce to themselves.

22
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,060
>> Okay, I get it but I think this is
something I need to see in action.
