1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,260
As you can see it's pretty straight forward. We check to see if the gain value

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:10,707
is greater than 0, which means it's not muted. So in that case we want to set

3
00:00:10,707 --> 00:00:15,854
it to 0 to mute the sound. If it isn't greater than 0 that means it is muted

4
00:00:15,854 --> 00:00:19,523
and we'll want to toggle it back to 1.
