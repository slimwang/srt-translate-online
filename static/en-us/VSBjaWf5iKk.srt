1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,204
>> For number one, we need to divide both sides by negative 5. 35 divided by

2
00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:08,743
negative 5 is negative 7. And, because we're dividing by a negative number, we

3
00:00:08,743 --> 00:00:13,268
need to flip the sign of the inequality. So it goes from being a less than sign

4
00:00:13,268 --> 00:00:17,751
to a greater than sign. We can go through this similar process for the rest of

5
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:20,304
the problems. And, here are our solutions.
