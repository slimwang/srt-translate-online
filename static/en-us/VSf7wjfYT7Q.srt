1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,044
Enchant me. Simplify my life. 
Make me amazing.

2
00:00:05,044 --> 00:00:07,270
They're incredibly 
one-sided wedding vows,

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,450
and the three key principles
underlying the Android team's

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,860
creative vision for the platform
and the apps that run on it.

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,410
As engineers, it can sometimes
be difficult to see past

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,520
our own delight at harnessing 
the power of an SDK

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,710
to bend a machine to our will.

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:26,090
But ultimately, our goal must be
to create that same empowering experience

9
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,776
for our users.

10
00:00:27,776 --> 00:00:30,822
And we do that by creating apps
that are as aesthetically pleasing

11
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:33,410
as they are functional and easy to use.

12
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,240
Users judge the quality of your app
within the first 30 seconds.

13
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,480
It may not be fair, but,
a disproportionate amount

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,733
of that judgement will be based 
not on the functionality,

15
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:44,856
but on the visual aesthetics.

16
00:00:44,856 --> 00:00:47,280
Does it look polished? 
Does it look professional?

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,360
How easy is it to use?

18
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,535
More than just looking pretty, 
the entire user experience

19
00:00:52,535 --> 00:00:54,330
is critically important.

20
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,505
With 30 seconds to win users over, 
it's critical that that onboarding process,

21
00:00:58,505 --> 00:01:01,680
that time and effort required 
to go from downloading your app

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,720
to performing it's main function,

23
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,960
should be as short 
and frictionless as possible.

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,250
Not only that, but a well designed app 
should evoke a visceral reaction

25
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,830
that speaks to the subconscious.

26
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,380
It should be fun to use.

27
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,150
It should surprise in delightful ways 
through subtle animations

28
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,200
and smooth transitions that contribute
to a feeling of power and effortlessness.

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,280
It should let users touch 
and interact with objects directly

30
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,720
rather than having 
to use buttons and menus.

31
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,090
And it should use rich imagery 
and pictures in place

32
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,300
of lots of words and long sentences.

33
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,440
It allows users to customize your app, 
to make it <i>theirs</i> while providing

34
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,770
beautiful and sensible defaults.

35
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,100
Create something that works like magic,

36
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,910
learning your preference in the context 
provided by the device,

37
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:48,990
so it never asks users for information
that they've already provided.

38
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,860
Provide simple shortcuts 
to complete complex tasks,

39
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,800
and remember data settings 
and customizations

40
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,400
making them available 
across every device.

41
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,480
While it's good practice to create 
a familiar and welcoming experience

42
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,770
by creating a look and feel
that's consistent

43
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,860
with the platforms, styles and themes,

44
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,140
it's just as important 
to remember that this,

45
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,800
and all the other principles 
I've discussed here,

46
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,870
are really just a starting point 
for your own creative vision.

47
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,100
Deviation from the guidelines 
is encouraged, but when you do so,

48
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,850
deviate with purpose.
