00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,890
The connection between logic and
human cognition is interesting.

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:08,720
Logic is a very important school of
thought in AI, for several reasons.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,660
One reason is that logic provides a very
formal and precise way of reasoning.

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,190
Another reason is that logic provides
a formal notation for expressing how

5
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,530
intelligent agents reason, whether or
not they're using logical reasoning.

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,840
But does this mean that logic
is also the basis of cognition?

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,100
It suddenly appears that humans
use logic some of the time.

8
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:35,910
For example,

9
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,510
I may have a statement like if I get
a big bonus, I'll take a long vacation.

10
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,250
I did get a big bonus, therefore I
may infer I'll take a long vacation.

11
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,108
This is clearly.

12
00:00:48,478 --> 00:00:52,721
But simply because of a behavior appears
to be logical, does not necessarily

13
00:00:52,721 --> 00:00:56,130
imply that we use logic as
a fundamental reasoning strategy.

14
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,570
I might solve a new problem, by analogy
to a previously encountered problem,

15
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:05,310
I did not use logic, but
my behavior appears to be logical.

16
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,830
The logic that we have considered so
far is deductive logic.

17
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,880
But a lot of human reasoning is
inductive or abductive in its character.

18
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,440
If you haven't come across
an abductive so far,

19
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,560
we will discuss in detail
later in the class.

20
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,930
Deduction has to do with
reasonings from causes to effects.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,850
Abduction has to do with
reasoning from effects to causes.

22
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,950
When you go to a doctor,
you go with some signs and symptoms.

23
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,290
Those are the effects.

24
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,330
The doctor comes up with
a disease category.

25
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:36,990
That's the cause.

26
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,970
Abduction is reasoning from
data to an explanation

27
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,820
to a disease category for the data.

28
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,210
Induction is given some relationship
between cause and effect for a sample.

29
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,010
How do we generalize it between
a cause and effect relationship for

30
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:52,590
a population?

31
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,360
So while human reasoning appears to be
inductive and abductive in character

32
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,970
much of the time, the logic that we
have considered so far is deductive.

33
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,840
That's yet another issue that we'll
return to later in the class.
