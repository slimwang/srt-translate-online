1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,609
deep learning is a hands-on empirical

2
00:00:02,609 --> 00:00:05,519
field more experiments that we engineers

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:07,710
and researchers try the more ideas we

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,869
generate and some of them actually turn

5
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:11,939
out to work other ideas that seem

6
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:14,849
promising initially don't work the

7
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,528
practice is definitely ahead of the

8
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:18,449
theory in many cases and so it's

9
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:20,100
important not to get too attached to

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,750
theories about different network

11
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,429
architectures are exactly what layer

12
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:26,189
follows another in a network instead to

13
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:27,359
be a successful deep learning

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,609
practitioner you need a bias towards

15
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:32,070
action experiment to answer your

16
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,229
questions rather than just thinking deep

17
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:36,539
thoughts also don't be too discouraged

18
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:38,128
if something doesn't work immediately

19
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:39,869
the first time you try it

20
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:41,609
keep experimenting until you find a

21
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:43,409
network and hyper parameters that work

22
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:46,378
for your problem i like to think of deep

23
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:48,119
learning is one of the few places in

24
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:50,369
computer science where we actually do

25
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:53,159
science most of computer science is

26
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:55,350
really more about engineering but in

27
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,329
deep learning we really do spend a lot

28
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,609
of time running experiments and building

29
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:02,280
theories of what works and why just like

30
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,978
real scientists yeah i would say that

31
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:07,500
does make us real scientists you're

32
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,420
learning about several important network

33
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,978
architectures that you can use as a

34
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:13,438
basis for your own projects but more

35
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:15,090
important than the intricacies of these

36
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,340
networks is to get your hands dirty and

37
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,259
try to solve real problems

38
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:20,849
this will develop your confidence and

39
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:23,009
give you practical skills with that in

40
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:25,228
mind let's look at that other network

41
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:27,118
from $MONTH 2014 which has its own

42
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:32,509
strength
