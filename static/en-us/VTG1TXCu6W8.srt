1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,170
We're going to keep coming back to this equation as we learn new skills to see

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,235
if we can solve it. But for now let's start by solving a number puzzle. For

3
00:00:08,235 --> 00:00:12,327
number puzzles, we're going to find 2 numbers that multiply to give us the top

4
00:00:12,327 --> 00:00:16,431
number and that add to give the bottom number. So for this one I want to find

5
00:00:16,431 --> 00:00:20,676
factors of 20 that sum to 9. We can think about it in our heads or make a list

6
00:00:20,676 --> 00:00:24,753
of the factor pairs. This is usually more helpful. We start with 1 since 1

7
00:00:24,753 --> 00:00:29,168
divides into any number. 1 times 20 is 20. So this is definitely a factor pair.

8
00:00:29,168 --> 00:00:33,244
2 times 10 is 20, that's another one and 4 times is 20. So this is our third

9
00:00:33,244 --> 00:00:37,715
factor pair. I don't need to continue writing any more factor pairs because well

10
00:00:37,715 --> 00:00:42,266
I've repeated one of them already. Ten and two would end up being repeated as

11
00:00:42,266 --> 00:00:47,054
would 20 and one if I continued listing factor pairs so if I'm going in order I

12
00:00:47,054 --> 00:00:51,881
can just stop when I have a repeat. I look at my list and I see which one of the

13
00:00:51,881 --> 00:00:56,485
pairs adds up to nine, that must be this one. So four and five would be the

14
00:00:56,485 --> 00:00:58,410
answer to this number puzzle.
