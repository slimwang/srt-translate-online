1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,400
As before, let's use the size function.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,350
So it turns out to be 201 cross 151.

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,900
Is that surprising?

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,580
Why isn't it 200 cross 150?

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:18,980
Let's look back at the range we selected, 110 through 310 and 10 through 160.

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:24,260
Note that in both these ranges, the limits are inclusive.

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:32,150
Which is why the first range, 110 through 310, includes 201 different rows.

8
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:37,220
Similarly, 10 through 160 includes 151 different columns.

9
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,550
Try to extract different parts of the image.

10
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,440
What happens when your selected range goes out of bounds
