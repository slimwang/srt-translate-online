00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
The correct answer here is that the total number of vertices to represent the variables

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:10,970
is 3*(n+1+2), so the number of vertices to represent one variable times n.

3
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:22,020
We have 3(n+1)+2 and the whole thing times n, which is equal to 3mn+5n.

4
00:00:22,020 --> 99:59:59,999
We have 5n, 0m, 3mn, and a constant of 0 here again.
