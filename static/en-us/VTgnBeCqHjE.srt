00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,577
Let's say that Chris is super popular. The number of Facebook friends he has is

2
00:00:05,577 --> 00:00:11,291
2.5 standard deviations above the mean. So, in other words, he has more friends

3
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:16,802
than about 99% of people. If the true standard deviation of our original data

4
00:00:16,802 --> 00:00:21,902
set is still 36 and the original mean is still 190, then how many Facebook

5
00:00:21,902 --> 00:00:23,805
friends does Chris have?
