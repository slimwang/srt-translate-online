1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,220
Let's look at it in a little bit more detail.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,240
So, what we're interested in, of course, is to compute the Gaussian at level k.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,860
We take the h, which was one we looked at previously, convolve it with the Gau,

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,940
the original Gaussian from the previous level.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,370
So in essence, that's why it's a pyramid.

6
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,470
So you take the previous level to compute the next one.

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,750
You take the previous to compute the next one.

8
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,190
And this, in essence, is known as the reduce function.

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,120
And again, basically takes the previous image to generate the new one.

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,440
So for example, this is my image at level one.

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,845
I can use this to generate an image at level 2.

12
00:00:34,845 --> 00:00:40,170
Here, while the samples of these images that go from g1 to

13
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,990
g2 is half, I'm still scaling it up,

14
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:47,010
all of them to be the same scale to kind of show what's happening as we go down.

15
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,340
Of course, g3 would basically be based on g2.

16
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,450
So here, of course, recursion is going on.

17
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,110
These are recursive functions.

18
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,720
g4 is based, now, on g3.

19
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,670
Again, I'm scaling them up, all to be of the same size,

20
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:03,290
to showcase the fact that information is being blurred out.

21
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:07,280
So, here, of course, you see a lot of pixelation, and even more.

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,210
So we've gone from images that were 256 by 256 to 128 by 128

23
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:18,860
to 64 by 64, 32 by 32, and 16 by 16.

24
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,050
Now we can actually start noticing an interesting fact.

25
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,300
This is extremely blurry, much more crisp.

26
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,660
This is encoding all of the high frequencies.

27
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,700
This is encoding all of the low frequencies.

28
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,850
Here you can see the blurry shape of Einstein.

29
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,860
Here you can see all the details, including even, for example, the hair.
