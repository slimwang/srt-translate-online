00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,062
Welcome to unit 11. At this point, I hope everyone's feeling pretty confident

2
00:00:04,062 --> 00:00:07,939
that you can write programs that can do interesting and powerful things. We've

3
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:10,820
come a long way, but we still don't know how to unleash our programs on the

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,106
world. At this point, to run your programs, you need to run them in the Python

5
00:00:14,106 --> 00:00:17,978
interpreter. What we're going to learn in this unit is how to write programs

6
00:00:17,978 --> 00:00:21,371
that we can unleash on the expectant world. To do that we need know a little

7
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:25,409
bit about input and output. Being able to make programs that other people can

8
00:00:25,409 --> 00:00:29,390
use is very empowering, but it also requires being careful. Once other people

9
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,987
start using our programs, well, they might do things wrong. Even worse they

10
00:00:32,987 --> 00:00:36,012
might be malicious. They might intentionally create inputs to our programs that

11
00:00:36,012 --> 00:00:39,378
try to make our programs do bad things. So, we have to be a lot more careful

12
00:00:39,378 --> 00:00:42,174
when we construct programs for other people to use.
