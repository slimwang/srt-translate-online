00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,370
We just saw that in order to reflect points in the x axis, we need to switch

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:09,965
any y coordinates to negative y. And in fact, this is exactly what we do with

3
00:00:09,965 --> 00:00:14,812
functions as well. So for example, if we start out with the function we were

4
00:00:14,812 --> 00:00:19,966
looking at before, y equals the root of x. Then in order to reflect this in the

5
00:00:19,966 --> 00:00:23,810
x axis, we need to switch y to be negative y, which will gives us the equation

6
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:29,182
negative y equals the square root of x. What I'd like you to do is to rewrite

7
00:00:29,182 --> 00:00:33,192
this equation. Negative y equals the square root of x, so that y is all by

8
00:00:33,192 --> 00:00:38,506
itself on the left hand side of the equation. So you'll end up with y equals

9
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:41,269
something. What goes on the right hand side?
