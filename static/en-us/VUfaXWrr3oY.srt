00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,980
Congratulations on finishing lesson five. Here, we

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,840
took many of the basic techniques you learned

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,500
in previous lessons and extended them to

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,940
look at patterns across many variables at once.

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,020
>> We started with simple extensions to the scatter plot,

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,182
and plots of conditional summaries that you worked with in

7
00:00:18,182 --> 00:00:22,740
lesson four, such as adding summaries for multiple groups. Then,

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,790
we tried some techniques for examining a large number of variables

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:29,410
at once, such as scatter-plot matrices and heat maps.

10
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,570
>> We also learned how to reshape data, moving from

11
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,050
broad data with one row per case, to aggregate data

12
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,200
with one row per combination of variables, and we moved

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,230
back and forth between long and wide formats for our data.

14
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,320
>> Next up in lesson six, we'll hear from our colleague

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,890
Solomon. He's going to do an in-depth analysis of the diamond

16
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:55,770
data set, so you can see how an expert does it. Lesson six also covers a larger

17
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,120
part of the data analysis process, highlighting the role

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,310
of EDA. Solomon did a lot of reading about

19
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,550
the diamond industry. He wrote codes to scrape

20
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,310
and format a new data set, and he used

21
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,560
the results of his exploratory data analysis to guide,

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,150
interpret, and evaluate a statistical model of diamond prices.
