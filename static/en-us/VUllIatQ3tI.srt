1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,340
The results of this research were staggering.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,430
Diagnostic accuracy increased from 39% to 91% for

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:10,930
the two dimensional model shown here.

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,920
In terms of perception, this should make sense.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,440
The two dimensional model readily reveals all portions of the arteries,

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,510
while the three dimensional model can hide links in the artery from view.

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,930
Some might argue that the 3D model can be rotated, but it's important to

8
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,700
note that the 2D model can be viewed all at once within the span of the eye.

9
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:35,340
This allows us to make comparisons more quickly and easily.

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,953
I think one of the key takeaways from this research,

11
00:00:37,953 --> 00:00:41,620
is that simple visualizations are generally better.

12
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,890
You can read more about this visualization and

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,910
all of Michelle's research in the instructor notes.

14
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,840
For a Readers Digest version, I recommend looking at the slides she

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,820
put together for the 2011 InfoVis conference.
