00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
What have you learned? Well, to flip a coin n times one for k small or equal to n.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We ask the probability--what are the chance it comes up heads k times.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
For any coin, with the probability of heads equals to all caps P,.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
we now get the following formula: n!/(n-k)!*k!.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
These are the total number of outcomes that have this property.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And then this one has the following probability:

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:39,000
P to the k, this was the (0.8)⁹ before times (1-p) to the n-k,

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
which is the remaining 3 over here in this example.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So, this formula is the probability of what's call the binomial distribution

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and really was this is the accumulated outcome of many identical coin flips,

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and it leads us beautifully to our next lesson

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
when we talk about very large experiments and the normal distribution.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What you should have learned and understand now is you can take very large experiments

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
with large numbers of coin flips and compute the probability that heads comes a certain number

15
00:01:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
of times using the formula that you should now fully and wholly understand.
