00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,642
Now, you might be wondering why on Earth this is helpful at all, well, remember,

2
00:00:03,642 --> 00:00:07,264
what we're trying to do here. Since we can't factor this expression, we need a

3
00:00:07,264 --> 00:00:10,877
different way to find the x-intercepts. Here, we can tell that we're getting

4
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:14,414
close to being able to do that. At some point, we want to set y equal to zero,

5
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:18,160
and now we only have x written in one spot in our equation, rather than in two.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,445
We know how to take square roots, so I feel like we're getting pretty close. At

7
00:00:22,445 --> 00:00:26,640
this point, we need to think about the difference of squares again. Remember

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,798
that if we have a squared minus b squared, we can factor this as a minus b times

9
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:34,878
a plus b. Here, we have one term that's clearly squared, so maybe we can use

10
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:38,446
this technique to help us out. Now, 6 doesn't look like a squared number, but

11
00:00:38,446 --> 00:00:41,735
that doesn't really matter. We can stil,l of course, take the square root of 6

12
00:00:41,735 --> 00:00:45,021
and get a number. It may not be an integer but it is a real number. What I would

13
00:00:45,021 --> 00:00:48,183
like you do now is keeping all that in mind, write out the two factors in this

14
00:00:48,183 --> 00:00:51,758
form that we have coming from this expression right here. This is going to look

15
00:00:51,758 --> 00:00:56,110
pretty different from anything we worked with before and you may not think it

16
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:00,258
looks very pretty but just go with it, this is going to be super, super useful

17
00:01:00,258 --> 00:01:02,190
in everything we have coming up.
