00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We will spend a lot of time in this class referring to Reddit.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You know, we've used it as database examples, 
I refer to the system architecture, things we did,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and I've referred the mistakes I've 
made over the years on Reddit.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm going to kind of take from the top how we 
built Reddit and how we grew it over the years

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and then I'm going to talk with Neil, who 
is the current lead engineer of Reddit,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and he is going to talk about how they taken over 
since I've left, which is a couple of years ago now,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and continued to grow all the site 
as it has grown tremendously.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So we started in June 2005--

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
me and my co-founder, my college roommate, 
his name is Alexis Ohanian.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I was the engineer and Alexis was 
our kind of everything-else guy.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
He paid the rent. He did the business-guy 
stuff. He did the marketing things.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
He was my sounding board for future ideas. 
He did design work for Reddit.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Him and I basically lived Reddit for 
the first 2 years, the two of us.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
When we started, the first vision 
of Reddit was written in Lisp,

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
which is an actually very old programming 
language, one of the first ones.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I think it was originally invented in '50s.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It is still one of those powerful languages. 
It is very fun to develop in.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
One of the other professors here in Udacity, Peter 
Norvig, is one of the world's Lisp experts

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and a couple of his books are 
extremely good on the topic of Lisp.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It is more popular out set universities than it is 
in the real world, it's really need to working.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
During this time, we had variable traffic, 
but everything was in Lisp--

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
our Handlers, as you'd expect. Our HTML 
was all generated by Lisp.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Our CSS was all generated by Lisp. Javascript.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Lisp is a language that lands itself to 
generating other languages

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and other pieces of code really, really nicely.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not to get in to the details of it, but Lisp 
was all we had. We had Lisp plus Postgres.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We didn't have any memcached at that time. I've just 
stored everything in an in-memory hash table.
