1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,510
So let's finally get to our earthquake problem. We're going to look at 2

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,930
earthquakes. One of them happened in Japan in 2011. This earthquake had a

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:15,030
magnitude of 9.0. The other earthquake we're going to talk about happened in

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:21,960
California. It was in 1857 and it had a magnitude of 7.9. This is the largest

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,620
known earthquake in California. Now what do these numbers actually mean? Well,

6
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:31,143
lets talk about the equation for the magnitude of an earthquake. Lets say that

7
00:00:31,143 --> 00:00:36,750
R is the magnitude of an earthquake on a Richter scale. Then for R we have the

8
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:43,945
equation R equals log base 10 of I over S. Here, I is the intensity of the

9
00:00:43,945 --> 00:00:49,600
earthquake and S is equal to some constant. It's supposed to be the intensity

10
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,340
of some sort of standard earthquake, which just has a fixed value. We don't

11
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,650
need to know this value though, since we'll be eliminating it from our

12
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:02,134
equations eventually. So here, once again, is our information about our two

13
00:01:02,134 --> 00:01:06,890
earthquakes. How does this information fall into an equation of this sort?

14
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:12,310
Well, we know that R is the magnitude. So that means that over here for Japan

15
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:19,210
we'll have 9.0 equals log base 10 of J over S. I'm just going to use the letter

16
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:24,625
J instead of I, to show that this in the intensity of the Japanese earthquake.

17
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:30,100
For California, we'll have something very similar. We're just going to instead

18
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:35,870
have and R value of 7.9 and I'll use the letter C to represent the intensity of

19
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:42,840
this quake, C for California. Now notice that in both of these log equations,

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,540
we have a fraction as the input to the log. What we're going to want to do

21
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:52,600
first is to split each of these up into two separate logs, since otherwise

22
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,310
you're not going to be able to get rid of the S. So, which property do we need

23
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:02,080
to use in order to do that? Should we use the product property, the quotient

24
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,395
property, the power property or the change of base property.
