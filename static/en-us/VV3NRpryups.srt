1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,370
Here's the answer.

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:04,100
Recall what a preorder
traversal looks like.

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,060
It numbers the root
first before descending.

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,860
Now with respect to the pseudocode,
there's actually a slight ambiguity.

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,760
It doesn't say in what order
to visit the children.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,600
So that means the following
answer is also valid.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,860
Anyway, I hope the grading goblin
accepted valid alternatives and

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,140
rewarded you for thinking outside
the left to right, right to left box.
