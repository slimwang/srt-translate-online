1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:02,210
So you have the DOM tree and

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,020
we know the browser transforms
this into the accessibility tree.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,070
It can do this because much of
the DOM has implicit semantic meaning.

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:14,210
That is the DOM is using standard native
HTML elements that are automatically

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:18,400
recognized by browsers and were
predictably on a variety of platforms.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,750
Accessibility for native HTML
elements such as the standard link or

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,950
button, is handled
automatically as well.

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:28,230
We can take advantage of that
built in accessibility by writing

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,910
HTML which expresses the semantics
of our page directly.
