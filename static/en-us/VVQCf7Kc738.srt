This last function that we looked at is a bit of an interesting kind of

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:07,665
piecewise function, it's called a step function. A step function, is a function

3
00:00:07,665 --> 00:00:11,075
that's made up of one or more constant functions, as you can see for the last

4
00:00:11,075 --> 00:00:16,469
one we worked with. In both the graph and the equation, each piece is in fact a

5
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:21,780
constant function. f of x is equal to just a number in each part of the domain.

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,711
And we have a bunch of straight horizontal lines. In light of what you've just

7
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:29,195
learned about step functions, which of these graphs do you think represent step

8
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:34,091
functions? Remember that a step function is just a function made up of one or

9
00:00:34,091 --> 00:00:36,329
more constant pieces.
