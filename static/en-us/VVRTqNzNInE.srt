Back at the glasses expo, Grant has noticed what awesome flashy displays some of

2
00:00:04,434 --> 00:00:08,700
the other vendors have. He just got his little glasses wipers and his little

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,809
sign. Investing in some advertising seems like a really great idea for his

4
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:17,185
business. Unfortunately, Grant runs into a woman who works for an ad agency and

5
00:00:17,185 --> 00:00:21,950
she guarantees with her agency's help, Grant can make $5,000 in just 2 weeks. Of

6
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:26,586
course, there is a price to pay. That will cost Grant $2,000 to work with them.

7
00:00:26,586 --> 00:00:31,118
If we assume that Grant earns money at a constant rate or in other words that

8
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:35,698
the graph of profit versus time is a linear graph and a linear equation. How

9
00:00:35,698 --> 00:00:40,483
long will it take Grant to break even? That's what we want to figure out. Let's

10
00:00:40,483 --> 00:00:45,082
say that x is equal to the number of days since the answer released, and let's

11
00:00:45,082 --> 00:00:49,996
say that y is equal to Grant's profit in dollars. Thinking about the information

12
00:00:49,996 --> 00:00:54,417
that the problem gave us, what two points we know lie on our line? Note also,

13
00:00:54,417 --> 00:00:57,376
that making $5,000 means making a profit of $5,000.
