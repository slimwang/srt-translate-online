00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,790
The first kind of relationship we look at is generalization.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:07,550
This relationship between two classes indicates that an instance of one of

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:12,500
the two classes, the child class are, are the instances of one of

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,990
the two classes are a kind of instance of the other class,

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,050
called the parent class. This means that the instances of the child class

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:24,580
are the subset of the instances of the parent class. In our text,

7
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:29,580
words like kind of and type of, indicate a generalization relationship.

8
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,150
Even if these words aren't explicit in the text, the class names, themselves,

9
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:39,320
can serve as indicators. For example, cars are a sub class of vehicles.
