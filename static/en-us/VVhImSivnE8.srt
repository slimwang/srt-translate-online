Alright Charles you want to help us kind of work through this example?

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:08,780
>> Sure. So ,we multiply x1 times w1 so that gives us a half

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:09,583
>> Um-huh.

4
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:13,538
>> We multiply zero times three fifth which would get a zero.

5
00:00:13,538 --> 00:00:14,311
>> Um-huh.

6
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:17,380
>> And we multiply minus one point five times one. Which will

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:22,040
give us minus three halves. And so, the answers negative. Whatever it is.

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,500
>> It is right, so it's, this was negative ahead, negative one and

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,820
a half plus a half, so it should be negative one.

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,240
>> Right.

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,540
>> And, but that's not the output that we should actually

12
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,340
produce, right? That's the activation. What do we do with the activation?

13
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,120
>> Well we see if the activation is above our threshold theta, which in

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,510
this case is zero, and it is not So the output should be zero.

15
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:43,870
>> Good.
