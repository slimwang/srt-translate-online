1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,575
The answer is the second version is better and the reason for this is what would

2
00:00:04,575 --> 00:00:09,146
happen if we defined a PandaBear class? And suppose out PandaBear can climb a

3
00:00:09,146 --> 00:00:13,173
tree. So, we'll have a climb_tree attribute. With the first version, the

4
00:00:13,173 --> 00:00:16,955
PandaBear will go hungry, even though it's able to climb a tree, because we

5
00:00:16,955 --> 00:00:21,042
didn't know about PandaBears when we wrote this chase method, we only knew about

6
00:00:21,042 --> 00:00:25,357
BlackBears and GrizzlyBears. With the second version, the PandaBear will be able

7
00:00:25,357 --> 00:00:29,417
to climb the tree just like the BlackBear because its got a climb_tree method.

8
00:00:29,418 --> 00:00:32,531
When we wrote the bear chase method, we didn't need to know about the PandaBear,

9
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:35,305
we just need to know what it means a climb a tree and what it means to knock

10
00:00:35,305 --> 00:00:39,278
down a tree. I don't have a PandaBear but I do have a duck, quack, quack, and

11
00:00:39,278 --> 00:00:42,209
this is what's known as duck typing, quack, quack.
