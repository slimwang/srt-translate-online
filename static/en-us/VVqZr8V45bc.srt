1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,708
All we need to do to solve these two problems is plug the right numbers into

2
00:00:03,708 --> 00:00:08,220
our equations up here. Let's start out with the quarterly compounding option.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:17,822
What do we know? Well, P equals 20,000, r equals 0.04, n equals 4 and t equals

4
00:00:17,822 --> 00:00:23,872
5. Great. Now, let's just plug these numbers in to solve for A, since that's

5
00:00:23,872 --> 00:00:30,432
what we're looking for. A will equal 20,000 times 1 plus 0.04 over 4, all of

6
00:00:30,432 --> 00:00:40,298
that raised to the 4 times 5 power. This simplifies to 20,000 times 1.01 to the

7
00:00:40,298 --> 00:00:48,430
20. If we plug this into a calculator and round, we end up with $24,403.80.

8
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:53,125
Now, on to monthly compounding. We do almost exactly the same thing. In fact,

9
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:58,894
all of our information is the same, except that n is not 4. This time n is 12,

10
00:00:58,894 --> 00:01:05,691
since there are 12 months in 1 year. For A then, we have 20,000 times 1 plus

11
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:14,377
0.04 over 12 raised to the 5 times 20 or 60 power. Plugging this into a

12
00:01:14,377 --> 00:01:21,380
calculator gives us $24,419.93. Although, these two total balances aren't too

13
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,860
far off from one another, Grant will end up with slightly more money if he goes

14
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:32,230
with the monthly compounding interest choice. And look at that, after 5 years

15
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:35,768
in either case, he'll earn over $4,400 just by keeping his money in his

16
00:01:35,768 --> 00:01:40,215
account. That's a pretty good deal.
