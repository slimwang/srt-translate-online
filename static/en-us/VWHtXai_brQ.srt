00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now for the answer. Let's check all that apply.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
A simplified test case is easier to communicate.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This is correct, because if it's simpler, takes less time, easier to understand.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
A simplified test case usually means small fixes.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Unfortunately, that's not the case.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It may mean faster fixes, but it does not mean smaller fixes.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The fix will be the same whether the test case is in its original complex form or whether it's simplified.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
A simplified test case usually means smaller program states. Yes.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
If the input is smaller, then all the data structures that represent the input will be smaller as well.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And, a simplified test case usually means fewer program steps.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This is correct as well, because it takes fewer steps to process the simplified input.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And there we go.
