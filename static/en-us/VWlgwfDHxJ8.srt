1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,155
So all the tweets come in from a lot of places.

2
00:00:03,155 --> 00:00:03,780
>> Mm-hm.

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,260
>> And then they form some master, big pipe.

4
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,029
And then Storm processes that.

5
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,566
What do you use to aggregate all the tweets from [CROSSTALK] is it

6
00:00:11,566 --> 00:00:12,657
storm in reverse?

7
00:00:12,657 --> 00:00:14,901
[LAUGH].

8
00:00:14,901 --> 00:00:18,123
>> Actually it's not there's a sophisticated pipeline and

9
00:00:18,123 --> 00:00:20,510
scaling system that runs those things.

10
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:24,155
>> Okay. >> So like, we have what you call Ascribe running on

11
00:00:24,155 --> 00:00:28,265
pretty much all the, the servers, and so whenever you create and

12
00:00:28,265 --> 00:00:31,973
do engagement with the computer application and everything.

13
00:00:31,973 --> 00:00:33,077
>> Yeah.

14
00:00:33,077 --> 00:00:35,483
>> Those are all captured as log units.

15
00:00:35,483 --> 00:00:36,239
>> I see.

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,428
>> Those log units are captured on the [INAUDIBLE].

17
00:00:40,428 --> 00:00:45,726
So, I the logs and collected like on the door.

18
00:00:45,726 --> 00:00:52,010
And we can more of the that's the main part.

19
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,236
And once you collect them,

20
00:00:53,236 --> 00:00:57,120
then it goes to something called a Skype application system.

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,646
Where it's coming from several hundreds of thousands of

22
00:01:00,646 --> 00:01:03,440
nodes [INAUDIBLE] aggregated nodes.

23
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,790
And those nodes in turn pump the data into HTFS for complete persistence.

24
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,650
>> Okay. >> And also push towards Kafka.

25
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:16,210
And that is to be a queueing system, that I said.

26
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,770
And up all these out of it.

27
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:18,680
>> Out of the Kafka.

28
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,440
Okay, thank you.

29
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,460
No, that's very interesting.

30
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:26,334
>> Yes. [CROSSTALK] So that, that pipeline/ is a pipeline unless
