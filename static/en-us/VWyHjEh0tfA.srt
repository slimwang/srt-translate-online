00:00:00,569 --> 00:00:06,308
Ã¯Â»Â¿Student W.Q. Feng asked when do you use a recursive definition versus a 'while' loop?

2
00:00:06,308 --> 00:00:12,211
So this is a good question and in terms of being able to solve a problem,

3
00:00:12,211 --> 00:00:15,954
anything you can do with recursion you can also do with a 'while' loop.

4
00:00:15,954 --> 00:00:18,299
Anything you can do with a 'while' loop you could also do with recursion.

5
00:00:18,299 --> 00:00:20,476
So any problem you can solve either way.

6
00:00:20,476 --> 00:00:23,668
Usually solving it with a 'while' loop would be more efficient

7
00:00:23,668 --> 00:00:26,676
because you donÃ¢ÂÂt have the overhead of all the extra procedure calls.

8
00:00:26,676 --> 00:00:30,456
Often solving it with recursion is a simpler and more elegant solution.

9
00:00:30,456 --> 00:00:34,757
So depending on whatÃ¢ÂÂs more important, oftentimes the tradeoff

10
00:00:34,757 --> 00:00:38,127
is much better where the simpler elegant solution

11
00:00:38,127 --> 00:00:41,049
that performance difference you probably couldnÃ¢ÂÂt even measure

12
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:43,778
unless you were timing really carefully for really large inputs,

13
00:00:43,778 --> 00:00:45,247
you wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt notice the difference.

14
00:00:45,247 --> 00:00:48,115
So itÃ¢ÂÂs more important to get the solution correct and have it

15
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:51,329
in code thatÃ¢ÂÂs easier for you to write and easier for other people to understand,

16
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,350
in many problems the recursive solution

17
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,859
really lends itself to that. ItÃ¢ÂÂs much shorter than the iterative solution would be

18
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:00,190
and itÃ¢ÂÂs easier to understand and follow.

19
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:04,331
In places where performance matters and we saw this with the Fibonacci example

20
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:07,503
that if you end up blowing up the number of calls in a way

21
00:01:07,503 --> 00:01:09,595
that makes it too slow to do recursively,

22
00:01:09,595 --> 00:01:13,368
you might prefer a more complicated solution that involves a 'while' loop and avoids the recursive calls.
