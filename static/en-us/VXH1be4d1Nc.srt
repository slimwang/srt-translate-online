Moving on, what if instead of having a sample of size 35, our sample had 250

00:00:06,535 --> 00:00:12,604
people in it. And they also have the mean Klout score of 40. Now, what's the

00:00:12,604 --> 00:00:18,363
likelihood of randomly selecting from this Klout population? A sample of size

00:00:18,363 --> 00:00:23,923
250, whose mean is at least 40. First let's find the standard error.
