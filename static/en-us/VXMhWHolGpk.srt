1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,510
There's always more changes
that we wish we could do,

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,663
if we just had a little more time.

3
00:00:05,663 --> 00:00:07,798
We're going to leave those
as exercises to you

4
00:00:07,798 --> 00:00:09,416
if you want to keep polishing it up.

5
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:12,558
For example, for simplicity,
we had all tablet sizes

6
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:15,002
and orientations, 
use the same layout.

7
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:19,320
However, 7 inch portrait would
actually look better as a one pin UI.

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,030
So you can modify your resource folders

9
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,920
to make 7 inch portrait 
use the phone layout.

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,130
You can also tweak the two pane behavior
so that the today layout is auto selected

11
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,020
when you first launch the app.

12
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,000
Also, this should just say "today"
instead of having the full date.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,600
That way, it'll look more
like the other items.

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,245
As you play around with the app, 
feel free to make any changes

15
00:00:38,245 --> 00:00:41,000
you think would help improve
the user experience.
