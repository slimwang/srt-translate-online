1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,090
So today what we're going to do is we're going to finish up Hough with two

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,060
significant changes.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,600
The first one is we're going to use non-analytic models.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,420
So it's not going to be lines, not going to be circles,

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,210
where we had, where our parameters were analytic parameters.

6
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,280
Instead, the parameters are going to express, say, the orientation or

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,410
the scale of some fixed but arbitrary template.

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,570
The second thing, and this we'll only talk about briefly.

9
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,450
Is a visual code word based approach where we

10
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,990
used what are called visual code words for

11
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:32,549
the features instead of edges, and this is much more modern computer vision.

12
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:37,410
Edges really came from a, an older view of, of how objects would be described.

13
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,880
And now the focus tends to be a lot more on individual features.

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,510
And, later in the course, we'll talk about interest points, and features about

15
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:48,260
those points because I don't want to teach you just old computer vision.

16
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,580
So, that was the, so the, the first one was then, and this is the now
