1
00:00:00,402 --> 00:00:02,360
>> All right, so turns out it, it matters how we

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:07,200
select training examples when when a learner is needing to learn.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,590
So let's at least articulate some various ways that training examples

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,610
could be selected. And then for each one we might end

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:16,270
up with a different answer as to how much training data

6
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,930
is going to be needed, if the training examples are selected in

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,290
that particular way. So, so what do you think, Charles? Are

8
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:25,420
there, there any ways you can think of for selecting training examples?

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,920
>> Well, so, I, I, I so here's how

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,650
I think about it. So, you keep using the word

11
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,490
learner, and when there's a learner there's often a

12
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,720
teacher. So, I'm trying to think about this in the

13
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,310
different ways that learners and teachers can interact. So,

14
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,030
I'm going to try to think about my, my experience as

15
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,600
a professor. So, there are a couple. Here's one,

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,770
one is: sometimes the learner asks questions of the teacher.

17
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:50,450
>> I see,

18
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,520
so in this case, the learner would be

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,480
selecting the training examples. The learner would say,

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,760
I, you know, here's, here's an input x, would you please tell me c of x?

21
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,090
>> Right, that's exactly what I mean, right,

22
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,390
right. Then there's another case. So the learner

23
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,520
asks questions of the teacher. But sometimes the

24
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,660
teacher just goes ahead and gives x, c(x) pairs.

25
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,310
>> And let's say it's, it actually is trying to help the learner.

26
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,020
>> Sure.

27
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:15,530
>> So

28
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:16,700
it's a, friendly teacher.

29
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,438
>> Okay, I've had some of those.

30
00:01:18,438 --> 00:01:20,030
>> Good, all right so, the, it could be

31
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,020
the, the learner asking to try to get data.

32
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,580
It could be the teacher asking to try to

33
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,380
lead the learner to something good. And, anything else?

34
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,870
>> Well, so, I like this, this way of thinking about it. Because

35
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:33,480
it sort of makes sense in my world as a professor, but it doesn't actually

36
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,120
sound like either of things is what we've been looking at so far. What

37
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,580
I think we've been looking at so far is that somehow the Xs and

38
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,780
the CXs, the training examples, just come out of nowhere.

39
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:48,290
They come from some underlying distribution. It's just nature. It's just

40
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,200
coming at us from some process that we don't know what

41
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,600
that process is. Yeah, I like that. So in some sense

42
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,030
there's three individuals that could be asking for examples. There's

43
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,430
the teacher, there's the learner, and there's, like, the world around

44
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,140
them. And, and, the things could come from any of those.

45
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,400
I guess another possibility would be that questions are asked specifically

46
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,699
in an evil way. All right, so all

47
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,810
of these different kinds of distributions or, or

48
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,760
ways of selecting training examples are actually going

49
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,140
to come into play in the stuff that

50
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,080
we're talking about. Let's let's use the first

51
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,370
couple to get a sense of why these

52
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,810
things might be different from each other. So

53
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,840
let's go back to this notion of 20 questions.

54
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,540
>> Okay.
