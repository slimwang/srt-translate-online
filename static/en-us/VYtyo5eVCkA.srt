00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:05,170
Back in the 1970s, when I was
involved in developing an early EMR,

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,350
the data collection
problem was already clear.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,590
In fact, for the most part,

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,300
our physicians dictated notes that
were transcribed into the EMR.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,300
I used to tell visitors that someday,

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,510
voice recognition would make this
far more efficient and accurate.

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,510
Has that day arrived?

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,490
To answer that question,
we'll look at M*Modal,

9
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:32,710
one of the most advanced medically
specific voice recognition technologies.

10
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,720
As shown here, it not only
translates voice to text, but

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,060
it recognizes clinical
concepts in that text and

12
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,296
can code them into ICD-9 or SNOMED.

13
00:00:45,296 --> 00:00:51,686
Here, 346.9 is the ICD-9 code for
migraine headache.

14
00:00:51,686 --> 00:00:56,739
62972009 is actually the SNOMED CT
code for an extraction,

15
00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:01,964
showing that at least at the time this
slide was made, which was a number

16
00:01:01,964 --> 00:01:07,626
of years ago, the system was not exactly
perfect, because there is actually

17
00:01:07,626 --> 00:01:12,710
a better SNOMED CT code that is
specific to wisdom tooth extraction.
