00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,280
In this lesson we will talk about

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,630
distributed hash tables, which enable a form of

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,440
content overlay called a structured overlay. We'll

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,130
talk about a particular distributed hash table called

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,200
Chord and an underlying mechanism that enables

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,820
it, called consistent hashing. Chord is a scalable,

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,120
distributed lookup service. A lookup service is

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,220
simply any service that maps keys to values.

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,960
Examples of lookup services on the internet include

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,770
DNS and directory services. Chord has some desirable

11
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:37,370
properties, including scalability, provable correctness, and reasonably good

12
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,310
performance that's also fairly easy to reason about.
