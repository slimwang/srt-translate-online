00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,756
Well we know that a circle is flattened on a screen, so it must be

2
00:00:03,756 --> 00:00:08,223
2-dimensional. The same is true for a triangle, a square and a trapezoid.

00:00:08,223 --> 00:00:12,610
They're all flat, so they must be 2-dimensional. A cube and a cylinder are

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:17,040
definitely 3-dimensional. We can hold a cube in our hand or we can pick up a

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,464
cylinder, like a cup or a glass. Great work on that quiz.
