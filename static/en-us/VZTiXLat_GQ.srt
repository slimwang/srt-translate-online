1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,690
Putting some numbers behind this,

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:06,460
the dynamic range that the human
eye can deal with is incredible.

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:11,510
It ranges over 14 orders of magnitude,
and there's almost nothing

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,250
in the real world that works over
14 orders of magnitude, right?

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,810
So that means 10 to the 14,
one and 14 zeros times

6
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,430
from the darkest dark to the brightest
bright that you can deal with, and

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,140
by the way, that does include looking,
like, directly at the sun, because,

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,460
frankly, you can't actually see much
when you look directly at the sun.

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,010
It's too bright.

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:29,740
All right?

11
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:34,541
But you can go from somewhere from 10
to the minus six to 10 to the eighth,

12
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:39,710
what's called candelas, which is
a unit of energy, per square meter.

13
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,910
It's a measure of the amount
of the flux of the light, and

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,440
flux falls on a particular area.

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,570
So, the human eye can
set its dynamic range,

16
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,630
its set point, to anywhere from this
really low, this 10 to the minus six,

17
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,360
10 to the minus five, 10 to the minus
four, so that'd be a range of two,

18
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,330
up to 10 to the six, 10 to the seven,
10 to the, another range of two.

19
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,030
It can set it anywhere
along that spectrum.

20
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,117
At any given point in time, it's
operating at at least a hundred to one,

21
00:01:04,117 --> 00:01:07,542
maybe a thousand to one, maybe,
maybe even more than that.

22
00:01:07,542 --> 00:01:09,417
It depends upon how you're doing.

23
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:13,386
And in any given sort of real world
scene, like I was just showing you,

24
00:01:13,386 --> 00:01:16,914
the actual ratio of sort of the darkest
area to the brightest area,

25
00:01:16,914 --> 00:01:19,875
can sometimes be in
the order of 100,000 to one.

26
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:21,297
Right?
So you're standing there,

27
00:01:21,297 --> 00:01:22,613
it's really bright outside,

28
00:01:22,613 --> 00:01:25,293
it's kind of dark in here,
that difference might be under if,

29
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:28,680
if it was that far, even your eye
would have difficulty dealing with it.

30
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,590
But it's way better than
most imaging systems.

31
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,960
Now, the thing is,
everybody knows about your pupal, right?

32
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,650
When it's bright out the pupal closes
down, when it's light you know,

33
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,640
when its, dark, the pupal opens up.

34
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,050
That's a very small range of variation.

35
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:47,260
A colleague of mine,
professor actually, used to say that it

36
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,490
was like an order of 10 to 100
variation, in terms of the size.

37
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:52,050
He actually said 10, but
I think it's a little smaller than that.

38
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,425
But how do you do the this
great huge variation?

39
00:01:55,425 --> 00:01:59,685
Well, it's actually the retina's
ganglion cells that make this happen.

40
00:01:59,685 --> 00:02:02,775
And the way it does it is, and
this is sort of looking at just a single

41
00:02:02,775 --> 00:02:06,262
section, so remember, light's coming
in this way, not too important for the,

42
00:02:06,262 --> 00:02:10,502
here we have our photo receptors,
here we have our horizontal cells,

43
00:02:10,502 --> 00:02:14,872
our bipolar cells, Amacrine, and
then there's these ganglion cells.

44
00:02:14,872 --> 00:02:18,932
But notice that this thing is referred
to as the surround, the center,

45
00:02:18,932 --> 00:02:19,612
and the surround.

46
00:02:19,612 --> 00:02:24,327
And you can think of this as being
a slice through a circular operator,

47
00:02:24,327 --> 00:02:28,950
okay, and that circular operator
would look something like this.

48
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,400
Okay?

49
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,780
In the retina, they are refered to as
center-surround receptive fields, and

50
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,770
what that means is, that in the positive
ones takes the illumination that's

51
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:45,950
from the middle, and they subtract
off the illumination around the back.

52
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:50,400
The negative ones do the negative in the
middle and subtract, and add, positive.

53
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,150
But basically what they're
doing is they're comparing

54
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,070
the local illumination to the,

55
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,550
a little patch of the illumination
to the overall illumination.

56
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,460
So what happens when
things get much brighter?

57
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,690
Well if it's just getting
brighter over the whole thing,

58
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,310
not a lot different changes.

59
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,690
So one part of your retina can
be sort of electrically and

60
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,830
chemically setting its dynamic
range at one place, and

61
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,320
another part is at another
place simultaneously.

62
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,900
So the part that's looking at
the bright window in the church

63
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,390
is operating at one place.

64
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:24,950
The part that's op, that's looking
at the the darker part, it,

65
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,650
it, it's doing its center-surround
on a darker area, but

66
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,280
it's looking at those
relative contrasts.

67
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,790
This plot here is just a notion of what
a center-surround field looks like.
