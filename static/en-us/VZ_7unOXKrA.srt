00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,870
Before we get started, let's discuss
some of the necessary technologies you

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,020
should be familiar with in order to
get the most out of this course.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,910
Most importantly, you should have
a basic understanding of Python coding.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,050
If you're comfortable creating classes,
writing methods, and

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,930
understand inheritance,
you are in good shape for this course.

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:21,310
Knowledge of SQL statements such as
insert into, select, update, and

7
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,680
delete will also be a useful
skill in this course.

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,460
I will also assume you're
very comfortable reading and

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,050
writing HTML code.

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,880
CSS and JavaScript won't be necessary
to complete the activities, but

11
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,210
are helpful for creating a polished,
presentable final project.

12
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,320
Knowing your way around
the Unix command line and

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,940
being able to navigate through the file
system is also going to come in handy.

14
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,110
If you are unfamiliar or would like
to brush up on any of these topics,

15
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,330
please refer to the instructor notes for
some helpful links to classes and

16
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,640
other references.

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,030
For ease of configuration, and

18
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,120
installation, I strongly recommend using
a Vagrant machine for this course.

19
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,230
Vagrant allows you to create a virtual
machine on your computer so that you can

20
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,750
program without worrying about affecting
your computer's current configuration.

21
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,280
I have provided you a Vagrant file
with all of the necessary software

22
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,489
already installed.

23
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,990
A link to installing this Vagrant file
is provided in the instructor notes.

24
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:12,940
Once you successfully run vagrant up and
vagrant ssh, you're ready to keep going.
