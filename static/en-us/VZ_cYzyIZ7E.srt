1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,350
Okay, let's consider these questions.

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,760
So, how will you associate buttons and
methods?

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,300
Well, we're going to make
some methods first, and

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,480
then we'll associate them by using
the on click attribute of the buttons.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,440
Okay, so the next question is
what new variables will you need?

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,630
Well, you're actually only going
to need to make one more variable.

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,500
And this is to represent Team B's score.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,430
Team B's score needs to be a variable,
and it needs to be a global variable,

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:34,040
for similar reasons that Team A's
score needed to be a global variable.

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,180
And these reasons are basically,
that you want to save the score between

11
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,880
button clicks, and
you want to be able to update the score.

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,500
Now, you can't use the same variable for
both.

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,350
If you did that,
then the score would be the same.

14
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:48,020
Meaning that whenever
Team A scored a point,

15
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,160
Team B would also be scoring a point.

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,340
It's not much of a game that way.

17
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,350
So it's important to have a separate
variable that isn't affected by

18
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,640
changing the score for Team A,
which brings us to the next question.

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,790
How will these scores
actually be changed?

20
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,580
Well, it's going to
be similar to Team A.

21
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,250
The scores will change
when you click buttons.

22
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,850
So, you click a button.

23
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,630
This triggers a method that you've
associated with the button.

24
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,220
You'll add some amount to
the score variable for Team B, and

25
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,440
then you'll display it.

26
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,470
It's very similar to the Team A side.

27
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,089
Okay, let's see this in practice.

28
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,570
OK, so here's my Java code.

29
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:27,310
And I've scrolled up so
that I could see the three methods

30
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,410
that allow me to update the scores for
Team A.

31
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:33,030
So I want a pretty similar one for
Team B.

32
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,850
I'll start with just
making the free throw one.

33
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,270
Okay.
So I'm going to go ahead and

34
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,230
just start typing, public void.

35
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,980
And we'll call this, add,
and it's free throw.

36
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,890
So I'm adding one point.

37
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:45,390
OneForTeamB.

38
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,530
Add one for team B.

39
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:55,884
And I'll put view v in there,
curly braces.

40
00:01:55,884 --> 00:01:56,980
Okay.

41
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,340
Now, hm, what should I do in here?

42
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,280
Now I want to basically be doing
the same thing, taking a variable,

43
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,100
updating it, displaying it.

44
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,500
But I don't have a variable yet
for team B.

45
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:09,870
I guess I'll go up and
make it right now.

46
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,670
So I'm going to scroll all
the way up to the top.

47
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,110
Now right before
the variable score team A.

48
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:23,360
I'm going to make int scoreTeamB,
and I'll also set it to 0.

49
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,660
I'll go ahead and add a similar
comment to the one for TeamA.

50
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,390
Now I"m going to scroll down.

51
00:02:29,822 --> 00:02:33,450
All right, and
now I have a variable to work with.

52
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:39,110
So I'm going to say that the score for
team B, well I've clicked the add 1 for

53
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:43,430
Team B so it's going to be
equal to its current value

54
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,600
plus 1, because I'm adding
1 to the score for Team B.

55
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,370
Okay, and then I'm going to display it.

56
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:56,160
Now I need to make sure to pick
the display for Team B method and

57
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,260
not the display for Team A.

58
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:04,760
And I will print out Score Team B,
and not the score for team A.

59
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,030
Well that looks pretty good.

60
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,860
The only thing now,

61
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,920
is to make sure that clicking the button
will actually trigger this code.

62
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,650
So I'm going to go over to my XML.

63
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,150
And go down the free throw, for Team B.

64
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,670
So, it looks like I'm in Team B.

65
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,810
This is the score for Team B.

66
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,970
Okay, here are the buttons.

67
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,040
It's three points, two points.

68
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,650
Free throw, okay, good.

69
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,020
So, I actually already have
an OnClick attribute here,

70
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,800
because I copied and pasted.

71
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,400
But I don't want to be adding one for

72
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,520
Team A, I want to be adding one for
Team B.

73
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,360
Maybe I'll change these as well.

74
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,970
Okay, well, I'm not done, but it
should work for the Free Throw button.

75
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,060
So let's try this code.

76
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,669
Okay, so let's just make sure
that Team A still works.

77
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,170
It's looking good.

78
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:00,250
All right, now let's see if
the Team B free-throw button works.

79
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,240
Yeah, awesome.

80
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,630
It looks like it works.

81
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,350
Okay, let's try pressing plus two.

82
00:04:05,805 --> 00:04:07,095
Hm.

83
00:04:07,095 --> 00:04:09,205
Well, that wasn't so great.

84
00:04:09,205 --> 00:04:10,585
Let's see why.

85
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:14,055
So, if I scroll up,
I can see an error here,

86
00:04:15,075 --> 00:04:18,725
that says it couldn't
find the addTwoForTeamB.

87
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,045
Oh, right.

88
00:04:20,045 --> 00:04:25,070
So, I changed these methods to say
addTwoForTeamB and addThreeForTeamB.

89
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,130
But if I go back to my
main activity Java,

90
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,090
I don't actually have
the corresponding code here.

91
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,590
I just have add one for team B.

92
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:39,050
Let's solve that by copying add one for
team B and pasting it.

93
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,400
Because one, two, three here,
so I'm going to addOneForTeamB,

94
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:50,470
addTwoForTeamB, addThreeForTeamB,

95
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:57,770
and we'll actually have to change what
it does to add to And to add three.

96
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,970
Okay.

97
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,810
Then, and
I kind of like these comments here.

98
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:06,090
So, I'm going to copy this comment,
and paste it here.

99
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:09,560
And it says Increase the score for
Team A by three.

100
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,740
But this method is actually increasing
the score for Team B by one.

101
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:22,390
I'm going to copy it again, paste it,
increases the score for TeamB by two.

102
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:28,380
This increases the score for
TeamB by three.

103
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,790
Okay, so
I think that might be everything I need.

104
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,700
I'm going to try running it again.

105
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,820
All right, moment of truth.

106
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,830
Team A still working fine.

107
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,350
All right, Team B scores two points.

108
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,170
Yes.

109
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,680
Scores three points, awesome.

110
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,330
Scores two points again.

111
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,630
Scores a free throw, free throw.

112
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,020
Three points.

113
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,510
Cool, looks like it's working.
