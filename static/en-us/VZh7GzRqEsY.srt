1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,680
IC, or the information coefficient,

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:09,410
is just the correlation of the manager's
forecast to actual returns.

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,580
So for instance, if she made a forecast
on IBM, that it would go up 1%,

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:19,230
and it went up 0.5%, well,
it's a positive correlation.

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,768
This value can range from 0,
where the correlation is not present,

6
00:00:23,768 --> 00:00:27,560
to 1, where it's very, very strong.

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,530
Finally, BR, or

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,730
breadth, represents the number of
trading opportunities per year.

9
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:38,420
So for example, if you're Warren Buffet,
and you hold 120 stocks, and

10
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:43,905
you just hold them all year,
that's 120 trading opportunities.

11
00:00:43,905 --> 00:00:49,400
If, say, you're Jim Simons, and
you trade 100,000 times per day,

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,460
you multiply that times the number
of trading days in a year, well,

13
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,680
it turns out to be a very large number.

14
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,620
Key thing is, even if it's just
a portfolio where you buy and

15
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,290
hold, you count the number of positions
in that portfolio as the number of

16
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:09,440
trading opportunities, because this
is oriented around an annual measure.
