1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Things are actually even worst.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We cannot set the wheel slip directly and we can't even set the brakes directly, at least not

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
with the standard type of hydraulic brake that's part of common cars.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So realistic approach to anti-lock braking is the following--the driver slams on the brake

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
as strongly as possible and then the electronic checks whether the wheel slips becomes too large.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
If so, it starts to decrease the pressure of the brake fluid and so on and so on.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The implementation of this will be part of the homework.
