1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,570
Okay, so now we've done some research so
we can finalize our marketing plans.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:08,039
From lesson one we already know our
audience is dog owners who travel.

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,990
We've chosen a persona to focus on, we
completed our competitive analysis and

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,290
our value proposition so we know how
to position ourselves in the market.

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,280
And now we know our
distribution plan and

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,090
the keywords we're planning on using.

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,190
We've done a great job so far,
and now we're ready to move on to

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,510
actually creating the materials
we're going to need for launch.

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,180
First, we'll need to create our landing
page, create our app store listing, and

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,260
then do some beta testing.
