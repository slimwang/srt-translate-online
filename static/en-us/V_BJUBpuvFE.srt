00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
One of the things I've been working on for most of my professional career are self-driving cars.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The vision is that in the future cars will drive themselves,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and in doing so they can be significantly safer.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We lose about a little over 1 million people per year in the entire world in traffic accidents.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I believe most of these accidents can be avoided by making cars safer.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If they drive themselves, they can drive disabled people.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
They can drive blind people, young children, aging people,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and they could drive all of us while we do better things that staring at the road ahead.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So one of my life passions has been to be develop self-driving cars.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Today, I'd like to tell you about those, and also show you some of the basic techniques

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
so you can in principle program your own self-driving car.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So for me the work on self-driving cars started in 2004 after the first DARPA Grand Challenge.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This was a government-sponsored robot race

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
in which autonomous robots were asked to drive through the Mojave desert from California to Nevada

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
along 141 miles of really punishing desert terrain.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Lots of teams competed from various universities, car companies,

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and also lots of hobbiests that were new to the field competed,

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and built this huge set of different cars.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
There were over 100 different entries into the first DARPA Grand Challenge.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Despite all this work, most robots failed out of the starting gate,

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
like this one over here flipped over less than 100 meters into the race.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Some were very, very large.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This is a major defense contractor who built this 35,000 pound vehicle,

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
which on the course was rather timid,

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and some of the the teams had very small robots, like the next one by UC Berkeley,

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
which was a motorcycle.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So here we go.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The first DARPA Grand Challenge came with $1 million of prize money,

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and despite this prize money, no team made it further than 5% of the total course.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
In fact, almost all cars stopped for something very stupid,

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
some went up in flames,

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and the furthest any team made it was this car over here by Carnegie Mellon University,

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
which made it about just below 8 miles of the total distance.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So for many of us, this was a massive failure of robotic technology,

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
which motivated me to get involved in this race.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
My own story is really simple.

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I started a class at Stanford, and I got about 20 students to work with me

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
on what would become the Stanford racing team that would ultimately go and win this race.

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We modified a Volkswagen Toureg to put all kinds of sensors onto the roof

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
and actuators into the car that could actuate the steering wheel, the gas pedal, and the brake.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The sensors came in multiple versions.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Some were related to localization, such as global positioning sensors,

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and some were related to understanding where obstacles are, like laser-range finders.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We talked about computer vision in this class.

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The actuators were basically a motor on the steering wheel and on the brake pedals and on the gas pedal.

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Early on, we tested on Stanford's campus.

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This is the roof of the medical parking garage.

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Here you can see my students and I performed simple maneuvers.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Now, I've got to tell you that this is usually a busy parking garage.

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's the medical parking garage at Stanford Hospital,

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
but as we practiced autonomous driving, people would come and pick up their car

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and ask us about, what we were doing, so we kept telling them,

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
well, we're building a self-driving car.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Within less than a week, people just chose not to park there anymore.

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Closer to the next version of the Grand Challenge, the second one in 2005,

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
we had built a car that could drive competently on most desert tracks

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:22,000
at speeds up to about 60 km per hour through dry river beds, through steep inclines and declines,

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and would be able to avoid obstacles like this little shrub on the right side over here.

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It was never really elegant, but it was insanely effective.

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Now, not all testing went smooth.

61
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
This is imagery that the New York Times shot of us when we invited them for a test drive.

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
During this day, we managed to crash into a tree and get stuck in the mud.

63
00:04:47,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It was pretty embarrassing.
