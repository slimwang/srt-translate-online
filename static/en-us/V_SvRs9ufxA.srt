1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,620
Now let's look at what we can
do with a camera like this.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,620
So, again,

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,060
we know that if somebody gave me this
information I would have a camera.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,220
And basically what I'm doing is,
to create this burn image,

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,180
remember our lectures on doing
things like convolution.

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,530
If I'm convolving with
a stock function like this,

7
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,890
blurring is basically equivalent to
convolution and this would be my output.

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,668
The size of this kind of suggests
the size of the step function that we,

9
00:00:24,668 --> 00:00:25,577
you would have.

10
00:00:25,577 --> 00:00:27,631
And of course what basically comes down,
and

11
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:30,725
there's a concept of a sinc function,
which basically says that.

12
00:00:30,725 --> 00:00:33,158
And sinc function for
those of you curious,

13
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:36,466
basically is showing
the information about a signal.

14
00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:39,662
And it basically says a sinc
function is a general form here and

15
00:00:39,662 --> 00:00:43,000
basically is a sine wave that
decays with an amplitude 1 over x.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,640
So as we move away,
it gets smaller and smaller.

17
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,660
This is one of the standard ways of
actually computing discrete Fourier

18
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,330
transforms and

19
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:53,820
it's one of the pairs that captures
the magnitude of a signal like this.

20
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,910
So this is, of course, one of the sinc
functions for a signal like this.
