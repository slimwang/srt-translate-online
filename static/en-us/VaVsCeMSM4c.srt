00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,120
Now that we have
a functioning application,

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,300
let's add some API endpoints to it.

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,350
The API request should return a JSON
object for a list of all restaurants,

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,480
the menu of a specific restaurant,
and a specific menu item,

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,580
when a client sends a GET request
to one of these three URLs.

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,120
Remember to import jsonify
into your project and

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,600
add a serializable property to your
database set up file where needed.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,469
Your JSON request should return pages
like these when you're finished.
