1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,950
I knew that I wanted to iterate through all of the p tags on the page,

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,890
so I selected all the p tags and called .each on it.

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:11,795
I passed in the function numberAdder which I defined up here.

4
00:00:11,795 --> 00:00:15,320
NumberAdder simply finds the text that's already there.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,350
Figures out how long it is and then changes the text

6
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,460
on each element to the same text plus a space and then a number.

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,760
When we hit Test Run we can see how it looks.

8
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,350
And check it out.

9
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,300
Now we've got how many characters are in each p tag.
