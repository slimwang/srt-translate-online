1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,390
Android Wear uses voice throughout the
platform, and one of the best places to

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,410
see it in action is doing
replies to notifications.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,130
Normally when you touch
the reply action on a phone,

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,120
it'll take you to an activity
to enter the text.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,500
On Android Wear, the user can touch this
reply button and then speak a reply and

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,790
it is then converted into a string and
delivered to your app.

7
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,240
Best of all, you can use this feature
with just a few lines of code,

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,330
added to your existing
notifications on the phone.

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,660
We use a class called
RemoteInput to implement this.

10
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,710
We declare a string extra_voice_reply
that specifies the key

11
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,670
that will be delivered
to the intent later on.

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,930
We also declare a label to
put on the text reply screen

13
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,040
telling the user what we
want them to speak to us.

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,560
You then call build to get
the remote input object.

15
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,140
Now we need to add the remote
input to our notification.

16
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,390
You can see here we declare a pending
intent to receive the reply.

17
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,990
We then create an action and

18
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:03,070
then we use addRemoteInput to use the
remote input object we created earlier.

19
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:08,700
Then we use extend on the notification
to add a wearable extender, add action,

20
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,870
and the action we just created.

21
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,360
Everything is now linked together,
and we can issue the notification.

22
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,580
This code will continue
to work on a phone, but

23
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,960
now we can have a reply action that
asks the user to speak a reply.

24
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,230
So how do we get the reply string back?

25
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,820
The previous code is written to use
an activity called reply activity.

26
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,940
Inside there, you can call get intent
to find details about the intent that

27
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,260
started the activity.

28
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,800
Once you have the intent,

29
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,670
you can pass it to the getMessageText
method shown here.

30
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:41,040
We can then extract out the voice
reply using the key EXTRA_VOICE_REPLY,

31
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,780
which returns a CharSequence
that was spoken by the user.

32
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,340
And that's it.

33
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,060
It's that easy.

34
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,920
Speech recognition has traditionally
been very hard to do by yourself, and

35
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,660
Android Wear takes care of all of it for
you.

36
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,520
There is also support for
emoji entry in Android Wear, and

37
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,540
these are automatically
handled on the wearable, and

38
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,920
sent to your app as standard
emoji unicode characters.

39
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,050
You don't always have
to use voice replies.

40
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,740
Sometimes your user will be
unable to speak to the watch and

41
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,870
they might want to reply with
a set of pre canned replies.

42
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:12,450
You can use the set choices method
to specify an array of options that

43
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,910
the user can select from to be
used along with a voice reply.

44
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,350
And here's how you define
the array in the strings.xml file.

45
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,620
It contains a set a strings that will
be given to the extra voice replied to

46
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,830
find earlier.

47
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,910
One more thing to note here,
if your using the Android wear emulator,

48
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,320
you'll have to type your
voice replies on a keyboard,

49
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,710
since the emulator does not
support speech recognition.
