1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,650
Let's look at a successful
request first.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,580
We provided you with a link for
a valid query.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,850
We visited that URL in a web browser,
and then copied the JSON

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:14,160
response into a JSON format, which
is what you see the results of here.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,180
At the top of the JSON response,

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,610
within the metadata JSON object,
there is a status field.

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:25,470
The value of the status field is 200,
so our HTTP response code is 200,

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,860
which means that it was
a successful response.

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,119
You can double check this by going
to the documentation for JSON and

10
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,540
then looking for the status field.

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,500
And indeed,
here you see the definition of a status

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,100
field is the HTTP status
code of the response.

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,900
Okay.
So in the quiz,

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,730
we can write that a successful request
will yield a 200 response code.

15
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,750
Now, the next question is
about an invalid request.

16
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,570
Here, we've provided you
with an invalid URL,

17
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:59,120
where we just typed in a silly
parameter at the end of the URL.

18
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:05,099
If you visit this page in a browser,
you'll see a 400 type of error.

19
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,340
Bad request.

20
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,340
It complains that we have
a bad value in the URL.

21
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,090
This is helpful information so
we can figure out what's wrong and

22
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,050
how to fix the URL.

23
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,980
Not all invalid requests will
provide this type of advice.

24
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,089
It just depends on how
the server was configured.

25
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,210
Okay, so going back to the quiz,

26
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,800
an unsuccessful request will
yield a 400 response code.

27
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,830
Note that there are other possible
response codes that we can encounter,

28
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,650
but these are the most common ones
that we want you to be aware of.
