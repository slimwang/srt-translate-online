1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:04,220
Pop quiz for you and for you.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,297
What was the last website you visited?

3
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:07,980
Don't say Udacity.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,057
I'll pause for
a moment to let you think.

5
00:00:12,057 --> 00:00:15,217
Cam?

6
00:00:15,217 --> 00:00:17,130
>> Maybe Twitter?

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,091
I can't remember.

8
00:00:18,091 --> 00:00:19,429
Maybe [LAUGH].
>> [LAUGH]

9
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:20,652
>> You know, there's a pretty good

10
00:00:20,652 --> 00:00:23,110
chance that you are like me, and
you didn't immediately recall.

11
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:26,190
And that's okay,
because everybody forgets things.

12
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,920
It's not a big deal, but
as a developer you should do what you

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,570
can to help people remember what they're
doing while they're on your site.

14
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,033
>> The good news is that
we've got the label element.
