00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This question asks why do most signing schemes use SIGN(m) = m || Ekr(H(m))

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
instead of the SIGN(m) = Ekr(m || nonce)?

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The options are because hashing m provides more security,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
to improve efficiency, to make it so that it is not necessary to perform

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
asymmetric decryption to validate a certificate,

6
00:00:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
or to provide resistance to small message-space attacks.
