00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,315
Here's the last compound inequality we'll look at. Notice I have two inequity

2
00:00:04,327 --> 00:00:08,253
signs, and an expression with a variable in the middle. So you might be

3
00:00:08,265 --> 00:00:12,521
wondering, is this an AND inequality, or an OR inequality. To think about it,

4
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:16,850
let's try splitting it up. Here's one inequality, so I'm going to write the one

5
00:00:16,862 --> 00:00:21,460
here. And here's the second inequality. We want this amount to be greater than

6
00:00:21,472 --> 00:00:25,430
negative 2 and we want this amount to be less than 4. So this is an AND

7
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:29,862
inequality. We know how to solve an AND inequality, and we could solve each of

8
00:00:29,874 --> 00:00:34,219
these separately, but I'm going to show you something different. We're going to

9
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:38,865
solve this inequality by working with each part of the inequality. All three of

10
00:00:38,877 --> 00:00:43,196
them. First I'm going to clear the fraction by multiplying every part by 5. 5

11
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:47,540
times negative 2 is negative 10. Here, I'm going to put the 5 over 1, then I'm

12
00:00:47,552 --> 00:00:51,796
going to reduce the common factors in the numerator and the denominator. So

13
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:55,569
these 5's reduce to 1. Now that you have an idea of how to perform the

14
00:00:55,581 --> 00:01:00,360
operations to every part, I want you to finish this one out. Write your answer

15
00:01:00,372 --> 00:01:05,421
in interval notation in this box. Remember to use parentheses or brackets and a

16
00:01:05,433 --> 00:00:00,000
comma to separate the numbers from the interval. Good luck.
