1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here's my solution.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I had to write some code to fix up the goal if it wasn't specified. Then it's just a single call.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We call shortest<u>path</u>search with the start state we were given,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
with the csuccessors function that we've already defined,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and then with a goal test.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The goal test is that everybody is gone from the start side of the river.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That we define this way.
