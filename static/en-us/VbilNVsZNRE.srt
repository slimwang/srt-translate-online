1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,620
All right, we've covered quite
a bit of ground already.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,190
We've heard a lot about
what accessibility is and

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,960
why it matters for everyone.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,650
We heard about some different
types of impairments and

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,620
what we might need to think about.

6
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,340
We saw what it's like to
use a screen reader and

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,900
we took a quick look at WCAG and
the WebAIM accessibility checklist.

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,700
>> For the rest of the course we're
going to dive into the practicalities of

9
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,200
actually creating accessible websites.

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,020
That's right we're not going
to just talk at you for

11
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,350
the whole course, you're going to
actually create some accessible code.

12
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:34,630
>> Yeah, so we're going to organize
this around three main topics, focus and

13
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,590
keyboard, looking at how to make sure
that we build things which can be

14
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,080
operated with a keyboard.

15
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,960
This is important for
users with motor impairments but also

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,660
ensures that your UI is in a good shape
for the next topic which is semantics.

17
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,650
Semantics is where we make sure that
we're expressing our interface in

18
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,100
a robust way which works with
a variety of assistive technology.

19
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,240
And finally styling and visual design.

20
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,400
Look at some techniques for making
sure the visual UI is as flexible and

21
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,280
usable as possible.

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,050
>> Now each of those
topics could probably fill

23
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,530
a whole course by themselves.

24
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,150
So we're not going to be able to
cover every single aspect of creating

25
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,910
accessible websites.

26
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,900
However, we're going to give you
enough information to get started and

27
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,300
point you at some good places
to learn more about each topic.

28
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,270
I'm sure you're all eager to get started
so let's begin with a look at how and

29
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,520
why you need to think about
focus in your web application.
