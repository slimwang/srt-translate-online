1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,890
In the previous project, you learned
how to construct models of data, and

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,350
then use those models to generate
predictions about the future.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,030
In this unit, we're going to cover
one of the methods for doing that,

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,790
called supervised learning.

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,805
Supervised learning is a type of machine
learning where we feed our system what

6
00:00:14,805 --> 00:00:16,385
we call labeled examples.

7
00:00:16,385 --> 00:00:20,185
Labeled examples means we give the
system some information that it uses to

8
00:00:20,185 --> 00:00:22,245
understand the data
that we're giving it.

9
00:00:22,245 --> 00:00:26,115
So for example if we were building our
system to recognize my face, we would

10
00:00:26,115 --> 00:00:29,185
give it some pictures of my face and
some pictures of other people's faces.

11
00:00:29,185 --> 00:00:32,455
And we would actually tell the system
these pictures are of David and

12
00:00:32,455 --> 00:00:34,190
these pictures are of somebody else.

13
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,510
And it would use that information to
develop its understanding over time.

14
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,790
In other domains,
we would see things like in health care,

15
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,330
we would give it some
examples of patients.

16
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:42,580
And we would tell it whether or

17
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,380
not those patients ended
up with a certain disease.

18
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,910
Or in education, we would give
it examples of students and

19
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,040
tell it whether or not each of those
students actually ended up graduating.

20
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,280
So the system is using some information
that we give it about the success or

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,080
failure of those different examples to
construct its understanding about what

22
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,460
leads to that success or failure.
