1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:06,070
Next we'll speak with Dr. David Kibbe,
president and CEO of Direct Trust,

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:10,270
and a senior adviser to the American
Academy of Family Physicians,

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:14,780
the largest primary care physician
organization in the United States.

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,570
So good morning, David, and
thank you very much for

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,380
taking the time to be with us today.

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,370
>> Good morning, Mark.

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,780
It's a pleasure to be here.

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:27,882
>> So at this point, the students
are aware of Direct Trust and

9
00:00:27,882 --> 00:00:34,270
the role it plays in
establishing trust across HISPs.

10
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:38,990
But, of course, with health IT,
adoption is always an issue.

11
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:43,290
So, where is Direct Trust in
terms of adoption at this point?

12
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:48,040
>> Yeah, well, we've made a lot of
progress, Mark, in the last year.

13
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,810
Your students are I'm
sure aware of direct

14
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,330
as a protocol in a set
of specifications.

15
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:58,300
They're probably not aware of
the extent to which direct

16
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,635
service providers have been active
in this sector of the industry.

17
00:01:03,635 --> 00:01:08,553
DirectTrust membership has grown
from about 50 members this time

18
00:01:08,553 --> 00:01:11,064
last year to over 135 members.

19
00:01:11,064 --> 00:01:13,732
We now have 33 health ISPs or

20
00:01:13,732 --> 00:01:19,068
HISPs who are providing services
to a range of customers and

21
00:01:19,068 --> 00:01:23,673
clients, including
electronic health records.

22
00:01:23,673 --> 00:01:26,909
And of course the electronic health
records are provided direct to their

23
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:29,086
customers, who are provider
organizations and

24
00:01:29,086 --> 00:01:31,610
individuals in those organizations.

25
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:37,030
We also have HIEs,
some federal agencies now,

26
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:41,850
and a growing number of personal
health records who are involved.

27
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,614
So, right now that network
serves approximately 6,000 to

28
00:01:46,614 --> 00:01:49,650
7,000 healthcare organizations.

29
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:54,900
There are over 250,000 direct addresses
that have been provisioned for

30
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,990
those parties in those organizations and

31
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:02,150
those numbers have been
doubling every three months.

32
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:06,420
So we think that by the beginning
of 2015, there will be

33
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,531
approximately 200 electronic health
records, depending on Direct Trust

34
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:16,610
accredited service providers,
and approximately a million

35
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,250
direct addresses being supplied within
the provider community nationwide.

36
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,380
>> That's certainly impressive.

37
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,670
In health IT right up there
with adoption is use cases.

38
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:35,210
The purposes to which technology
is used to approve care.

39
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:40,780
You've told me about a very
interesting example in hospitals and

40
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,820
transitions of care where patients
are leaving the hospital and

41
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,710
going to a long-term care facility.

42
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,200
Could you tell us a bit about that?

43
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,020
>> Yeah.
Certainly.

44
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,160
A couple things to keep in mind is
that we're clearly seeing the network

45
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,820
effect her.

46
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,640
The hockey stick curve of adoption
is growing very, very quickly,

47
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,590
but we're also seeing that there's
a long tail here in terms of use cases.

48
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,670
The primary use case that's driving the
adoption of Direct exchange right now

49
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,230
is of course stage two meaningful use.

50
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:18,200
As hospitals and medical practices seek
to meet the transitions of care and

51
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,799
patient engagement objectives in stage
two meaningful use which require direct

52
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:29,000
exchange, hospitals are probably the
most active now in terms of using direct

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,580
exchange to send referral documents, in
particular transitions of care clinical

54
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:38,680
summary, both to provider organizations
on discharge of the patients or

55
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,880
just before, but
also to skilled nursing facilities.

56
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,180
So we have a growing number of
skilled nursing facilities and

57
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:51,060
rehab centers that are, strictly
speaking, not meaningful users, but

58
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,810
they are endpoints for meaningful users
and are starting to see the need for

59
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,850
them to have direct
exchange capabilities.

60
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,870
I would add to that that claims
attachment is a growing use case,

61
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,870
again not really of meaningful use, and

62
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:10,665
the federal agencies have
referral needs to replace fax and

63
00:04:10,665 --> 00:04:13,640
e-fax mail with direct exchange,
and that's also growing quickly.

64
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,769
>> Another interesting example,
I believe it was in Tennessee and

65
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:26,660
Kentucky, is the use of direct by health
departments to collect very patients

66
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,260
specific data about those patients
with sexually transmitted diseases.

67
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,830
Can you tell us a bit about that?

68
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:37,610
>> Yeah, that's a really exciting
grassroots use case, and we're

69
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:42,000
seeing several like this around the
country, in rural areas of the country.

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,870
This involves public health clinics in
two states, Kentucky and Tennessee,

71
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:53,270
using direct exchange for patients
who they refer to one another or

72
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:58,750
see in common and those are patients
with STDs as you mentioned.

73
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:04,420
They are also involving an army base,
Fort Campbell, that has its own clinic.

74
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,910
And just been contacted by
the department of defense,

75
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:12,710
we have a meeting next week to talk
about how they can provide direct

76
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:17,110
services at their installations
within the coming months.

77
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:23,844
>> Well, so, the use cases we've talked
about so far are provider to provider.

78
00:05:25,475 --> 00:05:28,145
The students are familiar with view,
download,

79
00:05:28,145 --> 00:05:31,415
and transmit,
the VDT requirement meaningful use, too.

80
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:34,775
That would seem like a role for direct.

81
00:05:34,775 --> 00:05:38,241
What can you tell us about that?

82
00:05:38,241 --> 00:05:42,535
>> The use of direct
exchange by providers and

83
00:05:42,535 --> 00:05:47,470
patients to communicate protected health
information is an enormous potential.

84
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,480
We have about 15
companies in Direct Trust

85
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,320
who are what I call next generation
personal health records.

86
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,340
These are personal health record
companies like Healthy Circles that

87
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:05,660
are contemplating or actually
implementing now, direct services for

88
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:11,270
their customers who are primarily
patients and consumers, not providers.

89
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:15,140
So that could grow very quickly but

90
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,330
it requires first that the provider to
provider infrastructure be in place.

91
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:26,170
I don't expect to see large scale use
of Direct exchange in the provider,

92
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:30,030
excuse me,
in the consumer space until 2015.

93
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:35,680
Because if you want to communicate
with your provider using Direct,

94
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,790
which is a wonderful idea.

95
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,570
It's secure messaging with attachments.

96
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:44,870
Or you want devices to send direct
messages to your provider organization.

97
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:49,640
The provider organization has to be
capable of receiving those messages and

98
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,220
attachments first.

99
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:55,110
And we're very much still in that
building phase on the provider side.

100
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:58,745
>> David, you mentioned something, that
I hadn't really thought about before.

101
00:06:58,745 --> 00:07:03,920
Are the device manufacturers,
the companies that are hoping to put

102
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,260
devices into patient's homes so that
the patients with chronic disease, for

103
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,820
example, can be monitored
more continuously,

104
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,199
are they seeing direct as a technology
they want to build into these devices?

105
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,359
Yes, without question.

106
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:22,580
There's one of the things that gives
me real confidence that Direct

107
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:28,258
is a disruptive innovation is this
effect you're starting to see where of

108
00:07:28,258 --> 00:07:34,781
course we're talking about S/MIME over
SMTP, email messages with attachments.

109
00:07:34,781 --> 00:07:39,798
But there's a lot of innovation
occurring around the use of that very

110
00:07:39,798 --> 00:07:44,992
simple technology to replace
interfaces of various kinds, including

111
00:07:44,992 --> 00:07:52,020
device to device interactions, or device
to server Interactions and connections.

112
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,680
That innovation is sort
of quiet at this time,

113
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,140
there's not a lot of noise around it.

114
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:01,490
But there's significant interest in
the part of device manufacturers and

115
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:06,030
also the payers for
example who believe that

116
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,930
Direct can be a last
mile from the device or

117
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:14,290
from the data center to some end point,
which could be the provider's inbox.

118
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,170
>> Well, one final question.

119
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:23,790
Of course there are always challenges,
it sounds like exciting times for

120
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:29,140
Direct and Direct Trust, but what do you
see is the most significant challenges

121
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,520
that have to be over come
in the next few years for

122
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,940
Direct to really achieve its potential.

123
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:42,049
>> You know it, it always goes back to
some payment or business rationale.

124
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:44,320
Right now, the incentives for

125
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,370
provider organizations to exchange
information with one another easily and

126
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:56,690
affordably using standards
like Direct is not strong.

127
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,630
It's growing with the movement of ACO's,
but

128
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:04,840
I think we still have a hesitancy on
the part of providers to move data when

129
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:10,470
they're getting paid for
duplicating care, for example.

130
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:15,340
I also think that we have to
overcome the stigma of patients

131
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:19,698
asking their providers and the provider
organization for that information.

132
00:09:19,698 --> 00:09:24,672
There still is a hesitancy on the part
of many institutions to make it easy for

133
00:09:24,672 --> 00:09:27,095
patients to get their information.

134
00:09:27,095 --> 00:09:29,277
Having standard in place,
of course, helps.

135
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:32,412
But it doesn't motivate people.

136
00:09:32,412 --> 00:09:34,385
Standards are not motivators.

137
00:09:34,385 --> 00:09:36,893
Standards are enablers.

138
00:09:36,893 --> 00:09:39,560
>> Well David, I thank you again.

139
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:45,050
I particularly thank you for your final
comments, which just emphasize again

140
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:49,940
something I tried to get across in this
course which is that without the right

141
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:54,200
incentives, all the technologies in
the world won't change healthcare.

142
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,750
>> I would agree with that
statement very strongly, Mark.

143
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:02,960
Thank you for the opportunity to speak
with your audience, with your class.

144
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,613

who want to contact me or
