00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,254
We saw before that log base 10 of 2 times 3 is equal to log base 10 of 2, plus

2
00:00:05,254 --> 00:00:11,484
log base 10 of 3. So that means that if we have log base 10 of 5 times 5 then,

3
00:00:11,484 --> 00:00:15,644
according to the product property, this should equal log base 10 of 5, plus log

4
00:00:15,644 --> 00:00:22,655
base 10 of 5. However, we're just adding 2 log based 10 of 5s together. And we

5
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:28,770
can see that this is equal to 2 times log base 10 of 5, or 2 log base 10 of 5.

6
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,549
Considering what we've just written, how do you think you could rewrite log

7
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:37,160
base 10 of 5 times 5 times 5? Please follow this same pattern that we did up

8
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,870
here. So what belongs in this slot should be similar to what's in this form.

9
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,839
And this answer should be in the same form as this one.
