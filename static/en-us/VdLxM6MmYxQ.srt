00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,090
Games are a team effort.

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:03,110
You, the developer,

3
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,840
are often working with a designer who
decides how the game should work.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,710
It's then your job to bring
their designs to life.

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,010
Even when you're working alone,

6
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,120
it's a good idea to keep these
two jobs somewhat separate.

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,950
Take your level design, for instance.

8
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,798
You don't want to have to write Java and

9
00:00:17,798 --> 00:00:21,052
recompile your game every time you
move a platform or add a new enemy.

10
00:00:21,052 --> 00:00:25,096
Ideally you'd like to use some external
purpose built level-editing tool to

11
00:00:25,096 --> 00:00:28,170
create a level file,
which can then be loaded by your game.

12
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,060
And this level will do just that,
using the Tiled level editor to create

13
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,120
JSON level files, which will then turn
into an actual level object in our game.
