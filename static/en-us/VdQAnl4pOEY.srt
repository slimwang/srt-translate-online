00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In Python, we can write a comment that extends to the end of the line

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
by prefacing it with the # sign or the pound sign or the hash sign.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
JavaScript has this same idea, but instead

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
the comments start with // and then continue to the end of the line.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This time I'll write the rule for you.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Here's a rule corresponding to comments that go to the end

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
of the line in JavaScript.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
They start with a slash and then another slash,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and then you can have anything that's not our special newline character,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
as many of those as you want, and the maximal munch rule

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
means we're going to eat up all of those characters that we possibly can.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And then rather than returning that as a token, we throw it away

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
because it's a comment, documentation for the user.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Let's test our knowledge of this rule with a quiz.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I've written out 4 sequences of input,

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and I'd like you to indicate which of these 4 sequences would yield

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
identifier, identifier, number

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
given the rules we've been talking about for JavaScript.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You've seen how we define identifiers, how we define numbers,

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and what starts an end of line comment.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Here are 4 different lines.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Which ones give us identifier, identifier, number?
