00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,640
When you implement the OnLocationChange
callback, you can write the latitude and

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,720
longitude that you receive from
location services to your UI.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,980
This is essentially the same as
in our old OncConnected method

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,730
before we switched to
continuous updates.

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,610
If you remember there we had
location.getLatitude that we

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,526
converted to a string
loaded into mLatitudeText.

7
00:00:20,526 --> 00:00:24,460
And similarly location.getLongitude,

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,540
that we converted to a string and
loaded into an longitude text.

9
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,200
Now, we had done this previously in
On Connected so we would just get it

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,640
once whenever we connect, but now that
we're using the fuse location API and

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,960
we're requesting location updates from
that, those location updates will be

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,330
called back to us in the on
location change function.

13
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,440
And as a result,
we'll get continuous updates.
