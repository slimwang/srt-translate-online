1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,756
We see from the table that a proportion of 0.2 of the students are from the US.

2
00:00:04,768 --> 00:00:09,675
And we see that 0.16 of students are from India. Hopefully, you've figured this

3
00:00:09,687 --> 00:00:14,385
one out. But if not, it's okay. We see that all the European countries are

4
00:00:14,397 --> 00:00:20,064
England, Germany and Sweden. And all the Asian countries are China, India, Japan

5
00:00:20,076 --> 00:00:28,174
and Pakistan. So, it looks like the total proportion of students from Europe is

6
00:00:28,186 --> 00:00:36,215
0.04 plus 0.06 plus 0.02, so this is 0.12. And the proportion of students from

7
00:00:36,227 --> 00:00:42,709
Asia is 0.24 plus 0.16 plus 0.16 plus 0.02, this is 0.58. So, it looks like

8
00:00:42,721 --> 00:00:47,123
there's a greater proportion of students from Asia.
