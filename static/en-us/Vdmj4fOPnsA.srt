00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,470
In computational photography,

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:04,960
it's common to make what's known as a thin lens assumption.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,119
So a thin lens assumption is basically the drawing that I

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:09,620
just showed you before.

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:13,170
Where we say okay, for given lens with a given focal point,

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,340
it's going to image some object at let's say distance, d0,

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,024
at some distance di, or, or for d for image, back.

8
00:00:21,024 --> 00:00:23,610
And the question is can we predict,

9
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:29,710
from the focal point what the relationship is between d0 and di?

10
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,880
Well obviously the answer is yes, or I wouldn't have been wasting all this film.

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,730
Or, I waste your time.

12
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,714
So here's a thin film lens diagram taken from the slides by a Forsyth for

13
00:00:39,714 --> 00:00:43,450
their textbook, and we're going to use that to derive the relationship

14
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,250
between distance in the world.

15
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,280
And which we're going to call here z, away from the,

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,720
the center of the lens, to the distance z prime,

17
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,470
which is where the image will be focused, and the focal length, f.

18
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:00,650
First, just to be clear, here is some point p that's at some height y,

19
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,350
since we're just going to look at that side.

20
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:08,240
We're going to assume that it's projected at some point p prime, that is,

21
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,810
y prime.

22
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:10,380
Off of here.

23
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,060
And here is our focal length, f.

24
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,700
All right?

25
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:20,170
The idea is that all parallel rays are going to intersect f.

26
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,340
Okay? Which is why this one goes back here this way as well.

27
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,230
All right?

28
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:28,710
So when we have all sorts of parallel lines and that are going through the same

29
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,780
point, it's easy to reason about what's going on here using similar triangles.

30
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,870
So here we have our similar triangle.

31
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:41,660
And it basically says that y is to z as y prime is to z prime.

32
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,650
Two things to note here.

33
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,190
First of all, I only use the magnitude of z and

34
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,570
z prime, because we're only going to worry about the length.

35
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:50,180
And I probably could have used the magnitude of y prime, but

36
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:54,840
just to make it clear that the y value is inverted,

37
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,900
I set negative y prime as being a positive value.

38
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,750
So if y is positive, then y prime would be negative.

39
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,230
If y is negative, then y prime would be positive and thus the negative sign.

40
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,920
All right, so that's our first similar triangle.

41
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,570
Our next similar triangle is here.

42
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,670
And that says, and this one's a little bit trickier.

43
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:18,460
Again, the ratio between y prime and y is the same as

44
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:23,770
the ratio between z minus f, so that's this amount, right?

45
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:28,250
All of z minus f, is to f.

46
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,830
So y is to f.

47
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,530
All right. So just look that a little bit.

48
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:36,240
So y prime, size of y prime is to y as z prime minus f is to f.

49
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,220
So that gives us a second set of similar triangles.

50
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,180
Combining these two formulas gives us this formula.

51
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,390
Not rocket science here,

52
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,470
we're just setting the two left hands sides are the same, so

53
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,640
we set the two right hand sides equal to the same.

54
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,430
We continue, we play around with the math a little bit.

55
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,950
And we get this very simple formula.

56
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,531
That 1 over the magnitude of z prime plus 1

57
00:02:57,531 --> 00:03:01,170
over the magnitude of z equals 1 over f.

58
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,260
That's the thin lens equation, and

59
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:09,100
any points that satisfy that equation are in focus, okay.

60
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,760
So if my film plane, on a thin lens assumption or a thin lens model.

61
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,110
If my film plane is z prime away from the lens for

62
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:22,920
a focal length f, then everything that is z away will be in focus.

63
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,060
So by moving the lens in and out a little bit from my film plane,

64
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,360
I change where in the world things are in focus.

65
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,060
So I can change the z prime easily.

66
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,120
I can move the, the lens in and out from where my film plate is and

67
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,510
that changes the points out in the world that are in focus.

68
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,900
There's a cool little thin lens app.

69
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,730
It took me four times to say that before I got it right.

70
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,300
It's posted here on the Web and it just lets you sort of

71
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,417
play around with how you change the geometry of what's going to happen.
