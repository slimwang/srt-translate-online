1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,980
Density-independent pixels allow the
designer to create assets that appear

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,966
in an expected way,
no matter the resolution or

3
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,923
density of the target device.

4
00:00:09,923 --> 00:00:15,357
A density-independent pixel is equal
to one pixel at the baseline density,

5
00:00:15,357 --> 00:00:17,200
or 160 dpi.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,800
They're often abbreviated dip or
just dp.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,360
Don't confuse that with dpi
which stands for dots per inch.

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,810
So, what about at 320 dpi?

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,349
This is often called 2x.

10
00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:35,290
Now, at 320 dpi, 1 dp is equal to 2 px.

11
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:39,368
So, working with density-independent
pixels helps you deal with crazy

12
00:00:39,368 --> 00:00:43,247
situations like this where you may
have two devices with the same pixel

13
00:00:43,247 --> 00:00:45,761
resolution but
differing amounts of space.

14
00:00:45,761 --> 00:00:49,518
In this case, the tablet has a lot of
space and the phone has a lot less,

15
00:00:49,518 --> 00:00:52,290
but they have the same pixel resolution.

16
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,790
We'll see how density-independent pixels
makes this much easier to work with.
