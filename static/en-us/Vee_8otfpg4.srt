00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,293
In the last quiz, we narrowed down the interval in which zero lies to be

2
00:00:04,293 --> 00:00:09,556
between 1.5 and 2. To narrow this down even further, first, test the value of

3
00:00:09,556 --> 00:00:15,182
the function when x equals 1.7. Then, determine whether the zero is going to

4
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:21,580
lie in the interval from 1.5 to 1.7 or from 1.7 to 2. Remember that the

5
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:27,133
function is negative when x equals 1.5, and it's positive when x equals 2.
