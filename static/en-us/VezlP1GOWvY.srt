1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,440
Beyond these programs there's a need
to change incentives in at least

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,980
three ways.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,630
The first is reimbursement for

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,390
the expense of the electronic
health record system.

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:16,640
The second is some ongoing financial
incentive to use the system properly.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,659
The Medicare and Medicaid incentive
programs were designed to do the first.

7
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,570
The Medicare payment program may do
the second through penalties for

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,980
providers in hospitals who
don't achieve meaningful use.

9
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,930
It's increasingly possible that private
health insurance companies may start

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,260
funneling patients to providers who
have achieved meaningful use and

11
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,459
the prospect of that
is another incentive.

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,090
The third needed incentive is changing
reimbursement to some form of pay for

13
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,160
performance to further
reward providers for

14
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,800
improving care efficiency and quality.
