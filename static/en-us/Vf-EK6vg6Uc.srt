1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,670
Now find the point marked number
11 in your starter notebook and

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,870
split the daily engagement
data into two lists.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,960
The first list should contain
the engagement data for

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,440
students who eventually
passed the first project, and

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,270
you should name this
list passing engagement.

6
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,920
The second should contain records for
students who don't eventually

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,610
pass the first project, and you should
name this list non-passing engagement.

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,630
Throughout most of the time that this
data was being collected, the first nano

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,400
degree project was analyzing New York
subway data, so that's the project

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,900
that you're going to assume is
the first project for this purpose.

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,560
Now this project was actually
updated at some point and

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,210
the key identifying it changed,
so I've given you both keys here.

13
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,070
You should consider a student to have
passed the first project if they ever

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,050
pass a project with
either of these two keys.

15
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,780
As a reminder, here's what the project
submission data looks like.

16
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:52,290
You can use the lesson_key field to see
which project was submitted, and you

17
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:56,260
can use the assigned_rating field to see
whether the student passed the project.

18
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,670
The table descriptions file available
in the downloadable section lists

19
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,790
the possible values for
the assigned rating field.

20
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,980
Once you're finished, find how many
engagement records correspond to

21
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,060
students who passed the first
project and how many correspond

22
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,620
to students who didn't, and enter your
number in the boxes on the next screen.
