1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
In the beginning, you do have some initial observation.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
From this initial observation, we derive a hypothesis.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
A possible explanation for what you just observed.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
If the hypothesis explains your observation, the hypothesis must be useful to make a prediction.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
In our example, the initial observation was the apple falling.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The hypothesis would be, well every solid objects falls down and then a prediction would be,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
if I take this plate and let it fall, it's going to go straight down towards the floor.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It may also break along the way. This is what 3 years old do.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The experiment means to actually verify the prediction so we take the plate and let it fall.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
From the experiment comes the observation. What do you see?

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Well, the plate actually was attracted towards the ground and so you can now go

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and check whether what you just observed in your experiment is as predicted

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and therefore satisfy the hypothesis and we say it supports the hypothesis

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and we then can refine the hypothesis.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Our case line says, we can generalized it towards other objects

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and to come up with a more general hypothesis.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
If the observation, however, is not in line with your prediction, then the hypothesis is rejected,

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and if the hypothesis is rejected, you need to come up with a new hypothesis,

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and this cycle going along from hypothesis through prediction through experiment through observation

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and gradually refining the hypothesis or coming up with alternatives.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This is something you repeat again and again until your hypothesis

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
becomes consistent with all observations and has so much predictive power

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
that it becomes what one calls a theory.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
In a theory you repeat the process of refining the hypothesis through prediction, experiment,

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
observation or creating new hypothesis--again going through the circle again and again and again

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
until your hypothesis becomes a theory

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
that is a predictive and comprehensive description of some aspect of reality.
