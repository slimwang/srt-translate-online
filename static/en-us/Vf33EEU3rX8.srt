1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,180
Let's talk about the generate method,
and like I said, we're going to

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,650
be given some training leg, examples and
we want to predict the labels, okay?

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,580
I need a little bit of an invitation
because we're going to do a trivial

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,810
amount of math.

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,805
This little notation,

6
00:00:12,805 --> 00:00:17,500
4 to 9 means an object is really
a four but I call it a 9.

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,750
We're going to talk about the costs or
the loss,

8
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,220
you're going to see L for
loss, you know,

9
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,100
what's the, the cost to me of
calling a 4 a 9 or calling a 9 a 4?

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,630
All right?

11
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,490
And one of the things we're going to
assume for the rest of today, and

12
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,400
it's really not a big deal,

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,220
you can factor we're going to assume the
cost of calling an X an X is zero, okay?

14
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:41,000
So nobody gets upset if I call
a spade a spade, so to speak.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,760
So, let's consider the two class
binary classification problem.

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,680
Remember we just had 4s and 9s.

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,970
So we have two kinds of losses,
all right?

18
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,770
So that's what this L means.

19
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,670
An L of 4 9 is the loss of
classifying a 4 as a 9.

20
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:03,410
And conversely, L of 9 to 4 is
the loss of classifying a 9 as a 4.

21
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,310
Okay?
Pretty straightforward.

22
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:10,700
Risk is your expected cost, okay?

23
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,810
So, if I've got a particular strategy,
S, classifier strategy S.

24
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,790
We want to talk about what's
the expected loss, all right?

25
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:24,120
And for our 4 and 9 example,
the risk of our strategy

26
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,950
is, what's the probability
that I'll call a 4 a 9.

27
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,645
And how often is that going to happen?

28
00:01:31,645 --> 00:01:32,900
Okay.

29
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:37,560
Using this particular strategy, and
I multiply that by whatever the loss is,

30
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,600
the cost of calling a 4 9,
and what's the probability

31
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,882
of calling a 9 a 4 and
what's the loss when I call a 9 or 4?

32
00:01:47,882 --> 00:01:48,450
All right?

33
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,250
And that's the risk because
the probability is, you know,

34
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,725
15% of the time that I'm running
this thing, 15% of the times,

35
00:01:54,725 --> 00:01:58,230
I'm going to 4 is going to come up and
I'm going to call it a 9.

36
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,050
Okay, that's what probability
of calling a 4 9 means.

37
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:05,310
So this total quantity,
that's what's referred to as your risk.

38
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,139
And remember what we want to do is we
want to minimize the expected risk.
