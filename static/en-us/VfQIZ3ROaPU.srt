00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:06,556
The left hand side is equal to the log base b of j times a times m. Remember

2
00:00:06,556 --> 00:00:11,029
when we add two logs with the same base, we can really just multiply these two

3
00:00:11,029 --> 00:00:17,454
numbers together. So we can simplify these first two logarithms to be the log

4
00:00:17,454 --> 00:00:23,778
of base b of j times a. Now we apply this rule one more time, and we multiply j

5
00:00:23,778 --> 00:00:30,376
times a by m. So we'll just have one logarithm, log of base b, of j times a

6
00:00:30,376 --> 00:00:36,809
times m. This is how we know this left-hand side is equal to this right-hand

7
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:42,620
side. I use quotes here just to represent the same expression written here and

8
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,790
here.
