1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,421
First, we distribute a negative 1 to each of the terms, and change their signs.

2
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:08,447
Next, we identify the like terms. And finally, we combine the like terms

3
00:00:08,447 --> 00:00:12,918
together. Throughout the problem, I just kept my 4m to the 5th. And my negative

4
00:00:12,918 --> 00:00:17,236
5m to the 4th. These didn't have like terms. But I need to make sure I list them

5
00:00:17,236 --> 00:00:21,680
in my answer. Negative 5m cubed and negative 5m cubed make negative 10m cubed.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,800
And positive 3 and negative 3 make 0. So here's my answer.
