00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,130
Let's take a moment to talk about image size.

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:06,520
Here is an image defined over a two-dimensional space.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,730
Since it is a finite image, it must have certain bounds.

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:15,120
Let's say the limits along the x-axis are ten and 330.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,854
And similarly, along the y-axis, 20 to 278.

6
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:23,260
Can you tell me what is the width and height of the image?

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,790
How about the area that it occupies?

8
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,960
Type in your answers in the boxes provided.
