If you counted the batches form the last problem, we know we have 2 and 2 3rds

2
00:00:04,554 --> 00:00:09,184
of a batch. To do that math, I would have done 2 divided by 3 4ths. I was trying

3
00:00:09,196 --> 00:00:13,371
to figure out how mnay times 3 4ths goes into 2. Instead of dividng by a

4
00:00:13,383 --> 00:00:17,768
fraction, I'm going to multiply by the reciprocal. So I have 2 times 4 3rds. I

5
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:22,202
know 2 can be written as 2 over 1, and now I can multiply. 2 times 4 is 8. 1

6
00:00:22,316 --> 00:00:28,245
times 3 is 3, so I have 8 3rds. I'm going to write this as a mixed number. I

7
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:34,301
know 3 goes into 8 only two times because 2 times 3 is 6. So I have 3 going into

8
00:00:34,313 --> 00:00:39,913
8 two times, and then I'm left with two extra pieces. So 2 and 2 3rds.
