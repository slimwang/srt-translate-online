00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,730
Let's look at the answer to
our spatial locality quiz.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,610
The question is, which memory
locations have spatial locality?

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,590
Remember that spacial locality says
that once we access a memory location,

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:16,290
we are likely to access
nearby memory locations soon.

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:21,310
For the variable j,
we keep reaccessing j, but we don't

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:26,300
know what's close to j so we can not
really say that j has spatial locality.

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,150
If we access j,

8
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:32,430
there is a lot of temporal locality but
not necessarily any spatial locality.

9
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,550
Same for sum.

10
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,840
We are accessing sum
very often by itself but

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,220
we're not really sure whether we're
accessing anything that is close to sum.

12
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,480
For elements of arr, we have seen
that there is no temporal locality.

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,380
Each element is accessed
only once in this loop.

14
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,230
However, there is a lot
of spatial locality.

15
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,550
Once we access arr of zero,
in the next iteration,

16
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:58,520
we'll be accessing arr of one,
and then, arr of two and so on.

17
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,970
So it is true that once we access
a memory location in this array,

18
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,440
we're likely to access
nearby location soon.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,270
So this variable definitely
has spatial locality.

20
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,460
It turns out that the way
this program is compiled,

21
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:20,300
usually means that there will be some
spatial locality between j and sum.

22
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:26,060
J and sum are likely to be allocated
by the compiler on the stack

23
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,580
near each other, so
when we access sum and

24
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,520
then access j, that might be
an example of spatial locality.
