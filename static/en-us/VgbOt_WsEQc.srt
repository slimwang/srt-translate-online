1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,170
The correct answer is when we handle
a tap and when we animate the bugs.

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,480
Let's see how we can use
Stack Traces to prove it.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,410
I already have a breakpoint set and

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,660
the create bug method of
the bug factory class.

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,910
And we'll run the application.

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,650
I'll select the breakpoint debugging
scene, and then Alt+tab on screen.

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:25,630
And as we can see from the stack traces,
the createBug method is being called by

8
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:30,010
addBugToView, which in turn was
called by handleSingleTap, and

9
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,380
the breakpointBugViewController.

10
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,560
So we know that create bug
is called when we tap.

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,790
But what about when we animate?

12
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,725
If we continue the app's execution,
we're dropped right back into the same

13
00:00:41,725 --> 00:00:45,180
breakpoint, and we can see that
the stack frames have changed.

14
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,370
This time it looks like we're
calling adbug to view again,

15
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,920
which in turns calling create bug.

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,790
If we keep clicking Continue,
the stack frames just keep increasing.

17
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,200
And the culprit seems to be
the move bugs to animation method.

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,250
If we click on it, then we can see that
after bugs finish animating here in

19
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:11,410
the UIView.animateWithDuration,
we have the other add bug to view call.

20
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:15,450
This probably explains why so many
spiders are being drawn to the screen.

21
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,150
For now we're going to
leave this call here,

22
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,660
even though it's not the behavior that
we want, because in the next lesson,

23
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:24,050
I'm going to show you another way
to troubleshoot this same problem.
