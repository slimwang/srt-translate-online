1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,555
So, how do the other cues work, the ones that require two eyes?

2
00:00:03,555 --> 00:00:05,408
>> You mean, the ones that require one eye?

3
00:00:05,408 --> 00:00:06,420
>> Yes.

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,496
>> So, those are called monocular cues.

5
00:00:08,496 --> 00:00:09,586
>> Oh, monocular.

6
00:00:09,586 --> 00:00:13,904
>> Distinguished from binocular. and actually, I'm not really certain. Why don't

7
00:00:13,904 --> 00:00:16,170
we go to Susan? Susan, how are things going over there?

8
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,255
>> Great. I'm with Paul, our winner.

9
00:00:19,255 --> 00:00:22,783
>> Could you go into more detail about how we can perceive depth even when we're

10
00:00:22,783 --> 00:00:24,962
not using both eyes.

11
00:00:24,962 --> 00:00:29,622
>> Monocular cues, sure. Well, there's a thing called interposition, which is a

12
00:00:29,622 --> 00:00:33,002
fancy word for saying when one thing appears in front of the other, it's closer

13
00:00:33,002 --> 00:00:38,060
to you. So, for example, viewers at home know that this hand is closer because

14
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,350
it appears in front of this one.

15
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,745
>> That's interesting. So, are there any other monocular clues?

16
00:00:43,745 --> 00:00:47,682
>> Yes, linear perspective. But this one's a little more difficult to explain, so

17
00:00:47,682 --> 00:00:51,345
I'm going to send it back to the studio for you guys to do an illustration.

18
00:00:51,345 --> 00:00:53,519
>> All right. Thanks again, Susan.
