00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,200
Let's do the essential matrix computation for the example of parallel cameras.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,039
Okay?

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,000
So, first, what is, so, so, by the way, you recognize this picture?

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,010
Right, this is the picture of our parallel image planes when we were

5
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:20,750
doing the stereo the derivation of the relationship between disparity and depth.

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,180
So I have two parallel image planes, nothing is rotated, oh,

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,460
nothing's rotated, so what's the rotation matrix?

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,330
Well, it's just the identity.

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,220
Great.

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,870
All right, what's T, well, what was T?

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,550
T was the translation between the two camera centers.

12
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,760
Well, in the geometry that we've defined here, the camera center has just been

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,110
translated an amount B in the x direction, or negative B in the other x

14
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,580
direction, doesn't matter, but we'll just say it's minus B, zero, zero, okay?

15
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,150
So, T is just minus B, all right?

16
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,170
Well, that means I can now compute my essential matrix, because my

17
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:58,470
essential matrix defined before was this weird cross product thing of T times R,

18
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,820
R is the identity, so we just plug T into the cross product,

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,099
little formula I gave you, and it looks like that.

20
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,920
So that's our essential matrix.
