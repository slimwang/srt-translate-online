00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,939
The ability to generalize code for a
variety of possible inputs is a powerful

2
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:09,730
tool when creating easy to understand,
non-repetitive code.

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:13,220
Take this example, here's
a function that reverses a string.

4
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:19,399
You can pass in the string Julia as
an argument and it will reverse it and

5
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:24,309
return ailuJ or ailuJ, who knows.

6
00:00:24,309 --> 00:00:26,759
There are quite a few steps
involved in this process.

7
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:32,009
The function has one parameter,
a variable reverseMe,

8
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,649
that will be used to store the argument,
in this case the string Julia.

9
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:41,957
The function has a variable called
reverse that will eventually contain

10
00:00:41,957 --> 00:00:46,280
the final string with all
the characters in reverse order.

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,130
It then loops over the reverseMe
string from back to front and

12
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,980
adds each character in that
order to the reversed variable.

13
00:00:54,979 --> 00:01:00,089
Finally, it returns the result, so
we can print it using console.log.

14
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,400
Like I said, there's a lot going
on here, but think about it.

15
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,609
If all of these steps were not wrapped
inside this reverseString function,

16
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:11,179
you would have to repeat
this code over and

17
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:15,980
over and over, every time you wanted to
reverse the characters in the string.

18
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:21,210
Using a function simplifies the process
by wrapping all this code together and

19
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:24,619
generalizing the process for
all strings.

20
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:28,189
It allows you to use and
then even reuse the function

21
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:33,009
by just calling it by its name and
passing in a different string each time.

22
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,930
Let's take a closer look
at how functions work and

23
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,130
the different ways you can define and
call functions in JavaScript.
