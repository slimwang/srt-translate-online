1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,719
Cool, so it looks like we found
a service with the data that we need.

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:06,050
But to get that data it looks like we
need to download a complicated form,

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,650
then read our results off a map,
or download a spreadsheet.

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,720
I'm not sure how we're
going to use this service.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,200
>> Well, why can't we just embed
the spreadsheet into our app?

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,890
>> Well, I think we could, but
it would be an updating nightmare.

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,160
Especially for users.

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,050
I mean every single time there's
new data, we'd have to re-download

9
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,930
the spreadsheet, recompile the app,
then republish it to Google Play.

10
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,360
Not to mention, every single time there
was new data, users would also have to

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,610
update their apps every single time
we updated, which was like daily.

12
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,030
>> Yeah, talk about a poor experience.

13
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,120
>> That is a problem.

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,826
Well, perhaps we'll just have our
app pick up some drive-through data.

15
00:00:39,826 --> 00:00:41,680
>> [LAUGH] What do you mean?

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,570
>> Get this.

17
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,740
You can think of a data source
like a fast food restaurant.

18
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,850
You know, the kind with indoor
seating and a drive-through.

19
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:49,670
>> Okay.
>> You see,

20
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,380
when you're not sure what
you want at a restaurant,

21
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,490
you probably want to go inside,
look at the menu, talk to the staff, and

22
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,020
they'll take care of
bringing the food to you.

23
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:58,990
>> Okay.

24
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:03,020
>> But when you know exactly what food
you want, you're probably okay going

25
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,480
through the drive-thru making a precise
order and then getting your food

26
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,290
returned to you all nicely
packaged up at the pick-up window.

27
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,670
>> Are you sure we're still
talking about earthquakes?

28
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:12,910
>> Absolutely.

29
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:16,858
>> For example, when you navigate to
the USGS website and fill out the form

30
00:01:16,858 --> 00:01:19,950
querying for what earthquakes you want,
that's like going in and

31
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,770
sitting down at the restaurant You're
getting the human friendly experience.

32
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,020
>> Okay, I got you.

33
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,360
>> But
if you're another computer program, or

34
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,300
an app that wants to use data from USGS,
then there's the drive-through window.

35
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,920
You see, you can customize a request for
data and it gets returned to you in

36
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,010
a simple format that a program
can easily understand.

37
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,820
>> Hm, let me think about that.

38
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:46,290
So you mean there's dine-in data for
humans, and drive-through data for apps?

39
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,350
>> Absolutely.

40
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:51,074
And the drive-through window is kind of
like an application programming

41
00:01:51,074 --> 00:01:51,780
interface.

42
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,780
>> Right, an API.

43
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,280
So it's basically a way for

44
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,660
another application to talk
to a service via code.

45
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,160
>> Yup.

46
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,920
>> So, burgers?

47
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,890
>> Absolutely, let me call.

48
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:01,570
>> Let's do it.
