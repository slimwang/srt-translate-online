1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The answer is no. We're going to talk about a cryptographic protocol that does this.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
But actually achieving what we want depends on lots of other things.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It depends on people.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It depends on assumptions about the adversary, knowing what capabilities the participants have

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
as well as any eavesdropper might have,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
as well as building the system that actually runs the protocol.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
These are all things we're not going to talk about.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What we are going to talk about is a protocol that, given the right answers

9
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to these questions, could provide this property.
