1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:05,590
The second key concept is the event. Once again it's an abstraction, and

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:12,730
we'll say it's a single, instantaneous, noticeable occurrence. And

3
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,830
also, and also, think of it as some kind of stimulus because the system is going

4
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:23,800
to respond to it. Events in these kinds of systems can either be asynchronous or

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,660
synchronous. Asynchronous events you can think of as kind of randomly occurring,

6
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,880
they can come in bursts, they can be spread out.

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,170
Synchronous events are more likely to come at periodic intervals,

8
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,920
often the system has some sort of clock or event loop that controls.

9
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:49,060
The current events when they can be dealt with in our

10
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:55,750
approach to modeling these systems the events can

11
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:00,819
serve as the reason or the stimulus for a change of state in the system.

12
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:07,720
That, that change of state is sometimes called a state transition. For example,

13
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,430
when you got your envelope through the mail that said you were admitted to

14
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:17,890
college, that's a significant state transition in your life. Events can

15
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:23,360
occur as the results of user actions like hitting a, hitting a button on the,

16
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:30,460
on the graphical user interface. They can occur because of changes in the data,

17
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:35,670
in the, in the state space the temperature getting above 90 degrees.

18
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,490
Or they can be queued by the passage of time.
