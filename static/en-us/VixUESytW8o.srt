00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,320
One of the important things when you talk about real lenses is for

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,130
the photographers among you, you know about this, for

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,570
those of you who are new to it, it's cool, it's called depth of field.

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:14,580
And depth of field is, and, looks at the question of, okay I've got some

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,660
depth in space that's exactly in focus, how much does focus change as we get.

6
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,480
A little bit off of that, of that distance, right, so

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,240
if I move a little bit of the point that's precisely in focus, how much does

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,490
the focus change, and what that's controlled by actually is the aperture.

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,430
And the reason is, you can see here, so here we have a wide aperture, and

10
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,000
with a wide aperture, these, these rays diverge quite a bit,

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,480
if my film plane instead of being here, okay, was actually here,

12
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,610
okay, the rays from this point would have been spread out a lot, so

13
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,840
it would have been out of focus a lot.

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,040
But on this smaller aperture, okay, where things were supposed to

15
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,930
be in focus here, if I actually, am off by a little bit

16
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:13,650
there that is that my film plane has moved a little bit, you see that the spread

17
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:19,330
is much less, and that's why the depth of field is much better.

18
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,030
That's illustrated here, these are some pictures from Wikipedia, so

19
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,510
here's a picture of a flower.

20
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:28,520
You'll notice the flower itself is beautiful and sharp, and

21
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,780
the background is totally out of focus, now, it says f/5.6.

22
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:33,280
Now.

23
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,310
This is f for aperture, not f for focal length.

24
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,598
I apologize, those of you who buy lenses, you'll buy a 50 millimeter lens,

25
00:01:43,598 --> 00:01:48,770
f/1.4, the f is about the aperture, it means the, the smallest aperture, the,

26
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,890
the largest aperture it can get.

27
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:55,645
Also, fs are inverted, the bigger the number, the tighter the value, so

28
00:01:55,645 --> 00:02:01,464
5.6 is a relatively larger aperture, compared to say f/32.

29
00:02:01,464 --> 00:02:05,570
So here, same flower taken from the same position, but

30
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,490
you'll notice now that the background is in sharp focus.

31
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,164
So if you're a photographer and you, you want to separate out

32
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:14,880
your foreground from your background, you want to have a wide-open aperture.

33
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,650
If you're trying to look at a landscape and

34
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,530
you want to see everything in focus, you want a very tight aperture.

35
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,660
Here is a very nice example of depth of field,

36
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,790
the focal plane obviously is somewhere in the middle of the phone, so

37
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,860
the stuff that's in front and the stuff that's in back is out of focus.
