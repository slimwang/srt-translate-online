1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,520
>> Alright, so that wasn't so bad. You are able

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,930
to compute some probabilities from this joint distribution. So let's

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,820
see what happens when we start talking about more variables.

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,870
More propositions that could be true or false. What I did

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,300
is I filled in thunder as another variable and thunder

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,440
can be true or false in each of these cases. And

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,440
I wrote down what the probabilities could be from my

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,370
experience in Atlanta in the summer. I was, I was around

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:30,520
over last summer, and in 2004, so let's, so I'm an expert obviously, so

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,369
I'm able to estimate these probabilities to

11
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,880
the nearest percent. Anyway the point is, that

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,900
one of the things you should notice here is that each time we add

13
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,670
one variable what happens to the number

14
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,210
of probabilities that we have to write down?

15
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,390
>> Well in a world where it's binary it goes up by two.

16
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,407
>> A factor of two, right?

17
00:00:47,407 --> 00:00:48,150
>> A factor of two.

18
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,470
>> Not just, not just two more, but like, twice as many. And so

19
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:54,100
if we have a complicated scenario that we want to be able to reason about,

20
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,170
and it's got, I don't know, a hundred variables, that's going to be a lot.

21
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,630
>> That's, that's, I can't even, I can't even think about that.

22
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,900
>> Yeah, it's like two to the hundred is.

23
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,330
>> That's, that's not even a real number.

24
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,709
>> It's technically a real number, but

25
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,660
it's an, it's an unimaginably large number.

26
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,685
>> There's only like four numbers, one, two, three, many, and too many.

27
00:01:09,685 --> 00:01:12,229
>> So it's going to be really inconvenient as we start adding more

28
00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:13,525
of these and especially if we add

29
00:01:13,525 --> 00:01:15,685
variables like, you know, remember the restaurant

30
00:01:15,685 --> 00:01:18,290
example that we worked on when we were doing decision trees.

31
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,110
>> Oh yeah those were the days.

32
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,460
>> Then there was variables like food type,

33
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,850
and what was the deal with food type?

34
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,900
>> It had lots of values that it could take on.

35
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,360
>> Yeah, yeah like five or something like that.

36
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,760
>> Thai an, American and Italian.

37
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,321
>> Right and so if we had, add variable like that it's going

38
00:01:37,321 --> 00:01:40,702
to multiply the number of probabilities that we need by five. So this is

39
00:01:40,702 --> 00:01:43,520
going to get really big really fast. So would it be nice if

40
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,550
we had an more convenient way of writing it out in this distribution?

41
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,600
>> Yeah, it would be nice.

42
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,740
>> So it turns out that we can factor it.

43
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,070
>> But I thought we already had a factor of two?

44
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,290
>> Well that was a joke but it actually is pretty close to

45
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,860
being the truth, which is the idea that instead of representing all, so,

46
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,705
so, in this case, there's eight numbers. Instead of representing them as eight

47
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:05,870
numbers, we're going to represent it by you know, 2 times 2 time 2.

48
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:09,979
So we really are going to essentially factor it. putting,

49
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,820
putting things into pieces that we can recombine, smaller pieces

50
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,189
that we can recombine into, into larger pieces. And it,

51
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:17,010
yeah, it turns out that actually works out really well.
