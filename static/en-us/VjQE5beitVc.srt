00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,834
Based on what you've seen so far, let's see if you can shift a circle. So here

2
00:00:04,834 --> 00:00:09,480
this orange circle was our original circle we saw with a radius of 50 units.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:16,264
This blue circle was our same circle shifted 20 units to the right. And keep in

4
00:00:16,264 --> 00:00:19,680
mind even though we went 20 units to the right, we see a subtraction of 20 in

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,443
the equation I feel like this goes against my intuition. Usually when I think

6
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:29,278
about moving to the right, in the x direction, I think about adding or positive

7
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:34,626
20. But in our equation it's actually a negative 20. You always want to keep

8
00:00:34,626 --> 00:00:38,630
this in mind when shifting a circle. What's in the equation will be the

9
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:43,730
opposite of the direction we move. So if we have negative 20 in an equation, we

10
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:49,016
really move our circle 209 units to the right. So, knowing this, what do you

11
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:53,156
think would be the equation of a circle with center at negative 10, 2 and a

12
00:00:53,156 --> 00:00:58,091
radius of 50? Enter that equation here.
