1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,129
Now we're going to try
something slightly different.

2
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:06,139
Instead of one text field,
we'll have two of them.

3
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:09,140
Let's see what happens when
we try to stretch them.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:13,140
When we think about what should happen,
they both have the same content hugging.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,450
I'll create the views and stack them.

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:17,010
Ready?

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:17,720
Let's stack them.

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,260
Now let's add the last
remaining constraint.

9
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:30,739
And in order for the StackView to
stretch, we're going to change the size.

10
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:31,250
Ready?

11
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,439
Here we go.

12
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,219
Well, well, well.

13
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:37,449
Not sure about you but
I didn't see that one coming.

14
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:42,000
Apparently when the StackView has to
stret several views that have the same

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,255
hugging content value, instead of
stretching them all a little bit.

16
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:50,885
It concentrates all its stretching
power on the first one from the left.

17
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:54,634
This is a bit odd and it doesn't
provide the layout I was looking for.

18
00:00:54,634 --> 00:00:57,045
We'll find out how to
fix this pretty soon.

19
00:00:57,045 --> 00:01:00,145
But before we do so,
let's run a small experiment.
