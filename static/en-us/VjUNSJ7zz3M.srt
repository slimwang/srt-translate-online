00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,450
We've talked about how frameworks
provide templating, URL management and

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,810
event handling to control an app's data.

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:14,820
These are the V and the C in MVC speak,
but where is the data or the M in MVC?

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,130
How is the data being
managed by the client?

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,610
Does it live on the client?

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:21,180
And what happens with the data
when we stop using it?

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,020
If we take another look
at the to do NVC site,

8
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,570
we'll see that it doesn't
start with any data.

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,150
This is a common scenario.

10
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,000
The app starts out empty waiting for
the user to provide the data.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,100
Then when data is added
more features appear.

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,030
Now that we have our data, what happens
to it when we're done with the site.

13
00:00:39,158 --> 00:00:43,150
To do NVC used local storage to
save the user provide the data.

14
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,720
This, however, is not permanent,
and is only saved on this computer.

15
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,570
If I open up the developer tools,
go to the resources tab, and

16
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:54,170
open up local storage,
you can see the tasks I entered.

17
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,920
If I delete these entries and

18
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,120
refresh the page,
you'll see that the tasks are gone.

19
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,800
Browsers can make use of web storage,
like local storage or index DB for

20
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,080
temporary storage.

21
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,160
But typically, a framework will send
their data off to a server to be saved.

22
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,470
Then, when they need that data,
they'll just fetch it from the server.

23
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,340
For example, firebase is a platform
that lets you store and retrieve data.

24
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,110
It has a rest server, and can easily be
integrated with a front end framework.
