1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:06,800
The sequence diagram has columns corresponding to individual participants,

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,800
usually objects, in the system.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,910
Time marches down the sequence diagram, and horizontal lines between

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,450
columns indicate the passing of a message from one object to another object.

5
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:23,830
Historically, these sequence diagrams evolved from message

6
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:28,730
sequence charts which had been used in the telephony industry for many years.

7
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:33,300
These diagrams will be semantically equivalent to communication diagrams which

8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,400
we'll look at in a minute, but from a slightly different point of view.
