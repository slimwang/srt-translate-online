00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,530
Earlier in the course we saw how object oriented analysis can give you

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,950
a better understanding of the problem you are trying to solve.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:13,780
The results is a set of diagrams, interface specifications, expressed in OCL,

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,640
and a list of non-functional requirements and

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,222
constraints. Then the architectural design process can help you determine

6
00:00:20,222 --> 00:00:24,317
appropriate subcomponents. Understand the tradeoffs among the constraints.

7
00:00:24,317 --> 00:00:28,324
Select appropriate methods for satisfying the nonfunctional requirements. And

8
00:00:28,324 --> 00:00:31,970
choose a suitable architectural style. The eventual target is to

9
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,070
produce a program written in some object oriented language like Java.

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,550
The purpose of this lesson is to introduce you to Object Oriented Design,

11
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,320
OOD. The process of getting you from your analysis and

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,380
intended architecture to the point where you can write the target program.
