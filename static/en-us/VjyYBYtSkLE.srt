1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,233
Well, the entire curve sits in this part of the graph, starting at the y-axis

2
00:00:04,233 --> 00:00:08,591
and moving to the right. So, that means the smallest x value we have on this

3
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:12,218
curve is 0. And then it's going to continue to increase with corresponding

4
00:00:12,218 --> 00:00:15,634
values of the function for every value of x that gets higher and higher and

5
00:00:15,634 --> 00:00:19,672
higher. So that means, that domain is going to increase forever in this

6
00:00:19,672 --> 00:00:24,095
direction, and the domain of g of x, must me all number between 0 and infinity.
