All non trivial design involves refinement. Moving from a high level

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,540
of understanding to an implementation. Multiple levels may be involved,

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,570
not just two, depending on the complexity of the problem. To execute

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:19,680
a multilevel design properly, three properties must obtain. The top level must

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,860
faithfully represent the requirements. Each level must be internally consistent.

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,020
And third, each lower level must faithfully represent the level above it.
