00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,120
So, think about a typical home router.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,220
It has one interface that goes to your
ISP, and then one or more interfaces

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,740
that are local, maybe an Ethernet or
probably a wi-fi access point.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,920
Now, the local network, or LAN,
is where your computers and devices are.

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,330
Whereas the outward facing
wide area network, or

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,670
WAN, is the interface that connects
towards the rest of the internet.

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,342
How many interfaces does
your Linux box have?

8
00:00:25,342 --> 00:00:27,350
What are their names?

9
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,290
You can use ip add or show or
ifconfig to see them.
