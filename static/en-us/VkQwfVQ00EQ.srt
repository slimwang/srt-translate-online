1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,070
When we run the code, we get this output. And

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,920
notice how we have friend count split by females, and then

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,530
by males. And it looks like the median and the mean

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,870
friend count is greater for females. So here the answer was

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,230
women. Now the difference between the median friend count for

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,370
men and women is 22. That's just subtracting these two numbers.

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,310
Now, something I want to draw your attention to is the

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,600
mean Notice how the mean for friend count is higher than

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,820
the median for both females and for males. This should

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,790
make sense since our data is long tailed. So these

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,230
higher values out and the higher friend counts our kind of

12
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,420
pull our mean to the right. For this last question,

13
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,830
the median is a better measure than mean because it's

14
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,530
a more robust statistic. A few people with huge friend

15
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,910
counts drag the mean upwards which isn't necessarily representative of

16
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,480
most users. What's nice is that the median's resistant to change,

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,820
since it marks the halfway point for all data points. So as long as we trust

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,480
half of our values, we can report a

19
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,740
reliable location of the center of our distribution.
