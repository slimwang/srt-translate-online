1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,130
We know that the exponent needs to distribute to both factors that are

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:08,547
multiplied together to make up this term. So this equals 3 squared times i

3
00:00:08,547 --> 00:00:13,066
squared. We know that 3 squared is just 9, and we know that i squared is just

4
00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:15,788
negative 1. So 3i squared equals negative 9.
