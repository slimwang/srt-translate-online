1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This is the answer.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
A minus B corresponds to 3, because this is all the elements that are in A but not B.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We haven't filled in this area.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
A or B is number 2.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
All of the elements are either in A or B.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
A &amp; B is number 1. I filled in this middle area corresponding to both sets.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The symmetric difference of A and B is 4.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
All the elements that are in A or B but not in both, and I've left out this region.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Okay, so now that you understand the basics of set theory, we can implement this in Python.
