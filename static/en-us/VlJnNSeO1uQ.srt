1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,900
R is the leading programming language for statistics and data analysis.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,120
One of the main advantages of using R is that we

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,550
can build up an analysis line by line in code. We

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,560
can save all of our work in a file and go

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,740
back to see what we investigated at a later date. Having

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,830
R scripts allows you to easily share your work with others.

7
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,950
And you can see what others are doing with data. R

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:26,220
also has over 2,000 user contributed packages that increase its functionality.

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,070
One example of this is the text analysis package, TextCat, that

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,830
you just saw. Now, one of the main packages we'll use

11
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,880
throughout this course is ggplot2. Ggplot2 is a graphics package that

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,550
lets us create plots And graphs with just a few commands.

13
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,770
We'll learn more about ggplot in the next lesson but just

14
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,000
to give you a taste of it, here's an example of

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,110
a plot you can create. Now, don't worry about memorizing or

16
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,350
understanding all of this code. You'll have plenty of practice with

17
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,780
this later in the course. I just want to show you

18
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,110
how a few lines of code, can create amazing graphics.

19
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,280
I'm going to load up the ggplot library and a color

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,360
library. Then I'm going to load the diamonds data set, and with

21
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,310
this function I'll create a scatter plot. Let's check out

22
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:09,540
this plot in detail. This part shows the relationship between price

23
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,430
and carat of almost 54,000 round cut diamonds. I'd say

24
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,550
R is doing very well for such few lines of code.

25
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,180
The last thing I want to mention is that you

26
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,390
can use R anywhere. It's free open source software that

27
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,240
works on any operating system. And as a result of

28
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,620
this, R has a large active and growing community of users.
