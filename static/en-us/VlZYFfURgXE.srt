1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You may want to introduce auxiliary variables

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
such as, for instance, this vector from the spaceship to the moon

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and this vector from the spaceship to earth.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And then the rest is simply Newton's equation.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We're dividing by the second power of the distance from the spacecraft to the earth.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You're combining all occurrences of the distance of the spacecraft

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
to earth in this single place which is the third power of the length of the vector

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
from the spacecraft to the earth.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,173
The same occurs here with the moon.
