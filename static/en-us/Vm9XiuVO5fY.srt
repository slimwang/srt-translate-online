00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
One way to convince people something is hard is to post a challenge,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
provide some motivation, and see if anyone can solve it.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This particular challenge was posted in Martin Gardner's Scientific American column

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
in an article that he wrote in August 1977

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
that was introducing RSA to a wide audience.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The technical paper on RSA was published shortly after that in 1978.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
As part of this article, he asked for Ron Rivest to come up with a challenge.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This was the challenge that was published in this article.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Given a public key and an e--and here we have n as a 129-digit number--

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and the intercepted cipher text, figure out what the message was.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That can be done by factoring n.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Ron Rivest estimated that factoring n would take about 40 quadrillion years.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It turns out this was a little bit off.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The actual time was 17--without the quadrillion--years.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It was shown by a team lead by Derek Atkins in 1994

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
that these two numbers multiplied together to produce the n in the challenge.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
For the quiz, the question is what does this mean--

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
the fact that Derek Atkins and his team were able to break n into these two factors.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This is kind of a silly quiz, but I hope you'll think about it anyway.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Some of the answers are more serious than others.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It could mean that RSA is fundamentally broken.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It could mean that the magic words are "squeamish ossifrage."

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It could mean that RSA keys need to be longer than 129 for good security.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Or it could mean that time flies when you're factoring,
