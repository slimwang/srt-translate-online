1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,820
Let's consider how we can use this
same approach now for stock data.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:09,660
This is one of our pandas Data Frames
that contains some factors or

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,690
features of stocks, and it's arranged
in the usual way where each column

4
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:19,070
represents the value of the feature for
a particular stock.

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,930
And time goes downward essentially.

6
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,710
Now we might have many features for
each stock, for

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,910
instance we might have Bollinger Bands,
momentum, PE ratio, and so on.

8
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:39,540
We represent that by stacking
these one behind the other.

9
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,730
These are our X's.

10
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,730
What is our Y?

11
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:48,446
In most cases we want to
use our historical feature

12
00:00:48,446 --> 00:00:51,486
data to predict a future price.

13
00:00:51,486 --> 00:00:56,000
But to train our model, we're going to
use historical price as well.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,880
So the value of these factors or
features today we call X and

15
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,390
we like to be able to run that
through the model that we've built and

16
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,160
get Y which is our
predicted future price.

17
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,450
Well, we don't have that model yet,
we've got to learn it.

18
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,430
And we've got to learn it from data.

19
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,060
So here's how we do that.

20
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:23,040
We roll back time so that we're back in
history here at our first data point.

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,155
We look at the values of our features
there, and then we look, say,

22
00:01:27,155 --> 00:01:32,070
5 days into the future to see
what that future price is.

23
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,875
So now we've got a pairing of
these features with that future Y.

24
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:39,580
We save that XY pair into our data.

25
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,210
Now remember X can be multi-dimensional.

26
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,940
And that's one instance of data.

27
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,530
We move forward one day.

28
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,500
So we've got a new set of X's and
a new Y.

29
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,065
And we record that in our database.

30
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:57,100
Eventually, we reach a point
where we can't go any further

31
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,440
because there's no more Y data.

32
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:05,120
In other words, if we went one day past
this, Y would be out here in the future.

33
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,870
So we don't have that data to use, and
that means we've got some leftover data.

34
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:14,210
In any case, we now, for
each of these days in history, have

35
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:18,960
a pair of X's and Y's that we can feed
into our database to build our model.
