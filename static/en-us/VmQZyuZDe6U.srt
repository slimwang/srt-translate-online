00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,890
In this lesson, we will look at

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,330
how data center tarffic engineering through customized

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,150
topologies and special mechanisms for load balance

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,590
can help reduce linkulization, reduce the number of

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:19,590
hops to each the edge of the data center, and make the data center network

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,500
easier to maintain. We saw in the

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,530
last lesson how existing data center topologies provide

8
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,100
extremely limited server to server capacity

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,409
because of the over subscription of the

10
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,250
links at the top of the hierarchy.

11
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,280
Additionally, as services continue to be migrated

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,510
to different parts of the data

13
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,920
center resources can be fragmented, significantly lowering

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,540
utilization. For example, if the service denoted

15
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,610
by green is running mostly in one

16
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,220
part of the data center, but there's a

17
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,170
little bit running on a virtual machine in

18
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,270
another part of the data center, this might

19
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,730
cause traffic to traverse. Links of the data

20
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:06,570
center topology hierarchy, thus significantly lowering utilization and

21
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,900
cost efficiency, reducing this kind of fragmentation can

22
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,420
result in complicated layer two, or layer three,

23
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,890
routing reconfiguration, what we'd like to have is

24
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,540
just the abstraction is of one large layer to switch, this is the abstraction

25
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:30,005
that VL2 provides. So, VL2 has two main objectives. One is to achieve

26
00:01:30,005 --> 00:01:32,860
layer-two semantics across the entire data center

27
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,170
topology. This is done with a name-location

28
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,950
separation and a resolution service that resembles

29
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,190
the fabric manager which we talked about

30
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,320
in the last lesson. In which is described in more detail in the

31
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,770
paper. To achieve uniform high capacity

32
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,410
between the servers and balance load across

33
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,590
links in topology, VL2 relies on

34
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:58,760
flow based random traffic interaction using valiant

35
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,890
load balancing. Let's take a closer look at how that load balancing works.
