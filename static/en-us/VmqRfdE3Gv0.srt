1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,540
And on mobile, we need to be extra
careful, images consume a lot of

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,790
bandwidth, more than 60% of
the bytes that cross the web.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,520
That's bandwidth we can't always rely
on or might not want to use, and

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,880
images don't always work so
well on different screen sizes.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,730
This photo from the Tower of London
looks great on my new high DPI display,

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,510
but when I resize the window,
the fixed size image gets cropped.

7
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:31,060
With the same image on my phone,
I need to scroll horizontally and

8
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,000
vertically, and
that's a terrible experience.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,278
The web was actually invented with
responsiveness in mind to enable

10
00:00:38,278 --> 00:00:41,212
us to publish content to
a variety of devices.

11
00:00:41,212 --> 00:00:45,925
We need to think like that again,
and make sure our images work well,

12
00:00:45,925 --> 00:00:47,729
wherever they're seen.

13
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:51,000
So we can avoid this.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,550
Check out the pixelation
around the eyes on the horse.

15
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:57,710
And this,
not really seeing the surfer anymore.

16
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,700
And worst of all, this.

17
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,690
I'll leave you with a quote.

18
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,300
Create a product,
don't re-imagine one for small screens.

19
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,760
Great mobile products are created,
never ported.

20
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,930
That's from Brian Fling.

21
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,140
So great designers don't optimize for
mobile,

22
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,260
they think responsively, to build sites
that work across a range of devices.
