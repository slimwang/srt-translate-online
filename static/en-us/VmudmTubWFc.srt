We're so close to having x by itself. If I want the left side of the equation to

2
00:00:04,407 --> 00:00:08,753
now read x plus b over two a, what does the right side need to be? I'll make the

3
00:00:08,753 --> 00:00:12,919
version of the equation we just had a little bit bigger. Read each of these

4
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:17,447
answer choices really carefully to figure out whether or not it's correct. Note

5
00:00:17,447 --> 00:00:21,807
that I've put square boxes next to each of these. Indicating that you can check

6
00:00:21,807 --> 00:00:25,274
as many of these as you think are right. There might be multiple ways to write

7
00:00:25,274 --> 00:00:26,731
what belongs on the right side.
