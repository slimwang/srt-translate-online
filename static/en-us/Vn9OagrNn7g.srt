F times g of 2 equals 24. Great thinking if you found this number. When we find

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,818
f times g of 2, we're really finding the product of these functions' outputs,

3
00:00:10,818 --> 00:00:18,050
when their input is x equals 2. We know f of 2 equals 8. And g of 2 equals 3.

4
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:23,212
So we really just need to multiply these two outputs together. And what do you

5
00:00:23,212 --> 00:00:27,483
know, 8 times 3 equals 24, our answer.
