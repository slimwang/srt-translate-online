00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, let me introduce you to the mystery test function.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is a function which returns either pass or fail.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We would like to use fuzzer input in order to make it fail.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Here's some fuzzer input, which we can pass to mystery test.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let's see where they passes or fails on that. Well, for this input, it passes.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We now, however, is again a fuzzer generated input for which mystery test now fails.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The first input passes, but the second input fails.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So you wonder what it is in this input that makes a function fail.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
How can you find this out straightforward--by using delta debugging in order to simplify the first input

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
such that you know which part of the first input actually causes mystery test to fail.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And here is programming exercise, find the minimal input that causes mystery test to fail,

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and for this, use a fuzzer such that you'll find input that causes mystery test to fail.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And once through fuzzing you found such an input, use delta debugging in order to minimize the input.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Over to you.
