00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,699
The probability that in any drawing, A is not sampled, is 0.8.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,866
Because we sampled three times, we take 0.8 to the third.

3
00:00:10,867 --> 00:00:18,866
That's the probability that A never occurs. So the probability that A occurs at least once is one minus that.

4
00:00:18,867 --> 00:00:25,933
And when you work it out, it's 0.488.
