1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,019
In this lesson we'll learn how faults,
errors, and failures are related to each

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:09,910
other and how redundancy can help us
prevent faults from becoming failures.

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:14,740
This lesson also concludes the second
part of our computer architecture course

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,250
where we can learn how
the memory hierarchy works.

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,850
The final part of this course will focus

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,090
on what we need to do in computer
architecture to get correct and

7
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,650
efficient execution in multi
threaded and multi core processors.
