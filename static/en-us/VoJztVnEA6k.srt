1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,510
So at this point, when p0 is declared the champion

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,590
of the tournament, what we know is that everybody has

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:10,357
arrived at the barrier. And this knowledge is available with

4
00:00:10,357 --> 00:00:13,530
p0 but not with anybody else. So everybody, everybody has arrived

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,930
at the barrier, but P0 is the only one who

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,450
knows because he's a champion, he knows that, that everybody has

7
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,280
arrived at the barrier. So clearly, the next thing that

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,530
has to happen is of course free up all the processors

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,050
to indicate to them that you know, its time to

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,320
move on to the next phase of your computation. So let's

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,070
talk about the wake up. So what p0 is going to do

12
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:37,970
is is going to tell p4 that it's time to wake up.

13
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,920
And you know, if you want to use the tournament

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,290
analogy again, in any tournament the winner walks over to the

15
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,780
loser and shakes hands, right? So, you can sort of think

16
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,750
of the same thing happening over here, P4 with the [INAUDIBLE]

17
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,870
face is waiting for P0 to come over, and let

18
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,040
him know that okay, its a good match and shake

19
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,418
hands with you. And so, P0 is going to come

20
00:01:00,418 --> 00:01:04,980
over and let him know, shake hands. So that's the first

21
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,520
thing that happens. So in other words, at this point

22
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,960
P0 is awake of course, and he is also waking

23
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,440
up P4 saying that well barrier is done. And now

24
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,870
one of these guys can go to the next level and

25
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,630
do the honours at every level so, just as I

26
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,070
said about P0 coming in and shaking hands with P4, what

27
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,740
P0 is going to do is, go to the next round

28
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,100
and shake hands with P2, P4 go to the next round

29
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,900
and shake hands with P6 and, and so on. And

30
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,600
of course, if you think about the analogy of a tournament,

31
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,080
as soon as the match is over, the winner is

32
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,930
going to shake hands with the loser. But in this case,

33
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,820
the winner shakes hands with the loser after the

34
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,086
tournament is all done. So at every level, we're going to

35
00:01:45,086 --> 00:01:48,520
have that. So, its essentially, P0 and P4 come down

36
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,620
to the next level and they shake hands with the

37
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:55,050
respective losers of that level. And as I said, if

38
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,340
we have for some arbitrary N, where N is a

39
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,310
binary power, you're going to have this kind of propagation

40
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,990
of wake-up signals going from the winner to the loser

41
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,270
at every round. And all of them wake-up and go

42
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,460
to the next level. Because all of these guys are winners

43
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,660
from the previous level. So, all of these winners will

44
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,420
go down to the next level and wake up the losers

45
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,280
at that level. So that's what is going to happen. Again, what that means from

46
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,030
the point of view of a shared memory multiprocessor is that the spin location

47
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:31,490
for P4, P2, and P6, it's all fixed, right? Statically determined. If P4 knows

48
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:36,780
that P0 is going to come over and shake hands, and so that he can spin on a

49
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:44,130
local variable that is close to it's processor, and so again this is important

50
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,360
for NCC NUMA machines in which there is

51
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,820
no cache coherence and therefore it is convenient

52
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,390
if P4 can be spinning on a memory

53
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,670
location that is close to the processor. Same thing

54
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:01,930
with P2 and P6 at the next level. So this process of waking up the losers at

55
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:08,810
every level goes on till we reach round 1. And when at round 1, all the winners

56
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,432
have congratulated. Well, not congratulated, [LAUGH] but shook

57
00:03:12,432 --> 00:03:15,940
hands with the respective losers at the first round.

58
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,880
At that point, the wake up is complete. Everybody's

59
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,080
awake now. And, and, the, the barrier is done.

60
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,900
So all are awake, and the barrier is done, and

61
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,950
they can move on, the next phase of the computation.

62
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,700
And once again, in order to make sure that there

63
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,155
is sense reversal, everybody knows that this barrier is done, and

64
00:03:35,155 --> 00:03:37,910
they're going to go to the next phase of the computation

65
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,925
where they will wait on the different [INAUDIBLE] of the barrier.

66
00:03:40,925 --> 00:03:44,620
. So, that's Tournament Barrier Algorithm. So the 2 things

67
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,220
that I want you to take away is, the arrival moves

68
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:52,440
up the tree like this, with match fixing. And all the respective winners at

69
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,202
every round, waiting on a statically determined

70
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:59,260
spin location. And similarly, when the wake up

71
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,072
happens, the losers are all waiting on

72
00:04:02,072 --> 00:04:05,940
statically determined spin location in their respective

73
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,320
processors and the winner comes over at

74
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,630
every level at every round of the tournament,

75
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,380
the winner comes over and tells the loser that

76
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,510
it's time to wake up. So that's how this

77
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,980
whole thing works. So now that we understand this

78
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:25,320
tournament algorithm let's talk about the virtues of this algorithm.
