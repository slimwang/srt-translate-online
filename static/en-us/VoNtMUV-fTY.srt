00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,430
For the rest of the unit you'll be entering in routes. Let's get familiar with

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:07,630
how to enter these different types of roots using our awesome tool Math Quill.

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,908
To get the square root symbol we simply want to type a backslash and then the

4
00:00:11,908 --> 00:00:16,886
letters sqrt for square route. When you type this you won't see anything quite

5
00:00:16,886 --> 00:00:20,845
yet, you'll just see your backslash and the letters. You'll need to hit space

6
00:00:20,845 --> 00:00:25,243
in order for the square root symbol to appear. You'll see this, and your cursor

7
00:00:25,243 --> 00:00:28,134
bar will be underneath the radical symbol for you to type in whatever is

8
00:00:28,134 --> 00:00:32,986
inside. And for this first one, you would want to type in a 2. But we haven't

9
00:00:32,986 --> 00:00:37,370
just seen square roots. We've also seen cube roots. For a cube root or the nth

10
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:42,546
root, we simply want to type in a \ and then these letters. Then of course

11
00:00:42,546 --> 00:00:46,129
we'll need to hit the Space. This will create a radical sign with our cursor

12
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:50,990
bar in the index position for the radical. Here our index is a 3, so we want to

13
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:55,476
type the number 3 to get that same index. Your cursor will still be in the

14
00:00:55,476 --> 00:00:59,658
position of the index, so we need to hit the Right Arrow key once. To move it

15
00:00:59,658 --> 00:01:02,871
back down underneath the radical, the cursor bar should appear here now and

16
00:01:02,871 --> 00:01:07,416
were free to type in whatever expression is inside radical. In this case we

17
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:11,778
would just type x. Now see few have the hang of it. Try entering these two

18
00:01:11,778 --> 00:01:15,678
expressions and using the keystrokes on the screen then try tackling these to

19
00:01:15,678 --> 00:01:22,133
challenge problems. This one combines fractions, exponents, and radicals. And

20
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:26,793
be careful on this last one there's really a 4 for the index of this group.
