1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,000
So with these, state transition diagrams there are several problems that

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,050
we've noticed. There are too many arrows, there are too many states, and

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,660
there's no concept of nesting in them. As far as the arrows are concerned,

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:16,079
if you've got end states and you've got impossible events. You've got n times m,

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,690
a multiplicative number of possible arrows.

6
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:23,280
As far as states are concerned we've already indicated that the number of states

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,700
goes up with the power of the number of possible things that can be going on.

8
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,845
As far as nesting is concerned with the example of the dialing the telephone.

9
00:00:32,845 --> 00:00:38,640
In, in essence we would like to have done the modeling by having the,

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,000
the entering of the particular digits somehow hidden within that dialing state.
