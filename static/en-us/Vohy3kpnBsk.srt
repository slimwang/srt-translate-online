1
00:00:00,191 --> 00:00:02,037
So let’s now redefine how to treat continuous

2
00:00:02,037 --> 00:00:05,121
distributions, here is our circle again and

3
00:00:05,121 --> 00:00:07,057
here is the bottle that we are spinning.

4
00:00:07,057 --> 00:00:09,922
Let’s call the outcome X, that’s the final

5
00:00:09,922 --> 00:00:13,338
angle at which the bottle arrives. Tell me

6
00:00:13,338 --> 00:00:16,023
what’s the probability that X is between

7
00:00:16,023 --> 00:00:20,023
zero and 180 degrees? Put your answer here.
