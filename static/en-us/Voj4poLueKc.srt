1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,952
So we know, this is the fourth power. 3 to the 4th equals 81. And this form is

2
00:00:05,952 --> 00:00:10,850
considered to be exponential form. Now, another new form that we're going to

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:15,775
talk about is logarithmic form. Log form involves a logarithm, and it's just

4
00:00:15,775 --> 00:00:21,178
another way of writing this equation. The key idea for a logarithm is that its

5
00:00:21,178 --> 00:00:27,132
base will be the same base in the equation above. So if we have 3 to the fourth

6
00:00:27,132 --> 00:00:35,592
equals 81, then we'll have log with a base of 3 set equal to 4. The answer to a

7
00:00:35,592 --> 00:00:41,402
logarithm is an exponent. Meaning if I take the log base 3 of some number, I'll

8
00:00:41,402 --> 00:00:47,372
get 4. Now it turns out that that number has to be 81. So we read this

9
00:00:47,372 --> 00:00:53,830
statement as log base 3 of 81 equals 4. We're asking ourselves, what's the

10
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:59,825
exponent that we need to raise a base of 3 to, to get 81? Well, that exponent

11
00:00:59,825 --> 00:01:05,670
is 4. When we take the logarithm of any number, we'll always get an exponent.

12
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,561
We use logarithms as a way to undo or reverse raising a number to a power. For

13
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:15,209
example, if we had this exponential form, we can also write it in logarithmic

14
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:21,520
form. This base becomes the base of our logarithm. So, we'll have log base two

15
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,795
of sum number equals 3, the exponent. We know that this number must be 8, since

16
00:01:27,795 --> 00:01:34,115
2 raised to the third power equals 8. The log base 2 of 8 is the exponent that

17
00:01:34,115 --> 00:01:40,245
we need to raise 2 to in order to get 8. So, in this case, log base 2 of 8

18
00:01:40,245 --> 00:01:45,890
equals 3. In general, when we have something written in exponential form with a

19
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:49,190
base raised to an exponent equal to a number, we can rewrite this in

20
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:55,347
logarithmic form. We can make the base be the base of our logarithm, the number

21
00:01:55,347 --> 00:02:01,662
is the argument for a logarithm and the answer is the exponent. So log with

22
00:02:01,662 --> 00:02:07,316
base b of some number always will give us an exponent. I think the key idea in

23
00:02:07,316 --> 00:02:13,467
any of these situations is that the log of a number results in an exponent. The

24
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,040
same was true for this example.
