00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,910
When I first got to Google.

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:04,670
I was trying to wrap up
on all things sysadmin.

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,050
It was overwhelming.

4
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,060
There were so many tools to learn so
many ways of doing the same thing.

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,620
Luckily, I got to sit next to
Kelsey on a two hour bus ride.

6
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,129
I started asking him questions I said,
Kelsey.

7
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:19,080
I'm having information overload
there are so many tools out there.

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,140
What should I learn, what's the fastest
way for me to become productive?

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,440
And he said there's only one rule
way to manage applications and

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,010
that's Kubernetes.

11
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,160
And he spent the next two
hours showing me Kubernetes.

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,290
After that I wasn't so
overwhelmed anymore.

13
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,020
Kubernetes made sense to me because it
looked at containers at a higher level.

14
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,190
It was an abstraction that made sense.
