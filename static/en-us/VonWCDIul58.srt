00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,510
Student Rodith asks, "How do we go about finding a good seed page?"

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,000
>>This is a really good question,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,040
we haven't solved that question in this course, and we won't.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,000
We're going to give you a seed page and have exercises and--

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,320
sets of pages to crawl set up so that seed page will work well.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,620
For a real web crawler, this is a big challenge.

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,590
And they don't start with just one seed page;

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,990
they start with a set of many seed pages that are selected in different ways.

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,750
Some may be found by hand,

10
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,000
by people identifying them as good seed pages,

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
some may be the results of previous crawls,

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,700
so once you start crawling the web, you don't just stop--

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,670
you keep crawling the web and you build a new collection of pages,

14
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,270
which you can start using start using as seed pages.

15
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,000
But this is a hard problem--to get a good collection of seed pages--

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
to cover as much content as you can find on the web.
