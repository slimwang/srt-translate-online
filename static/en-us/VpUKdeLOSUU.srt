To solve this problem, we can, once again,
use this trick that we learned earlier. We

2
00:00:04,778 --> 00:00:10,211
have two factors inside this term that
have the same base. So, we have y^4 and

3
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:12,853
y^-2.
So, I'm going to start by writing those

4
00:00:12,853 --> 00:00:18,343
next to each other. And now, we know that
y^4 times y^-2, is just going to be equal to

5
00:00:18,343 --> 00:00:24,546
y^4+-2.
So, I rewrite the x^2 factor and we have

6
00:00:24,546 --> 00:00:33,453
y^4+-2, which is the same as 4- 2power.
4-2 is just 2, so our final answer is x^2

7
00:00:33,453 --> 00:00:34,484
y^2.
