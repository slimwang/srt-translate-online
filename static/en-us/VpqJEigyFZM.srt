00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,336
So AI has drawn up representations that help capture both divisible levels of

2
00:00:05,336 --> 00:00:10,390
obstruction structure for example. And the indivisible levels like behavior and

3
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:14,200
function. Therefore these models are sometimes called structure,

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,880
behavior, function. Let's take a simple example. All of us

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,740
are familiar with the household flashlight. You press on the button and

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,520
light comes out of the bulb. What you can see is, the button and the bulb and

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,700
the body of the flashlight. You can even open the body of the flashlight and

8
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,030
you might see some batteries inside your flashlight. That's all you can see.

9
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,240
But of course there is more going on here. To begin with,

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,170
this particular flashlight has a function. This function is invisible.

11
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:46,110
You can ascribe to it, but it's nowhere inside the body of the bulb.

12
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,660
One level at which it is used would analyze the flashlight is, to

13
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:55,090
ask ourselves what does it do. Not yet, how does it work? Just what does it do,

14
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:59,020
its function. Here is a representation of the function. Here is the function,

15
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,650
create light off that light bulb circuit, or the flashlight light bulb circuit.

16
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,680
There is some stimulus, some external force on the switch.

17
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,340
Initially there was no light, zero lumens and finally there is some light,

18
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,380
30 lumens. This captures the notion that when I press on the switch,

19
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,480
light comes out. Here is a presentation of the structure of the flashlight.

20
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,890
Here is a light bulb, the switch, and the battery. And they're connected.

21
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:29,300
All of them are attached. Here is the invisible causal process that we're

22
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,120
calling behaviour. We'll capture this behavior through a series of states and

23
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,954
transitions between these states. So here is electricity initially in

24
00:01:37,954 --> 00:01:43,010
the battery. Then this electricity flows from the battery to the bulb, and

25
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:47,620
then the bulb converts this electricity into light. But in order for

26
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,240
this electricity to flow to the bulb, this particular switch has to be in

27
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,750
the mode ON. The switch goes into the mode ON, when someone presses on it.

28
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,220
Electricity is converted to light, because that's the function of the bulb.

29
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,810
Notice that these SBF models are nested.

30
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:07,810
We just gave an SBF model of the flashlight circuit. But now if you want, we can

31
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:12,550
do the SBF model of the lightbulb itself. How does it create light? In this way,

32
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:17,150
structure behavior function models capture not just the visible structure, but

33
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,670
also the invisible cause of processes, the behaviors and

34
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,810
the functions. Moreoever, they capture the multiple abstraction,

35
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,490
at the level of the flashlight, at the level of the bulb, and so on.

36
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:32,250
We'll not describe it in detail here, the structure behavior function models and

37
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:37,260
other similar models enables systems thinking in the context of diagnosis and

38
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,000
design of complex systems. You're provided some readings about this in

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,480
the course materials, if you want to read more about it.
