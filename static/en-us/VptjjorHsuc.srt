1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,290
Divs are great for

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:06,246
general all purpose blocks but they can
lead to a condition called div soup.

3
00:00:06,246 --> 00:00:10,970
Div soup happens when developers only
use divs to build their web page and

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:14,710
as a result the page is
just a mess of nested divs,

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,330
inside of divs, inside of divs.

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,849
And it's hard to tell what markup

7
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,210
corresponds to which
elements on the page.

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,960
Which is the problem I had in the game
at the beginning of this lesson.

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,400
Technically there's nothing
wrong with only using divs but

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,849
cognitively there is.

11
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,920
HTML is a markup language,
meaning that it describes a document.

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,780
If you can't easily figure out what is
describing then it's failing at its job.

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,930
Look at this page.

14
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,900
It's all divs, however,
you can build the same page using

15
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,670
elements that are much more
descriptive than divs.

16
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,160
These elements are called
semantic elements and

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,459
you've actually been using some already.

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,720
Here's the same page
with semantic elements.

19
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,410
Do you notice any differences?

20
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,190
You shouldn't.

21
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,590
It's the same result but
much nicer HTML.

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,900
Besides being easier to read, semantic
elements offer some additional benefits.

23
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,750
Using semantic tags makes your page
friendly for search engine crawlers like

24
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,690
the Googlebot, which determine where
your page shows up in searches and

25
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,670
makes it possible to show cool
previews of your content.

26
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:23,350
In effect this helps with SEO or
search engine optimization.

27
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,410
Semantic elements are also good for
accessibility.

28
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:30,820
Many people with vision impairment use
screen readers and semantic elements

29
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,139
makes it easy for screen readers
to make sense of your page.

30
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,160
That way it's easier for
everyone to enjoy your content.
