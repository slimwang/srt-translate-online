1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,750
In figuring out which line should be in the final file,

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,860
first we'll look at the lines that are the same in both versions.

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,120
Line B is in both, so it should be on the final list.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,150
It may have been there at the beginning of the day and

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,360
neither of them removed it.

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,280
Or possibly both Jake and Rachel added it independently.

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,900
Either way, we definitely want it.

8
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:17,960
The same thing is true for D.

9
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,020
Now let's look at some that are different.

10
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,360
Rachel's file contains A, but Jake's file doesn't.

11
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,560
There are a few different ways that this could have happened.

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,330
Maybe the original file didn't contain A and Rachel added it.

13
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,189
In that case, we do want A in the final version, but

14
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,230
it's also possible that the original line did contain A and Jake deleted it.

15
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,990
In that case, the final version shouldn't contain A.

16
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,780
It might seem like it would be safest to just include A since you can always

17
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,630
delete it later.

18
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,515
But remember that these letters could be representing code, so

19
00:00:45,515 --> 00:00:47,840
re-adding a deleted line could cause a bug.

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,350
So, without anymore information, we can't really tell whether A should be in

21
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,260
the final version or not, so we mark it as unknown.

22
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,210
We can see that the same reasoning applies to C and the opposite is true for E.

23
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,160
It's in Jake's file but

24
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,860
not Rachel's, meaning that either he added it or Rachel deleted it.

25
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,209
Since we can't tell these apart,

26
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:05,690
we don't know whether we should include it or not.
