Let's take our 2 equations and plot them on the same coordinate grid. Now that

2
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:07,870
we have 2 lines, we have a system of equations. We can represent the system

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:12,023
using 2 equations or graphically using 2 lines. This first line indicates that

4
00:00:12,023 --> 00:00:16,142
you can spend $45 on the car rental, that's the most you're willing to pay. This

5
00:00:16,142 --> 00:00:20,110
second line represents the cost of the car, notice that the line continues to

6
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:24,634
increase up into the right. This makes sense because the cost will continue to

7
00:00:24,634 --> 00:00:28,898
increase if we rented the car for more hours. You pay 10 more dollars for each

8
00:00:28,898 --> 00:00:33,043
hour you rent the car and that also is reflected on our graph. Knowing this

9
00:00:33,043 --> 00:00:37,459
information, what's the longest amount of time you can rent the car. Write your

10
00:00:37,459 --> 00:00:38,198
answer here.
