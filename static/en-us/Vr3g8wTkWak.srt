00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,690
Doing a merge sort with 2-way
Merging is pretty good in terms of

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,300
the number of slow
fast memory transfers.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,200
By way of reminder,

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,770
that number asymptotically is n
over L log based 2 of n over z.

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,810
I've rewritten this in a funny way for
reasons that you'll see momentarily.

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,570
Now this number of transfers still
falls short of what it turns out is

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:20,920
the lower bound.

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,940
And here's that lower bound now.

9
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,320
It's n over L,
log base z over L of n over L.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,440
Here is it is rewritten in
terms of log base twos.

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,790
So this scheme relative to this
scheme is off by a little bit.

12
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,560
That little bit is approximately
log base 2 of z over L.

13
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,520
And, in fact,
it's not even a little bit.

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,200
For typical adjacent levels of the
memory hierarchy on a real machine like

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,410
disc and main memory or main memory and
the last load of cache.

16
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,910
It might be roughly of factor of ten or
as high as a factor of 100.

17
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,680
Hence, my question for you.

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,950
Why doesn't merge short,

19
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,170
based on a 2-way merging scheme,
obtain the lower bound?

20
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,680
This question is
deliberately open-ended, so

21
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,090
there isn't necessarily a very
precise single correct answer here.

22
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:08,520
I'm mostly asking to force you to
think about how two-way merging works.

23
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,100
Force you?

24
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,580
I know what you're thinking.

25
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,240
What?

26
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,460
Is this Russia?

27
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,630
Are you forcing me to Gulag?

28
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,140
And if you are Russian,
I am truly sorry if I have offended you.

29
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:21,510
It's just that my wife is Polish, and
there's this natural distrust there.

30
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:25,000
If you don't believe me, just go ask any
mid 20th century European historian.
