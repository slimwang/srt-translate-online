1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,604
So here is a,
what's referred to as an audio spectrum.

2
00:00:02,604 --> 00:00:06,563
And at the top up here that's a,
a waveform.

3
00:00:06,563 --> 00:00:09,023
That's the actual signal coming in,
that's,

4
00:00:09,023 --> 00:00:11,980
a voltage is a function of
time going into a speaker.

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,770
And what this is, this is what's
referred to as a audio spectrum,

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,640
short term for a decomposition.

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,830
Basically, you've got low
frequency stuff down here,

8
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,100
high frequency stuff down here
with time going that way.

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,950
And the question is,
that's a sound, what sound is that?

10
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,822
Obviously, it's the song spectrum.

11
00:00:31,822 --> 00:00:37,515
It's the spectrum of the Prothonotary
Warbler, or, or War, Warbler.

12
00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:39,465
Obviously, I'm not a bird person, okay?

13
00:00:39,465 --> 00:00:40,495
There's a picture of one.

14
00:00:40,495 --> 00:00:44,755
But the idea is, if you listen to this
bird chirp, and then you process it

15
00:00:44,755 --> 00:00:48,215
over time, or actually, you listen to
it chirp over time and you process it,

16
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,845
you would see this audio spectrum.

17
00:00:50,845 --> 00:00:54,575
And the spectra of different birds,
of course, are different.

18
00:00:54,575 --> 00:00:58,045
Here's two different birds,
the Prothonotary Warbler, and

19
00:00:58,045 --> 00:00:59,700
the Chestnut-sided Warbler.

20
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,690
But what you can see is that the spectra
are really quite different, all right?

21
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:08,660
And, the goal is to think about
these things as what's referred

22
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:13,920
to as time series, and
how would you distinguish between them.

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,100
So, for a given time series,
there are questions you can ask,

24
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,040
like which bird is this, okay?

25
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,130
So like, you've, you've got, you've
got an audio signal, which bird is it?

26
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:25,700
How long is this thing
going to keep going?

27
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,510
Is this bird sick?

28
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,442
Right?
That is, you know, somehow not normal.

29
00:01:31,442 --> 00:01:35,444
And are there different sort of elements
or different phases that the book, the,

30
00:01:35,444 --> 00:01:36,145
the bird has.

31
00:01:36,145 --> 00:01:39,920
And when you think of these in a time
series context which bird it is,

32
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,885
that's a classification problem.

33
00:01:41,885 --> 00:01:44,775
Time series classification,
how long will it continue,

34
00:01:44,775 --> 00:01:47,155
might have something
to do with prediction.

35
00:01:47,155 --> 00:01:47,925
Is this bird sick?

36
00:01:47,925 --> 00:01:50,005
Would be an outlier detection.

37
00:01:50,005 --> 00:01:53,570
And finally,
you get the notion of segmentation.

38
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,398
So that would be for like bird data.

39
00:01:54,398 --> 00:01:57,150
Well, how about other time series data?

40
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,200
Here's some.

41
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,710
So, you know,

42
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,600
here's stock data of different types of
indices over different amounts of time.

43
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,940
And you might have questions
that you would ask like,

44
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,470
will this stock go up or down?

45
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,758
Something we all want to know.

46
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,810
What type of stock is this?

47
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,320
Right?

48
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,660
If you had a set of
categories of stocks.

49
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,110
And, is this stock behaving
the way it normally does?

50
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,300
And that becomes just like we saw
before, prediction classification,

51
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,410
or outlier detection.

52
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,945
Here's another example.

53
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:31,560
Supposed you were listening to
the audio of this music, right?

54
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,450
So not looking at the imagery
of the score of, of the,

55
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:38,710
of the music itself as shown here, but
actually listen to somebody playing it.

56
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,903
You might ask things like, you know,
is this Bach or Beethoven,

57
00:02:41,903 --> 00:02:43,542
which would be classification.

58
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:45,125
Can we make more of that?

59
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,701
That's now a generative
model kind of question.

60
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:50,254
And computer music people are always
interested in listening to some music.

61
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:55,240
Could I have a machine produce
more music of that sort of type?

62
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,090
And can we sort of divide this up into,
into segments?

63
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,650
So this is what's referred to
as time series segmentation.

64
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,586
By the way, this bottom one is,

65
00:03:04,586 --> 00:03:08,430
segmentations receive
a lot of attention lately.

66
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,770
Something called conditional random
field is being applied to it.

67
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,050
We're not going to talk about that,

68
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,870
we're going to talk
about mark-up models.

69
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,850
But I just wanted to point out that you
might not use what we're going to learn

70
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:17,950
today so much for

71
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,730
segmentation as much as you would for
some of the classification things.
