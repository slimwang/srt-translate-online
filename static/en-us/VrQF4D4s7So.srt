00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,712
We can solve for b by simply substituting in the values x and y that we know

2
00:00:05,712 --> 00:00:11,521
from our point. If we do that and a bit simple algebra, we can[UNKNOWN] the

3
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:17,793
value for b of 2800. Inserting this into our equation, gives us a final equation

4
00:00:17,793 --> 00:00:21,086
in[UNKNOWN] form of y equals 2x plus 2800.
