1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We study again our die.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You observe the following sequence: 1, 2, 3, 2.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'll ask you know for the two different estimators what is the maximum like estimator

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and what is the laplacian estimator for our estimate of the probability of the outcome 1

5
00:00:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
for this die, based on that data.
