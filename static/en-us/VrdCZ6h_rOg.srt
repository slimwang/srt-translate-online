1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This quiz is going to require a little bit of guess work,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
for how a multiple assignment works.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I think you'll be able to bet the right answer.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You can also try experiments in the Python interpreter.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The question is for any variable--so let's assume s and t are names,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and they've been assigned some value,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and now we execute the statement s, t assign t, s.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What does that do?

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The choices are nothing--after the assignment

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
s and t both have the same value as they did before.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That it makes both s and t refer to what the original value of t was before this statement.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That it swaps the values of s and t so after the statement,

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
s now has the previous value of t and t has the previous value of s.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Or it's an error.
