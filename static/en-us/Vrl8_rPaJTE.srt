00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,598
We've seen parallel lines. Now, let's check out perpendicular lines. Here are 2

2
00:00:04,598 --> 00:00:09,082
lines that are perpendicular. Before we talk about perpendicular lines, I want

3
00:00:09,082 --> 00:00:13,533
to see if you can find these equations. Use the graph to write the equations in

4
00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:18,098
slope intercept form. For this line, write the answer here. And for this line,

5
00:00:18,098 --> 00:00:18,962
write it here.
