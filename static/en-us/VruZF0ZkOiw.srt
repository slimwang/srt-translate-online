When you drove the boat upstream and downstream, it took a total time of one

00:00:03,766 --> 00:00:08,856
hour. This means that if we add the time to go upstream to the time to go

3
00:00:08,856 --> 00:00:14,090
downstream, those should add to one. So, we'll add the time to go upstream to

4
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:19,446
the time to go downstream, and that should equal 1. Great thinking if you found

this piece of information which you led you here.
