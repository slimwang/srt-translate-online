I wrote some broken pseudocode too. It sets temp to n and then while temp is

2
00:00:03,692 --> 00:00:07,412
greater than 10, increments count which was originally set to 1 and then

3
00:00:07,412 --> 00:00:12,212
divides temp by 10. It was meant to count the number of digits in the number n

4
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:16,989
but it's not doing it. Help me debug this by hand-tracing. If n is 123, what

5
00:00:16,989 --> 00:00:22,385
value does count end up with? What if n is 100? What should this loop condition

6
00:00:22,385 --> 00:00:24,000
be to get the right answer in all cases?
