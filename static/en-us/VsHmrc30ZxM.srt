00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,750
So now we're going to touch on some material that we talked about during the

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,840
lesson on the brain which was lesson three. This material may feel pretty

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,740
dense, but you can always refer to the document we're giving you on the

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,865
physiological side of the stress response. Stressful events can cause changes

5
00:00:14,865 --> 00:00:20,121
in our physiology. Most importantly, we see that the autonomic nervous system,

6
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:24,147
endocrine system and the brain all interact together to produce changes in our

7
00:00:24,147 --> 00:00:30,487
body systems as a result of stress. Remember that the autonomic nervous system

8
00:00:30,487 --> 00:00:36,414
has both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Sympathetic is

9
00:00:36,414 --> 00:00:40,780
responsible for arousing and parasympathetic is responsible for calming.

10
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,616
Remember, for example, when Susan encountered the bear in Yosemite? This

11
00:00:45,616 --> 00:00:49,234
resulted in activation of her sympathetic nervous system, which allowed for an

12
00:00:49,234 --> 00:00:52,798
increase in heart rate, which pumped more blood to the large muscle groups, and

13
00:00:52,798 --> 00:00:55,930
more oxygen was available so her muscles can function and react to the

14
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:02,169
dangerous situation she found herself in. In addition to the autonomic system,

15
00:01:02,169 --> 00:01:06,122
the endocrine system is important in our stress response because it consists of

16
00:01:06,122 --> 00:01:12,018
the major hormone-releasing glands that are active during our stress response.

17
00:01:12,018 --> 00:01:16,710
That's the Pituitary gland and the Adrenal glands.
