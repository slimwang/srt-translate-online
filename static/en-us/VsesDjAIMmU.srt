00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Thrun] The answer is surprisingly simple.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It is 0.01.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
How do I know this so fast?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Well, if you look at this Bayes network,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,000
both the sunniness and the question whether I got a raise impact my happiness.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But since I don't know anything about the happiness,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
there is no way that just the weather might implicate or impact whether I get a raise or not.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
In fact, it might be independently sunny, and I might independently get a raise at work.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There is no mechanism of which these 2 things would co-occur.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Therefore, the probability of a raise given that it's sunny

11
00:00:49,000 --> 99:59:59,999
is just the same as the probability of a raise given any weather, which is 0.01.
