1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We can solve this for instance by distinguishing between three different cases.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
First case, time is between 0 and 4 years, the output is 0.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Second case, the time is 6 years or greater. The output will be 0.8, the maximum sustainable yield.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Third case, we need a function to describe this line if the time is between 4 years and 6 years.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The slope of this line is 0.8 times the maximum sustainable yield

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
divided by this time span 6 years minus 4 years.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The slope is multiplied by t, but if we're just using this expression, this would be the result that we get.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
A line would intercept zero.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The trick is to subtract 4 years from that time, which would make it work.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We still have this expression still describes the line with the right slope, but if you plug in 4 years,

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
this coefficient times 0 and thus the result is 0 for 4 years.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
In the resulting diagram, you see how the growth of the population

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
softly bends down between 4 and 6 years,but we are not over fishing.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The implementation makes use of a factor to modify the maximum harvest rate

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
which is 0.8 times the maximum sustainable yield.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
If the time is larger than 6 years, we are using the factor of 1.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If the time is not larger than 6 ix years but it's larger than 4 years, we're using the linear ramp,

18
00:01:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and otherwise, we are using the factor of 0.
