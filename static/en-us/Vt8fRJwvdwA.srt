1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,150
All right. So let's put some of these rules into play

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,870
by actually doing some inference by hand. Ultimately, we're going to derive

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:07,520
some algorithms that can do this so you don't have to

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,330
think about it so hard. But understanding those algorithms, it's helpful to

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,430
have gone through an exercise where you actually use these ideas.

6
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:18,926
So here's a setup. Let's imagine that we've got two boxes. Onee

7
00:00:18,926 --> 00:00:21,146
has 4 balls in it and one has 5 balls in it.

8
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:25,290
And we're going to choose one of those boxes uniformly at random.

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,370
Either the box that we choose is equal to box 1,

10
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,190
or the box that we choose is equal to box 2.

11
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,246
And after that, we're going to draw at random, uniformly at

12
00:00:34,246 --> 00:00:38,224
random, from what's inside the box, one of the balls, and

13
00:00:38,224 --> 00:00:41,460
let's say it turns out to be green. All right. So

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,150
the draw that we make, we have a green ball. We

15
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,010
reach into that same box a second time, and the question

16
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,410
is, what's the probability that that second ball will be blue,

17
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,950
given that the first one we drew was green? So

18
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,160
let's, to make, maybe to help point out how this

19
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,430
is connected with Bayes net inference, Charles, why don't you

20
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,360
help me draw the Bayes net that corresponds to this problem.

21
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,470
>> Okay. So, if I think about it as

22
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,700
a process, which now means I'm, I'm thinking about this

23
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,940
as things causing the other, the first thing that

24
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,840
you did in the process is you picked the box.

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,480
>> Good. All right. So let's say, so the first variable in

26
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,170
the net is going to be the box variable.,

27
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,826
>> Right, and then once I had the box variable

28
00:01:19,826 --> 00:01:22,110
over there, I can then pick, the second thing in

29
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,120
the process is I pick a ball. So, in this

30
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,119
case you're calling it 1. So I make the first pick.

31
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,760
>> And is it, do we need an arrow there?

32
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,460
>> Yeah, because the, you pick the box and

33
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,110
then that let's you pick which ball that you have.

34
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,410
So, which ball you pick, the color of the

35
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:38,160
ball you pick, depends upon the box so to speak.

36
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,510
>> Good. And so, the probabilities here are

37
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,342
going to be, it's going to look like this.

38
00:01:42,342 --> 00:01:45,500
All right. So the second variable here is what, what

39
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,790
color ball you get when you do the first draw

40
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,130
from the box. Ad we can represent this as a

41
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,140
conditional probability table. So for box 1, it's three quarters

42
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,659
green, one quarter yellow or orange, zero for blue. And

43
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:00,771
for box 2, it's two fifths, zero, and three fifths.

44
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:03,330
And so that captures what happens on the first draw.

45
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,270
>> So for the second draw,

46
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,180
well, clearly, that sort of depends upon what you drew

47
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,008
the first time. Because you said we were drawing without

48
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:16,000
replacement. So it definitely depends upon what you, what you

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,868
drew the first time. But also, it still depends upon

50
00:02:18,868 --> 00:02:22,365
the box. Okay, so now we've got tables for a

51
00:02:22,365 --> 00:02:24,560
box, we've got tables for ball 1, and we need

52
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,570
to know what ball 2 is going to be. Well,

53
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,270
the value that ball 2 takes definitely depends upon whatever

54
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,980
value ball 1 takes.

55
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,765
>> Sure.

56
00:02:34,765 --> 00:02:37,330
>> But it also depends upon which box you're

57
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,420
in. So you need an arrow from there as well.

58
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,140
And what would be really nice is if we

59
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,280
were in the storm, lightening and thunder case where, if

60
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,610
I knew that it was, what ball 1 was,

61
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,670
I would know what ball 2 was, but that's not

62
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,010
true. Because in a case, for example, when ball

63
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,430
1 is green, it doesn't tell me what ball 2

64
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,380
is unless I also know which box I'm in. So,

65
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,220
we have to draw the arrow from box to ball 2.

66
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,916
>> Indeed. Right. And so there's a lot

67
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,302
of, a lot of probabilities that we have

68
00:03:05,302 --> 00:03:09,529
to write down. But lets, let's just write down a piece of that table. Let's say

69
00:03:09,529 --> 00:03:14,745
that the value of ball 2 depends on which box. And it depends on what

70
00:03:14,745 --> 00:03:19,844
ball 1 is. But let's just look at the piece of that table where ball 1 is green.

71
00:03:19,844 --> 00:03:20,192
>> hm.

72
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,532
>> because that's what we're

73
00:03:21,532 --> 00:03:25,095
ultimately going to need here. So now ball 2, in

74
00:03:25,095 --> 00:03:27,535
the case where we were drawing from box 1, that

75
00:03:27,535 --> 00:03:31,525
probably that's green. In the case were the first ball

76
00:03:31,525 --> 00:03:35,355
had been green, it leaves just 2 out of 3, right.

77
00:03:35,355 --> 00:03:35,855
>> hmm.

78
00:03:35,855 --> 00:03:41,109
>> And 1 out of 3 yellow and no blue. But on the other hand, had we drawn

79
00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:46,617
from box 2 first, and again, we had gotten green, now it's green one fourth,

80
00:03:46,617 --> 00:03:49,468
zero yellow, and blue three quarters.

81
00:03:49,468 --> 00:03:50,110
>> RIght.

82
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,930
>> And there's yeah, we need this same

83
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,780
thing where the other case, where ball 1 is

84
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,529
yellow and ball 1 is blue. But we are

85
00:03:56,529 --> 00:03:59,234
not going to need those numbers for this problem.

86
00:03:59,234 --> 00:03:59,717
>> Right.

87
00:03:59,717 --> 00:04:01,828
>> All right. So now that we have written it as

88
00:04:01,828 --> 00:04:04,384
a Bayes net, is that, is that helpful at all? So what

89
00:04:04,384 --> 00:04:07,740
we're, we haven't asked the question yet. So maybe it's time

90
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,490
to ask the question and then we could work on the answer.

91
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,150
>> Okay.

92
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,690
>> All right. The question

93
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,900
is, what's the probability that the second draw is

94
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,510
blue, given that the first draw had been green? Go.
