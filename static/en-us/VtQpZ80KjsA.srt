1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:01,339
All right.

2
00:00:01,339 --> 00:00:03,170
You're done.

3
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,310
Let's take a look at my solution.

4
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,120
First of all, you all added the support
annotations dependency, right?

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,210
Then we just created the constants,
added the location status interface and

6
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:18,520
annotated that interface with
the IntDef containing the constants.

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,830
Finally, we said retain it only for
our source code.
