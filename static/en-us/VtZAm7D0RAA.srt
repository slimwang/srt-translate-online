00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,410
Thanks for helping us out with our first
steps of marketing plan for Embarkment.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,790
Some of the things we considered for the
geographic segmentation, for example,

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,410
were neighborhood and
proximity to dog parks.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,290
So, we can tailor our solutions for
each neighborhood and

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,820
map other solutions available for
the dog owners there.

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,030
>> When thinking of
behavioral segmentation,

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,180
we came up with dividing families that
are going on a family vacation from

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,160
individuals going on business trips.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,920
This way the service they are looking
for might be different and so

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,310
do our messaging, and
the places we decide to advertise on.

11
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,380
But there is no right or wrong here.

12
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,550
You could go with demographic
segmentation, and

13
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,620
divide it based on demographic
characteristics of the dogs themselves.

14
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,075
Like big dog versus small dogs,
for example.

15
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:45,525
Or even psychographic segmentation of
the owners with different solutions that

16
00:00:45,525 --> 00:00:47,060
may be priced differently.

17
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,620
Like come and
get a deluxe service versus come and

18
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,070
be just another dog in our backyard.
