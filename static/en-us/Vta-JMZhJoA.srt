00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
Now, of course, the answers to these are a little bit subjective depending on what you want to model,

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,020
but I think that there are three components that are absolutely essential to keep.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,520
The first one is you need a memory for the computer because, otherwise,

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,920
it will not really be able to perform any computations.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,840
The second one is you need some sort of input and some sort of output.

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,270
It doesn't really have to be a graphical output or be displayed on the monitor,

7
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:30,650
but you need to be able to tell the computer what the input is that it's suppose to work on

8
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:35,570
and you need to have some way of reading the output once the computer is done.

9
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:41,330
And you'll also need some sort of flexibility in the processing that the computer is doing,

10
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,760
so we expect it to have certain programming capabilities.

11
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,180
All the other components I think are not essential, so you do not necessarily need a graphic's card

12
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,350
as long as you have a certain type of output.

13
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:56,740
You certainly don't need a mouse to input anything. You don't need a monitor.

14
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,470
You don't need a file system or operating system because if you really want that

15
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:04,610
you can emulate that using the programming capabilities and you certainly also

16
00:01:04,610 --> 99:59:59,999
do not need a CD-ROM as long as you have some way of providing the input.
