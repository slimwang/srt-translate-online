Vertex and fragment shaders give programmers a lot of power over the GPU.

00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,299
However, some elements of most GPUs have transistors dedicated to them. Check

3
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:11,631
the elements in the pipeline that are hardwired and not currently programmable,

4
00:00:11,631 --> 00:00:17,519
at least not to any great extent. What's available hardwired on the GPU? The

5
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:22,118
illumination model, vertex transformation, Z-buffer evaluation, image

6
00:00:22,118 --> 00:00:26,790
processing, such as color correction or edge detection, rasterization and

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:32,380
interpolation, clipping. All the hardwired elements don't necessarily have to

8
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:36,268
be used by the programmer. You should check off those capabilities that are

9
00:00:36,268 --> 00:00:37,190
available.
