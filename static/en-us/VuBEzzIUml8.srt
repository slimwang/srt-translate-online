1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,660
That was the first criterion adequacy. The second property three criterion is

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:10,890
totality. That is our implementation can't put us in a concrete state that

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:16,900
doesn't correspond to an abstract one. No memory fault core dump messages.

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,490
Memory fault core dump would be a concrete state. Okay? And

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,800
it doesn't correspond anything in our spec. And we want to prevent such

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,450
situations from arising. We call this criterion total or

7
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:34,250
totality because we must make sure that the retrieve function is total in

8
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,690
the mathematical sense. That it's defined at every point. Here is how this

9
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:44,358
property looks if we express it formally. For every concrete state t,

10
00:00:44,358 --> 00:00:50,074
if the invariants are true on t, then it had better be the case that there

11
00:00:50,074 --> 00:00:56,380
exists, some kind of abstract state s. That's the result of retrieving out of t.

12
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,910
And the invariants of the abstract invariants must hold on, on state s.
