00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,919
Our alpha level is our criterion for deciding whether or not something is

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:09,535
likely or unlikely. If the probability is less than alpha then it is considered

3
00:00:09,535 --> 00:00:14,711
unlikely. If a sample mean has a z score greater than z star this means the

4
00:00:14,711 --> 00:00:21,420
probability of selecting this sample mean is even smaller. Therefore, this

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,546
second is also true. If we consider sample means, with z-scores greater than

6
00:00:26,546 --> 00:00:30,490
z-star to be unlikely, then if it falls in the orange region it would be

7
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:37,230
considered likely, in this case. Therefore this third one is not true. And

8
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:42,450
finally, the alpha level is .05, which is 5% which corresponds to the green

9
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,213
region, not the orange.
