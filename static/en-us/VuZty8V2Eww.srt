1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,160
At this point, you should have
modified the submitOrder method and

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,140
also added the displayMessage
method within the main activity.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,300
Then you can hit run to
see it on your device.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,130
First, I'm going to change the Quantity,
and

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,130
then I'm going to hit the Order button.

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,800
Now the app says free for price.

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,760
That answers the first question.

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,340
When the ORDER button is clicked,
then the price text field now says Free.

9
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,990
For the second question we talked
about creating a string variable

10
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,950
in the submitOrder method.

11
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,710
Even though we haven't seen code for
a string variable before,

12
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,180
I ask you to guess what you think
the variable name and value would be.

13
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,230
The answer is that the variable name
is priceMessage, and the value is Free.

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,720
To arrive at these answers,

15
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,360
let's look more closely at how
we create string variables.
