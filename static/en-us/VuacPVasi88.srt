00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,304
For g of x equals the absolute value of x minus 3. We can write this in

2
00:00:05,304 --> 00:00:10,245
piecewise form as g of x equals negative x minus 3, for x is less than 0, this

3
00:00:10,245 --> 00:00:15,105
branch over here and g of x equals x minus 3 for x is greater than or equal to

4
00:00:15,105 --> 00:00:23,643
0. You can write f of x equals the absolute value of x minus 3. As f of x

5
00:00:23,643 --> 00:00:28,009
equals negative x plus 3 for X is less than 3, and x minus 3 for x is greater

6
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:31,203
than or equal to 3.
