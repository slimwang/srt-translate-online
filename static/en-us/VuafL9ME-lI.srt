00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,450
In the last quiz I asked you to
modify a bunch of things in your app.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,640
You may not have understood what
you were doing, but that's okay.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,430
We're going to talk about it now.

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,970
Specifically, we're going to talk
about resources in your app.

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,700
Resources live under the res
directory of your app.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,230
Res is short for resources.

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,960
On the other hand,
java files live in the java folder.

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,830
And we have MainActivity.java
located inside this folder.

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,970
An Android app is mainly made
of resources and java code.

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,860
The java code consists of
files like MainActivity.java.

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,900
Altogether it handles what should
happen when the app is running

12
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,939
like responding to button clicks or
other events.

13
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,920
Then you have resources that live
in the res directory of your app.

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,870
This includes images, text strings,
colors, dimensions, like for

15
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,150
width and height,
xml files like for menus and

16
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:56,740
layouts, as well as raw media
files like for audio or video.

17
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,660
One of the major advantages to
separating out the java code and

18
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:03,640
the resources is that we can
provide alternative resources

19
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,500
to make the app look
better on certain devices.

20
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,110
So if we want a different layout
on larger screen devices,

21
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,830
we can provide that by
just swapping it out.

22
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,220
Or, if we want to translate these
strings into another language,

23
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,940
then it makes it easier to swap out the
strings in just the centralized location

24
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,310
instead of having it scattered
all over the code files.
