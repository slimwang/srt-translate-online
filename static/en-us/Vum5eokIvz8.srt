00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,260
Let's do a quick exercise on this
high school linear programming.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,760
Here's the problem.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,039
A movie actor is
developing a workout plan.

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:13,040
He will burn 12 calories for
every minute of step aerobics he does,

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,600
and 4 calories for
every minute of stretching he does.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,250
The workout must include 5 minutes
of stretching for warmup and

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,820
cannot last more than 40 minutes total.

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,130
The actor wants to burn as
many calories as possible.

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,860
We'll let x be the minutes
spent on step-aerobics.

10
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,850
And we'll let y be the minutes
spent on stretching.

11
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:39,140
And I want you to express this actor's
problem as a linear program and

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,000
give the optimum values for
x and y here.
