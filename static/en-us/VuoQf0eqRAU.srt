00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,548
Right. Now, back to equations. I mentioned a moment ago that an equals sign

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,046
isn't enough for something to actually be a true equation. Which of these

00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:13,816
choices don't make sense, just aren't right from a mathematical point of view?

4
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:18,643
Remember, I want you to check off the ones that don't make sense, not the ones

5
00:00:18,655 --> 00:00:19,763
that do make sense.
