As you dream up your ideas, it is
important to be passionate about them.

00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,240
It is never a good idea to create
a startup just because you want to

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,510
create a startup.

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,300
Create a startup because you
want to solve a problem that

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,970
keeps you up at night.

6
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,720

from a good idea and

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,860

00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,210
Udacity does that by providing
an affordable on-demand

12
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,580
technical education for jobs.

13
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,370
Disrupt an industry.

14
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,440
