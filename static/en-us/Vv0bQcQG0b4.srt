You're on your way to getting
your product in front of users.

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,150
>> To prepare for the next lesson on
design sprints, let's take some time to

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:12,600
make sure you have some basics of user
experience and user interaction down.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,070
You'll hear from experts
about user experience and

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,000
see examples of what to do and
what to avoid.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,690
>> You will also learn
how user experience and

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:24,140
user interaction fits
into product development.

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,620
>> By the end of this lesson,
you'll have the background knowledge and

10
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,210
techniques to dream up flows and
features for your users.

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,010
>> Let's get started by hearing
from one of Google's experts.
