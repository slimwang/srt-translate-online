1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,150
So let's talk about measurements.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,820
What are the things that
start-ups should measure?

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,160
>> Such an important question.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,795
It's actually the first
conversations we have with

5
00:00:09,795 --> 00:00:12,460
start-ups when they
get into Y Combinator.

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,218
The first time we sit down with
them we say, what's your metric,

7
00:00:15,218 --> 00:00:18,626
because Y Combinator runs for
three months.

8
00:00:18,626 --> 00:00:22,020
They get in, it's really four months
from the time they get in, five months

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,960
from the time they get in but,
they have demo day at the end of that,

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,970
when they get up in front of a roomful
of very intelligent people, and

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,520
they show their progress.

12
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,040
And the more progress they can show,
honestly, the better that demo goes and

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,550
the better their follow
up conversations go.

14
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,740
So, you have to figure it out and
it's different for every company.

15
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,150
Now, there are variations on themes,
right?

16
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,600
There are basic themes
that everyone looks at.

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,670
If you're a company that
should be generating revenue,

18
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,380
your metric is probably revenue.

19
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,140
If you're a social product,
it's probably users or

20
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,810
some function of engagement.

21
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,190
If you are a transaction site, it's
probably something about the number of

22
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:01,440
transactions you do or the volume of
transactions, which by the way is

23
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,620
just a proxy for revenue, because
you probably would take a cut of it.

24
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,640
So it's particular to
different startups.

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,460
I think the critical thing is
to make sure it's the thing

26
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,500
that actually reflects whether or

27
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,640
not you're succeeding as a business,
and not what we call vanity metrics.

28
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,710
>> And what's the hard part about
setting the metrics and measuring them?

29
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,650
>> Everything.

30
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,120
Right, so I think on one
level it's hard to choose.

31
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,410
You start out as a company and
you think to yourself, oh,

32
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,650
there's all these different things
I want to accomplish, right?

33
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,400
I want to hire people,
I want to raise money.

34
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,670
Raising money, by the way, probably
the biggest vanity metric of all.

35
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,430
Basically meaningless for
the success of your company,

36
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,305
except that it gives you money
to achieve the metrics you need.

37
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:47,990
So, you think that, you think that,
you want a lot of people,

38
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,170
you want a lot of press,
you want all these things,

39
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:54,860
and they all feel good, but they don't
necessarily matter to your business.

40
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,400
So that's the first part.

41
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,450
Ignoring all that vanity is hard.

42
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,830
The hardest part, though, is once you
pick a metric, being honest about it and

43
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:09,370
sticking to it, and
setting time frames for

44
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,230
success and for
progress that you actually stick to.

45
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:16,200
So, we tell companies that during
Y Combinator they should grow

46
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,240
whatever their metric is between 5 and
10% a week.

47
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,910
We try to say go for 7% a week.

48
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,580
If you do more, great.

49
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,080
If not, not.

50
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,030
And that's great for consumer companies.

51
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,830
And if they're sticking to that,
the thing that happens,

52
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,690
and this is something
that people miss a lot.

53
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,220
They say, oh,
all you care about is growth.

54
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,470
But, growth isn't
a one-dimensional thing, right?

55
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,930
Growth is a function of the fact that
you've done everything else properly.

56
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,130
You built a product that people want,
you got it into their hands,

57
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,320
you supported it, it continues to
be something that they want to use.

58
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,140
That's what leads to growth.

59
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,690
So you can't, you can't isolate it.

60
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,040
And if you miss it, that's when it gets
hard, because then you have to be honest

61
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,730
with yourself about why you missed
that goal, why you missed you metric.

62
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,170
And that will make you
fix your business.
