One really awesome take away message about facial expressions is that they

2
00:00:04,184 --> 00:00:09,450
don't only express emotions, they can actually amplify and regulate emotions.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,246
This is through what's called the facial feedback effect. This is the tendency

4
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:17,074
for facial expressions and the muscle activations that cause them to actually

5
00:00:17,074 --> 00:00:22,332
produce a corresponding feeling, such as happiness or anger. Now, I want you to

6
00:00:22,332 --> 00:00:27,465
try something. Grab a pen. If you don't have one, press pause and get one. And

7
00:00:27,465 --> 00:00:31,668
take this pen and put it between your teeth, like this. Doing this activates

8
00:00:31,668 --> 00:00:37,090
the muscles that make you smile. Then, I want you to grab the pen again and

9
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:43,944
hold it between your lips, like this. Doing that activates the muscles that

10
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:49,322
make you frown. If I had you watch a video with a pen between your teeth like

11
00:00:49,322 --> 00:00:53,418
this to activate a smile, and then watch another video with a pen between your

12
00:00:53,418 --> 00:00:57,514
teeth like this to make you frown, do you think that would actually affect how

13
00:00:57,514 --> 00:01:04,060
amusing you thought the video was. Yes or no.
