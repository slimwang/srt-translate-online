00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,070
The fundamental design goal of the internet

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:07,360
was multiplexed utilization of existing interconnected networks.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,850
There are two important aspects to this

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,490
goal. One is multiplexing or sharing. So one

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,910
of the fundamental challenges that the internet

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,670
technologies needed to solve was the shared

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,310
use of a single communications channel. The

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,840
second major part of this fundamental goal is

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,200
the interconnection of existing networks. These

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,080
two subproblems had two very important solutions.

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,060
Statistical multiplexing or packet switching was

12
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,330
invented to solve the sharing problem. And,

13
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,170
the narrow waist was designed to

14
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,470
solve the problem of interconnecting networks. Let's

15
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:49,520
talk about each of these now. In turn. We'll first talk about packet switching
