00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,645
By this point, you've had a bunch of practice with combining like terms. So,

2
00:00:04,657 --> 00:00:09,430
let's go back to that problem we were doing with Grant and his glasses wipers

3
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:14,500
and nozzles. Here's the equation we had. a, the total amount of money he's going

4
00:00:14,512 --> 00:00:19,631
to earn from his friends buying his products is equal to 36w plus 51w plus 22 n

5
00:00:19,643 --> 00:00:24,161
plus 50 n. Last time you saw this, we didn't know how to combine like terms.

6
00:00:24,266 --> 00:00:28,716
But, now you do. So, in this box, I would like you to type the most simplified

7
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:33,672
version of this entire equation that you can come up with. Remember, I'm looking

8
00:00:33,684 --> 00:00:38,288
for the whole equation, not just this expression. You need to include the a

9
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,274
equals in the equation down here.
