00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,032
We know the lowest common denominator is helpful whenever we want to solve this

2
00:00:04,032 --> 00:00:08,282
type of equation. So in order to solve this equation we're actually going to use

3
00:00:08,282 --> 00:00:12,656
the LCD. We're going to multiply every term in the equation by the lowest common

4
00:00:12,656 --> 00:00:17,722
denominator to simplify the equation. So let's start by figuring out the LCD.

5
00:00:17,722 --> 00:00:19,353
What is it for this equation?
