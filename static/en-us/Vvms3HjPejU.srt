1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,961
For any of these points I'm going to start at the origin, count over in either

2
00:00:04,973 --> 00:00:10,163
direction, as many slots as I need to horizontally. And then, count either up or

3
00:00:10,175 --> 00:00:14,886
down. So it's going to give me first the x value, and then the y value of that

4
00:00:14,898 --> 00:00:21,323
point. So for point a, I need to count over 1, 2, 3, 4. I can see that this is

5
00:00:21,335 --> 00:00:27,019
the vertical line that a lies on, and then I need to come up this line toward a,

6
00:00:27,142 --> 00:00:32,782
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So a must be the point for 7. I can do the same thing for

7
00:00:32,794 --> 00:00:39,488
b, starting at the origin. I count in the negative direction, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 6.

8
00:00:39,898 --> 00:00:45,979
So my x coordinate is negative 6. And then from there, I count up to b, 1, 2, 3,

9
00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:52,880
4, 5. For point c, once again the x value is negative, since it's to the left of

10
00:00:52,892 --> 00:00:59,726
the origin, 1, 2, 3, 4. So negative 4. And then c has a negative y value, since

11
00:00:59,738 --> 00:01:05,808
it's below the x axis. So from here I need to count down negative 1, negative 2,

12
00:01:05,934 --> 00:01:12,104
negative 3, negative 4. And last but not least, d has a positive x value, 1, 2,

13
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:19,127
3, 4, 5, 6, and a negative y value, negative 1, 2. So it's the point 6, negative

14
00:01:19,139 --> 00:01:19,265
2.
