1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,090
So, what did you get?

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:03,600
I got 5.5 years.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,060
Here's my reasoning.

4
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,070
Let t denote time, measured in years.

5
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,690
Now R we said doubled every 1.9 years.

6
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:16,796
Mathematically, that means R is
proportional to 2 to the t/1.9.

7
00:00:16,796 --> 00:00:18,062
Beta is similar.

8
00:00:18,062 --> 00:00:21,500
It's 2 to the t/2.9.

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,560
The balance point is just
the ratio of these quantities.

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,750
Simplifying it, you should get
roughly 2 to the t divided by 5.5.

11
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,250
The doubling time is there for
5.5 years.

12
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,450
Now you might be suspicious.

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,820
This is just a quiz, right?

14
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,660
Or is this a real life trend?

15
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,450
Well, let's check it on Wikipedia,
purveyor of all things good and

16
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,520
definitely 100% true
with no questions asked.

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,120
Here's some stats on two
mobile GPU processors.

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,791
The top one was launched in June 2008,
and the bottom one in March 2015.

19
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:54,751
That's a period of
time of almost 7 years.

20
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:57,990
Let's call it 6.75 just to be
a little bit more precise.

21
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,958
Now, the balance point is supposed
to double every 5.5 years.

22
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:05,750
So, after 6.75 years you would
expect the balance point to

23
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,834
increase by a factor of roughly 2.34.

24
00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:13,240
Now, what I've been calling beta is
given by these bandwidth parameters.

25
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,640
R is given by the peak
processing power parameters.

26
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,350
Those are these two.

27
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,710
So, are these data consistent
with the predicted rate of change

28
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,430
in the balance point?
