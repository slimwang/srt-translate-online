00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,900
Setting up a local development
environment for Ruby is hard.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,460
It's one of the biggest barriers for
people just starting out to code.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,070
They often think if I
can't even set this up,

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,640
how can I possibly become a developer.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,059
The reality is setting up an environment
has very little to do with your

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,700
ability to code.

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,510
It's just a painful process that
everyone has to go through at least once

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,410
and setting it up on Windows
makes it even harder.

9
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,900
One thing is Ruby development is very
heavily focused on the command line.

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,600
And the Windows command line is
very different than the ones in

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,230
Unix based systems like Mac or Linux.

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,460
Here's what using the Windows
command prompt looks like.

13
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,480
And here's the Unix command line.

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,490
Even if the prompts and
output looks similar to you,

15
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,390
the commands are different.

16
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,900
And this could confuse
you in the long run.

17
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,560
Issues with software compatibility,
speed, and available support for

18
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,590
Windows users are also
factors to consider.

19
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,490
This does not mean that it's impossible
to work in Windows as a Ruby Developer,

20
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,770
but we want you to have a development
environment that allows you to focus on

21
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:00,920
learning Ruby.

22
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,940
Not undebugging Windows.

23
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,930
You don't need to go out and
buy a new computer for this program.

24
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,540
In this lesson,
you'll set up a virtual machine or v.m..

25
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,820
That will allow you to run an operating
system different than the one currently

26
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:14,720
installed on your computer.

27
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,290
This means you will be able to
follow along with the lessons.

28
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,420
As if you were on a UNIX computer,
like Linux or Mac.

29
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,130
Here are two ways you might use a VM.

30
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,510
Some VMs are like having another
desktop computer inside your computer.

31
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:32,770
You can interact with the VM through
its graphical user interface

32
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,190
by opening windows and clicking buttons.

33
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,970
The same way you would interact
with your regular computer.

34
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,640
Some VMs, like the one you'll
set up in this lesson,

35
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,840
only allow you to interact with
the computer through the command line.

36
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,249
These are called shell VMs.

37
00:01:45,249 --> 00:01:48,924
In this lesson you will set up a Linux
shell VM that you'll be able to use for

38
00:01:48,924 --> 00:01:51,680
the rest of this Nano degree program.

39
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,870
Using the Windows command prompt,

40
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:56,400
you will be able to start up your
VM with a simple command and

41
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,680
run all your Ruby files through the VM
as if you had a Linux computer.
