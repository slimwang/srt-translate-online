1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,070
Two basic principles
provide the fundamental

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,040
theory behind the cloud
computing approach.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,620
The first is the so-called
Law of Large Numbers.

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:14,180
This says that once you start
considering many customers

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,130
who's resources may vary over time,

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,900
the average across all of them
will tend to be fairly constant.

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,990
That's why a cloud
computing provider can pick

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,760
any amount of resources in capacity for
the cloud.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,420
And with that capacity,
can service lots of customers,

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,670
whose peaks in the expected
demand are shifted in time.

11
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,850
Second, there is the Principle
of Economies of Scale.

12
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,950
Essentially, things
are cheaper by the dozen.

13
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,700
When you start considering how many
different customers a cloud provider is

14
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:54,210
able to leverage on a single
physical piece of hardware resource.

15
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,460
The cost of that hardware
resource ends up being amortized.

16
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,610
And ends up being an offset
by all of the fees

17
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,590
that the cloud provider is able
to gather from its customers.
