1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,680
Alright. Well we'd like to try to get an

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,430
understanding of how powerful one of these perceptron units are.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,070
So, what is it that they actually do? So

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,660
they, they return, in this case either 0 or 1

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,870
as a function of a bunch of inputs. So

6
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,900
let's just for simplicity of visualization, let's just imagine that

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,840
we've got 2 inputs, X1 and X2. So Charles,

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,760
how could we represent the region in this input space

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,700
that is going to get an output of 0

10
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,690
versus the region that's going to get an output of 1.

11
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:30,580
>> Order the weights.

12
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,460
>> Right. So indeed, the weights matter. So

13
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,670
let's, let's give some concrete values to these weights.

14
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:40,130
And let's just say, just making these up that weight 1 is a half, weight 2 is a

15
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,910
half, and our threshold data is three quarters. So

16
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,750
now what we want to do is again, break

17
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,770
up this, this space into where's it going to

18
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,920
return 1 and where's it going to return 0.

19
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,640
>> Okay, so I think I know how to figure this out. So, there's kind of

20
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,790
an, there's 2 sort of extreme examples, so let's take a case where X1 is 0.

21
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:05,351
>> X1 is 0. Okay, good. So that's this Y axis, uh-huh.

22
00:01:05,351 --> 00:01:09,240
>> Alright. So if X1 is 0, what value would X2 have to be in

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,550
order to break a threshold of three quarters? Well, the weight on X2 is a half.

24
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,130
>> Mm-hm.

25
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,220
>> So then,

26
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,090
the value of X2 would have to be twice as much

27
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,780
as the threshold which in this case is one and a half.

28
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,220
>> Right. So we're trying to figure out where is it, if X1 is 0, where

29
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,730
does X2 need to be so that we're

30
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,880
exactly at the threshold. So that's going to be.

31
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,750
>> Right.

32
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,028
>> The X2 times the weight, which is half has to exactly equal the threshold

33
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:41,885
which is three quarters. So, if we just solve that out, you get X2 equals

34
00:01:41,885 --> 00:01:45,580
3 halves. So okay that's this point here. That's going to be

35
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,360
a dividing line. So anywhere above here, what's it going to return?

36
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,310
>> It will return, it will break the threshold, and so it will return a 1.

37
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,030
>> These are all going to be 1s and

38
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:58,225
then below this these are all going to be 0s.

39
00:01:58,225 --> 00:01:58,780
>> Right.

40
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,280
>> Alright. Well now we have a very, very skinny

41
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,140
version of the picture. [LAUGH] Well what else can we do?

42
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,180
>> Well we can do the same thing that we just did except we can swap

43
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,787
X2 and X1 because, they have the same weight. So, we could say X2

44
00:02:10,787 --> 00:02:14,910
equal to 0 and figure out what the value of X1 has to be.

45
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,670
>> Good, and that seems like it would be exactly the same algebra, and so

46
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,130
we get X1 is 3 halves, gives us at the one and a half point

47
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:26,100
above here are going to be 1s and below here are going to be 0s. Okay, so now

48
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:32,410
we've got 2 very narrow windows, but what we notice is that the relationships

49
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:37,330
are all linear here. So solving this linear inequality gets us a picture like

50
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:43,190
this. So this perceptron computes a kind of half plane right? So, so the half of

51
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,510
the, the plane that's above this line, the half plane thatt's above this line is

52
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:51,530
getting us the 1 answers and below that line is giving us a zero answers.

53
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,420
>> So Michael can we generalize from this, so

54
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,560
you're telling me then that because of the linear relationship

55
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,490
drawn out by a perceptron that perceptrons are always going to compute lines.

56
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,540
>> Yeah. Always going to compute, yeah

57
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,500
these half planes right. So there's a dividing

58
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,270
line where you're equal to the threshold and

59
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,520
that's always going to be a linear function

60
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,390
and then it's going to be you know, to the right of it or to

61
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:18,620
the left of it, above it or below it but its always halves at that point.

62
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,172
>> Okay, so perception is a linear function, and it computes hyperplanes.

63
00:03:22,172 --> 00:03:23,590
>> Yeah, which maybe in

64
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,500
some sense it doesn't seem that interesting, but it turns out we're

65
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,490
already in a position to compute something fascinating. So let's do a quiz.
