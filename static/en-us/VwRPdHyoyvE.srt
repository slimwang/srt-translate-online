00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,910
Remember your boss in Toy City Part One?

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,240
Well they loved your sales report so

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,490
much they decided to surprise you
with an extra fun, special request.

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,950
Your boss thinks they might
be able to save Toy City

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,170
if they can convince investors
to invest in the company.

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,040
They've asked you to print
the sales report to a file so

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,990
they can easily share
the reports with investors.

8
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,410
Your boss was also wondering if you
could somehow package up the code.

9
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,870
So they can re-use pieces of
it in future sales reports.

10
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,630
In this lesson, you're going to
use the new skills you've learned

11
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,640
to re-factor your code
from Toy City Part One.

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,010
You'll then restructure your
code using methods, and

13
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,710
output your reports to a file,
instead of just the command line.

14
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,520
You'll also start using Get to
track your changes that you make to

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,940
the project files.

16
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:43,780
All right, let's get started.
