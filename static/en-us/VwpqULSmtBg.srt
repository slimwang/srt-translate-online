1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,790
Now, before the end of this unit, two words of caution.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:08,390
The first one is that the border between NP completeness and polynomial time

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,660
can sometimes be very thin.

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,200
I already mentioned to you that for example 3-SAT,

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,580
so where you just have three variables in each clause is NP complete

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:23,960
but 2-SAT where you just have two variables is solvable in polynomial time

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,890
and there are many other cases like that

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,510
but of course this is good news

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,250
because if your problem turns out to be just as hard to solve as 2-SAT

10
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,240
you actually have a polynomial time algorithm for it

11
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,310
although it might initially have seemed a bit harder

12
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:42,800
or sometimes even if your original problem possibly is as hard as 3-SAT

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,400
maybe you can look at a slightly different problem that becomes polynomial time solvable.

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,260
Because oftentimes there are many different ways to frame

15
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,750
the practical problem that you're trying to solve

16
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,570
so sometimes you're lucky there.

17
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,420
The second thing is an actual word of caution.

18
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,430
Because this border here can sometimes be so fragile.

19
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:04,840
It's very important to be precised in your NP-completeness proof.

20
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,000
Because sometimes making just a little mistake in an NP-completeness proof

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,390
can invalidate this whole proof and of course we don't want that.

22
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,780
Now, it's time once more to congratulate you.

23
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,060
You now know what NP completeness means and how you control NP completeness.

24
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,340
And actually not many people can do that.

25
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,010
Very few people know precisely what NP completeness means

26
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,390
and also they're not capable of showing NP completeness.

27
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:33,340
In the next unit, we're going to take you even one step further.

28
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:38,110
We're going to show you countermeasures against NP completeness.

29
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,600
Because even most people that understand what NP completeness means

30
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,900
and that can also show NP completeness actually tend to give up

31
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,090
once they've shown their problem to be NP complete.

32
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,150
But that's actually not necessary because there are many many techniques

33
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:55,660
that she can use to attack even NP complete problems.

34
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:01,220
What should you do when you want to solve the problem and show that is NP complete?

35
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,710
Should you carefully check your proof?

36
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,790
Should you have somebody else carefully check your proof?

37
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,150
Should you give up?

38
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:13,360
Should you maybe try to think about ways of modifying your problem

39
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,900
so that it could not be NP-complete or

40
00:02:15,900 --> 99:59:59,999
should you try to use the techniques that you're about to learn in the next units of this course.
