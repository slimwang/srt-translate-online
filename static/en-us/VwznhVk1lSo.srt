1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We are now two steps away from the confidence interval. We're almost there.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The first thing we do is we go back from the quadratic expression

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
down to the non-quadratic expression--the standard deviation that corresponds to the variance over here.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You're ready now to compute this. Just give me those three values over here.
