1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,900
Now that we have a blank canvas, we
can insert SVG elements, like circles,

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,520
to start drawing.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,180
In order to be able to add any SVG
element, such as circles or rectangles,

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:16,300
we need to first insert a top-level,
generic SVG element.

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,180
Let's select the main content area
by using our select method, and

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,990
then with this selection,
we can append an SVG element and

7
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,820
store the SVG element into
a variable called SVG.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,700
Notice that this blank SVG canvas
gets inserted into the DOM, and

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,950
this is what we'll use to insert points,
lines, and bars, or

10
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,490
any other graphical shapes that we want.

11
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,300
Now, hovering over this element, we can
see that Chrome indicates that we have

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,410
an SVG canvas that's 300 pixels wide and
150 pixels tall.

13
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,910
It looks like nothing is
displayed on the page, but

14
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:54,620
by default, SVG elements don't
have any visual representation.

15
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,480
Well, let's make our SVG element,

16
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,150
which will be our plotting region,
a little bit larger.

17
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,105
To do that, I'll change the width and
the height attributes.

18
00:01:02,105 --> 00:01:04,670
I'll set the width to 600 pixels, and

19
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,080
I'll set the height to 300 pixels,
and there we go.

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,660
We have a place to
start making our chart.
