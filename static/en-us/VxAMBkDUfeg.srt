00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We now talk about spectral clustering.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The fundamental idea of spectral clustering

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
is to cluster by affinity.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And to understand the importance of spectral clustering,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
let me ask you a simple intuitive quiz.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Suppose you are given data like this,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and you wish to learn that there's 2 clusters--

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
a cluster over here and a cluster over here.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So my question is, from what you understand,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
do you think that "EM" or "K" means

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
we would do a great job finding those clusters

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
or do you think they will likely fail to find those clusters?

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So what were the questions--Do "EM" or "K"

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
mean succeed in finding the 2 clusters?

15
00:00:40,000 --> 99:59:59,999
There is a likely yes and a likely no.
