1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,950
It's called an inception module.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,470
It's going to look
a little more complicated.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,530
And you can skip this
section if you'd like.

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,550
It's not essential to
the rest of the lecture.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,960
The idea is that at each layer of
your convnets you can make a choice.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,748
Have a pooling operation,
have a convolution.

7
00:00:18,748 --> 00:00:25,050
Then you need to decide is it a 1 by 1
convolution, or a 3 by 3, or a 5 by 5?

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,280
All of these are actually beneficial
to the modeling power of your network.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,400
So why choose?

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,140
Let's use them all.

11
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,560
Here's what an inception
module looks like.

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,458
Instead of having a single convolution,

13
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:41,926
you have a composition of average
pooling followed by a 1 by 1,

14
00:00:41,926 --> 00:00:46,418
then a 1 by 1 convolution,
then a 1 by 1 followed by a 3 by 3.

15
00:00:46,418 --> 00:00:48,998
Then a 1 by 1 followed by a 5 by 5.

16
00:00:48,998 --> 00:00:52,840
And at the top, you simply concatenate
the output of each of them.

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,530
It looks complicated, but

18
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,570
what's interesting is that you can
choose these parameters in such a way

19
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:02,320
that the total number of parameters
in your model is very small.

20
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,630
Yet the model performs better than
if you had a simple convolution.
