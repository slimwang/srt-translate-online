00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,660
Guesses.

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:05,910
Further explore this idea of ethics and
laws that we covered before.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,840
Let's look at this question.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,350
And this perhaps has happened to you,
and happened to others.

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,900
Let's say due to an error or

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,280
mistake, somebody sends you
sensitive data in an email.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,200
They just put the wrong attachment.

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,890
They were trying to send you one thing
and end up sending something else.

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,520
Well this is sensitive information
that is arrived at your desk, or

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,770
your desktop, should you read it.

11
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:33,430
First of all, if you were to read it,
you obviously didn't go into

12
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:38,220
the computer, and didn't do unauthorized
access that's been sent to you.

13
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:43,050
So, the two options we have here, should
you decide to read, or not read it.

14
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,160
And if you decide not to read it,

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,860
what's the reason why you think
you should make that choice?

16
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,330
So pick the right option,
and we'll talk about it.
