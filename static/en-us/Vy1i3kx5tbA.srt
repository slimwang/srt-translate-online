1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,890
When hiring new employees especially the
very first few, you want an employees

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,270
that fundamentally believe in the vision
and the mission of the company.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:15,230
Because that will dictate
the culture going forward, you want

4
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:19,210
the first few employees to really set
the tone for everyone that comes after.

5
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,490
So whatever environment, whatever
culture you're trying to instill.

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,070
Those early employees will
help you determine that.

7
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,260
So, if your company's such that work
life balance is very important and

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,540
you work 9 to 6 very hard and

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,660
then everybody goes home, find
employees that are aligned with that.

10
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,580
If your company culture is different,

11
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,520
find employees that aligned with
whatever vision you have for

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:48,470
your company because that will clearly
determine a lot on future hires and

13
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,050
the tone of the business and
your style of going forward.
