1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,670
For digital health data
to help coordinate care,

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:08,109
in our highly specialized and
fragmented system, it must be shared.

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,800
To support population health management,
public health, and

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,230
research, it must be aggregated for
analysis.

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,570
Whenever it is moving, there
are inevitable concerns about respecting

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,423
the patient's privacy preferences,
securing it from unauthorized

7
00:00:26,423 --> 00:00:31,200
disclosure, and knowing that
the persons or entities who send it and

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,070
with whom it is being shared,
are who they claimed to be.

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,210
In this lesson, we've gained a basic
understanding of the technologies and

10
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:45,210
policies required to achieve all
three of these important objectives.

11
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,030
We've not yet dealt with a question
that is increasingly being asked.

12
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,660
Have we gone too far with this?

13
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:56,390
Are the complexities we've created
in the interest of privacy security,

14
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:01,380
and trust now standing in the way
of other important objectives?

15
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,930
For that we talk with Don Detmer,

16
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,390
one of the best known people in
health informatics, and a member of

17
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:11,800
the committee that wrote the landmark
IOM report, we discussed in lesson one.
