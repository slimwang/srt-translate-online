00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,070
Here is Marla,
we already know her story.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,290
Many chronic diseases leading
to many medications and

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,180
many encounters with
the healthcare system.

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,260
As a result,
her chart is large and complex.

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,990
And should she visit her PCP,
if she had one, they would need a quick

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,020
overview of it to adequately plan
the visit and her comprehensive care.

7
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:28,190
Her friend Doris on the left
works out regularly and

8
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,410
rarely goes to her physician.

9
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,040
Today she's visiting because
she overdid things a bit and

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,170
sprained her right knee.

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:40,460
Doris' chart is thin, and there's
really not much else for her PCP to be

12
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,910
concerned with, other than any routine
preventive care that might be due.
