1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,670
Okay, let's look at each of these.

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:05,360
So here we have our type, and here we
have our name, but we don't put a space,

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,860
we put a dash here.

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:07,590
And honestly,

5
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:12,060
that's really no different than just
writing something like, stringname.

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,340
Java won't be able to see
these as separate words, and

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,120
will cause an error because it thinks
you're trying to declare a variable

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,780
without giving it a type.

9
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,778
Oops, and apparently we also forgot
a semicolon, that's no good.

10
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:23,169
So this has a lot of problems.

11
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,830
Okay, let's look at the next one.

12
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,920
String is a correct data type,
so that's all good.

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,020
But over here, the variable name.

14
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,310
We're breaking our variable naming rule.

15
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:36,310
Variable names really can't contain
miscellaneous punctuation like these

16
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,418
quotes, here.

17
00:00:37,418 --> 00:00:39,150
Whoever's just declared this variable,

18
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,650
might be confusing the variable
name which is just a typed word,

19
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:46,680
with the value which is a string and
must be surrounded by quotes.

20
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,940
So, variable names can't have
weird punctuation in them.

21
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,515
Strings require you to
surround them by quotes.

22
00:00:52,515 --> 00:00:54,440
Okay, on this last one,
the data type looks correct.

23
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,000
And now we have name on profile.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,790
Well, this is actually breaking
one of the variable naming rules,

25
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:04,200
which is in your variable
name you can't have spaces.

26
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,070
Java's basically going to see
the word name and expect to have

27
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,370
some sort of initialization off of it,
or semi-colon, or something.

28
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,460
It won't expect for the name to
continue after there's a space.

29
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,810
So how do we solve this?

30
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,400
Well, usually if we want a name like
this we'd just write it in camel case.

31
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,590
So you could write something out
like name on profile with the O and

32
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,530
P being capitalized and
no spaces in between.

33
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,780
And this is a great variable name,

34
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,059
especially if you want to be able
to include all of these words.
