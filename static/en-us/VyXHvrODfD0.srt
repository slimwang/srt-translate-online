1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,640
Now we're going to set up our development environment. To

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,230
get ready, you're going to need to install some things

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,010
if you don't already have them installed. The first thing

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:13,406
you're going to need is Java. And you're going to need the

5
00:00:13,406 --> 00:00:17,416
JDK 1.7, also known as Java 7. You probably already

6
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:19,712
have it on your computer, but if you don't, you're

7
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:22,610
going to need to download that now. And then the next

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,427
thing you're going to need is Apache Maven. And then you're

9
00:00:25,427 --> 00:00:27,715
also going to want to use Eclipse. You don't have

10
00:00:27,715 --> 00:00:30,625
to use Eclipse when you're using Maven projects, but

11
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:33,800
we strongly recommend it. And during this course, all

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,910
the instructions are going to assume you are using Eclipse.

13
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:41,440
Also recommend that you get Eclipse EE, because it

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,845
comes with built in support for Maven. If you

15
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:48,030
already have standard Eclipse installed, you can add the

16
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,644
Maven m2e plugin to it. But really I think

17
00:00:50,644 --> 00:00:53,393
you're going to have a much better experience if you

18
00:00:53,393 --> 00:00:56,130
just use Eclipse EE. Some of the things in the

19
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,665
Maven plugin for Eclipse don't quite work right. Now

20
00:00:59,665 --> 00:01:01,755
one thing you don't have to install is the App

21
00:01:01,755 --> 00:01:04,553
Engine SDK. And this is because when you have

22
00:01:04,553 --> 00:01:09,334
Maven projects, you specify all the dependencies in a configuration

23
00:01:09,334 --> 00:01:13,040
file called pom.xml. And it's in this pom.xml where you're

24
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,690
going to specify the version of App Engine SDK that you

25
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,050
want and then Maven will just download the App Engine

26
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,830
SDK for you. So if you need help installing any

27
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,520
of these components, we've written a document for you to

28
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,950
help guide you through installing them. And you can find

29
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,020
a link to that document in the instructor notes for

30
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,280
this lesson. So go ahead and install each of these.

31
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,348
And when you've done it, go ahead and check the

32
00:01:34,348 --> 00:01:37,810
box here, so that we know you're ready to continue.
