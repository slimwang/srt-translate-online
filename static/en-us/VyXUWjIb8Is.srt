1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,870
In this class we'll build a Pitch
Perfect App which lets you record

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,450
your voice and
play it back with changes to the pitch.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,860
This lesson is an introduction
to where we explore and

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,000
get comfortable with Xcode,
Apple's development environment.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,600
You can use Xcode to create apps for
any of Apple's platforms.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,630
From the watch to AppleTV To iOS and
even the Mac.

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,610
This lesson is all about
getting comfortable with Xcode.

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,870
In Lesson 2 we'll set up
the basic structure of the app,

9
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:33,120
learning how to connect UI elements,
such as buttons, to our code.

10
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,930
In Lesson 3 we're going to step it
up a notch, add multiple views to

11
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,920
the Pitch Perfect app, as well as
adding the code to record audio.

12
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,730
Towards the end, in lessons 4 and
5 you'll learn how to play back your

13
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,510
own voice with the pitch perfect app
with various alterations to the pitch.

14
00:00:50,525 --> 00:00:53,380
You'll also learn how to deploy
pitch perfect on your iOS device.

15
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,320
As you progress this course,
we'll be introducing the Swift And

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,590
iOS concepts you need to know
in order to build pitch perfect.

17
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:07,121
After that in UIkit fundamentals will go
into much further depth in both swift,

18
00:01:07,121 --> 00:01:07,786
and iOS.

19
00:01:07,786 --> 00:01:10,191

to download Xcode and

20
00:01:10,191 --> 00:01:12,540
begin your adventure in iOS development.
