1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,670
So, to start answering our question of who has more

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,960
friends, men or women, on average, let's take our histogram

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,730
and split it up into two histograms for males and

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,640
females. We do this by adding a facet wrap as another

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,380
layer. This time, our facet wrap is going to take

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,240
a formula where we have the tilde sign and then

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,480
gender as our splitting variable, and when we run this

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,480
code as you might find out, we get something quite unexpected.

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,570
We don't just have two histograms, we have three.

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,940
One for females, one for males, and one for NA.
