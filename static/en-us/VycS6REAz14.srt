When we see a fractional exponent, we want to think about power divided by

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:08,194
root. The numerator is the power of our base, and the denominator indicates the

3
00:00:08,194 --> 00:00:13,612
root we're taking, a square root here. For the second example, we'll still have

4
00:00:13,612 --> 00:00:18,662
a power of 1 here, and then 3 as the root, the cubed root. Let's see if you can

5
00:00:18,662 --> 00:00:22,123
put this knowledge of fractional exponents to use.
