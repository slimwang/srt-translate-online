1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,880
All right, so our goal is going to be to
try to create learning algorithms that

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,580
are not quite as smart as you were in
that example, but trying to approximate

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:12,916
that, getting as far along the rock to
Charles continuum as we possibly can.

4
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:16,890
>> [LAUGH] Okay, we want algorithms
that are Charles complete.

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,959
>> No, I think you're probably still
going to beat the algorithms that we're

6
00:00:21,959 --> 00:00:23,001
going to talk about in this class.

7
00:00:23,001 --> 00:00:25,719
Someday, someday.

8
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:30,179
All right, so the important thing
is that we have to figure out,

9
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:32,834
what it is that we are trying to learn?

10
00:00:32,834 --> 00:00:35,778
So in this case what we're trying to
learn is a behavior, we're trying to

11
00:00:35,778 --> 00:00:38,872
learn the way of interacting with the
environment that obtains high reward.

12
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:42,165
And it turns out that there's different
ways to think about this depending on

13
00:00:42,165 --> 00:00:44,530
what kind of behavior
you are looking for.

14
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,340
So one classical kind of behavior

15
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,070
that is very common in the AI
literature is the notion of a plan.

16
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,460
So plan usually refers to
a fixed sequence of actions.

17
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,230
So the kind of thing that says,
okay I see where I am now,

18
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,920
this is the sequence of
things I'm going to do.

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,814
I'm going to go left, right, up, up, up,
down, pick up, left, left, down, down,

20
00:01:02,814 --> 00:01:04,248
down, down, down, drop off.

21
00:01:04,248 --> 00:01:04,885
Something like that.

22
00:01:04,885 --> 00:01:09,710
So that plan, once you've chosen
the plan, you can just execute it.

23
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,500
It's just that fixed
sequence of actions.

24
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,530
And this happens sometimes in real life,

25
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,040
there's certain kinds of
behaviors that we just have.

26
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,020
It memorizes a sequence, but
in fact what's the problem with this?

27
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,001
Why can we, in general,
just execute plans in

28
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:27,650
order to satisfy the kind of goals
that we're trying to satisfy?

29
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,981
>> Well, so, I'll say two things.

30
00:01:29,981 --> 00:01:34,057
One is, I was actually executing a plan
once I figured out what was going on.

31
00:01:34,057 --> 00:01:34,777
>> Mm.

32
00:01:34,777 --> 00:01:35,613
>> Right?

33
00:01:35,613 --> 00:01:36,272
Particularly the-
>> Yeah, that's true.

34
00:01:36,272 --> 00:01:40,443
Right so, part of it is, during
learning, you don't know stuff, so

35
00:01:40,443 --> 00:01:42,860
you don't know kind of plan to execute.

36
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,080
For this slide I'm talking about
behavior structures for after learning.

37
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,924
So during learning also sorts
of weird things have to happen.

38
00:01:49,924 --> 00:01:50,772
You have to try stuff out.

39
00:01:50,772 --> 00:01:51,851
You have to adapt.

40
00:01:51,851 --> 00:01:53,942
But once you've figured
out what you want to do,

41
00:01:53,942 --> 00:01:56,705
you could try to represent it as
a plan but the problem with that.

42
00:01:56,705 --> 00:02:00,735
Okay, so it is true the environment that
I showed you has a property that makes

43
00:02:00,735 --> 00:02:02,250
plans actually okay [LAUGH].

44
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,480
>> Yeah, it's deterministic for
one thing.

45
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,192
So that was the second
thing I was going to say,

46
00:02:08,192 --> 00:02:12,850
which is that the plan worked because
everything did as I expected it to do.

47
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,150
It was deterministic.

48
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,320
>> Good, good.

49
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,180
And so in stochastic environments
you need to be at least a little

50
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,410
bit of aware of your surroundings, you
need to move around with your eyes open.

51
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,900
And so one step in that direction is
something called the conditional plan.

52
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,190
So you can think of a conditional plan
as actually being a kind of program

53
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,540
where plan is a fixed program where it
just executes a sequence of statements.

54
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,670
A conditional plan can
have if statements in it.

55
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,940
You can sort of see what's
happening in your environment.

56
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,450
I'm going to do this,
this, this, and this.

57
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,440
And if I get to this point and such and
such is true, then I'll go this way and

58
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,930
start this action, otherwise I'll
start these things, these actions.

59
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,430
>> Right, so
could one of your if things be,

60
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,420
if everything works out the way
I expected, keep going.

61
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,190
If it ever doesn't, then stop and
try to figure out a new plan?

62
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,780
>> Usually that's not
thought of that way.

63
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,842
A conditional plan would be something
where you have that sequence, and

64
00:03:02,842 --> 00:03:05,650
then there's a branch point,
we ask a question.

65
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:10,688
And we could, if everything's gone okay,
continue the way we've been going,

66
00:03:10,688 --> 00:03:14,927
but if not, then a conditional
plan has an else statement, right?

67
00:03:14,927 --> 00:03:15,682
>> Mm-hm.

68
00:03:15,682 --> 00:03:17,977
>> It tells you what you should do
in case that that's not true or

69
00:03:17,977 --> 00:03:19,650
in case it's something else that's true.

70
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,380
>> Okay.
>> What

71
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,840
you're talking about is something
more akin to dynamic replanning,

72
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,280
where the idea is exactly what you said.

73
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,835
We're just going to
continue along the plan,

74
00:03:27,835 --> 00:03:29,947
making predictions about
what's suppose to happen next.

75
00:03:29,947 --> 00:03:33,349
If those predictions are violated,
we just generate a new plan.

76
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:36,962
So there's nothing in the plan that
says, here's what I do in case things

77
00:03:36,962 --> 00:03:41,100
break, instead, we wait for something
to break and then we react to it.

78
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,040
>> Okay, fair enough.

79
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,268
So that's just in time
conditional planning?

80
00:03:44,268 --> 00:03:46,391
>> Just in time planning really.

81
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:46,950
>> Hm.

82
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,726
>> because again the conditionals
aren't in there.

83
00:03:48,726 --> 00:03:50,140
>> Hm, fair enough,
fair enough, I like that.
