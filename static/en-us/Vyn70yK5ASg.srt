00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,160
To get the constant term to be on the left side instead of the right side, we

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,509
just need to subtract 15 from both sides. This gets rid of it on the right and

3
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:12,888
makes this so we have a new constant on the left. Now we're left with y minus 15

4
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:14,421
equals x squared minus 8x.
