1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,450
Follow these steps to create a unit
test to insert a row of data

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,810
into the location database table.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,320
Then, query the table and
validate the values.

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,920
We're going to be filling out the test
location table function within TestDB.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,490
The comment in that function should
guide you in completing your test.

6
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,120
This test function returns
the ID of the inserted row.

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,100
When you're done,
check the box to continue.
