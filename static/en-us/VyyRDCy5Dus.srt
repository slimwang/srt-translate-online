1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,390
Remember the coffee bean trail,
Katherine?

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:03,469
>> How can I forget?

3
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:04,998
>> I know.
>> You spilled it all over me.

4
00:00:04,998 --> 00:00:06,051
[LAUGH]
>> [LAUGH] So

5
00:00:06,051 --> 00:00:09,425
we talked about how there would
be three big parts to Lesson one.

6
00:00:09,425 --> 00:00:10,925
>> Mm-hm.
>> And we spoke about image and

7
00:00:10,925 --> 00:00:11,840
TextView.

8
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,880
And then we learned how
to style those views.

9
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,510
>> Yes.
>> Where are we going next?

10
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:16,640
>> Well, I was thinking.

11
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,980
Since we only have one view
on the screen right now.

12
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:19,830
>> Yeah.

13
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,790
>> It's a little boring, so
we should add more than one view.

14
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:23,300
>> Right.

15
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,790
And if you think about it,
all of the fun apps that we use,

16
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:29,750
YouTube, OkCupid,
what's another one that comes to mind?

17
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:30,560
>> Gmail.
>> Gmail,

18
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,180
they all seem to have more
than one views packed in

19
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,940
very neatly on the screen together.

20
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:35,950
>> Yeah.
And the way they do

21
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,205
that is through view groups.

22
00:00:37,205 --> 00:00:37,790
>> Mm-hm.

23
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,340
>> So we'll learn about that next.

24
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,260
And that gives us the power to
also position views on the screen

25
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,090
where we want them.

26
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:43,650
>> Right.

27
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,620
So lets talk about view groups next.

28
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,675
>> So
far we've only had a single TextView or

29
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:51,870
a single ImageView on screen.

30
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,590
If we want to add another view below
it we could try to just copy this and

31
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,320
paste it below it.

32
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,010
But then we get an error.

33
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,590
It says the XML document has
more than one root view.

34
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,710
There can only be one root view, and it
should enclose all of your other views.

35
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,100
If we want both of these
TextViews to appear on screen and

36
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,390
not be lonely anymore, then we
need to put them in a View Group.

37
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,085
The View Group will then be
the single root view for the layout.

38
00:01:18,085 --> 00:01:21,460
View Groups are also views and
they are rectangles on the screen.

39
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,960
For example the red and orange
rectangles here are all View Groups.

40
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,460
They can have a width, a height or
a background color, or other attributes.

41
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,680
Background color here is orange.

42
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,980
Orange.
But it could also be transparent so

43
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,820
the View Group isn't
even visible to the user.

44
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,770
Instead of holding some content like
text for TextView or an image for

45
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:44,140
an ImageView, the content that
a View Group holds is other views.

46
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,130
You can think of a view group
as being a container for views.

47
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,790
When a view contains other views,
we call it the parent of these views.

48
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,030
So this is the parent.

49
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:52,780
This is the parent.

50
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,210
And this is the parent.

51
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,260
When a view is inside of a View Group,
we call it the child of that View Group.

52
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,390
So this is a child, and
this is a child, and this is a child.

53
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,030
Same here, there are two children here,
and two children here.

54
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,590
Continuing with the family language,
if there are multiple children,

55
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,940
then each of those children
are siblings to each other.

56
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,300
These are sibling views, and
these are sibling views.

57
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,100
Okay, that was a lot.

58
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,550
To help you remember all the terminology
around parent and child and view and

59
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:24,005
View Group, I want you to meet
a very nice family called the Views.

60
00:02:24,005 --> 00:02:25,860
You've already met Tommy TextView.

61
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,310
He's pretty great at displaying text.

62
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:33,090
You also know his sister, Ivy ImageView,
who displayed very beautiful images.

63
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,100
And now we're meeting their parents.

64
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,240
It's always nerve racking
to meet the parents.

65
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,870
So we have Laura the LinearLayout and
Ray the RelativeLayout.

66
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,380
These are both View Groups,

67
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,220
which we mentioned before
are called Parent Views.

68
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,860
Then the Children Views
are positioned based on their parent.

69
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,960
Let's look at an example of one parent.

70
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,740
A parent may tell their child to sit or

71
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,510
stand in a specific place and
not to move.

72
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,030
Let's ignore the possibility that
the child might want to get up

73
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,780
and run around.

74
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,570
Because that's just an edge case.

75
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:05,240
On a device this means that a parent
has control over where to position

76
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,380
its children.

77
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:10,310
For example, one child Text View
can be at the top of the screen and

78
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,730
then a second child
ImageView can be below that.

79
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:14,930
Or, if the parent wishes,

80
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,278
they can rearrange the children
in a different way.

81
00:03:17,278 --> 00:03:19,570
The child ImageView can be on the left,
and

82
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,690
then the child TextView
can be on the right.

83
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,200
We're going to talk about view groups
in more detail in this lesson, but

84
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,400
to make sure that you've
understood what we've covered so

85
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,000
far, please answer these questions.

86
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,690
For the screenshot on this device, can
you tell me how many views there are?

87
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,740
Number 2.
For the mountain image, is it a child or

88
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,100
a parent of the red view group.

89
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:44,630
Number 3, is the red view group a child
or a parent of the hiking text view.

90
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,730
Number 4, which of these views
are siblings of each other.

91
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,470
And you can just list them here.
