1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,270
In your layout file, you had actually
set up the button handler functions for

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,030
the two buttons.

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,790
Go and check it out now.

4
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:10,568
Now, you had specified that these be
called request activity updates button

5
00:00:10,568 --> 00:00:14,130
handler, and
remove activity updates button handler.

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,329
Go ahead and create these functions now.

7
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:18,430
They both take a view as a parameter.

8
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,340
In the request function,
you should do the following.

9
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:27,757
First, you should call
ActivityRecognition.ActivityRegonitionA-

10
00:00:27,757 --> 00:00:33,070
PI.RequestActivityUpdates and
set its results call back to this.

11
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,680
It takes three parameters.

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,830
The first is the API Client, the second
is an interval in milliseconds.

13
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:42,310
And then the third is a pending intent.

14
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,040
You don't have that pending intent yet,
so for now,

15
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,450
just enter this function,
getActivityDetectionPendingIntent().

16
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,160
You're going to create this
function in the next step,

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,940
and this function will return
the pending intent for you.

18
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,290
Similarly, in
the removeActivityUpdatesHandler, call

19
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:03,210
activity recognition.activityrecognition
API.removeActivityUpdates.

20
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,810
And this just takes two parameters,
the API client and a pending intent.

21
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,680
And as you don't have
the pending intent yet,

22
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,130
just use the same function call
as in the request function.

23
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,040
When you're done implementing these,
check this box.
