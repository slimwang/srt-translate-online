00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,834
Let's look at another example of cognitive dissonance and see how to help

2
00:00:03,834 --> 00:00:09,145
decrease the discomfort caused by cognitive dissonance. Let's say we have a

3
00:00:09,145 --> 00:00:12,866
person who is cheating on her lover. Can you think of examples that fit into

4
00:00:12,866 --> 00:00:16,258
each of the three categories that we discussed that might help decrease that

5
00:00:16,258 --> 00:00:21,852
discomfort caused by the dissonance? First, how might the person change her

6
00:00:21,852 --> 00:00:27,400
behavior. Well one thing she could do is end the affair. Second, she could try

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,184
to justify her behavior. For example, perhaps she says that she's not hurting

8
00:00:31,184 --> 00:00:35,440
anybody by having the affair. Third she may try to change her ideas or her

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,298
thoughts in order to justify her behavior. For example, maybe she says, I'm

10
00:00:41,298 --> 00:00:46,369
pretty sure he cheated on me, or if he can cheat, I can cheat. Now, before I

11
00:00:46,369 --> 00:00:50,027
move on to the next area of social relations, I'd like you to think about any

12
00:00:50,027 --> 00:00:53,567
personal experiences that you have had that have resulted in cognitive

13
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:58,965
dissonance. What did you do to try to decrease the uncomfortable feelings that

14
00:00:58,965 --> 00:01:00,460
you experienced?
