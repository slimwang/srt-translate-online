00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,019
Scientists have used EEG machines to record our brain waves while we sleep, and

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,907
while we're awake. When we're awake, our electrical brain activity is called

3
00:00:08,907 --> 00:00:14,170
beta waves. However, when we're relaxed, our brain activity slows to alpha

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:18,205
waves. As you can see here, this is when we become drowsy, and when we first

5
00:00:18,205 --> 00:00:21,491
fall asleep we don't go into rapid eye movement sleep but we go down to stage

6
00:00:21,491 --> 00:00:26,810
one. And during stage one our brain waves are theta waves. So if you were

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,910
looking at a brainwave activity, you would know that somebody fell asleep

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,349
because they moved from alpha waves to theta waves. In stage one we can be

9
00:00:34,349 --> 00:00:37,997
easily aroused by outside stimuli such as a phone ringing or someone walking

10
00:00:37,997 --> 00:00:42,886
around or so on. After about seven minutes or so. We're going to move from

11
00:00:42,886 --> 00:00:46,110
stage one to stage two. Now during stage two, which is also a type of theta

12
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,110
wave, we're going to see two interesting things in our electrical brain

13
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:55,246
activity. First, as you see here this is a sleep spindle. It's a sudden burst

14
00:00:55,246 --> 00:00:59,826
of electrical activity in the brain waves. And here, we see a K complex which

15
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:05,294
is a single but large, high voltage spike in brain activity. Both of these

16
00:01:05,294 --> 00:01:08,834
things last about a second or two. It has been proposed by some researchers

17
00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:13,352
that these help us to disconnect from the outside world. After about 15 minutes

18
00:01:13,352 --> 00:01:17,353
in stage two, we move on to stage three sleep. Which consists of theta waves

19
00:01:17,353 --> 00:01:21,070
again, but also delta waves which are the slowest and strongest waves in our

20
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:26,970
sleep cycle. So stage three consists of some theta waves and some delta waves.

21
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,322
And in stage four we experience all delta waves, and this again is our deepest

22
00:01:31,322 --> 00:01:36,593
stage of sleep. Now, remember, once we hit stage four, we go back up in reverse

23
00:01:36,593 --> 00:01:42,216
order. So we go from stage four to three to two to one and then REM sleep. Now,

24
00:01:42,216 --> 00:01:46,080
it's interesting to note that during REM sleep, we actually lose muscle tone.

25
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,582
This may actually help to prevent us from acting out some of our dreams. Now,

26
00:01:50,582 --> 00:01:53,898
perhaps you've had a dream where you were running from someone. It would be

27
00:01:53,898 --> 00:01:58,309
hazardous if our brain actually allowed us to engage in these activities.
