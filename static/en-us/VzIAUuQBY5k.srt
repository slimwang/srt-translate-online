00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,460
I'd like to now take a few moments to talk about how

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,620
to be a good ciziten on the Internet. There are two key

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,510
things you can do, when youâ€™re writing programs to manipulate other peoples

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:12,870
websites, or to access other peoples websites, that will make everybody's life a

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,230
lot easier. One is, use a good user agent. Remember, we talked

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,910
about, in unit one, user agents are the header that describe what,

7
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,890
what browser you are using, or what program you are using to

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,080
access somebody. If you are planning

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,340
on accessing somebody in a consistent fashion.

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,818
If you're going to polll them, you know, every couple of seconds for

11
00:00:28,818 --> 00:00:32,130
updates or do something like that, use a good user-agent. When you're using

12
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,455
urllib2 you can specify headers in your request, and you should set a

13
00:00:36,455 --> 00:00:40,830
user-agent header that says, you know, who you are, what your name is, maybe

14
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,600
links to your website. So that somebody on the other end, if they

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,590
see you, you know, pounding them with lots and lots of requests, they

16
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,620
know, they know what's up. They have a way of reaching you to

17
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,350
ask you to stop or to tell you they blocked you or that sort

18
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,150
of thing. It's good to always include that. And the other important thing is,

19
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,450
is to rate-limit yourself. If you want to download, let's say, all of the

20
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,710
search results for the word udacity on Twitter, yeah, you can, you can request

21
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,870
them 15 at a time, which is what their API returns, I believe. As fast

22
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,680
as you can, but you'd be really sending a lot of requests to Twitter

23
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,510
because you can have some loop and it's much, much faster than any human

24
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,870
could type it and that will actually hurt Twitter's service. If you were to

25
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,450
have code like this in Python, you

26
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,430
know, while there's more stuff, make another request

27
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,790
to Twitter, and just run this and this infinite loop, or maybe

28
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,000
not infinite loop, but loop that's going to run through a number of

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,240
iterations, you'd be sending requests as fast as Twitter could possibly serve

30
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,420
them. Instead it's a really good to get in the habit of using

31
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,830
the sleep function. In Python you can say import time, time.sleep(1). And

32
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:35,490
this will cause your interpreter to sleep for one second. And this

33
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,680
is nice. Then you're only hitting them once a second, which is

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,450
much more sustainable. But, if you abuse their service, or do too many

35
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,390
requests, they'll probably rate-limit you. I

36
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,210
know Twitter does. Because I thought about

37
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,966
having a quiz in this, in this unit that was, how many requests

38
00:01:47,966 --> 00:01:51,790
in a minute can you make before Twitter rate-limits you? But then I

39
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,310
realized that that would be the exact opposite of being a good citizen

40
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,730
on the net, asking thousands of students to go hit some website as

41
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:01,500
fast as you can. It's generally not a nice thing to do. So,

42
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,820
instead, we're just going to talk about it. I'm going to ask you

43
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,510
to make sure, if you're hitting somebody hard, that you structure your code

44
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,810
like this. Include a sleep so you pause

45
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,830
a little bit and don't hit anybody too hard.
