00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,065
So now that Susan explained classical conditioning, let's look back to when I

2
00:00:03,065 --> 00:00:07,290
classically conditioned Greg, and identify the parts of classical conditioning.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,490
Let's start here. Here I am with the bell. The bell originally didn't produce

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:11,175
any significant

5
00:00:11,175 --> 00:00:11,435
[SOUND]

6
00:00:11,435 --> 00:00:14,919
response from Greg, other than maybe looking around. So what's the original

7
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:18,320
term we would give to the bell in this situation? Is it the unconditioned

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,286
stimulus? Is it the unconditional response, is it the conditioned response, or

9
00:00:23,286 --> 00:00:25,650
is it the neutral stimulus?
