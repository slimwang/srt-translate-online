1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,920
The Mangler Function, performs
the bulk of processing in a DES round.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,940
It takes the right half of the input,
expands the 32 bit data

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:15,110
into 48 bit data, and
xor it with a param key.

4
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:20,730
The result is that a 48 bit
value is being substitute

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,060
to a 32 bit value, and
then the result is permutated.

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:30,320
That is, the Mangler Function performs
both substitution and permutation.
