1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,540
So let's discuss the answer for our manufacturing cost

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,710
quiz. We had a watch processor that was one millimeter

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,545
square in size,and a laptop processor that is 100

4
00:00:09,545 --> 00:00:13,370
millimeter squares in size. The question was, which of the

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,079
following is true? Is the cost of the laptop

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,477
processor about 100 times the cost of a watch processor?

7
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:22,240
Is it more than that or less than that?

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,144
We have seen already that if we disregard the yield,

9
00:00:25,144 --> 00:00:29,302
the cost of a laptop processor would be about 100 times the cost of a watch

10
00:00:29,302 --> 00:00:33,429
processor. Just because the same cost wafer gets

11
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:37,310
divided into 100 more of these than of these.

12
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:41,760
However, logic processors also result in lower yield.

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,313
So, this is why the cost of laptop processor

14
00:00:44,313 --> 00:00:46,935
will be more than proportionately the cost of

15
00:00:46,935 --> 00:00:50,030
the watch processor and this is the correct answer.
