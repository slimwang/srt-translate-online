1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,110
>> Alright so, Stochastic Games are more general than

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,430
other models that we've talked about. And so, just to

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,280
make that case here's a way of making the Stochastic

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,550
Game settings more constrained. And, by making them more constrained,

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,450
actually turning them into other models that we've talked

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,380
about or could talk about. So, I wrote down three

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,150
different ways of constraining the Stochastic Game model. One says

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,370
that we're going to make the reward function for one player

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,780
the opposite of the reward function for the other. The next one says that the

10
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:35,600
transition function has the property that for any state and joint action and

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,800
next state. If that's going to be equal to the transition probability for state

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,700
joint action, next state, where we've changed

13
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,410
potentially the choice of action for player two.

14
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,410
>> Mm-hm.

15
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,770
>> So basically, player two doesn't matter

16
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:54,600
to the transitions or the rewards for player one, and the rewards

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,520
for player tow are always zero. So that's, that's again, you can specify

18
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,320
this as a Stochastic Game and then in the third case we

19
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,410
are saying that the number of states in the environment is exactly one.

20
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:11,425
>> So I claim that by doing these restrictions. We get out the

21
00:01:11,425 --> 00:01:13,690
mark-off decision process model, a zero

22
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,100
sum statistic game model, and the repeated

23
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,040
game model that we've been talking about in

24
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,440
the context of, like, the folk theorem. So, what

25
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,450
I'd like you to do is write the letters, A, B, and C in the correct boxes.

26
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,330
>> Okay.

27
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:26,510
>> Go.
