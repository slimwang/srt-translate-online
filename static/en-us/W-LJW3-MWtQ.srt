00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,160
The specific objectives
of this lesson are for

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,920
us to look at how are we
going to transform the image?

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,570
specifically transformations
like Rigid Transformations.

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,290
Specifically Translation and Rotation.

5
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:15,390
Again, the emphasis is that we
are trying to do now is look inside

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,920
the image but not at the intensities,
but the number of rows and columns.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,070
The number of pixels in the image and
transform those.

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,340
An additional part of it, where we will
also look at non-rigid transformations,

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,950
where we would actually look at our
final projective transformations.

10
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,290
But more importantly, what we
want to do now is start looking at,

11
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:37,420
how many numbers, how many parameters,
degrees of freedom we

12
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,450
want to be able to model in mathematics
of how to do these transformations.

13
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,210
So, let's get started.
