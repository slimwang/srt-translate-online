1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,740
Well we still have the same two components.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:06,000
We haven't added anything there, but for each of the components we've

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,270
added another port for dealing with these error messages.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:15,080
In particular for the client, it's now got a port which is called here err-trap,

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,190
and symmetrically the server has another port, this one for sending the alert.

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:25,250
We're going to add a new connector for dealing with this communication channel.

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,870
It's called error, okay, and it's got two roles.

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,810
One being the source of the error and

9
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,360
the other being the sync or receiver of that error.

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,360
We still have the same two attachments we had for, for dealing with the main

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,830
flow of communication, but now we've added two more for dealing with error flow.

12
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:47,315
In particular, a clients error trap is connected to the connector sync and

13
00:00:47,315 --> 00:00:53,160
the receiver's alert port is connected to the connector's source role.
