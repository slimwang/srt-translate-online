>> Grant is still at the Udacity Glasses Expo. And to get people more excited

00:00:04,108 --> 00:00:08,329
about his family of glasses wiper products, he's decided to add a game to his

3
00:00:08,329 --> 00:00:12,653
booth. Anyone who wins the game gets a free pair of deluxe glasses wipers, the

4
00:00:12,653 --> 00:00:17,076
ones with the awesome curlicues on them. The game is pretty simple. The person

5
00:00:17,076 --> 00:00:21,626
playing uses this giant slingshot that Grant built to try to get a ball through

6
00:00:21,626 --> 00:00:26,116
a hoop that's attached way up high on the ceiling. Grant has another idea of a

7
00:00:26,116 --> 00:00:30,605
way to soup up his booth though. The game isn't quite enough for him. A gigantic

8
00:00:30,605 --> 00:00:34,586
sign with his brand name on it. That way no one will ever forget what his

9
00:00:34,586 --> 00:00:38,860
company is called. The question is, where should he hang it? He needs to make

10
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,940
sure that it doesn't get in the way of shots from the slingshot that would

11
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,149
otherwise have gone through the hoop.
