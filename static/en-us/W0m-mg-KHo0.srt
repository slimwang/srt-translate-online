00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,550
Did you say things like performance, memory footprint, time to construct?

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:08,650
Note that we particularly don't include correctness in the factors to compare.

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,080
That is, we assume that all the versions that are constructed work, but

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,230
differ in other nonfunctional ways.
