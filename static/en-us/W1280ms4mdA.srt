1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,230
Now let's review the model and view in a bit more detail.

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,610
The model is going to be super simple.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:10,290
It's just our data, an array of cat objects, with properties for

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,150
name, click count, and image URL.

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,460
Nothing new here.

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,680
Now the view, well, actually, if we want to,

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,310
we can split this up into two views.

8
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,060
First we have the list of cats, and second, we have the cat viewing area.

9
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,380
Both of these views will be pretty simple.

10
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,250
They'll just have render functions that redraw the respective areas.

11
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,790
And they'll have click handlers registered for the various cats up here and for

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,460
the image down here.

13
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,220
Now, why am I splitting them up into two views?

14
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,270
Well, here's a good way to think about this.

15
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:48,180
Think about how separate they are functionally, not with regard to action, but

16
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,310
with regard to what gets rendered.

17
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,500
The list renders the list of cats.

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,110
When does this re-render?

19
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:58,280
Well, right now, it only renders one time, at the start of the application.

20
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,490
This other part renders cat details and

21
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,880
it gets re-rendered every single time you click on the cat.

22
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,690
Now, they're both separate visually and in terms of when they get rendered.

23
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,000
Separation does make some sense here.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,255
Now, if you wanted to make them one view, that would work just fine, but

25
00:01:15,255 --> 00:01:18,410
it's generally a good idea to separate out functionality into

26
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,290
smaller chunks whenever it's possible.
