00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,022
To make a reflection in the Y axis happen, we simply need to replace x in our

2
00:00:04,022 --> 00:00:09,705
original function with negative x in the transformed function. So, here are the

3
00:00:09,705 --> 00:00:14,468
four functions that Athena needs to make her final glasses frame logo. This is

4
00:00:14,468 --> 00:00:18,498
pretty cool. With a couple of domain restrictions and a few other functions

5
00:00:18,498 --> 00:00:22,916
added in, she could complete her picture like this. Or maybe she'd rather let

6
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:27,086
the functions themselves complete the glasses. Of course, adding in a couple of

7
00:00:27,086 --> 00:00:31,150
other lines and points for wipers and nozzles. Either way, I think we've seen

8
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:35,950
just how powerful transformation of different kinds of functions can be. You've

9
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:39,635
learned about shifts, horizontally and vertically, reflections in the X-axis

10
00:00:39,635 --> 00:00:44,936
and the Y-axis, and stretches and shrinks in the vertical direction. These are

11
00:00:44,936 --> 00:00:48,817
all super powerful tools that can be used with any kind of function. Awesome

12
00:00:48,817 --> 00:00:51,879
job. I'm sure Grant will be very pleased with this logo.
