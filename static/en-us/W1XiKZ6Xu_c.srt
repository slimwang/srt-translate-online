1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,188
What we're looking for here is just the other x intercept of our new graph.

2
00:00:04,188 --> 00:00:08,968
That's this point right here and its coordinates are 2, 0. So the water will

3
00:00:08,968 --> 00:00:13,275
land 2 meters from the base of the fountain. Alternatively, we could have of

4
00:00:13,275 --> 00:00:17,537
course figured this out from the equation alone. We can set up a quadratic

5
00:00:17,537 --> 00:00:22,273
equation, 0 equals negative 7x squared plus 14 x, then I could just factor the

6
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:27,035
right side, which gives us 0 equals negative 7x times the quantity x minus 2.

7
00:00:27,035 --> 00:00:31,348
This equation will be satisfied if either negative 7x equals 0 or if the

8
00:00:31,348 --> 00:00:35,845
quantity x minus 2 equals 0. Of course, you get x equals 0 for the first

9
00:00:35,845 --> 00:00:40,805
solution, which is the one we already knew ahead of time. And then, we get x

10
00:00:40,805 --> 00:00:45,082
equals 2 for the second one, which is the one we just figured out.
