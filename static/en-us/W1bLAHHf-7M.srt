In general it's easy to use power divided by root rather than to expand the

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:10,130
factors of a variable. But not all powers are evenly divisible by a root. We

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:14,638
know 3 doesn't divide evenly into 14. We could rewrite x to the 14th as x to

4
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:19,581
the 12th times x squared. We use our product tool to split this up into two

5
00:00:19,581 --> 00:00:24,200
separate cube roots. And since we know that cube root of x to the 12 is equal

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,858
to x to the 4th, this would be our final answer. An easier way to get to this

7
00:00:28,858 --> 00:00:33,564
more quickly is to use power divided by root and to look at the remainder. We

8
00:00:33,564 --> 00:00:38,686
know this radical can be written as x to the 14 divided by 3. So when I divide

9
00:00:38,686 --> 00:00:44,412
the power by the root, I get 14 divide 3, which equals 4 remainder 2. Notice

10
00:00:44,412 --> 00:00:48,700
that the 4 appears as the exponent of our factor outside of the radical,

11
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,486
whereas the remainder 2, is the power inside of the radical. So, using this

12
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:58,610
ideal of the remainder, I want you to see if you can simplify this radical. Use

13
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,760
the idea of power divided by root to figure out what would be on the outside of

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,552
the radical and what would stay on the inside. When you think you have it put

15
00:01:06,552 --> 00:01:08,730
your answer here.
