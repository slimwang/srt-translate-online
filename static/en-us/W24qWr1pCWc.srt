00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,070
Now we want to actually start looking at the details of how a camera operates.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:09,560
And we'll be specifically be talking about the details of what happens when

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,610
a camera takes a picture.

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,504
These are more photographic principles, and all I'm going to be talking about is

5
00:00:15,504 --> 00:00:19,235
what's referred to in the photographic circles as the exposure triangle.

6
00:00:19,235 --> 00:00:23,275
In an exposure triangle, a photographer controls variety of

7
00:00:23,275 --> 00:00:26,933
parameters that lets him or her capture the best image.

8
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:29,806
The three things that are controlled are, the aperture,

9
00:00:29,806 --> 00:00:33,630
which is the size of the opening that actually lets the light into the sensor.

10
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,890
The shutter speed, which is of course, the,

11
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,530
how fast the shutter opens and closes.

12
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,390
And the ISO, which is the sensitivity of the sensor.

13
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,060
Most of the time,

14
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:48,280
a photographer basically attempts to optimize all of these three parameters,

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,630
that's why this is referred to as an exposure triangle, to get the best picture.

16
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,770
What we're interested in is learning these concepts, because we want to be

17
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,630
able to figure out how we're going to control these in a computational manner.
