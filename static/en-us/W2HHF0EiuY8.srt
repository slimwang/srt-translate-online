00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,620
Here is a visualization of the RGB color space. The axis to the left shows the

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,738
red channel increasing. The vertical axis is green. And the channel to the right

3
00:00:08,738 --> 00:00:13,437
is blue. We can't see the interior of the cube showing intermediate values. All

4
00:00:13,437 --> 00:00:16,918
the values we can see in this particular have one or more channels at the

5
00:00:16,918 --> 00:00:20,717
maximum. Here's a view inside the cube with the red and blue axes swapped. Next,

6
00:00:20,717 --> 00:00:25,694
this direction doesn't really matter. The point inside the cube shows how sky

7
00:00:25,694 --> 00:00:31,675
blue is formed by the RGB values of 1 5th red, 3 5th green, and 4 5th blue.

8
00:00:31,676 --> 00:00:35,397
Another way to visualize the RGB color space, is to take a slice of the cube at

9
00:00:35,397 --> 00:00:38,996
these three corners. Each corner represents a single color channel at full

10
00:00:38,996 --> 00:00:43,135
intensity, with the other two channels off. For example this vertex is where

11
00:00:43,135 --> 00:00:47,170
green is set to one and red and blue are 0. By slicing a plane through these

12
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,808
three corners, we'll be able to see where red plus green plus blue equal 1. This

13
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:55,978
slice gives another view of how these colors blend. This is what the next

14
00:00:55,978 --> 00:00:57,163
exercise is about.
