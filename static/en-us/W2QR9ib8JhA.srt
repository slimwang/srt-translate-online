00:00:05,017 --> 00:00:08,648
As part of this course, you'll be given access to a virtual machine that

3
00:00:08,648 --> 00:00:11,801
contains an environment and tools that should aid your work for

4
00:00:11,801 --> 00:00:15,914
the course. For example, the virtual machine has ARGO UML,

5
00:00:15,914 --> 00:00:20,470
a UML-aware drawing tool. You are not required to use ARGO UML, but

6
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,810
it may enable you to get started more quickly with the UML related work.

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,760
There are other tools such as Eclipse installed as well. In addition to

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,780
the virtual machine you should also be aware of the class resources page.

9
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,050
It not only contains links to all the courses required readings, but

10
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,970
other items referenced in the lessons, and some pointers.

11
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,220
That should allow you to dig deeper into topics that interest you.

12
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:46,590
I encourage you to explore. Also, if you are aware of other interesting

13
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,530
resources, let us know on the class forum and we will add them to this page.
