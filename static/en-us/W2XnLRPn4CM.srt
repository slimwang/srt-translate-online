1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,840
So what went wrong in this application? It

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,980
was this right here, the 3G data connection.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,990
What ended up happening is this application is

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:12,750
currently violating data and battery constrains of mobile.

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,970
>> So what the application should have done is by default download

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,800
the video at 480p or the lowest resolution, because the user's on 3G.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,450
>> Yeah, and what ends up happening is if you're trying

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,510
to download this humongous video over this really slow network connection,

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,210
it'll take forever to download the video,

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,430
which will drain your cellular, because it's

11
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,460
cellular radio. It's going to drain your battery.

12
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,740
Two, it will take forever to download

13
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,550
the video, so the playback is going to be really janky anyway. And so just

14
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,160
avoid it. Just downgrade to a lower resolution or queue it for playback later.
