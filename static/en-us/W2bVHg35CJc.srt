1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,760
So name, yes, both the Conference and
ConferenceForm have a name field.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,170
The user will specify the name of
the conference in the ConferenceForm.

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,160
And it'll be stored in
the conference model.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,528
Likewise topics, that's something the
user will also specify when they agree

5
00:00:13,528 --> 00:00:14,670
to the conference.

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:15,870
So parent, no.

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,390
Parent is the key of the profile of
the user who created the conference and

8
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,090
it's calculated in a logged in user.

9
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,840
It's not present in the classes.
