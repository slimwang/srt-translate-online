1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,600
Here, you can see my on click function.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,230
I'm only going to process button clicks
while the Google API client isn't in

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,610
the midst of connecting.

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,510
So this is just going to
be a big switch statement.

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,760
Because the on click
will take in a view v.

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,239
And v's ID will be the ID of
the button that was pressed.

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,300
So, in this case, when the v.getId
gives me R.id.sign in button,

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,250
the sign in button has been pressed.

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,650
We just said we want to set
the status to signing in,

10
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,810
and then call this result
sign-in error function.

11
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,110
We'll write that function shortly,

12
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,640
and then just break out
of the switch statement.

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,230
And then when we're signing out, we can
clear the default accounts, just so

14
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,100
that the Google services don't
return an unconnected callback,

15
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,170
without any interaction.

16
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,040
And the result, so once you've
signed out, it's good to clear

17
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,250
any of the default information out, so
that you don't have any security issues.

18
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,850
So just going to call
Plus.AccountApi.clearDefaultAccount and

19
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,750
pass it the API client.

20
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,290
We then disconnect the API client and
reconnect it.

21
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,510
And then break out of
the switch statement.

22
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,180
Finally, for
revoking access on the plus account API,

23
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,220
we call the default account for
the same reason.

24
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,490
And then also in the Plus.AccountApi,
we call revokeAccessAndDisconnect and

25
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,680
pass it the GoogleApiClient.

26
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,940
Once we've done that, we'll start the
process of building a new client ,and

27
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,480
getting it ready to connect.

28
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,570
So again, we just say mGoogleApiClient,

29
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,180
and we call the same helper
function that we had earlier.

30
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,820
And then we reconnect that.

31
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,190
So that's all we have to
do in our three run-ins.

32
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,330
So signing in is setting the text and
resolving the errors.

33
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,440
Signing out is clearing the default
account, disconnecting and reconnecting.

34
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,280
And revoking access to
clearing the default account.

35
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,310
Revoking access and disconnecting.

36
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,195
And building a new API client and
connecting that.
