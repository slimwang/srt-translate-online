1
00:00:00,195 --> 00:00:03,912
>> Alright so we're back in again, and we're going to attack it I the way

2
00:00:03,912 --> 00:00:06,432
that we, that you attacked the previous ones,

3
00:00:06,432 --> 00:00:09,330
where we're going to ask, kind of systematically is the

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,866
VC dimension, greater than or equal to 1, 2, 3, 4 by, by giving examples until

5
00:00:13,866 --> 00:00:18,170
we just can't anymore [LAUGH]. So good, so

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,800
is the VC greater than or equal to one?

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,060
>> Yes.

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,240
>> Yes. So, what would that mean? All we need to do is provide

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,940
a point, I don't know, call it the origin. And.

10
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:32,740
>> Basically, we get to just pretend that it's like a single point on a line

11
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,610
with a VC dimension of one and it,

12
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,700
the same argument that we had before, applies.

13
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,660
>> That's a good way to say it. Just you know, just think about the

14
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,210
x asis, axis itself, and we can label

15
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,690
something, well actually it's simpler in a sense

16
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,450
because, we can keep the line steady and we can just flip which side is, you

17
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,760
know, by negating all the weights we can

18
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,340
flip which side is positive and which side

19
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,930
is negative, and that gives us the 2 labelings of that point.

20
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:57,820
>> Right, and because similar argument for VC of 2.

21
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,990
>> So, if the 2 points were on a

22
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:02,950
line, then to do the 4 different combinations, we could.

23
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,140
>> So right, by putting that line to the left, we

24
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,410
can label both of them positive. That's easy, or we could label

25
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,035
both of them negative by flipping the weights. Now we've to do

26
00:01:12,035 --> 00:01:15,780
the other 2 cases where they've different labels. So, I'm going to recommend

27
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,230
putting a blue line between them.

28
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,090
>> It's a thin blue line.

29
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:23,670
>> [LAUGH] Yes, and you know, the one on the right is positive the one

30
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,358
on the left is negative, or we can flip the weights and then flip the signs.

31
00:01:27,358 --> 00:01:29,450
>> Yes, and 3 is where we got into trouble

32
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,890
last time, so let's let me start off by giving ourselves

33
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:36,260
a clean slate. So, this ran us into trouble in the

34
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:41,330
case of the intervals because we couldn't do that case and

35
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,290
it looks like we're kind of hosed again, right?

36
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,680
>> Yeah, we're. We're actually completely hosed again, if we do this.

37
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,227
>> [LAUGH]

38
00:01:47,227 --> 00:01:49,340
>> So, I'm going to say that the

39
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,080
problem is not with the hypothesis space. The problem

40
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,430
is with the hand that is drawing points

41
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:00,170
on the screen. So that's you, so here's the.

42
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,390
>> My hand is really depressed.

43
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,473
>> [LAUGH]

44
00:02:02,473 --> 00:02:03,556
>> [SOUND]

45
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:06,360
>> Well, I'm going to make your hand happier. So, I think

46
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,038
it's right that you can't separate this. It's, and,

47
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:11,968
and the reason you can't separate it's because we've

48
00:02:11,968 --> 00:02:13,610
3 points on the number line and there's just

49
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,090
sort of nothing to do here, just like we'd before.

50
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,060
But, we are not restricted to the number line.

51
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,480
So I'm going to recommend cheating, and moving that

52
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,940
point in the middle off the number line. So

53
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,520
make a triangle, stick it up in the middle somewhere.

54
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,490
>> Alright, and that gives us the ability to handle

55
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,380
this case now, because we can just send our slicey line

56
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,420
this way. Put everything below it as

57
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,100
positive and everything above it as negative.

58
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,110
>> Right, now of course we still, by doing that

59
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,680
we might have messed up the other labeling, so we

60
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,510
should check to make certain that we haven't we haven't

61
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,450
screwed anything up. So, we can, we can make the

62
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,450
top minus and the bottom, plus that's true and we

63
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,490
can just by flipping the weights we can make it

64
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,520
the top plus and the bottom minus right? So that's

65
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,200
good. And the question is that can we do anything else.

66
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,440
>> Yeah, I think it's pretty clear. We could definitely label them all

67
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,710
positive or all negative just by putting

68
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,550
a vertical line somewhere off to the left.

69
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,310
>> Yeah, and I think it's actually easier than this because if you just

70
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:08,666
think about vertical lines, then we really are back in the one dimensional case.

71
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:12,910
>> Right. And, and we handled the other 7 cases in the

72
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,140
one dimmensional case really easily. It was just this, this extra case

73
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,600
that we didn't know how to do and now we do, we

74
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,040
just use that 3rd dimmension. [LAUGH] Or the 2nd dimmension, even better.

75
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,360
>> [LAUGH]

76
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,290
Fair enough. Okay, so the answer's yes. I feel good about that. Okay, so, that's

77
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,700
good. So we got, we got 1, 2, and 3 out of the way, so

78
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,460
we know it's more powerful. We know

79
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,540
that it's better. This's, this's kind of nice. So

80
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:40,710
now the question is 4. So, thinking about it, I think that the answer is no.

81
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:44,190
>> [LAUGH] That would be nice, wouldn't it? But, no, we need a, we

82
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,000
need a slightly better argument and I think, I think we can do that,

83
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,890
what we need. Again, what would be helpful

84
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,670
is if we had an example, where we could

85
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,310
say, okay, here's a labeling that no matter how

86
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,360
you lay out the points, you're going to fail.

87
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,390
>> So, in order for that to work, we need to try to use

88
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,510
all the power of the 2 dimensions so we don't fall in a trap. Right

89
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:07,720
if, like we almost did with VC3 by making them collinear. So, why don't you

90
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:13,710
place 4 points in the plane and make a kind of like a diamond shape,

91
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,260
or a square, which is like a diamond.

92
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,510
>> It's a diamond shape if you yeah, tilt your head a little bit.

93
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,230
>> Okay, so I'm going to tilt my head to look at it. So, here's

94
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,100
my argument. Now, I don't know if this's quite right Michael, so, so help me

95
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,190
out with it. The reason I don't think you can do 4 is because we've only got

96
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:33,273
lines to work with. Okay so, if you connect all the points [CROSSTALK]

97
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:33,520
>> Hm-mm.

98
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,280
>> All, all pairs of points the way they,

99
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,850
all ways they can be connected. So, you know,

100
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:42,302
draw the square on the outside and then draw the 2 [CROSSTALK]

101
00:04:42,302 --> 00:04:42,450
>> Hm-mm.

102
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,830
>> Cross ones in the middle. Does that make sense?

103
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,960
>> Yeah, it makes sense, but I'm not sure where we're going with this.

104
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,230
>> Okay, so I'm not either so [LAUGH] so, so, so work with

105
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:55,830
me. So that's kind of all the boundaries that you can imagine drawing.

106
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:00,120
And the problem that I see here is that because of the way

107
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,110
that the, the 2 lines that the x and the interior of the square's

108
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:08,910
set up. There's kind of no way to label the

109
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,230
ones on the other side of those lines differently without

110
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,990
crossing them. So that made no sense what I said,

111
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:18,730
right? So, try putting the, a plus in the upper left

112
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,100
and bottom right. And minus for the other 2. So,

113
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,010
if you look at the, the 2 1's that are

114
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,390
connected by the line with the plus, and the 2

115
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:29,190
1s that are connected by the minus, they cross each other,

116
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,930
right? There's no way to put a single line that will

117
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,530
allow you to separate out the pluses from the minuses here.

118
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,500
>> Yeah, yeah. Exactly. So, in particular anything

119
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,880
that puts, these 2 pluses on the same

120
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,300
side is either going to put one minus or the other minus on that same side.

121
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:44,810
>> Right.

122
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,450
>> It has a very XOR kind of feeling to it, to me.

123
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,670
>> Yeah does, it, it,it does and in fact

124
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,395
it has an x right there in the middle.

125
00:05:51,395 --> 00:05:54,160
>> [LAUGH] It does, no but it, that is true,

126
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,950
but I meant it in a slightly different way, which is if you think

127
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:03,367
about these 4 points as actually being you know, zero, zero. 1-1, 0-1 and 1-0.

128
00:06:03,367 --> 00:06:04,320
>> Mm-hm.

129
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,950
>> Then, the labeling here is exactly XOR. And XOR is one of these things

130
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,670
that you can't capture with a linear seperator. So I think, I think you got it.

131
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:15,860
>> Oh, it makes sense. And I think the important thing here, is that oh

132
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,260
I like the XOR argument. The important thing here is that, no matter where I

133
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,900
move those four points, I can take the one closer or

134
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,920
one further away. And I could, they're no longer squares, but

135
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,860
whatever I want to be, they're always, you're always going to have

136
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,360
a structure where you can draw those kind of crosses between

137
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,930
the 4 points. Or, you're going to end up collapsing the points

138
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,580
on top of one another or making 3 of them co-linear

139
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,990
or all four of them co-linear and so that makes it

140
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,660
even harder to do any kind of separation. Cause now we're back.

141
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,420
>> Right. You fail

142
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,320
on all the, but there, there's one case that

143
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,620
I'm not sure that you quite described yet. Like that.

144
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,240
>> Right. Well, I think that, that works out to be the same thing, right?

145
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,620
If you draw the connecting lines together they're

146
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,800
all going to cross at the middle point.

147
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,930
>> There's no crossings.

148
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,490
>> They all cross at that point. They all meet at that point.

149
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,780
>> They don't cross at that point.

150
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,600
>> Well, so those are line segments, but those are just

151
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,410
line segments they represent lines that go on forever. Good point.

152
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,600
>> Yeah so, but the way,

153
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,380
the way that I would see this one is, again to just give an example of a

154
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,680
labeling that just can't be separated would be

155
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,330
this one. Like if you capture the outside points,

156
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,130
assigning all the outside points one label, you

157
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,610
can't assign the input, the inside points a different

158
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,880
label. It's inside the convex hall, it's going

159
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,600
to have the same label as the other ones.

160
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,750
>> Exactly. So, the, and I, and well so in my head the, the main issue

161
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,700
is as lines, when lines cross there's really

162
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,430
nothing you can do with a single line.

163
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,620
Never cross the streams.

164
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,150
>> [LAUGH] Yeah. It still doesn't feel like quite the same.

165
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,660
I mean maybe we're belaboring this point. Here in this square,

166
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,070
if you actually let this, this corner point pushed into the

167
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:49,070
middle, then we can, I think we can linearly separate them.

168
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,570
>> Sure.

169
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,810
>> So, I feel like these are 2 different cases,

170
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,750
but regardless the point is, that what we, what we argued

171
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,720
is no matter how you lay out the points, there's

172
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,520
always going to be a labeling that can't be achieved in

173
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,130
the hypothesis class.

174
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,760
>> Yeah, the whole crossing of the lines thing, really is

175
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,230
about being able to get all 4 points. It's not saying that

176
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:10,180
any pair of points. Works out okay. So, what you'd end

177
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,630
up doing is taking one of those points and dragging them into

178
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,980
the middle, and then the lines all meet like in, in

179
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,310
what you've drawn. And you end up with the basically the, the

180
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,740
same argument. I think it's the same thing. But, I do agree

181
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,440
with one thing, Michael. Which is that we are belaboring this point.

182
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,630
>> Because the good news or the, the exciting news

183
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,550
is no, we really argued that the

184
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,330
VC dimension of linear separators is not greater

185
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:34,659
than or equal to four. So therefore, it's 3. Because 3 works and 4 doesn't.

186
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:37,918
>> And 3 is my favorite number. So, I have a question for you

187
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:42,381
Michael, I noticed that we keep getting in all the examples we have done so

188
00:08:42,381 --> 00:08:47,134
far, we keep getting one more VC dimension, so does this kind of argument work

189
00:08:47,134 --> 00:08:50,878
if I went from planes to, or lets see, 2D space or 3D space or

190
00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:52,920
4D space or 5D space? is the VC

191
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,720
dimension still three or does it keep getting bigger?
