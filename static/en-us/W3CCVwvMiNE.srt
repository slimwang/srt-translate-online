00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,468
Here's another expression for you to factor. M cubed plus 27. M's a pretty great

2
00:00:04,468 --> 00:00:08,507
letter, so we might as well use it as a variable. Just as we did in the last

3
00:00:08,507 --> 00:00:12,862
example, be super careful about what we're going to substitute in for y and z in

4
00:00:12,862 --> 00:00:16,914
our original equation. Or rather, in the general form of the equation.
