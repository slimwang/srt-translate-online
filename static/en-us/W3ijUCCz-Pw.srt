1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
If we want more confidence, we could also look at the documentation and the challenges.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
If we don't know what we're looking for, well the documentation won't tell us

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We can see that we have union that returns a union of the sets.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What we don't see yet is update and now, given that we found update and guess what it did,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
we can see this description, not the most clear description

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
to know for sure that it does what we want.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We could do some more searches.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Let's see what we got when we search for Python and update.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Well, we got some discussion here, we're looking at the dictionary update.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let's make sure we are looking for the set update and we get some more documentation.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This is going back to what we're looking for probably not the most useful thing.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And now searching for update, we see this documentation, the same that we saw.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It is updating the set adding elements from all others.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So, I think it is easier to understand what something does by experimentation

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
than by reading the documentation.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You should be open to using both approaches and combining them with looking at example code

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and trying things own your own.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So, for the final quiz of this mini unit, your goal is to modify crawl_web

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
that was part of the web crawler that we developed in CS101 to use set objects

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
for tocrawl and crawled instead of using list.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You should make your search engine simpler and remove the need for the separate union function.
