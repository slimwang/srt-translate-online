1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,350
So now let's start thinking about what are Good Features that we can find

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:10,780
between two images of the similar scene or a same object, that we can then

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:16,239
use to be able to register that same feature for across two different images.

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,670
I'm going to use this simple object of a water bottle to

5
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,420
help us illustrate this.

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,270
So as I've said before, we are interested in extracting features.

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,450
Basically, we want to find parts of an image that lets us encode that image in

8
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:32,780
a compact form, so then I can do comparisons from one image to the other.

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,390
I'm going to propose the concept of Edges here.

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,690
Edges on an image, in a variety of ways,

11
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,120
basically could be one way of encoding such an information.

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,240
So what kinds of information do we want to look at?

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,460
Basically what we want to look for

14
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,680
is various forms of discontinuities in an image or a scene, and

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,950
that basically is one of the ways to think about what an edge is.

16
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:00,700
So, an edge in an image basically is trying to capture the discontinuity in

17
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,750
a scene, and use that to be able to then find information that would be again,

18
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,850
somewhat repeatable across images.

19
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,870
We'll look at these more in detail.

20
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,890
So let's look at, for example, this water bottle.

21
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,640
And see what kind of changes in the scene we could actually look for.

22
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,830
And actually look for certain discontinuities in this.

23
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,370
So, for example, at the water bottle at the top of it you basically if I was to

24
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,910
start growing surface normals,

25
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:32,200
you would basically see the surface normals going this way.

26
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,690
And, after a while,

27
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,990
there are no more surface normals because they are on the other side.

28
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,520
So, this form of discontinuity, if there was a sudden change in it,

29
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,310
would allow us to start thinking about how we could actually look for

30
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,610
discontinuities of this form and the surface normals.

31
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,540
So those would be surface normal discontinuities.

32
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,210
Let's look at depth discontinuities.

33
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:56,270
In this case, of course, we know there's an object of course, and it might be in

34
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:00,760
front of something, so by just being able to look at the, you know, the sides

35
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:05,070
here, you know that anything behind that would be at a different depth.

36
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,850
This would be in front of everything behind that.

37
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,419
So that would be a depth discontinuity.

38
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:15,000
How can we actually look at the term water here, and be able to separate it out?

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,110
Well, in this case, if you can notice is,

40
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,430
water is written with a different color than the background.

41
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,680
So surface color is basically also a cue, a discontinuity that we can look at,

42
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,720
that basically points out how we can actually separate out terms like water, or

43
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,220
even this band here.

44
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:35,350
Or, in fact, even looking at how we can take difference between the bottle and

45
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,530
the cap here.

46
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,190
Another form of discontinuity is illumination.

47
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,340
This object, of course, is being lit in different ways.

48
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,160
And, of course it, creates a shadow.

49
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,750
Or it could actually have other types of reflections and specularities and stuff

50
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,900
like that, that are also coming in because of the lighting conditions on it.

51
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,390
That basically is referring to discontinuities because of lighting changes and

52
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,980
such on the object.

53
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,760
So hopefully you see now, that by just looking at various types of

54
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,850
discontinuities, we can start extracting some information about an image.

55
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:13,450
So of course, what we now want to do is go back to the image itself and look for

56
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:18,080
certain sets of discontinuities that would basically best capture the changes

57
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,270
because of the normals the depth, surface color, and illumination.

58
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,470
Of course, that is a rather big problem and

59
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,330
we should be looking at it, and this is one of the bigger things we look at in

60
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:32,040
computer vision when we do analysis of scenes.

61
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,811
Now one thing I wanted to emphasize here,

62
00:03:33,811 --> 00:03:35,770
this is an extremely important concept.

63
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:42,440
The Edges basically are encoding change in a spatial way of looking at an image.

64
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,440
Anywhere afterwards I look for a change, and

65
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,870
that chain encodes a lot of information.

66
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:51,555
And in fact some may argue that this is a very important set of

67
00:03:51,555 --> 00:03:53,350
informations about an image.

68
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,928
So in a information theoretic manner,

69
00:03:54,928 --> 00:03:59,420
what we an actually say that edges and basically are encoding change, and

70
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,070
therefore are an efficient way to encode an image.

71
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,170
So basically any time I can think about an image is,

72
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,080
if I can start looking at where the changes are, that basically starts giving me

73
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,390
a lot of information about what the image would be,

74
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:16,820
because now I've actually taken a a differential code to represent an image.

75
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,880
Wherever there are changes, I'm going to highlight those.

76
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,730
We'll look at that a little bit more carefully in a bit.
