00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,960
SDN has many advantages over conventional networks. It's

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,350
easier to coordinate behavior among a network of devices.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,600
The behavior of the network is easier to evolve,

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,120
and it's also easier to reason about. These characteristics

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,100
are all rooted in the fact that the

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,940
control plan is separate from the data plan. Having

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,850
a separate control plane or control program allows us

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:26,710
to provide conventional cs techniques to old networking problems.

9
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,200
So as before it was incredibly difficult

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,790
to reason about or debug a network's behavior

11
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,660
if the network behavior is now controlled

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,780
by a logically centralized control program. We can

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,420
use techniques from programming languages or software

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,710
engineering to help us reason about the behavior

15
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,140
of the network. As far as SDN's

16
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,750
infrastructure is concerned, the Control Plane is typically

17
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,930
a software program written in a high level language, such as Python or C,

18
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,860
on the other hand the Data Plane.

19
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,350
Is typically programmable hardware that's controlled by

20
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,820
the control plane. The controller effects the

21
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,930
forwarding state that's in the switch using

22
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:13,730
control commands. Open flow is one standard

23
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,850
that defines a set of control commands by

24
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:21,439
which the controller can control the behavior of one or more switches.

25
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:27,330
SDN has many applications including data centers, wide area

26
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,220
backbone networks, enterprise networks, internet exchange

27
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,950
points or IXPs, and home networks. Later

28
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:42,210
modules in this course will explore how software defined networks. Can solve

29
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,300
network management problems in some of these areas. In this

30
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,320
course we will focus in particular on the first three applications.
