1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I have magically deduced that you're answer is 3--tada. All right, now I'll show you how I did it.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I will not leave you in suspense for very long.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
All right, so see if we can work out what's going on here.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This region here, this county is going to have to get some color

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and it's ultimately not really going to matter which one it is.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So I'm just going to call it that. G is going to have a color that's different from H, so we'll call it that.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now, we noticed that this region touches both of these two regions

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
so it has to have a different color than both of them.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
This region touches both green and blue but not pink, so it has to be pink.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And d touches both pink and blue, so it has to be green.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And now we got these three regions and what do we know about these three regions.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Well, these two can't be green and they have to be different from each other,

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
so one of them is pink and one of them is blue and that means this one is going to have to be green,

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
but we don't know about these two.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So here's what I'm going to do, so I'm marking this sort of both pink and blue right there.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This going diagonal lines are--this one's pink, this one's blue,

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and this going diagonal lines--this one's pink and this one's blue.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Regardless, it's going to turn out not to matter.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So now you don't have to assign number to green, pink and blue--0, 1 and 2,

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
but notice that we have G-A here and G-A, no matter what numbers you assigned,

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
they're going to be the same color.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So this has value of 0. It didn't matter what color C is, C*0 is going to end being 0.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So what we're left with is D+F+H, so D+F+H and notice that each of them are different colors,

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
so no matter what numbers you assigned to those three colors,

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
we're going to have exactly one of each.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The colors get assigned number 0, 1 and 2, so the sum is going to have to be 3.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So that's the trick
