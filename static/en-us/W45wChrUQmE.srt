Being able to modify strings quickly and cleanly is probably the most commonly

00:00:03,532 --> 00:00:07,618
used programming skill. So let's practice a bunch of these. We're going to be

00:00:07,618 --> 00:00:12,068
working with the Alice Project. We've given you a program book, which does some

4
00:00:12,068 --> 00:00:16,927
magic to read in a book from a file. It's down here, but you don't have to look

5
00:00:16,927 --> 00:00:21,031
at it if you don't want to. Check out the link to the fact sheet on string

00:00:21,031 --> 00:00:25,189
methods, and then use them to complete the methods for this program.
