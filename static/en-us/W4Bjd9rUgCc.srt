1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,029
First, an IP address.

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:03,770
Can this be an anomaly?

3
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:08,290
If the IP address is not the one
that normally accessed by users or

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,960
is not well known, it can be anomaly.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,780
So this is anomaly.

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,800
Second, a port address.

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,620
Similar to the IP address, if the port
address is not normally accessed,

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,060
then this is an anomaly.

9
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,710
How about packet length?

10
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:29,650
Again, if the length is unusually long,
for example, then this is an anomaly.

11
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,009
How about flag setting on a packet?

12
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:37,310
Again, if these flags are not normally
seen under the same traffic conditions,

13
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,540
then this is an anomaly.

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,260
That is, all of these can be anomalies

15
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,060
if they are not normally seen in
normal operations of the network.
