1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,960
Let us think through this
a little bit more deeply.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,100
Does the nutritional label make all
the information explicit, David?

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,810
>> So it seems like it does, for
each given nutrient in the food,

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,310
it lists the explicit amount of that,
that is present in the food.

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,059
So it seems like it makes all
the information explicit.

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,100
>> Would you say then, it enables me
to draw the right kind of inferences?

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,440
Well, it certainly seems like it does.

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,520
So, if I'm worried about my diet and

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,270
I'm worried about how many
calories I'm consuming,

10
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,470
it tells me right there on the label
exactly how many calories it has.

11
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,320
So, I can infer the right
amount of food to eat per day.

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,840
If you're concerned with something
different in your diet, though,

13
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,200
it actually gives you the information
to make a different kind of inference.

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,050
>> What about extraneous information,
information that I may not need?

15
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,970
>> Well, that's a good point, actually.

16
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,650
Because it gives the information that
anyone might need and, as a result,

17
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,800
it's going to give information
that's extraneous to somebody.

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,560
So, for example,

19
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,970
in my diet, I might not care about
the number of carbohydrates I consume.

20
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,540
So, for me,
that's extraneous information.

21
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,750
But, for somebody else,
that's very important.

22
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,500
So it doesn't avoid
extraneous information, but

23
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,990
it would be really hard for it to do so.

24
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,790
>> What about relationships?

25
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,880
Does it make all the concepts
of all the relationships

26
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,390
between them really explicit?

27
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,000
>> So actually, now that you mention it,
Ashoke, it really doesn't.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,370
So for example, the number of calories
from fat in a particular food is based,

29
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,500
in large part,
on the amount of fat that's in it.

30
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,100
It gives the number of calories from fat
and the amount of fat in it right there

31
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,270
on the label, but it doesn't tell me
that there's a relationship there.

32
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,910
So I really can't make any inferences
based on that relationship.

33
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,980
I don't even know that
relationship exists.

34
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,270
>> So note how this connects with
the ability to make inferences.

35
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,675
Nutritional labels capture some
information that allows us to make

36
00:01:36,675 --> 00:01:39,300
good inferences,
do not capture all the information.
