00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,260
Now that we've heard from some experts,

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,750
let's take some time to put
their advice into practice.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,820
On the next screen you'll get
the repository information for a not so

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,410
well designed school
attendance application.

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,546
Clone it to your machine, check out
how it's working, and refactor it.

6
00:00:15,546 --> 00:00:16,753
Make it awesome.

7
00:00:16,753 --> 00:00:19,308
Now, it'll be up to you to
decide how to go about this.

8
00:00:19,308 --> 00:00:21,584
Is this code completely a mess?

9
00:00:21,584 --> 00:00:25,320
Is this a burn it down and
rewrite it from scratch situation?

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,690
Or are there pieces
that are salvageable?

11
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,600
Remember, before you start doing, take
a moment to figure out how it's working,

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,410
and what's good and
bad about the code as it is.

13
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,300
Evaluate how much needs to change and
figure out your strategy.

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,710
Once you're done, we'll talk
to the author of this code and

15
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,780
see what their motivations were for
building it the way they did.
