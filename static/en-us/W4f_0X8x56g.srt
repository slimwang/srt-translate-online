00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,399
The Firebase security rules are a
comprehensive set of rules that make it

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,080
easy for you to protect
files in Firebase storage.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,480
These rules can be accessed and
modified from the Firebase console.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,089
You can find the rules under
the Rules tab for storage.

5
00:00:16,089 --> 00:00:19,559
It's very similar to the security
rules for the database.

6
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:23,029
Firebase storage provides
a default security rule.

7
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:27,720
And this rule limits reading from, and
writing to all pods and storage for

8
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:29,109
authenticated users.

9
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:31,309
Just like the default database rule.

10
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:34,699
You will notice that the storage rules
look a little different than database

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,740
rules.

12
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,200
The syntax is a bit different from
the JSON base security rules for

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,750
the database.

14
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,679
Let's examine the components of
Firebase storage security rules, and

15
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:46,829
then see how they apply
to this default rule.

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,649
Every storage rule lives
under the first two blocks.

17
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:57,439
Service firebase.storage indicates that
these rules are for Firebase storage.

18
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:03,201
Match /b/your Firebase storage bucket/o
matches the path specifically for

19
00:01:03,201 --> 00:01:06,599
your particular Firebase project.

20
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:09,909
Every rule you'll add will
be under the second block.

21
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:14,149
In the same level as the match
rule that's provided by default.

22
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,710
Rules are broken down
into several key parts.

23
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:19,469
The match, the rule, and the context.

24
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:23,489
In order to fully understand
Firebase storage security rules,

25
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:27,199
we will examine each of these parts in
detail, and then put them altogether.
