00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Fernando has a question about the DH key distribution.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
He thinks the sets A and B should have primes less than p. Is that true?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In Diffie-Hellman we have the exponents a and b that are picked.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
They don't have to be related to p other than if p is very small there is no point picking

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
really large values for a and b.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
If p is really big, it's silly to pick small values of a.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The exponents are usually recommended to be at least 256 bits.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That's because there is an attacker where the work is related to the square root

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
of the size of the exponent rather than to the actual exponent.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If you want 128 bits of security, you need a 256-bit value.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You need to select a as a random value up to 256 bits.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That means if p is too small your attacker will go after p instead of focusing the attacker on a.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
There is no particular relationship between the size of a and the size of p.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
He also asks another question about Diffie-Hellman.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
He wonders why in practice it is less accepted than RSA.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This is a good question.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
They're both actually widely used in practice.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
RSA is more widely used and more talked about.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
They do different things. It's not a question of one being thought of as being more secure than the other.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The security of both depends on quite similar problems--

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Diffie-Hellman depending on the discrete log problem,

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
RSA depending on factoring.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
There is no reason to believe one of those is easier or harder than the other.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The property that Diffie-Hellman gives you is just this key agreement property.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
RSA can do more things like digital signatures and encrypting messages.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's a more versatile cipher. You can do more things with RSA.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
All you can do with Diffie-Hellman is agree on a key,

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
but there are ciphers built on top of the same ideas that Diffie-Hellman

29
00:01:54,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that can provide the same properties as RSA.
