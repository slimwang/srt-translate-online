00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,052
Now I've got five different curves over here for you, and I'd like you tell me

2
00:00:05,052 --> 00:00:10,172
which one of these represents the graph of y minus 3 equals the quatity x minus

3
00:00:10,172 --> 00:00:20,354
2 squared. So think about what replacing y with y-3 did to a curve before and

4
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:19,544
what we said replacing x with x-2 would do to a curve
