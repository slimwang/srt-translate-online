1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,526
In a couple of the problems before, we distributed the parenthesis on the

2
00:00:04,526 --> 00:00:09,352
outside to the exponents on the inside of the parenthesis. We can also do this

3
00:00:09,352 --> 00:00:14,364
with fractions. If we think all the way back to unit 1, we saw 1 3rd times 1 3rd

4
00:00:14,364 --> 00:00:19,185
times 1 3rd. We knew that result was 1 27th. We found this answer by multiplying

5
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:23,606
1 3rd by itself three times. There was actually another way we could have

6
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:27,747
thought about this. I know the exponent on this base, 1, is a 1. And the

7
00:00:27,747 --> 00:00:32,325
exponent on this base of 3 is also a 1. We can distribute this exponent of 3, or

8
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:37,047
multiply it to each of the exponents on the inside of the parentheses. So we've

9
00:00:37,047 --> 00:00:41,413
a base of 1 and an exponent of 1 times 3, and a base of 3 with an exponent of 1

10
00:00:41,413 --> 00:00:47,015
times 3. This is really 1 cubed, and this is really 3 cubed, or 1 divided by 27.

11
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:52,043
If we can get to this step more quickly, then we can get to our answer, 1 cubed

12
00:00:52,043 --> 00:00:56,983
is 1, and 3 cubed is 27. Here we have a negative sign, and we're going to square

13
00:00:56,983 --> 00:01:01,931
it, so we know our answer should be positive. So I'm going to have negative 5

14
00:01:01,931 --> 00:01:07,455
squared and x squared. So all together, we have 25 divided by x squared. This

15
00:01:07,455 --> 00:01:12,519
last case of variables works just like this first example. We'll have a to the

16
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:17,510
5th, divided by b to the 5th. We just multiply the exponents on the inside of

17
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:22,426
the parenthesis by the exponent on the outside. We raised a power to a power.
