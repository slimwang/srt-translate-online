1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now I want to talk about approximate inference

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
by means of sampling.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What do I mean by that?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Say we want to deal with a joint probability distribution,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
say the distribution of heads and tails over these 2 coins.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We can build a table and then start counting by sampling.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Here we have our first sample.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We flip the coins and the one-cent piece came up heads,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and the five-cent piece came up tails,

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
so we would mark down one count.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Then we'd toss them again.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This time the five cents is heads, and the one cent is tails,

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:00,000
so we put down a count there, and we'd repeat that process

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and keep repeating it until we got enough counts that we could estimate

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
the joint probability distribution by looking at the counts.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Now, if we do a small number of samples, the counts might not be very accurate.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
There may be some random variation that causes them not to converge

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
to their true values, but as we add more counts,

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
the counts--as we add more samples,

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
the counts we get will come closer to the true distribution.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Thus, sampling has an advantage over inference in that we know a procedure

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
for coming up with at least an approximate value for the joint probability distribution,

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
as opposed to exact inference, where the computation may be very complex.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
There's another advantage to sampling, which is if we don't know

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
what the conditional probability tables are, as we did in our other models,

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
if we don't know these numeric values, but we can simulate the process,

27
00:02:04,000 --> 99:59:59,999
we can still proceed with sampling, whereas we couldn't with exact inference.
