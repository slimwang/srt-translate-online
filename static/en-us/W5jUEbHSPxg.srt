00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,920
You've just learned how to set up a two-dimensional array, and now let's say we

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,851
want to know the price of regular gasoline of the second gas station. We supply

3
00:00:10,851 --> 00:00:16,036
two index values; the first one is the row, the second one the column. So in

4
00:00:16,036 --> 00:00:20,998
this case we're in row zero and in column one. Now you know how to access a

5
00:00:20,998 --> 00:00:25,096
particular element. You simply look up the row and the column number and plug

6
00:00:25,096 --> 00:00:30,450
them in here. What if you want to look at all elements? For example, to make a

7
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:36,505
print out of every price in the 2D array. Let's look at that next.
