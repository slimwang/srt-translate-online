00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,650
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,240
We've just finished taking in user
feedback on our low fidelity prototype,

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,920
and we've made the decision to move
on to a medium fidelity prototype.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,140
>> Now that we've made that decision
it's time to learn about medium fidelity

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,600
prototypes, interactivity,
and what tools are available.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,560
>> To do that we brought in Jonathan,
an expert on interactive prototypes.
