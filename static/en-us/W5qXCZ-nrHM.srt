1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,792
No, we can't necassarily say Andy's more unpopular, even though he has less

2
00:00:03,792 --> 00:00:08,430
Twitter followers than I have Facebook friends. Because look at the

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,270
distributions, they're both different and we can compare them by looking at

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,849
them on the scale. In other words, in terms of their unique standard

5
00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:21,841
deviations. This is called standardizing the distributions, using 0 as our

6
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:26,816
reference point. When we standardize Andy's and my individual scores, I am

7
00:00:26,816 --> 00:00:31,888
further from the mean. Our standardized scores show us the proportion that have

8
00:00:31,888 --> 00:00:36,600
a lower or higher score in that distribution. In the distribution of Facebook

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,620
friends, there's a greater proportion of people with more friends than me, than

10
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:46,876
the proportion of people with more Twitter followers than Andy. So basically

11
00:00:46,876 --> 00:00:48,713
I'm more unpopular.
