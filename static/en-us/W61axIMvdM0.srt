00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,170
Now that we've given you an overview and

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:06,320
established a strategic mindset,
we'll go through each LinkedIn section.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,710
Let's begin with the professional
profile picture.

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:12,430
The picture though technically optional,
is highly recommended.

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,460
It's your first chance to communicate
that you are friendly, likeable and

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,770
trustworthy.

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,010
It also helps ensure that you
are human and not a robot.

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,380
A strong profile image
should look like you.

9
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,020
It should be a recent photo that
reflects how you would look if you

10
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,670
showed up for an interview.

11
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,680
That means keep the glasses, hair, and
make up consistent to your normal look.

12
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,070
Secondly, you should keep
the focus in your face.

13
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,630
Make sure that your image has your
face taking up about 60% of the frame.

14
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,280
If you don't have a perfectly framed
picture, you can always crop it.

15
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,090
Your photos should also show that you
are friendly and approachable, and

16
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,880
be sure to select a photo that fits
with the industry's work culture.

17
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,040
This means if your target job is formal,
wear business attire, or if you work at

18
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,660
the more casual environment,
work clothing that fits this vibe.

19
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,310
Finally, keep the background simple.

20
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,315
The focus should be on you, so
opt for muted or solid colours.
