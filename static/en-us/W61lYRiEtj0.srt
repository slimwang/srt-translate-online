>> We know that if we want to write this in the form x plus a times x plus b,

2
00:00:04,357 --> 00:00:09,176
that in this case, a times b will equal negative 150, and a plus b will equal

3
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:13,900
25. Since a times b is negative, either a or b needs to be negative and the

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,892
other needs to be positive. So what are some things that multiply it to equal

5
00:00:18,892 --> 00:00:24,994
negative 150? Well, there's negative 1 times 150. There's negative 3 times 50.

6
00:00:24,994 --> 00:00:31,084
There's negative 5 times 30. Oh, it looks like that one will work since, as we

7
00:00:31,084 --> 00:00:37,192
know, 25 is equal to 30 minus 5. So the equation now should read x plus 30 times

8
00:00:37,192 --> 00:00:38,634
x minus 5 equals 0.
