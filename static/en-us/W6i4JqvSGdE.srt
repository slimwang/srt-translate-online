00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,930
Well, we want to get x on one side of the equation. So let's subtract x from

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:12,075
both sides. I'll get negative x plus zx plus zy equals 0. Remember, I can't

3
00:00:12,075 --> 00:00:16,560
combine this negative x with either this term or this term since the variables

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,710
are completely different. To isolate these two terms that have x, I subtract zy

5
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:28,754
from both sides. This gives me negative x plus zx equals negative zy. Now, this

6
00:00:28,754 --> 00:00:33,910
equation doesn't quite match any of these. So there must be something else I can

7
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:38,706
do. Well, let's multiply this equation through by a negative 1. If we multiply

8
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:43,284
every term by a negative 1, we really change all of these signs. This will

9
00:00:43,284 --> 00:00:47,773
become positive, this will become negative and this will become positive. So x

10
00:00:47,773 --> 00:00:55,952
minus zx is equal to zy. Well, that would be this one here, x minus zx equal to

11
00:00:55,952 --> 00:01:00,614
zy. This equation has just been flipped over. This was the tough way to do it.

12
00:01:00,615 --> 00:01:04,732
Let me show you a quicker way. We know we want to get these x terms alone on one

13
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:09,710
side of the equation. So if we just subtract zx from both sides, we get there a

14
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:15,440
lot quicker. Zy is equal to x minus zx. This is where your algebra skills can

15
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,440
come into play. If you think a little bit forward you can predict what you're

16
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,913
going to get. Try and choose the simpler method. Having two x terms isolated on

17
00:01:23,913 --> 00:01:28,122
the right side of the equation is the same as having x terms isolated on the

18
00:01:28,122 --> 00:01:33,363
left side of the equation. This one just happens to be much easier.
