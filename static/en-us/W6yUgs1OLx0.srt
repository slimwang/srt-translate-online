1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,460
In the 1980s,
Richard Grinold was seeking a method of

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,890
relating performance, skill,
and breadth in investing.

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:13,470
So for instance,
you might be a very skilled investor,

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,900
meaning that you can pick stocks well,
but

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:22,610
you might not have many opportunities or
breadth to exercise that skill.

6
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:27,830
So Grinold felt that there must
be some equation whereby we could

7
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:32,509
combine skill and breadth to
create an estimate of performance.

8
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:34,880
He developed a relationship he called

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,350
the Fundamental Law of
Active Portfolio Management.

10
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:42,660
I'm going to state it here at the
beginning of the lesson, and then spend

11
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,950
the rest of the lesson trying to justify
it and show you why it makes sense.

12
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,370
And here's his expression,

13
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:53,730
performance is equal to skill
times the square root of breadth.

14
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,630
So we need some measure of skill and
some measure of breadth.

15
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:03,180
So if you want to improve your
performance you can improve skill, or

16
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,170
you can find more and
more applications or methods or

17
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,620
opportunities for applying that skill.

18
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,520
So, as an example breadth might relate
to how many stocks you invest in and

19
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,120
skill relates to your
skill in choosing them.

20
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,680
So, again you can invest in
either improving your skill or

21
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,520
improving your breadth.

22
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,780
So performance is summarized in
something called information ratio,

23
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,870
which is very much like the sharpe
ratio that we've discussed before, but

24
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:38,850
it refers to the sharpe ratio of excess
returns, in other words the manner

25
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:44,460
in which the portfolio manager is
exceeding the market's performance.

26
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,990
Skill is summarized in something
called Information coefficient and

27
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,050
and breadth is just how many
trading opportunities we have.

28
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:53,600
Okay.
So,

29
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,010
we'll expand more and more on
this as we go through the lesson.
