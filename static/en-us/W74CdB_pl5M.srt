1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,850
So one of the questions we always have is what causes outliers?

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,470
And I give you a couple of hypotheses,

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,590
one is sensor malfunction, one is data entry errors.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:13,750
If someone types in data by hand, it's really easy to just get a digit wrong.

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,770
One is aliens, and one is freak events.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:17,560
Things that happen very,

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,380
very rarely, but they do happen, and they might even be important.

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,470
Sort of like plausible ways to explain outliers.
