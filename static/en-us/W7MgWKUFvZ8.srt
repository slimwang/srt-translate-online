00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,787
This is the point where our line intersects the x axis. They meet right here and

2
00:00:04,787 --> 00:00:09,294
this is the point where our line intersects the y axis. They meet here. Now

3
00:00:09,294 --> 00:00:14,046
thinking back to before, what are the coordinates of this x intercept and this y

4
00:00:14,046 --> 00:00:16,458
intercept? Write the numbers in here.
