1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So now it's time for a quiz to see if you understand the differences between

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
CBC mode and Counter mode.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So the question is: If Alice wants to quickly encrypt a large file

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and she's got a multi-core machine, or she's got access to a large distributed

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
computing resource, which of these two modes will allow her to encrypt the file

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
more quickly? The choices are that it doesn't matter--that CBC mode would

7
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
be faster or that CTR mode would be faster.
