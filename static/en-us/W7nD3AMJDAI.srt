00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'm here with Isabelle Stanton, who is a PhD student at Berkeley,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and she works on theory of computation.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So what are you working on?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Lately I've been working in computational economics,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
which is this exciting thing that really Berkeley focuses on,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
so looking at problems that economists face

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and see whether or not we can develop algorithms and ways to solve this.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So particularly the thing that I've been working on has been computational social choice.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Social choice functions are ones that aggregate people's preferences.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So think about this as a voting mechanism.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Everybody gets to say, "I prefer Candidate A to Candidate B to Candidate C,"

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and then we take everyone's votes and we output some kind of winner.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And you'd really like this winner to be the one most people prefer or something.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The problem that I've been specifically looking at is that back in the 1970s

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Gibbard and Satterthwaite showed that for any kind of reasonable voting mechanism

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
it's going to be susceptible to manipulation.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So is this like when someone doesn't vote for their preferred candidate

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
because they think it's going to be better for them

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
if they vote for sort of the more popular, less preferred candidate? >>Exactly.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So if you knew that your favorite person was the underdog

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and there was no way, you might change your vote

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
so that way your second favorite person would be the one that's elected.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We've been specifically looking at Binary Cup voting protocols,

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
which are familiar to people as single elimination tournaments.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So how could someone manipulate a tournament like this?

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The tournament organizer is allowed to pick the seeding of the players,

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and that's the bracket, that's in each round who plays against who.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
For example, I can show you over here on the computer.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Here on this slide we have actually the Women's World Cup.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The seeding is this picking of Germany versus Japan, Sweden versus Australia.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If I wanted something else to happen,

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
maybe I could have picked a different initial seeding here,

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
like maybe I have Sweden play England,

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and that would end up with a different result out of the tournament.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Let's go over a simple example.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Everyone is familiar with the game rock, paper, scissors.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And in computer science we like things to be a power of 2,

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
so let's add in hand grenade so that way we have 4 players.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So we've got rock, paper, scissors, hand grenade.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Now we can look at 2 different tournament brackets that have different winners.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So if we have rock, hand grenade, paper, scissors,

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
first rock wins this match-up and then scissors wins here

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and then rock wins the total bracket.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
If, on the other hand, we have rock face paper and scissors face hand grenade,

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
then paper knocks out rock, hand grenade still wins,

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and hand grenade is the final winner.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So the tournament manipulation problem is to figure out if there's a bracket

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
so that your favorite player wins, like this,

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
given information about the match outcomes.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm not sure if this explains how the US lost the Women's World Cup,

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
but we'll leave that as an open problem.
