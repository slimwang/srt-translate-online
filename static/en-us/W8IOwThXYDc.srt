00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's say we have a variant of the SAT problem called MAX-SAT

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
where instead of the question

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
does the boolean formula have a satisfying assignment

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
we'd rather like to know what is the maximum number of clauses

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
in a given boolean formula that can be satisfied?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's say we have an algorithm for deciding this,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
or rather, approximating it, where first we simply assign

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
true or false randomly to all variables,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and we count the number of satisfied clauses with this assignment.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Then we invert the assignment of all variables, that is,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
we flip true to false and false to true for every variable,

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and finally, we count the number of satisfied clauses

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
with this new inverted assignment.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Now, my question to you is what is the approximation factor of this algorithm?

15
00:00:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And please enter the number in this box below.
