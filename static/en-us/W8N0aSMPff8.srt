1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,750
Visualizations like this one are a core component of exploratory

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,840
data analysis. We're going to be using the R programming

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,756
language to create these types of visualizations and to explore

4
00:00:09,756 --> 00:00:12,340
data throughout the course. You can read more about the R

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,510
programming language and how it was developed by clicking on

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,773
the link in the instructor notes. We'll also learn about RStudio,

7
00:00:18,773 --> 00:00:22,380
which is this program. It's a graphical user interface for

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,410
programming in R. You'll learn all about RStudio in the next

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,010
lesson, and future lessons will cover visualization and statistical

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,040
techniques for data exploration. We'll start by examining one variable

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,600
at a time in a dataset. This will give us

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,660
an idea of its underlining distribution and what type of

13
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,040
values the variable takes on. Eventually our visualizations will

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,390
become more complex as we look at pairs of variables

15
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,880
and multiple variables all at once. At the end of

16
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,460
the course you'll have the chance to conduct your own

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,880
exploratory data analysis. I hope you're getting excited

18
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,020
to explore data. See you in the next lesson.
