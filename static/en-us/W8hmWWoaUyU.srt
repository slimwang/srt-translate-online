00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,626
There is no correct answer for which is better, a left-handed or a right-handed

2
00:00:04,626 --> 00:00:08,646
one of the other. May be more convenient for people or intelligent rabbits,

3
00:00:08,646 --> 00:00:13,120
depending on a situation. One other area in computer graphics where opinions

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,260
vary is whether the y-axis or the z-axis should be on the up direction.

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:22,600
Architects tend to think in terms of floor plans, so the x and y-axes, our

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,612
directions on the ground, and z is then the height. However, another common way

7
00:00:27,612 --> 00:00:31,010
to think about coordinate system is with respect to our display. Looking at a

8
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:35,784
monitor and starting on the lower left-hand corner, the x-axis goes to the

9
00:00:35,784 --> 00:00:39,949
right, the y-axis goes up. If we want to present a right headed coordinate

10
00:00:39,949 --> 00:00:44,114
system with respect to the monitor, the z-axis then points towards us. We'll see

11
00:00:44,114 --> 00:00:48,097
this type of definition in a later unit where we cover how to define a camera.

12
00:00:48,098 --> 00:00:53,142
The difference between these two coordinate systems is just a 90 degree rotation

13
00:00:53,142 --> 00:00:57,562
along the x-axis. So, it's easy enough to fix. We'll talk about rotations in a

14
00:00:57,562 --> 00:01:01,648
later unit, too. However, you've now been warned. If you read in some models

15
00:01:01,648 --> 00:01:05,534
some day into your program and the object is sideways, it's probably because the

16
00:01:05,534 --> 00:01:08,673
models up direction is different than what you're expecting.
