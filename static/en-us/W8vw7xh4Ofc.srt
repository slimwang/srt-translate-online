00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,360
Let us do another exercise together. We have identified the type of each of

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,960
these junctions. Let us now use, the constraints for

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:13,220
each type of junction to identify the type of each of these edges. For

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,440
each of these boxes, right? Either fold or blade for the type of the edge.
