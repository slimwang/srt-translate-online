1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,120
Well, judgi- oh, time.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:06,310
>> Yes. So, we shouldn't be approving any bookings if there isn't

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,640
an actual time for them to be booked at. because then it's incomplete.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,280
>> So, use this approval process if set time

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,725
is equals blank and just kind of just leave it blank?

6
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:17,750
>> Is not equal to blank. Because if.

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,160
>> All right, Sorry. Not equal to blank.

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:19,830
>> Yeah.

9
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,090
>> So this means if, if a time is

10
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:24,130
set, then we need to see an approval process.

11
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,060
>> Yeah. In order to set an approval

12
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,150
process, you have to push the Submit for

13
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,320
Approval button, but if they push that button and

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,680
there is no time set, it shouldn't fire this

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,750
approval process, because it's not ready to be approved.

16
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:36,540
>> Gotcha.

17
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,130
>> So you can leave that blank.

18
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:38,340
>> Blank.

19
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:38,650
>> Yeah.

20
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:39,610
>> Makes sense.
