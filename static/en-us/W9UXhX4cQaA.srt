Here's a question for you. Say, it takes roughly the same amount of time to

2
00:00:04,683 --> 00:00:08,927
compute the lighting at a vertex as it does per pixel. You're trying to get some

3
00:00:08,927 --> 00:00:12,290
idea of how much more expensive it is to draw objects using the material

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,151
evaluation, using fragment shading instead of vertex shading. In other words,

5
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:19,900
Phong shading instead of Gouraud shading. Say your object and application has

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,237
the following characteristics. Each vertex on the mesh is squared by an average

7
00:00:24,237 --> 00:00:28,698
of 5 triangles. That is, any vertex where we compute the materials color can be

8
00:00:28,698 --> 00:00:33,809
shared among 5 triangles. On average, each triangle covers 60 pixels. Don't

9
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:38,920
worry about visibility. Assume the pixel shader is evaluated for all of these

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,153
pixels in a triangle. So, the question to you is how many reflection evaluations

11
00:00:44,153 --> 00:00:48,973
are needed for, per pixel versus per vertex shading? In other words Phong versus

12
00:00:48,973 --> 00:00:49,915
Gouraud Shading.
