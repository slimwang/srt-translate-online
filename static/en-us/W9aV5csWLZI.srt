00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,493
>> So you're pretty proficient at this point at multiplying polynomials

2
00:00:03,493 --> 00:00:07,333
together. And then of course simplifying what you get. But if we can work from

3
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:11,415
having two binomials. Binomials are just polynomials with two terms in them. We

4
00:00:11,415 --> 00:00:15,309
can work from having those multiplied together to having something that looks

5
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:19,692
sort of quadratic. We should be able to start with something quadratic and work

6
00:00:19,692 --> 00:00:24,371
backwards, to having binomials multiplied together. And the problem with Grant,

7
00:00:24,371 --> 00:00:28,637
we're trying to go that direction. So let's say we have some simple quadratic

8
00:00:28,637 --> 00:00:32,894
expressions, like x squared, plus 5x, plus 6. Can we figure out how to factor

9
00:00:32,894 --> 00:00:37,022
this, based on patterns in the above equation? The x squareds correspond

10
00:00:37,022 --> 00:00:40,975
directly, and the 6, and the ab, are both constant terms, so they must go

11
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:45,407
together. If this middle term, the 5x and ax plus bx that are going to be a

12
00:00:45,407 --> 00:00:49,464
little bit more tricky. So let's focus on this part of the term.
