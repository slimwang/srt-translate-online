1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,290
Now this quiz is actually a pseudo quiz.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,760
By that I mean it's not designed
to test what you've learned.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,440
Rather it asks you to make
an educated guess and

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,040
in coming up with that guess hopefully
you learn something in the process.

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,880
Start by recalling
the dynamic power equation.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,140
Notice that it has 4 nobs for
controlling power.

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,530
The first is the capacitance of
the circuit element, like a gate.

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,040
The second is the supply
voltage of the circuit.

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,670
The third is the clock rate or
the clock frequency.

10
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,960
Lastly, there's the activity factor.

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,695
The activity factor was
the frequency of state changes

12
00:00:32,695 --> 00:00:35,035
relative to elapsed cycles.

13
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,135
Now put on your algorithm and
software hat.

14
00:00:38,135 --> 00:00:42,275
Do you have any guesses or intuition
about which of these knobs might

15
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:45,365
be within the control of algorithms and
software?

16
00:00:45,365 --> 00:00:48,075
I want you to think about it,
and if you don't know, it's okay.

17
00:00:48,075 --> 00:00:50,235
In fact, it's a little bit
of a research question, and

18
00:00:50,235 --> 00:00:52,970
there isn't necessarily a right or
wrong answer.

19
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,400
The main point of this pseudo-quiz
is to make sure that you stop and

20
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,930
think about the question before
I tell you what I think.
