1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,920
Let's think some more about the size and
the shape of the view point.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,650
Think about the way you use devices.

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:11,650
Phones and tablets are often used in
portrait orientation whereas a full

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:16,906
screen browser window on
a laptop is landscape.

5
00:00:16,906 --> 00:00:21,720
Now, even though you can't change
the window size on a phone or tablet,

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,230
these devices.

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:28,260
Have another rather tricky feature
when it comes to responsive resizing.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,310
Orientation can change, and
when it comes to landscape and portrait,

9
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,620
you need to think about
content as well as size.

10
00:00:35,645 --> 00:00:39,075
Tola square images can work well
in portrait mode on a phone but

11
00:00:39,075 --> 00:00:42,425
wide images can be a real problem.

12
00:00:42,425 --> 00:00:45,605
Again for responsive design
the golden rule is don't

13
00:00:45,605 --> 00:00:48,376
assume the viewport size
will always stay the same.

14
00:00:49,707 --> 00:00:53,507
You'll learn the impact of image choice
and art direction later in the course

15
00:00:53,507 --> 00:00:55,737
when you find out how to
use the picture element.

16
00:00:55,737 --> 00:00:56,777
And later in this lesson,

17
00:00:56,777 --> 00:01:00,217
we'll look at ways to work with
orientation using media queries.
