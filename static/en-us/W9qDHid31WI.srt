1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:05,420
Chi-square test for goodness-of-fit look at how well our observed values match

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:10,950
our expected values for a certain variable. For example, this variable could be

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:16,340
your response to the question do you like ice cream? Response one would be yes.

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,830
Response two would be no. But of course there might be a whole number of

5
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:26,230
responses for a particular variable like which season do you prefer? In that

6
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,695
case there would be four responses, spring, summer, winter, fall. But

7
00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:34,820
chi-square tests can also help us determine whether or not two variables are

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,910
independent. In a chi-square test for independence, instead of just having the

9
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:44,828
observed and expected values in the two rows, we'll be looking at the number of

10
00:00:44,828 --> 00:00:50,020
participants or subjects who answered response one for variable one. And

11
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:54,710
response one for variable two or the number who answered response two for

12
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:59,980
variable one and response one for variable two, etcetera. We're going to

13
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,560
illustrate the chi-square test for independence with a real research example.
