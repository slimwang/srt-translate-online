1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,630
Down here there's a message
informing the user about which item

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,010
they've chosen.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,260
In this case,
we haven't selected anything yet, so

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,850
it assumes we're starving and
tells us to pick something.

5
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,010
If I pick something to eat
like strawberry pudding,

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,500
the message changes to remind
me which item I've selected.

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,529
Now how does Backbone
handle monitoring events?

8
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,960
In app.js we have a view for
the SelectedItem message.

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,310
Just like before we get the template
from the DOM, convert it to a string,

10
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,660
and pass it to underscore's
template function.

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,640
These buttons are part
of a MenuItemView, and

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,209
that's where the button and the
SelectedItem message are wired together.

13
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,220
This is where we set up the events for
each menu item.

14
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,212
When something with a class
of SelectedItem is clicked,

15
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:48,320
JavaScript will call the selectItem
function which is right here.

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,620
Backbone creates a record of all
the events it needs to listen for.

17
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,360
It keeps track of everything that needs
to happen when that event actually runs.

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,450
And when the event occurs, it triggers
all the code that needs to run.

19
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,600
We're going to look at Backbone's
on function in isolation,

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,519
this way we can really
focus on how it works.

21
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,200
Let's first create an empty object.

22
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,789
Now we'll take this empty object and add
in all of Backbone's event functions.

23
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,340
Since it has Backbone's on method,
I can now set up an event for

24
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,540
this object to listen for.

25
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,890
Finally, I'll trigger that event and
pass it some data.

26
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,680
Backbone took this string and
passed it to the callback function and

27
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,800
logged out this message.

28
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,970
Let's dive into on and
see how it's doing this.
