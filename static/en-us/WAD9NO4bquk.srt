00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Here I've written a Python procedure called uptoten.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
If the argument you pass in in less than 10,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
it returns that argument, so if you pass in 5, it's going to return 5.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But it clamps values at 10. If you pass in 15, I'm just going to return 10.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I just showed you the similarity between Python and JavaScript before.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I would like you to write a JavaScript program.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Because we're going to be write a web browser that deals with JavaScript as strings,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I would like you to write your JavaScript program as one big string constant.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Call it "javascript" and submit via the interpreter.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You should declare a JavaScript function called uptoten

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
that takes and argument x and does exactly the same thing as this Python one.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Translate this Python code into JavaScript and then put it in this big string.
