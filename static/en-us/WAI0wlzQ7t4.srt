Since this new client-side validation,

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,860
doesn't use Javascript directly, disabling Javascript,

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:10,330
won't actually disable it. But, older browsers might not recognize that

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,420
input type and then it lets the user type in whatever

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,380
they want. And in general, it's

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,390
fairly easy, to, circumvent client-side validation.
