00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:01,870
I'm sitting here with Nick Artman.

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:04,140
He's one of our lead front end web developers.

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,130
Thanks for sitting with me.

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:05,950
>> Sure thing.

5
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:10,480
>> So wh, I was learning JavaScript, I had this feeling that if I

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,690
don't do it all by hand, if I don't actually write all of the code,

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:20,120
then that makes me somehow less able or less awesome or something like that.

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,490
I felt some shame around using frameworks and libraries.

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,300
What are your thoughts?

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,800
>> That's actually a misconception that I've

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,710
encountered amongst a lot of people.

12
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,510
Because as engineers we want to build a lot of things and

13
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,190
we want to make sure that we prove that we can do it.

14
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,950
And while it's interesting to experiment with new technologies and

15
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,010
with trying to replicate things that you've seen other people doing,

16
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,770
the core of good engineering is taking what has been built before.

17
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,050
What is well tested, what is documented, like a good framework or library.

18
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,850
And using it to build something even greater.

19
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:51,470
>> Mm. Okay.

20
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,500
That sounds really good actually.

21
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,400
So how frequently would you say you

22
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,420
tend to use libraries versus just writing code on your own?

23
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,090
>> So I in fact, use libraries and frameworks every day.

24
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:06,770
For example, on our site, we use the Underscore library to help fill in

25
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,130
bits that JavaScript doesn't have natively.

26
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:13,250
And we use the Angular JS framework to give us automatic updating of

27
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,320
our page when we modify our data model, and advanced features like that,

28
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,220
that would take us a lot of time to write ourselves, but the Angular team at,

29
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,677
works on that as their full time job, which benefits everyone in the community.

30
00:01:24,677 --> 00:01:28,220
>> So rather than writing it all from scratch you just use a library or

31
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,240
framework that's really well tested and solidly built.

32
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,810
And it sounds like you write a lot of code in frameworks.

33
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:35,900
>> Absolutely!

34
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,270
And there's no shame in it.

35
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:41,080
In fact, it is leveraging the work of other people to make your work go

36
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,010
even further.

37
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,180
>> So if someone came to you and

38
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,290
said, hey, I like to write everything from scratch.

39
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,370
Would you hire them?

40
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:51,600
>> I would tell them I love their tenacity and I love their drive, but

41
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,260
I'd want to sit down with them and show them that they can take other's work,

42
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,270
such as jQuery and Angular and many libraries and

43
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:03,010
many frameworks out there, and build upon them, and make an app that is theirs.

44
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:07,890
Not just kind of a rewrite of something that somebody else has already solved.

45
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,730
>> Mm. >> It's always great to advance the state of the art, but, except for

46
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,100
learning, you don't want to just reinvent the wheel.

47
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,010
>> Mm.

48
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:15,540
Got it.

49
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,980
Awesome. Well, thanks for sitting with me.

50
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,480
>> Sure thing.
