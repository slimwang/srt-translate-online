00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,780
As an entrepreneur thinking
about how you take feedback and

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,010
how you figure out how you incorporate
that feedback into your business.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,770
I think the most important thing is,

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,040
as an entrepreneur can
you take a step back?

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,870
Can you back away from maybe a narrow
problem you're trying to solve right

6
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,450
now, and really look at the big picture?

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,400
And can you take the feedback that's
coming in and apply it to the big

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,330
picture, without being so distracted
from what's happening in the weeds?

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,060
In particular for early stage companies,
if you look at the founders and

10
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,360
the co-founders, you know, they're
selling the product, they're building

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,350
the product, they're marketing it,
they're doing customer service.

12
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,750
And sometimes you can get so

13
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,660
focused on the detail, that when
somebody provides you feedback,

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,510
you don't understand how to take it,
unless you can really step back.

15
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,200
And that's a really important
attribute of a founder,

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,200
is can you step back from all of
the detail that you're working on and

17
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,210
incorporate the feedback
that's coming in.

18
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,660
And change directions if you need to.
