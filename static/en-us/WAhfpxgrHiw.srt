1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,820
Now that we have already seen how to split the data,

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,320
we will do some data cleaning.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,300
Remember we have already decided that the location can be

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,840
represented as the distance from a point of reference.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,730
We will go into depth a little bit later.

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,830
As to which distance function among these three might work best.

7
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:26,470
We will also need to decide on the times when we calculate these distances.

8
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:31,230
The distances at each time is a feature in our model.

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:37,860
We will also need to decide at what time intervals we choose these distances,

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,380
so that we can have adequate number of features.

11
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,760
We have now switched to the iPython Notebook again.

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,310
We're going to run the code to clean the data.

13
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:55,500
The code in block five takes the date and time, combines it into one

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,200
timestamp quantity, and makes the value reflective of US specific time.

15
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,400
It also makes sure that if some values of date or time is absent or

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,550
is equals, equals none those data points are not used in the analysis.

17
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,400
So let us run the code again by pressing the play buttons.

18
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,535
After you have finished running through lines six, seven, and

19
00:01:21,535 --> 00:01:23,500
eight you will see an output.

20
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,060
The output has 128,520 entries.

21
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:37,480
This is down from 128,561 entries we started with.

22
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,950
The reduced number of events is a result of cleaning the data.
