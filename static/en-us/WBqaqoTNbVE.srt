1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
That actually does it for Unit 6.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We basically got to the main points that I wanted to tell you about.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I wanted to kind of express the notion of NP completeness and give you a chance

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
to play with that a little bit, and in the homework, we're going to look at that in a little bit more depth.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So I will give you more practice problems to think about.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
In a smaller class, you would probably be writing proofs, but for this class,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
you're going to write some programs and do some multiple choice questions.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So good luck on the homework, hang in there. We're almost done.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The next unit is just going to be interviews and a song that I put together for you,

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and a kind of a summary of what we did in these units.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So thanks a lot for listening.
