1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,189
At this point, you should have
a project at your Firebase console.

2
00:00:04,519 --> 00:00:07,929
And in the friendly chat folder on your
machine, if you go to the app folder,

3
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:11,869
you should have moved your
google-services.json file here.

4
00:00:11,869 --> 00:00:14,789
Now it's time to actually open
your project in Android Studio and

5
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:15,259
see it run.

6
00:00:16,429 --> 00:00:18,929
Here I've got mine
running in an emulator.

7
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:22,730
Now Firebase needs a recent version of
Google Play services installed to be

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:23,250
able to run.

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,760
So, like I am here,
make sure that you're up and

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,260
running with the Google Play services.

11
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,368
We've provided full instructions
in the notes which,

12
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:35,420
I'm providing instructions in the notes
to get you started if you're having any

13
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,950
trouble getting an emulator set up.

14
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:39,719
If everything goes well
though you should be,

15
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,259
like me, looking at an app on your
computer that looks like this.

16
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:45,640
This is a great starting point for
friendly chat.

17
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,570
Let's go ahead and familiarize ourselves
with the code that's already here.
