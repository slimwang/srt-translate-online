00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,030
In this lesson we built the movie
manager and an API client for

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,420
the Movie Database.

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,260
We also talked about the different
authorization flows that you might

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,120
see when you build apps.

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,110
You'll want to remember this lesson
well because the principles taught here

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,140
are really going to help you when you
start building more complex apps.

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,660
So before we head into
the final lesson of the course,

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,430
let us know what you've learned as well
as any feedback on how we can improve.
