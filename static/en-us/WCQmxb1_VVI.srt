00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,040
So I've got my string awesomeThoughts and

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,560
it's saved as My name is Cameron and I am AWESOME!

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,410
I'm going to create a new variable called funThoughs and I'm going to use

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:17,170
the replace method to replace the word AWESOME from awesomeThoughts, with FUN.

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,667
Once I've done that, I'm going to use the jQuery selector here for

6
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:24,620
the main id and I'll append our new funThoughts variable.

7
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,520
Save that, come over to the browser and

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,930
hit Refresh, and we see that my name is Cameron and I am FUN
