00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,021
In general, when we want to compute the slope of a line, we look at two points.

2
00:00:04,021 --> 00:00:08,524
We can label these points P1 and P2. We use a subscript to indicate which point

3
00:00:08,524 --> 00:00:12,264
it is. Now, these points could have any coordinates. So it'd be really

4
00:00:12,264 --> 00:00:16,294
unspecific or general in mathematical speak. We're just going to say that this

5
00:00:16,294 --> 00:00:20,657
point has some x coordinate and some y coordinate. We'll label the point x sub 1

6
00:00:20,657 --> 00:00:25,023
and y sub 1. The 1 is a subscript and it tells us which point we're on.

7
00:00:25,023 --> 00:00:29,643
Likewise, I could label this point x sub 2, y sub 2. We know slope is the ratio

8
00:00:29,643 --> 00:00:33,898
of the rise divided by the run. So this distance would just be the rise. If I

9
00:00:33,898 --> 00:00:38,486
wanted to find the rise between these two points, I would want to look at the y

10
00:00:38,486 --> 00:00:43,684
values. I would want to know how these y values changed. For example, if this y

11
00:00:43,684 --> 00:00:48,787
value was 5 and this y value was 3, I would just subtract them to figure out the

12
00:00:48,787 --> 00:00:53,832
rise. It'd be 2. We can see that the vertical distance or the rise is just the

13
00:00:53,832 --> 00:00:59,011
difference between the two y values, y2 minus y1. Knowing this information about

14
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:03,423
the rise, which of the following do you think could represent the run? Is it the

15
00:01:03,423 --> 00:01:07,911
sum of the x coordinates, the difference of the x coordinates or the difference

16
00:01:07,911 --> 00:01:09,152
of the y coordinates?
