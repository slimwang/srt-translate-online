1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,580
Let's return to the problem of guaranteeing

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,490
origin and path authentication. To guarantee these

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,550
properties there is a proposal to modify

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,810
the existing border gateway protocol to add signatures

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,610
to various parts of the route advertisement.

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,880
This proposal is sometimes called Secure BGP

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,610
or BGPSEC The proposal has two different

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,760
parts. The first part is an origin attestation,

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,160
which is a certificate that binds the IP

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,850
prefix to the organization that owns that prefix,

11
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,850
including the origin AS. This is sometimes also

12
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,480
called an address attestation. Now, this certificate must

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,160
be signed by a trusted party. That trusted

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,190
party might be, for example, a routing registry

15
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,410
or the organization that allocated that prefix to

16
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,120
that organization in the first place. The second

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,410
part of BGPSEC is what's called a path attestation which are a

18
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:01,440
set of signatures that accompany the AS path as it is advertised from

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,080
one AS to the next. Let's have a closer look at BGPSEC's

20
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,480
path attestation and the types of attacks that it can and cannot prevent.
