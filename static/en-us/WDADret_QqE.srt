1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,760
Let's now do a residual outlier rejection.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,870
Let's assume we remove point B, we now refit the line with linear regression.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,440
Would the new regression line after outlier rejections, be steeper, shallower or

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,070
would the steepness of the line be unchanged?

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:14,890
Check one of the three
