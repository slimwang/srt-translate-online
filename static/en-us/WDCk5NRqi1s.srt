1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,019
Let's look at what each side of each of these equations simplifies to, to

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,850
figure out which equations are true. How about we start with this equation up

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,840
here. And let's go with the left hand side first. Inside the parentheses here,

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:19,420
we have 100 times 1000 which is 100,000, or 10 to the 5th power That means that

5
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,780
this side of the equation is equal to log base 10 of 10 to the 5th, and we know

6
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:28,822
that that is just equal to 5. Great. Now, on the other side we have log base 10

7
00:00:28,822 --> 00:00:34,394
of 100 plus log base 10 of 1000. So, this is the same as log base 10 of 10

8
00:00:34,394 --> 00:00:40,460
squared. Plus log based ten of ten cubed. That's just two plus three, or five.

9
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,750
So, this equation does check out. This side is equal to this side, which means

10
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,060
it is a true statement. Awesome. Let's go for our second one. We know that log

11
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:53,990
based ten of 100 is 2 and we know that log based ten of 1,000 is three. So that

12
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:58,820
means that this side is equal to 2 times 3 or 6. Now over here, we're adding

13
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,420
those two numbers we just multiplied. Log base 10 of 100, plus log base10 of

14
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:09,870
1000, as we saw on this side, is just equal to 2 plus 3, or 5. 6 is not equal

15
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:14,030
to 5, so this is not a true statement. And our third equation, finally. On the

16
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:20,570
left hand side we have log based 10 of 1,100. Let's see using our calculator,

17
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:28,414
what that equals. Log of 1,100 equals 3.04139 and so on. Let's write that down,

18
00:01:28,414 --> 00:01:32,880
I'll just write some of the numbers, we know that it's rounded on the

19
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,450
calculator anyway. On to the right hand side. Now notice that this expression

20
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,690
is exactly the same as the one we already evaluated. On the left-hand side of

21
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:46,793
the previous equation. So we know that this, log base 10 of 100 times log base

22
00:01:46,793 --> 00:01:53,860
10 of 1,000, equals 6. Now, 3.04 anything is not equal to six, so this equation

23
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:58,680
is not true either. The first equation we had is the only example of the

24
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,270
product property being used properly. The two numbers that we multiplied and

25
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,470
then plugged in as the input of our first log expression, each act as the

26
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:11,800
inputs for these separate logs over here that are then added together. We have

27
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,650
to be super careful about which numbers are multiplying and which quantities

28
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,271
we're adding when we use the product property. Great job.
