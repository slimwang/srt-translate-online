1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,920
Here's my solution. I begin by opening the file, with

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,280
read and write permissions, and then I read from the file.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,230
Remember, it goes key value, key value. So, this first

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:13,300
read, will represent a key. I check to make sure that

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,350
I read in as much as I intended, and assuming

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,250
that that goes okay, I enter this loop here. I first

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,200
check the key to see if it's the value that

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,300
I'm looking for. If it's not, then I simply move the

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,700
cursor past the associated value and then read

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,000
in the next key. If it does match,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,880
however, then I want to overwrite the value with

12
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,830
the new one, close the file descriptor, and exit

13
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:40,720
with success. If I ever reach the end of the file or if a read fails for

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,860
any reason, I can simply print that the

15
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,350
key is not found and then exit with failure.
