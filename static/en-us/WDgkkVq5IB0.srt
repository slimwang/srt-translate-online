1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And the answer here is that we need to say something about

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
the length of the formula, because as you know,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
we are measuring running time as a function of the size of the input.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Now if you have N variables,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I think it's very convenient to measure the running time as a function of N,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
but we can only do that if we know that

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
the length of the formula is also some function of N

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
or if the length of the formula is polynomial in N to be more precise.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So just to be very precise, from now on

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
we will always assume that the total length

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
of this Boolean formula that we are given

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
is polynomial in N,

13
00:00:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
the number of variables.
