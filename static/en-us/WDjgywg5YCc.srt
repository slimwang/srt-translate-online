1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,699
To make a 15% mixture, we would need 4 liters. If you got that one right, that's

2
00:00:04,699 --> 00:00:09,323
amazing work. You've really mastered how to solve these system problems. If this

3
00:00:09,323 --> 00:00:13,836
one gave you trouble, that's okay. Stay with me to figure out what might have

4
00:00:13,836 --> 00:00:18,525
gone wrong. The question asks for how much of the 15% mixture we should use. So

5
00:00:18,525 --> 00:00:23,252
that's going to be our variable, x. We start with 10 liters of a chemical

6
00:00:23,252 --> 00:00:28,398
mixture that is 8% water. So that's going to be my percent 1 and volume 1. For

7
00:00:28,398 --> 00:00:33,847
percent 2 and volume 2, I'm adding 15% of x liters of solution. And for my final

8
00:00:33,847 --> 00:00:39,118
percentage, I know the mixture needs to be 10% water. I don't know my final

9
00:00:39,118 --> 00:00:44,040
volume. But if I remember back from the bucket, if I pour in one volume, and I

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,146
pour in another volume, that gives me my total volume. So I poured in 10 liters

11
00:00:49,146 --> 00:00:54,259
first, and then I poured in x liters. This must mean that the total volume is 10

12
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:59,294
plus x. I can use that here. Now we have one equation with one variable, and we

13
00:00:59,294 --> 00:01:05,566
can solve for x. I multiply my terms together, and then I distribute the 0.10.

14
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:11,692
Next, I subtract 0.8 from both sides. I'm moving my constant terms to the right.

15
00:01:11,692 --> 00:01:17,026
This means that I must move my x terms to the left. I subtract 0.1x from both

16
00:01:17,026 --> 00:01:22,899
sides to get 0.05x equals 0.2. And finally I divide by the coefficient of x, to

17
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:24,948
get x is equal to 10 liters.
