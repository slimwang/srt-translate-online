1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,110
So when going to a networking event,

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,390
I think you want to come up with
at least a couple of things.

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,710
First, if there's content in this event,

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,020
you want to learn at least one thing
that's relevant for your business.

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,980
And so you want to go to a networking
event that you can hopefully learn

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,620
something relevant for you.

7
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,769
But the most important thing
is trying to figure out

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,690
specific individuals there that
would be good for your business.

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,020
Are there other investors
that can help you?

10
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,850
Are you looking for a co-founder?

11
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:33,420
It's really about trying to tell
your story in a very succinct way,

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,310
so the person across from you
will understand what you do and

13
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,510
hopefully connect.

14
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:42,530
I think it's not about quantity,
it's really about quality.

15
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,470
Don't try to shake hands with 100
different people for one second.

16
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,870
Try to find those five, six,
seven people that there's a chance

17
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,750
that they will dramatically influence
the trajectory of your startup.

18
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,990
Because they join you as an employee,
or as an investor, or

19
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,120
perhaps connect you to
somebody who can be that.
