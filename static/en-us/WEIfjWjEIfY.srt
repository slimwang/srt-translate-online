00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:03,900
This is a sandwich. It's not a regular

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,050
sandwich. It's a little bit bigger than the

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:10,210
regular sandwich, but it looks delicious. So why

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,150
am I telling you this? Well, datastore is like

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,610
a sandwich. It has layers, each layer built

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:20,250
on top of the other for support. We have

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,690
covered a lot of layers in lesson four

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,080
and we only have two more layers to cover.

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,270
So, keep the good work up. As for me, I'm eating a sandwich.
