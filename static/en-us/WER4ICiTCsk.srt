So as a quick quiz, suppose that we have a token bucket shaper. And suppose that

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,790
the size of the bucket is 100 kilobytes,

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,470
that rho is ten packets per second, and that

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:16,440
packets are one kilobyte. Assume also that we

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,050
are talking about an interval of one second. Remember

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,550
than in any given interval, a flow can

7
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,310
never send more than beta plus tau times rho

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,450
bits of data. Please give your answer in kilobits per

9
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:33,540
second. Keeping in mind that one byte is eight bits.
