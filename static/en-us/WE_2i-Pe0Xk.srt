00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,722
Now you've gotten pretty good at working with simple loops and it's time to

2
00:00:03,722 --> 00:00:10,075
introduce another loop type. It often happens that you need to work with

3
00:00:10,075 --> 00:00:16,742
consecutive numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. I'll just give you an example. Let's say

4
00:00:16,742 --> 00:00:21,110
you want to write a to-do list. Maybe your and my to-do list is really complex.

5
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,958
So we'll start with something really simple. My cat, Eliza Doolittle. Her to-do

6
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:30,080
list is stunningly simple, and you can program it. The first thing she does is

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,680
sleep. That's the second thing she does. And the third, and you guessed it.

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,971
Sleeping is what she does all day. Your task is to write a program using a

9
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:42,439
while loop that prints this to do list.
