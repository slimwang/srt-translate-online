00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,640
Look in your professional and
social networks and

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,750
find an Objective-C developer.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:08,109
Ask that person for one interview
question they commonly asked and

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:09,360
post that question to the forum.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,130
Now do you have a general sense
of what Objective-C is all about.

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,708
Next stuff will get into the nitty
gritty of writing classes.
