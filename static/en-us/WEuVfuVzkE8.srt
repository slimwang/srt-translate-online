1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
And the answer here is as follows--so first of all, it's important to notice that

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:09,660
a RAM that has the if-better function available is at least as powerful as a normal RAM

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,440
because all we're adding is this additional instruction

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,200
but we can still do anything that we could do before.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,810
So this here is clearly a check mark.

6
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,660
Vertex cover, independent set, and clique would be solvable in exponential time.

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,330
Also, if we have this if-better function available.

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,910
And the second thing is that in the well sort of programming example that we just had

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,670
we also saw that the if-better function is so powerful that it will allow us to solve

10
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,300
vertex cover, independent set, and clique in polynomial time

11
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,660
if we have the if-better function available.

12
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,820
And of course this one down here, that unfortunately has to stay blank

13
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:49,000
but not because we're sure that these problems, vertex cover, independent set, and clique

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,790
don't have a polynomial time algorithm but simply because we don't really know yet.

15
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,310
We will come back to this matrix picture here in a minute.

16
00:00:56,310 --> 99:59:59,999
But let's turn our attention back to the RAM machine for a moment now.
