1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,370
The first logic we would consider
is called propositional logic.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,179
Let's jump right into an example,

3
00:00:07,179 --> 00:00:10,279
recasting the alarm problem
in propositional logic.

4
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:16,820
We have propositional symbols B,
E, A, M, and

5
00:00:16,821 --> 00:00:21,490
J corresponding to the events of the
burglary occurring, of the earthquake

6
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:26,789
occurring, of the alarm going off,
of Mary calling, and of John calling.

7
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:30,969
And, just as in the probabilistic
models, these can be either true or

8
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:32,158
false.

9
00:00:32,158 --> 00:00:34,250
But unlike in probability,

10
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,530
our degree of belief in
propositional logic is not a number.

11
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:44,640
Rather, our belief is that each of these
is either true or false or unknown.

12
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:50,159
Now we can make logical sentences
using these symbols and

13
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,099
also using the logical
constants true and

14
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:59,289
false by combining them together
using logical operators.

15
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:03,950
For example, we can say that the alarm
is true whenever the earthquake or

16
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:08,500
burglary is true with this sentence.

17
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:15,930
E, or B a parenthesis, implies A.

18
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,770
So that says, whenever the earthquake or

19
00:01:18,769 --> 00:01:23,274
the burglary is true,
then the alarm will be true.

20
00:01:23,275 --> 00:01:28,520
We use this v symbol to mean or,
and a right arrow to mean implies.

21
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:32,299
We could also say that it will
be true that both John and

22
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:33,920
Mary call when the alarm is true.

23
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:40,722
We write that as A implies

24
00:01:40,721 --> 00:01:45,384
parenthesis J and M.

25
00:01:45,384 --> 00:01:47,347
And we use this symbol to indicate an M.

26
00:01:47,347 --> 00:01:54,489
So this upward-facing wedge looks kind
of like an A with the crossbar missing.

27
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,447
And so you can remember A is for
and, right,

28
00:01:56,447 --> 00:02:01,839
where this downward-facing v
symbol is the opposite of and.

29
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,189
So that's the symbol for or.

30
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:07,060
Now, there's two more
connectors we haven't seen yet.

31
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,430
There's a double arrow for equivalence,

32
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:14,300
also known as a biconditional,
and a not sign for negation.

33
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:21,469
So we could say, if we wanted to, that
John calls if and only if Mary calls,

34
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:28,189
we would write that as John
is equivalent to Mary.

35
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,300
When one is true, the other is true.

36
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,480
When one is false, the other is false,
or we could say that when John calls,

37
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:37,639
Mary doesn't and vice versa.

38
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:41,780
We could write that as
John is equivalent,

39
00:02:41,781 --> 00:02:45,009
with double arrow, to not Mary.

40
00:02:45,008 --> 00:02:47,327
And this is the not sign.

41
00:02:47,328 --> 00:02:50,110
Now how do we know what
the sentences mean?

42
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,210
A propositional logic
sentence is either true or

43
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,140
false with respect to
a model of the world.

44
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:59,199
And a model is just a set
of true false values for

45
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,959
all the propositional symbols.

46
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:06,228
So, a model might be the set B is true,

47
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:09,370
E is false, and so on.

48
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:15,090
We can define the truth of a sentence in
terms of the truth of the symbols with

49
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,120
respect to the models
using truth tables.
