1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,960
So the argument for
RAID 6 being an overkill is that

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,870
when in RAID 5 a disk fails, it takes
up to a couple of days to replace.

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,080
Sometimes you have a spare disk and
usually a data center will have that,

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,360
so it's going to take less than an hour.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,199
And there is a very, very low
probability that another disk in

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,790
the array will fail in those three days.

7
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,310
If it fails after these three days,
it doesn't matter because by then we

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,170
are back to being protected
by the extra disk.

9
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:34,560
So the failure of the second
disk needs to happen in the time

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,950
when one of the disk is
in the failed state.

11
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,860
But that assumes that the disk
failures are independent.

12
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,200
But the failures can be
related to each other,

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,410
in which case this is
not correct to assume.

14
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,010
A typical scenario where
this can happen is,

15
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:55,550
let's say that we have a RAID five with
five disks and one of the disk fails.

16
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,510
Let's say that disk number
two in the array has failed.

17
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,430
The system reports that
a disk has failed and

18
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,180
continues functioning normally.

19
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,920
Remember than it can do that
with one failed disk in RAID 5.

20
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,650
And now the operator gets a replacement
disk, opens the computer case and

21
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,980
sees five drives like this,
knows that the number two has failed so

22
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,540
takes this one out and
puts the new drive in.

23
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:24,370
But for example, the numbering of
the disks was actually 0,1,2,3,4 so

24
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,890
we pulled out the wrong drive.

25
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,000
This was the failed one.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,730
When we pulled the second one,
that was the second failure, and

27
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,230
now we really have two failed disks.

28
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,950
One failed because it failed,

29
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:43,390
the other one failed in the course of
trying to repair the first failure.

30
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,060
So that's, for example,
a case of correlated failures,

31
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,610
and in that case,
we cannot assume independence.

32
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:56,040
So pretty much when a disk fails,
the actions to repair it are creating

33
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,430
a lot more risk for the other disks and
may cause a second failure.

34
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:05,720
And that, for example, where you
want to have RAID 6, when one fails and

35
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,799
you're trying to repair it.

36
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:11,750
If another one fails for
any reason, independent or

37
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,830
dependent on the first failure,
you're still safe.
