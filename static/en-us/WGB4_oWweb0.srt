1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,290
So this lesson we're going to
go through an exercise.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,030
Imagine you had to prepare an analysis
model of the external behavior of this

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,620
clock radio using state charts.

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,140
What steps would you take to do this?

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,690
Because we are concerned
here with modeling behavior,

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:19,830
one natural way to get started is with
usage scenarios, also called use cases.

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,530
A use case is a sequence of steps,

8
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,510
each involving an actor performing
an action, possibly on an object.

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,850
Clearly any model of behavior of the
clock radio must indicate how each of

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,080
the use cases is realized.

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,730
See if you can come up with three
typical use cases for the clock radio.

12
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,260
>> Okay.
So the first use case I can think of

13
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:42,700
is that the user is setting the time for
one of the three different modes.

14
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,770
Whether that's the display time or
the time we want the alarm to go off.

15
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,190
There's a third time but with each of
those, I guess there's a separate use

16
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,920
case but we'll just say setting
the time is use case one.

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,080
>> Okay, so, Jared is right

18
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,210
that each one of those would be a
separate use case and now we're picking

19
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:06,300
the one about just setting the time
of day that's visible on the display.

20
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,610
>> And then for use case number
two we could change the frequency

21
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,790
of the radio so we may be in AM mode and
changing the frequency,

22
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,520
or in FM mode and
changing the frequency.

23
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,270
>> So regardless of the mode, we're
changing what station is coming in.

24
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,350
>> Right, so we're going to be
twisting that knob to change it.

25
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,010
>> On the side.

26
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:26,620
>> On the side.

27
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,290
Okay.

28
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:32,950
And then for a third use case, let's
say the user presses the snooze button,

29
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:36,360
the alarm's going off and
they want to sleep a little bit longer.

30
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,040
>> Okay.
Clearly there are lots of other ones,

31
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,460
like just listening to the radio,
turning it on and just listening to it,

32
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,449
or getting shocked out of
bed by the beeper going off.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,930
Lots of possibilities here and
ultimately, our state and

34
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:56,170
chart model needs to be able to cover
all the cases that might arise,

35
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:02,130
including error cases,
including situations where what you had

36
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:07,600
hoped to happen doesn't happen and the
radio has to respond in that situation.
