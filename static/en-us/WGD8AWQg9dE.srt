1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,400
Well, remember, that if we leave the parenthesis off of a function name,

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,960
it simple returns the function object rather than calling that function.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,240
Let's see what this looks like in the Chrome console.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,079
So, I need a debugger for right after our pack is created, and

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,590
I'll pause execution and inspect the path object itself.

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,230
Here we are in our code.

7
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,250
Right beneath the path object.

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,310
And if we simply type path without any parentheses,

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,520
we can see here that a function is actually returned and not called.

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,370
And if you notice that a path is actually a function

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,230
that takes a single argument.

12
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,780
And acts very similar to the access or

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,570
call back functions, that we've explicitly defined ourselves.

14
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:47,270
In this case, it gets past the data bound to each element,

15
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,850
and to make this a little bit more explicit.

16
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,770
Let's pass our first GeoJSON country,

17
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,930
in this case Afghanistan, to the path itself.

18
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:02,270
As you can see here, we're passing a GeoJSON object to our path function.

19
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:06,510
And what gets spit back is a jumble of strings.

20
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,820
In this case, scrolling to the top of this string,

21
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,330
we see a strange stream of numbers.

22
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,570
Prefaced by the letter M, separated by commas.

23
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:21,490
This is simply the SVG way to specify which path to draw and

24
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,800
which pixels to connect on the screen.

25
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,440
Again, d3 being the great library that it is, makes it so

26
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,660
you don't have to concern yourself with any of this messiness.
