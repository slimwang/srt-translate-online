I'd already given you instructions for how to type these two right here, the

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,275
square root of 2 and the cubed root of x. But then, as you can see for these two

3
00:00:07,287 --> 00:00:10,939
slightly more difficult ones, when you write out all the keys you have to type

4
00:00:10,951 --> 00:00:14,679
in MathQuill, it looks super complicated. But hopefully, if you found it's a

5
00:00:14,691 --> 00:00:18,735
little more intuitive when you're actually typing it, especially because you've

6
00:00:18,747 --> 00:00:22,596
already had practice using MathQuill before. Please remember that when you type

7
00:00:22,608 --> 00:00:26,405
parentheses in MathQuill, it actually fills in the second parentheses when you

8
00:00:26,417 --> 00:00:29,147
type the first one, so you don't have to retype at the end.
