00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,798
There are three elements that can change in the scene. The light's directions,

2
00:00:03,798 --> 00:00:08,874
the eyes position, and the objects orientaion. In the first answer, the object

3
00:00:08,874 --> 00:00:12,741
does not move. This means the objects normals are the same each frame. The

4
00:00:12,741 --> 00:00:16,798
lights can still move. If the lights move, the shade of the object will change,

5
00:00:16,798 --> 00:00:20,764
so we can rule out this answer. The second answer locks down the eye position

6
00:00:20,764 --> 00:00:25,660
and the light's directions. Now the lights cannot move, but the object could

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,864
rotate in space. If it does, the directions of its normals compared to each

8
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:34,679
light will change, which changes the diffuse calculation. So this answer won't

9
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:38,748
work. The third answer locks down the lights directions, and the object's

10
00:00:38,748 --> 00:00:43,084
orientation. The eye position is not locked down, and so can move and change the

11
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:47,140
direction it is looking in. However, the two elements that affect the diffuse

12
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,240
lighting equation are the lights directions, and the objects normals. Eye

13
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,140
direction is unimportant, as the diffuse material has the same shade from any

14
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,506
direction it's viewed. So this answer is correct. The fourth answer keeps the

15
00:01:00,506 --> 00:01:04,474
objects orientation fixed, but like the first answer, the lights can change

16
00:01:04,474 --> 00:01:09,973
directions. Surface shading can change. So this answer is incorrect.
