00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,812
>> Manipulating this in the ways that we've practiced gives us m is greater than

2
00:00:04,812 --> 00:00:09,184
or equal to 333 and 1 3rd. Let's look at this on a number line. So, m can be

3
00:00:09,184 --> 00:00:13,910
anything to the right of, or including, 333 and a third. But wait, what are we

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:18,524
talking about anyway? What was m equal to? M is equal to the number of deluxe

5
00:00:18,524 --> 00:00:23,074
wipers sold. Now, you can't sell a third of a wiper set, so that means we're

6
00:00:23,074 --> 00:00:27,462
going to have to make m into a whole number. Now, if we make it 333, then we

7
00:00:27,462 --> 00:00:31,921
won't quite make it to our $20,000 profit level. So, that mean that we're going

8
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:36,428
to have to round up. M has to be greater than or equal to 334 wipers. Well, I'm

9
00:00:36,428 --> 00:00:40,780
going to leave our number line looking just like this, because these would be

10
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,935
about in the same place. You can just imagine that our bracket has shifted

11
00:00:44,935 --> 00:00:50,083
slightly to the right. What we want is the minimum possible value for m, so the

12
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:55,811
smallest value in this range of possible solutions. That, of course, is going to

13
00:00:55,811 --> 00:01:00,680
be just this endpoint solution, 334 exactly. So we want m equals 334.
