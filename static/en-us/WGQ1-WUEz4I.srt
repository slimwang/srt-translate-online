1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Since on average it didn't move,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
we just add the mean of its starting position to the no movement,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and we get a mean of 0.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
But it has a standard deviation or variance of 1.
