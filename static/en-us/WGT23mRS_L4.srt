1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,325
Well, since we've been talking about distances a lot, we might as well find the

2
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:08,685
length of each side of this new black quadrilateral. This time, however, we're

3
00:00:08,697 --> 00:00:12,890
just going to use these coordinates of the points that we know. So, what did we

4
00:00:12,902 --> 00:00:16,950
use before? Well, we used the distance between the x-coordinates, and the

5
00:00:16,962 --> 00:00:21,669
distance between the y-coordinates, squared each of those distances, added them

6
00:00:21,681 --> 00:00:26,953
together, and then found the positive square root of that quantity. Interesting.

7
00:00:26,955 --> 00:00:31,816
So, you can formalize this process for any two points, where one of the points

8
00:00:31,828 --> 00:00:36,831
has the coordinates that I'll call x1 y1,. And the other point has coordinates

9
00:00:36,843 --> 00:00:41,666
x2 and y2. I want to use these subscripts here because that lets me still show

10
00:00:41,678 --> 00:00:45,376
that these two coordinates are in fact x-coordinates, and these ones are

11
00:00:45,388 --> 00:00:49,416
y-coordinates, but, that they belong to different points. Now that we have this

12
00:00:49,428 --> 00:00:53,182
handy formula, for the distance between any two points, we can calculate

13
00:00:53,194 --> 00:00:57,141
distances just knowing coordinates. That means, we don't need to rely on our

14
00:00:57,153 --> 00:01:00,787
picture anymore. Although, of course, it will be helpful in the future to go

15
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:04,721
back and reference it. We know that we can use this formula to calculate the

16
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:08,655
distance between any two points, so let's try it for each of the points that

17
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:12,596
creates the outline of our black quadrilateral, on the visual that I've now

18
00:01:12,608 --> 00:01:17,249
conveniently taken away from you. The notation here that we're using is similar

19
00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:22,080
to what we did before. MN, for example, is the distance between M and N, two

20
00:01:22,092 --> 00:01:26,953
points on our list. You can consider this just two letters that form a single

21
00:01:26,965 --> 00:01:31,805
variable. So, NP is the distance between N and P, PQ is the distance between P

22
00:01:31,817 --> 00:01:32,807
and Q, and so on.
