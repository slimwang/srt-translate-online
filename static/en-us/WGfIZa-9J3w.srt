00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:06,050
Many of 3JSs geometry object come along with their own UVs built-in. Some of

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,504
these are displayed here. For planar objects, the texture's put flat against

3
00:00:09,504 --> 00:00:13,264
the face. For round objects, the general idea is that the u-value goes from

4
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:17,940
zero to one, around the equator. And V goes from zero to one, around the axis.

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,292
To be honest, the mapping on the bottom of the cone shown here is pretty. But

6
00:00:21,292 --> 00:00:24,612
doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Maybe you'll be the one to fix it. Note that

7
00:00:24,612 --> 00:00:28,014
3JS truly is a work in progress and anyone can submit bug fixes and

8
00:00:28,014 --> 00:00:33,526
improvement. I should also point out the tetrahedron. It's mapping is a bit

9
00:00:33,526 --> 00:00:37,512
distorted. In fact, if you look at the code, no UV mapping is given at all and

10
00:00:37,512 --> 00:00:41,888
3JS creates one using some rules. Sometimes there simply is no natural UV

11
00:00:41,888 --> 00:00:45,765
mapping for the object being made. It's then pretty much up to the programmer

12
00:00:45,765 --> 00:00:49,326
to decide how to proceed. What is happening with each of these objects is that

13
00:00:49,326 --> 00:00:54,661
UVs are generated by the geometry class used to create the triangles. The form

14
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:58,218
for making a triangle with UVs code. Here, three vertices are defined and put

15
00:00:58,218 --> 00:01:03,480
inside the geometry object. Three UVs are created. I put them in an array so I

16
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,189
can reuse any that I want. A face is defined as usual. The three numbers given

17
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:12,975
are indices to the three vertex locations in the vertices array. The way the

18
00:01:12,975 --> 00:01:16,900
three UVs are attached to this face is a little non-standard. The first element

19
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:21,066
of the face vertex UVs is accessed. And the three uv's we want to use for this

20
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:25,164
face are directly placed there. If you want to add more faces with UVs Note

21
00:01:25,164 --> 00:01:30,048
that you'll access the face vertex UV's class the same way each time. You'll

22
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:33,320
access a ray element zero and pass in the three UVs desired.
