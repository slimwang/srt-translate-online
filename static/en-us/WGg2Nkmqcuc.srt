We have been expanding expressions, so now let's condense them. This is

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,850
effectively the reverse of expanding. How about we play around with this

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:13,952
expression? 3 natural log of x plus 4 minus the natural log of 5. Now a common

4
00:00:13,952 --> 00:00:18,480
mistake in trying to condense this, would be to start off using the quotient

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,730
property, but we're not ready for that just yet. To do that we would need both

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:27,990
terms to just be the log of something, and not have a coefficient in front. But

7
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,960
how do we get rid of this coefficient, please rewrite this first term so that

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,620
the coefficient is no longer there.
