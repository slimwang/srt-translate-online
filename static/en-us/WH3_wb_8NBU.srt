00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,394
We figured out this equation in the last lesson and in the previous quiz by

2
00:00:04,406 --> 00:00:08,838
finding a pattern in this data right here that relates n to d. But in order to

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:13,371
find patterns as easily as possible, we need to see the connection between data

4
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:17,967
like we have in the table, mathematical descriptions like our equation right

5
00:00:17,979 --> 00:00:22,555
here, and to add to our list, visual representations, or graphs. For the

6
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:27,511
situation we're dealing with, a graph might look something like this, but how do

7
00:00:27,523 --> 00:00:32,177
we make this? Well, we start by plotting points. Each row of data in our chart

8
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,621
right here is a pair of numbers, one for d and one for n, and we plot those

9
00:00:36,633 --> 00:00:41,433
pairs of numbers on our graph. For the first point I would graph, I have the

10
00:00:41,445 --> 00:00:46,443
numbers one and 23. So if we're on our coordinate plane here, on the d-axis

11
00:00:46,455 --> 00:00:51,833
which is the horizontal one right here. I'd start at zero and move over one, and

12
00:00:51,845 --> 00:00:56,893
then, move up 23 on the n-axis, which is the vertical one. I could do the same

13
00:00:56,905 --> 00:01:02,207
thing for 2, 46. I count over from zero in the positive direction, two slots,

14
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,952
one, two, and then up, 46.
