00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,450
When we talked about security before, we
put in simple rules that prevent users

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,560
from reading or writing to the database,
unless they are authenticated.

3
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:12,189
Authentication provides a means of
identifying who your users are.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,070
And once you verify who a user is, your
database security rules can come into

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,870
play and give them the ability
to fewer change data.

6
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:24,619
Think about your everyday interactions
with computers and mobile devices for

7
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,589
a while.

8
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:28,390
Can you think of times that
you've had to use authentication?
