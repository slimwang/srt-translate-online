00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,772
Let's talk about the thought process in more detail. The first question I asked

2
00:00:03,772 --> 00:00:08,932
myself was, which nouns in this problem description are doing things? Well, the

3
00:00:08,932 --> 00:00:14,107
manager is getting assignments, and marking them with priorities, and assigning

4
00:00:14,107 --> 00:00:20,515
them to photographers. Photographers are getting the assignments from the

5
00:00:20,515 --> 00:00:25,248
manager, and completing them. Assignments don't seem to do too much, but we

6
00:00:25,248 --> 00:00:29,401
need to keep some information associated with the assignments. In particular, I

7
00:00:29,401 --> 00:00:33,955
thought an assignment would have a priority, and maybe, whether it's finished

8
00:00:33,955 --> 00:00:38,906
or not. They would also have the original description. Perhaps I would even

9
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:43,268
want to store the finished work in the assignment. So maybe the finished method

10
00:00:43,268 --> 00:00:47,759
would take in an assignment. You might also want customer objects. Maybe the

11
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,645
customers are doing something interesting when they create the assignments or

12
00:00:51,645 --> 00:00:55,473
maybe the manager keeps a list of customers and assigns the priorities based on

13
00:00:55,473 --> 00:01:01,506
who the customer is. Maybe you would want an object to represent a priority. If

14
00:01:01,506 --> 00:01:04,730
you imagine the priorities as just numbers and higher numbers mean higher

15
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:09,485
priorities then you probably wouldn't need a special priority class. But if you

16
00:01:09,485 --> 00:01:12,485
wanted priorities to age over time, and increase the longer you have the

17
00:01:12,485 --> 00:01:15,735
assignment, then you might want to class your priorities, because they would

18
00:01:15,735 --> 00:01:20,368
have behavior. This kind of design work can be very difficult, because there's

19
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:23,813
so many ways you might start. But it also becomes a lot of fun as you get

20
00:01:23,813 --> 00:01:28,623
better at it. This process becomes a kind of story telling. You're using the

21
00:01:28,623 --> 00:01:33,956
code to document the relationships between all of the actors in the story. And

22
00:01:33,956 --> 00:01:37,360
creating a model for how to solve the problem.
