1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's say of the 40 people in the hospital,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
36 were actually sick and passed away,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and some were healthy, 4 of them,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and they all survived.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Let's further assume, for the people at home,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
40 were indeed sick,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and 20 of them passed away,

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
whereas the remaining 7,960,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
they were healthy,

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
also inquired a total death of 20,

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
perhaps because of accidents.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
These statistics are consistent with

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
the statistics I gave you before.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We just added another variable,

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
whether the person's sick or healthy.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Please now fill out once again,

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
in percent,

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
what is the percentage of people that passed away

19
00:00:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
in each of of those 4 groups?
