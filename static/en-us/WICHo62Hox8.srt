The third question asked, what is the maximum possible path length in B?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It's pretty straightforward to see the chains have a maximum possible path length of n-1

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and this n-1 is an upper bound on the path link of any graph with n nodes

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and so we are checking to see if we can make B into a chain.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If we can, then n-1 will be the maximum possible path link

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and this is about as close as we can get into making B into a chain.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In fact, it doesn't matter how many nodes are on the left side. We can still only get a chain of six.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
For another node on the right side, we can make our chain to it as longer, and so the maximum

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
possible path link in a bipartite graph depends on the number of nodes in the smallest group,

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and so in general the maximum possible path link in a bipartite graph is the minimum

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
of 2 times the number of nodes in the left group or 2 times the number of nodes in the right group

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
or the number of nodes in total minus 1.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
For B, we get that the possible maximum path link is six edges.
