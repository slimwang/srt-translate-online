00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,330
I want you to do a series
of calculations,

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,830
partly inspired by Danny Hillis' thesis.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,080
These calculations will lead you to
one conclusion about the limits of

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,330
computation.

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,250
Consider a processor from the year 2015,

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,750
like this quad core
Intel Ivy Bridge CPU.

7
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,250
As it happens it can,

8
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:21,428
in the best case, execute a about
100 billion operations per second.

9
00:00:21,428 --> 00:00:26,060
Or 100 gop's If you're keeping
count at home that's 10 to the 11th

10
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,500
operations per second.

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,286
Very roughly speaking this
peak rate of performance or

12
00:00:30,286 --> 00:00:32,537
through put doubles
about every two years.

13
00:00:32,537 --> 00:00:37,111
So, how fast will be a processor
be 10 years hence in 2025?

14
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:40,385
Type your answer here and
leave it in units of gop's.
