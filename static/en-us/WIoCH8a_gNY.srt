00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now, let's go shopping. What do we need to build a simple model of a wildfire.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The most important simplification that we are introducing is to treat

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
the forest as though it was a football field.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We neglect height, we've reduced everything to two dimensions.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
In two dimensions, we can already describe how heat diffuses, but in addition to that,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
there's also heat loss, there's wind, and first and foremost, there's combustion.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, we are going to look into these three starting with heat loss.
