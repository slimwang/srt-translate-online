1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,710
The first statement, intrusion detection

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:06,640
is based on the assumption that
the behavior of the intruder

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,650
differs from that of a legitimate
user in ways that can be quantified.

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:12,660
This is true.

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,690
This is the primary assumption of IDS.

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,620
The second statement,
the primary purpose of an IDS is

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:24,430
to detect intrusions,
log suspicious events and send alerts.

8
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:29,380
This is true statement, because these
are the basic functions of an IDS.

9
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,225
The third statement,

10
00:00:30,225 --> 00:00:34,950
signature-based approaches attempt
to define normal, or expected,

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,720
behavior, whereas anomaly approaches
attempt to define proper behavior.

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,720
This is false, because a signature
based approach is typically used to

13
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,460
represent known intrusion patterns.

14
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,890
The fourth statement,

15
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,810
a network IDS sensor monitors
a copy of network traffic.

16
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,190
The actual traffic does not
pass through the device.

17
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:02,600
This is true because a network ID
typically performs passive monitoring

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,470
by copying the network traffic.

19
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:05,114
The last statement.

20
00:01:05,114 --> 00:01:09,980
Network-based intrusion detection
makes use of signature detection and

21
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,290
anomaly detection.

22
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,190
This is true.

23
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,550
You can indeed use both approaches.
