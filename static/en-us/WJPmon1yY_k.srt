00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,711
If we replace all occurrences of Alice with no letters, then the length of the

2
00:00:03,711 --> 00:00:08,622
book will decrease by five times the number of occurrences of Alice. Because

3
00:00:08,622 --> 00:00:12,594
Alice has five letters. So if we calculate the length of the book with Alice

4
00:00:12,594 --> 00:00:17,610
and the length of the book without Alice, and take the difference. We can

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,010
divide the difference by 5 and get the number of occurrences. So, here again,

6
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:26,618
is our book class with our new method, occurrences of Alice. First, we'll

7
00:00:26,618 --> 00:00:30,156
calculate the original length and then the length after we remove all the

8
00:00:30,156 --> 00:00:36,108
occurrences of Alice, by replacing Alice with an empty string. Then we return

9
00:00:36,108 --> 00:00:42,008
the difference between the 2 all divided by 5. Let's add a line to our book

10
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:46,180
tester to see how many times Alice actually occurs. And if we're in the main

11
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:51,444
method again it now tells us that Alice occurs 395 times. It's not totally

12
00:00:51,444 --> 00:00:56,070
clear or obvious that this will be correct, but you could check it a few ways.

13
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,162
For example, you could open up the text and use some other program to search

14
00:01:00,162 --> 00:01:06,188
for the number of occurrences of Alice. Or you could find some word, that only

15
00:01:06,188 --> 00:01:09,750
appears once. Or maybe a string of words so you can be pretty sure that it

16
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:15,979
would only occur once. And try using that to debug your code.
