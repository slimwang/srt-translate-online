00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,350
Let's continue looking at our DB helper.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,360
The other important function
that we are required to fill in

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,290
is the on-upgrade method.

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,740
This function gets called when the
database has already been created but

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,740
the version is changed.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,110
A version change or upgrade should
signify that the columns, tables or

7
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,060
general structure
the database has changed.

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,744
The SQLite Open Helper knows
the database version has changed because

9
00:00:24,744 --> 00:00:27,810
the version we passed into
its constructure has changed.

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,600
Make sure to always change
the database version

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,460
when you make changes
to the database tables.

12
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,570
You might think,
why would I care about this?

13
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,590
I'm not upgrading anything yet,
so why bother?

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,400
Because it's important to make sure
that your application won't have

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,635
errors when you make changes
to the database tables.

16
00:00:45,635 --> 00:00:50,160
Since we are going to be using our
database as a cache for web data, and

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,680
not for use generated content,
we'll drop the tables,

18
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,900
which deletes all of the data.

19
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,450
If the data had contained information
that was user generated, of course,

20
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,130
we'd want to preserve it.

21
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:05,360
To do that, we'd likely use
alter table to add new columns.

22
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,660
See the instructor notes for

23
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:10,200
more information on alter table if you
are interested in how this is done.
