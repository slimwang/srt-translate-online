00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is reject, and you can see it easily from the data shown here.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
79.74 is the mean. This is the 95% confidence interval--less than a kilogram.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The reason why it's so small is because we have so many data samples, really interesting.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
As a result, we don't even come close to 73.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So, if all the guesses that you guys voiced online were actual measurements

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
using the actual scale of Sebastian,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and this is what I told you and the question really was H0.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Is Sebastian telling the truth or is he lying?

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The, using statistical techniques, you should conclude he's lying.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
This is somewhat contrived. This is the only data point, and everything else is just guesses.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
But I hope you had fun using actual data that you students derived in answering this question.
