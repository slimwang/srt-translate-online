1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is, the only reasonable choice is the third one.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The reason for that is, either of the first 2 make it very easy for Alice to cheat.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
For the first choice, we're only looking at the first bit out of the encryption,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
so if she tries a few different keys, she is likely to find ones that produce outputs

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
that differ in the first bit. Very easy to find one with this property.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
For the second one, it's not easy to find exactly this property.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Finding this equality would be just as hard as it is with the third property,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
but the problem is Bob does not know the 127 bits that are added.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So Bob is only looking at the first character here

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and finding 2 keys that have this property would be very easy.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So in this case, the only 1 that makes sense is this one.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
When we're thinking about encrypting files and other things,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
this isn't quite the right answer for padding in most cases.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This solution only works when Bob knows the actual size of the input

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and agrees with Alice in advance to know that all padded bits should be 0's.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
When you don't know the size, this doesn't quite work because if the message ends

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
with 0 bits, and we start the padding with 0 bits, we don't know where the actual end was.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So the usual solution to this, and there are several possible solutions,

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
is to start the padding with a 1 bit and then all 0's to the end of the message.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
That means if the message actually ended here, if this was the end of the block,

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
if the message was an even number of blocks,

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
we'd need an extra block of just padding to indicate that we got to the end.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
In this case, since Alice and Bob both know that there's only 1 bit for the coin toss,

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
as long as they agree in advance that the padding will be all 0 bits,

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
that would be okay.
