00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Using the maximum-likelihood estimator MLE that we just discussed and here are my answers.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
1 was observed in 1 out of 10 experiments, gives us 0.1--1 divided 10.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
2 was observed twice 0.2, 3, 4 and 5 was observed once each,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and 6 was observed four times, one, two, three and four, is a 0.4.
