1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,270
So, using this idea,

2
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:04,760
let's actually have your practice on the same concept briefly.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,400
So, what I want you is to go through this example image.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,120
And, basically, at each and every point, again our neighborhood is size 1,

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,050
look at where the edge would be.

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,770
And, I've given you the threshold.

7
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,830
So, for example, in this case by looking at 12,

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,660
you would say that this should be a edge here.

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,720
But, of course no edge between 12 and 10.

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,220
And, use that to be able to then construct a edge

11
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,180
that goes through this whole example image.
