00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,070
Let's stick with alpha equals 0.05, and decide that at least two of these

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:10,738
college groups are different in terms of the amount of caffeine consumed. Then

3
00:00:10,738 --> 00:00:14,329

students consume significantly different amounts of caffeine. Here's the

5

Because I want you to try and figure out what the missing values should be
