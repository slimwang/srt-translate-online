1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,485
[SOUND] And now the award for

2
00:00:03,485 --> 00:00:08,832
most innovative technology goes to Dr.

3
00:00:08,832 --> 00:00:12,927
Emmet Brown and Marty McAppy.

4
00:00:12,927 --> 00:00:16,736
>> [APPLAUSE]
>> Looks like Marty and

5
00:00:16,736 --> 00:00:18,065
Doc saved the day.

6
00:00:18,065 --> 00:00:21,545
And now, it's your turn to implement
Core Data all on your own for

7
00:00:21,545 --> 00:00:24,025
the final project,
the virtual tourist app.

8
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:26,844
>> While we've gone over what you
need to know in order to create

9
00:00:26,844 --> 00:00:29,720
a Persistence App, know that
Core Data is a huge framework and

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,990
we've only scratched the surface.

11
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,870
We do hope, however,
that you realize how useful it can be.

12
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,740
If you want to learn more,
we'll be waiting for

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,470
you in the senior iOS nanodegree.

14
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,360
>> So thanks.

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,200
>> Good luck.

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,597
>> And we hope to see you in the future.

00:00:44,597 --> 00:00:46,829
