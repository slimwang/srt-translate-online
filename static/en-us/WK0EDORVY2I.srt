00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:06,456
Inside the module, you'll find
a vector class with three functions,

2
00:00:06,456 --> 00:00:08,295
init, str, and eq.

3
00:00:08,295 --> 00:00:10,882
I will give a brief description
of these functions in case you're

4
00:00:10,882 --> 00:00:12,650
not familiar with Python.

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,820
In that case, I also encourage you
to make use of some of the resources

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,280
in the instructor notes on this page.

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:23,180
The initializer creates a vector based
on an input list of coordinates, and

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:27,220
also sets the dimension of
space that the vector lives in.

9
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:33,419
For example, if we wanted to create the
vector 1, 2, 3, we could write my_vector

10
00:00:33,419 --> 00:00:37,940
= Vector([1,2,3]).

11
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,630
Then, my vector would be a variable
referring to the vector that we want.

12
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:47,130
The str function gives us the ability to
print out the coordinates of the vector

13
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,200
using Python's built in print function.

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:55,618
Using our example,
if we input print my_vector,

15
00:00:55,618 --> 00:01:01,546
we would receive the output Vector: (1,
2, 3).

16
00:01:01,546 --> 00:01:06,080
The eq function gives us the ability
to test whether two vectors are equal.

17
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,560
As I mentioned earlier,
two vectors are equal if

18
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,940
they have the same amount of change
in each coordinate direction.

19
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,160
Therefore, since we are storing
vectors using their coordinates,

20
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,080
we just need to compare
two vectors' coordinates.

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:25,321
To see how this works in Python, we can
input my vector2 = Vector ([1,2,3]) and

22
00:01:25,321 --> 00:01:29,740
my vector3 = Vector ([-1,2,3]).

23
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:34,999
Then if we input print my vector ==

24
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:40,040
my_vector2, we'll
receive the output True,

25
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,030
since all coordinates of my
vector in my_vector2 match.

26
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:49,419
On the other hand, if we input
print my_vector == my_vector3,

27
00:01:49,419 --> 00:01:51,920
we'll receive the output False,

28
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,220
because the two vectors have
different first coordinates.

29
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,800
Now, let's start defining some
basic operations on vectors.
