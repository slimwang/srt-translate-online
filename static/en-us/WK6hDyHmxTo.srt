00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:01,810
Amazing work.

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:06,590
You've polished Icicles into a real
playable game, adding scores, a HUD, and

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,740
a difficultly select screen.

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,080
Do you realize how much
you've accomplished?

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,670
Icicles is a simple game, but
you coded everything from the ground up.

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,143
You know Icicles better than
the stickers on the back of your laptop.

7
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:19,783
You've had to pay
attention to tiny details,

8
00:00:19,783 --> 00:00:24,520
like how fast the icicles drop and
how big the font in the HUD should be.

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,745
This kind of line by line,

10
00:00:25,745 --> 00:00:29,376
pixel perfect mastery, is what it takes
to build something new and awesome.

11
00:00:29,376 --> 00:00:31,872
And you've proved you can do it.

12
00:00:31,872 --> 00:00:34,320
I can't wait to see what you build next.
