In Java you can use an interface type to describe common behavior. In our

2
00:00:04,915 --> 00:00:11,370
example, what do cars and dogs and houses have in common, they're all drawable.

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,530
They all have a draw method. In Java, we use the interface keyword instead of

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:22,795
the class keyword. To define interfaces. Here we say that Drawable is an

5
00:00:22,795 --> 00:00:29,038
interface, with a draw method. We give no implementation of the draw method,

6
00:00:29,038 --> 00:00:33,948
that's up to the individual classes, that implement this interface. Methods in

7
00:00:33,948 --> 00:00:37,990
an interface are automatically public. You can write the keyword public, or you

8
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:42,936
can omit it. Now an interface is different from a class, an interface only

9
00:00:42,936 --> 00:00:47,226
specifies the behavior and you can't create objects of an interface, instead

10
00:00:47,226 --> 00:00:51,582
you create objects of classes that implement the interface, let's look at that

00:00:51,582 --> 00:00:54,360
next.
