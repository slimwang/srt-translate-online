1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,310
Now in configuration design, we not only know all the components like legs, and

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,939
set, and arms, and so on. We not only know the variables for

3
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:11,500
each of the components, like size and material, and cost.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,270
But we also know the ranges of values that any of these variables can take.

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,200
Thus the seat of a chair may have a certain weight, or length, or

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,220
depth. Here between the sides and the seat in a very simple matter in terms of

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,060
the mass of the seat as measured in grams. So 10 to 100 grams, you'll see in

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,260
minute why we're using this simple measure. So when it is brackets for

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,340
this material slot suggests that there is a range here, it will show the range

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,720
on the left [UNKNOWN]. TThe cost then will be determined by the size and

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:45,370
the materials. Let us suppose that this table captures the cost per gram for

12
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:49,370
certain kinds of materials. Now you can see why we're using gram as a measure

13
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:54,430
for the size of the seat. We wanted to very easily relate the size to the cost.

14
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,750
The material slot now can take one of these three values. This is the range of

15
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,980
values that can go into the material slot. Given a particular size and

16
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:07,440
a particular material, we can calculate this cost. Note that this representation

17
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,700
allows us to calculate the total mass of the chair and the total cost of

18
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,900
the chair, given the total mass and the total cost at least of the components.
