00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,229
So the last integrative therapy that we'll discuss today is called dialectical

2
00:00:04,229 --> 00:00:08,048
behavior therapy which uses a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy and

3
00:00:08,048 --> 00:00:14,465
mindfulness but without the meditation element. This is a common treatment for

4
00:00:14,465 --> 00:00:19,244
borderline personality disorder. And the idea here is that in this treatment,

5
00:00:19,244 --> 00:00:23,148
the person will earn to accept without judgement their actions and their

6
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:29,645
emotions. And if this occurs, then they can have a great reduction in self harm

7
00:00:29,645 --> 00:00:36,624
behaviors, in substance abuse, and risk for suicide, and depression. And these

8
00:00:36,624 --> 00:00:40,846
are all common symptoms in borderline personality disorder. And dialectic

9
00:00:40,846 --> 00:00:44,994
behavior therapy can also be used in treating eating disorders, conduct

10
00:00:44,994 --> 00:00:48,140
disorders, and domestic violence.
