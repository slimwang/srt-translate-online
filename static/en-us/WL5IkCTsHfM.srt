1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,359
So, first things first.

2
00:00:01,359 --> 00:00:02,850
You'll need to create a new app and

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,480
set it up in the same ways
you set up the last app.

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,990
That means you'll need to go
through these steps again.

5
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,160
So first, you'll create a new
app with a single view.

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,370
Then, you'll add the services
libraries to Build.gradle.

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,122
Then, you'll edit your Android.manifest
by putting the services libraries,

8
00:00:19,122 --> 00:00:22,630
the open GL stuff, the API key, and

9
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:26,840
the internet, network state, and
write external storage permissions.

10
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,130
Check that you've done each of these,
and if you need to review how to do

11
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,750
this, refer to the answer video for
creating and configuring the app earlier

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,600
in the lesson,
where we showed a simple fragment.

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,080
When you're done with all of that,
check this box to continue.
