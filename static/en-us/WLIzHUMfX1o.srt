00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,455
So you might think that layers
are a totally automated process, and

2
00:00:03,455 --> 00:00:04,870
that's mostly true.

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:05,640
Generally speaking,

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,400
you should let the browser manage layers
because it knows what it's doing.

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,190
>> Right, but
if you're hitting a paint issue,

6
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,270
then you might want to think about
promoting an element to its own layer.

7
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,260
>> Yeah, and you may be wondering,
how do I create a layer?

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,170
Well, before I get to that,

9
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,360
you should see if an element
already has its own layer.
