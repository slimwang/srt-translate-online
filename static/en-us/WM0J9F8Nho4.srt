1
00:00:01,242 --> 00:00:02,960
A much simpler table.

2
00:00:03,054 --> 00:00:07,867
Just a standard primary key, 
a few values, and a few constraints.

3
00:00:08,077 --> 00:00:10,616
Note that we use 
ON CONFLICT IGNORE.

4
00:00:10,616 --> 00:00:13,600
This means an insert into the database 
with the same key

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,050
will not actually update 
the database at all,

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,333
and therefore will also not return an ID
in the Android helper functions.
