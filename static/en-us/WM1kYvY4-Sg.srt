00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's go back to our list of concepts, go back to our diagram of where we were

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and say, "What should be the next step?" Well, what can we do now?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We can take a hand and we can take a single letter on the board and we can say,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
"Yes, I can pick letters out of the hand and maybe do a S-I-D-E."

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That would be a good play, except if there was an X here, then it would not be a good play.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Similarly, if there were letters in the opposite direction, that could be a bad play.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
But sometimes, there's letters in the opposite direction and it makes a good play.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Where here I'm forming two words at once, and the rules are the play I have to make

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
has to be all in one direction and all adjacent to each other so forming one consecutive word.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Then if it incidentally forms some other words in the other directions, that's okay.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
But I can't put some in this direction and then put some others down in that direction.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I think my next goal will be to place words on a row

13
00:00:56,000 --> 99:59:59,999
while worrying about the crosswords in the opposite direction.
