This comes from the saying that if it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and

2
00:00:03,864 --> 00:00:07,774
quacks like a duck, then it is probably a duck. Python encourages this style,

3
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:11,470
it's a very dynamic way of programming. It means that we can dynamically add

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,836
attributes to classes and they'll take on these new behaviors and the code that

5
00:00:14,836 --> 00:00:18,748
uses them will still work. It doesn't matter how we create an instance as long

6
00:00:18,748 --> 00:00:22,476
as it has the operation we need when we need it. There are certain dangers to

7
00:00:22,476 --> 00:00:26,200
duck typing. Just because an object has a quack method, it doesn't mean it

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,140
necessarily does what we expect. Not all ducks quack. Some would say mak, mak,

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,442
like they do in Romania.
