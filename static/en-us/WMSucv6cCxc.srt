Aside from its bookkeeping details,

2
00:00:02,163 --> 00:00:05,372
here's the bigger question
about work-optimal list scan.

3
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:09,767
How many times do you need to run the
parallel randomized independent set in

4
00:00:09,767 --> 00:00:11,314
order to shrink the list?

5
00:00:11,314 --> 00:00:12,943
And when I say shrink the list,

6
00:00:12,943 --> 00:00:16,158
I mean shrink the list to the target
size which is n over log n.

7
00:00:16,158 --> 00:00:18,085
Here are your answer choices.

8
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:19,820
I want you to choose the best one.
