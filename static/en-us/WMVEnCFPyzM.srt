1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,709
Now we're going to add a second

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:03,839
View Controller to our app. Adding another

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:05,580
screen and View Controller to manage

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,740
that screen is just what we need to turn

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,750
Pitch Perfect into the app that we want.

6
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,630
With the library panel open in the

7
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,400
bottom right hand corner, we need to find

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,138
a View Controller, so that we can drag it

9
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:21,028
onto the screen. Let's give ourself some

10
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:23,250
space and then drag the View Controller

11
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,370
onto the storyboard like this.

12
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,649
You may want to position it as I've done

13
00:00:29,649 --> 00:00:31,329
here to the right of our View Controller

14
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:35,079
for recording. Also, let's use our old

15
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:36,549
trick of changing the background color

16
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:38,710
of this new View Controller, so that it's

17
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,179
something other than white and we can

18
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:42,130
distinguish it from our View Controller

19
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:56,289
for recording. So I’ll select the View

20
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,460
and I'll go with this light blue color.

21
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,100
You can set the color to whatever you like,

22
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,460
just something other than white.

23
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,230
For now what I want to do is connect that

24
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,480
transition to the stop recording button.

25
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,640
This will cause the after transition to

26
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,140
the second View Controller whenever the

27
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,590
user taps the stop button. First select

28
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:15,790
the Stop Recording Button in the

29
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:19,060
document outline, then hold control and

30
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,709
click and drag to the new View

31
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:25,120
Controller. You can either drag to the

32
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,829
View Controller here in the document

33
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:28,959
outline or you can drag to the View

34
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:30,819
Controller over in the main editing area

35
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:34,299
for storyboard. When the pop-up appears

36
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:39,430
for the Action Segue, select Show.

37
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,019
You'll now see this new symbol and arrow

38
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:43,840
connecting the two View Controllers.

39
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,930
This is called a Segue. Remember that we

40
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,459
previously wired up the Stop Recording

41
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:51,368
Button to stopRecording function

42
00:01:51,368 --> 00:01:52,780
via an IBAction.

43
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,640
This means the Stop Recording Button is

44
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,759
now doing two things. First it's going to

45
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,370
call our code in our View Controller for

46
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,680
the stopRecording function, and now it's

47
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,569
also going to cause this Segue to occur,

48
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:05,920
that moves us to the next View Controller.

49
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,199
Now you may be thinking to yourself,

50
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,509
wait a minute, where's the code

51
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:12,819
for this new View Controller? We never

52
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:15,549
created any class. Well you're correct,

53
00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:18,129
storyboard is just using a default

54
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:20,019
UIViewController right now. It's not a

55
00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:21,580
subclass that you've written, it's just a

56
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,500
plain old View Controller with a plain

57
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,449
old UIView, where we change the

58
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:27,400
background color. Let's run the app and

59
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,129
see what happens.

60
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:33,889
If we click to record and then click to

61
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:35,870
stop the recording, we can see the

62
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,550
UINavigationController has transitioned

63
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,849
us to the second View Controller.

64
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:42,560
Also take a moment to notice this bar at the top.

65
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,379
It's called the navigation bar and

66
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:48,199
it has a Back button. This is the default

67
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:50,120
back button that will return you to the

68
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,340
previous View Controller. it's sort of a

69
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,270
breadcrumb if you will. If we click it, we

70
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,919
go back to our initial View Controller.

71
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:00,349
we've just scratched the surface of the

72
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:02,659
UINavigationController, because that's

73
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:04,129
all we need for now in order to continue

74
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:07,069
building the Pitch Perfect app. In UIKit

75
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:08,360
fundamentals, you're going to learn about

76
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,669
UINavigationControllers in much

77
00:03:10,669 --> 00:03:16,419
further detail.
