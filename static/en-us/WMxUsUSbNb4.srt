00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,210
Let's see if we can do another one. 
What if we have h of x equals one over x

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,606
squared plus three? 
If we want to write this as f of g of x,

3
00:00:08,606 --> 00:00:12,557
what are g and f? 
Now just to tell you, there isn't only

4
00:00:12,557 --> 00:00:15,900
one right answer here. 
See if you can find more than one.

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,524
This is the perfect chance to use some 
creative thinking and play around with

6
00:00:18,524 --> 00:00:19,570
your math.
