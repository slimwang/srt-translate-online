1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the answer is this one over here.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It takes a pixel and subtracts

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
the vertically next pixel from it.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And if there's a horizontal edge,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
if we have an image where the values over here are large,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
the values over here are small,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
then the specific filter over here,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
when applied to the transition between

9
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
the large and small values will give you a large response.
