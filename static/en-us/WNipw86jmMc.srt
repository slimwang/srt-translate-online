1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,920
For this quiz, I want you to
do a little bit of research.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,320
I'm giving you a link, below,
to the Mozilla Developer Network.

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,480
It has an HTML element reference
that is a super useful tool for

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,510
every web developer.

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,960
In fact, I encourage you to use Mozilla
Developer Network whenever you want to

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,030
look something up.

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,650
In fact, I want you to practice now.

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,460
I'm going to give you this html.

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,410
I want you to search for bold in
emphasis, over here, in your browser.

10
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,785
Just use the find function, which is
either going to be a Cmd f or Ctrl f.

11
00:00:33,785 --> 00:00:37,365
And then once you've found out
how to make something bold or

12
00:00:37,365 --> 00:00:39,755
emphasize it, do that over here.

13
00:00:39,755 --> 00:00:43,695
Make this text bold and
then emphasize this text.

14
00:00:43,695 --> 00:00:44,565
Good luck.

15
00:00:44,565 --> 00:00:45,265
I know that you can do it.
