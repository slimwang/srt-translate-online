00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,937
So now, we are going to look at non-parametric models formally.

2
00:00:04,937 --> 00:00:10,413
We defined a derived feature which is x equal to the absolute

3
00:00:10,413 --> 00:00:15,897
value of the difference between f0 and f1 divided by f0.

4
00:00:15,897 --> 00:00:21,150
What this means in practice is that the ratio of the submitted charge, f0, to

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,660
the difference between the submitted charge and the payment amount by medicare.

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,275
When you're making a derived feature, make sure what that represent,

7
00:00:32,275 --> 00:00:34,810
makes sense in your given problem.
