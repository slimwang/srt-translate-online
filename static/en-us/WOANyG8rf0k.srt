1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:06,410
The answer is that we add one more path,
the path to Bucharest.

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:10,359
We don't add the path going back
because it's in the explored list, but

3
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:12,619
we don't terminate yet.

4
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:16,239
True, we have added a path
that ends in Bucharest but

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,789
the goal test isn't applied when
we add a path to the Frontier.

6
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,259
Rather it's applied when we remove
that path from the Frontier, and

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,170
we haven't done that yet
