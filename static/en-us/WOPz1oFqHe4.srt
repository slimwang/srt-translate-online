1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,559
an understanding of the data combined
with the business issue understanding

2
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:09,329
will help you as you prepare the data
for analysis which is the third step of

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,410
the problem solving framework when
starting analysis

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,070
it's a rare occasion for the data to be
ready without some level of preparation

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,019
preparing the data generally includes
one or more of the following actions

6
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:29,460
gathering cleansing formatting blending
and sampling the data when gathering the

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,880
data you may need to collect data from
multiple sources within your

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,109
organization the data set you are
working with may have issues that you

9
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:39,808
want to resolve prior to analysis

10
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:44,759
this can be in the form of incorrect or
missing data you may need to format the

11
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:48,719
data by changing the way a date field
appears renaming a field or even

12
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,660
rotating the data similar to using a
pivot table

13
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:56,369
you may want to blend or combine your
data with other data sets to enrich it

14
00:00:56,369 --> 00:01:01,738
with additional variables similar to
using the vlookup function in Excel and

15
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:05,789
lastly you may want to sample the data
set and work with a more manageable

16
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:11,520
number of Records referring back to our
electricity example we identified that

17
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,810
we may need to obtain some data from the
national weather service to get forecast

18
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,820
high and low temperatures as well as
historical temperature data the data we

19
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:24,959
obtain may not be in a usable format so
we may need to prepare the data for

20
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:30,000
analysis by formatting enriching and
cleansing the data will also gather data

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,228
from our internal systems such as past
electricity usage as well as any other

22
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:37,228
data we may have that may prove useful
to our analysis

23
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:42,450
Maureen Wolfson has dedicated an entire
course of preparing your data for

24
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,630
analysis and we'll go into detail about
the data preparation step
