00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,530
Welcome back introduction computer vision.

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,520
Today, we're going to be talking about intrinsic camera calibration.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,350
Last time, we said, that we're going to do geometric calibration in general, and

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,710
that there were two parts to calibration.

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:15,760
The first transformation is from some arbitrary world coordinate system,

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,700
to the camera system or the camera pose, and this was the extrinsic parameters,

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,320
and it mapped from, world coordinates to camera coordinates, or

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,330
camera coordinates to world, depending upon how you think about it.

9
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,570
When we write it as T, W, C, it takes you from the world, to the camera.

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,700
We expressed it in terms of homogeneous coordinates,

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,980
where we had a world coordinate p here expressed in that world coordinate frame,

12
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,350
and it was homogeneous so there's a one down there.

13
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,900
And we pump it through both the rotation component and the translation component

14
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,470
to get the three dimensional point in camera coordinates.

15
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:54,200
And, that world to camera matrix and codes what were referred to

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,250
as the extrinsic parameters or the extrinsic parameter matrix.

17
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,060
We also said that,

18
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,128
that encodes six degrees of freedom, three translation, three rotation.

19
00:01:03,128 --> 00:01:06,650
Today, we're going to talk about the second transformation which goes from

20
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:12,490
the 3D camera coordinates to the 2D image coordinates or the 2D image plane.

21
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,360
And these are referred to as the intrinsic parameters, and

22
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,270
we'll again come up with the intrinsic parameter matrix.
