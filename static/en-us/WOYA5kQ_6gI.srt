1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The answers are P and not P is valid.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That is, it's true when P is true because of this, and it's true when P is false because of this clause.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
P and not P is unsatisfiable.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
A symbol can't be both true and false at the same time.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
P or Q or P is equivalent to Q is valid.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So we know that it's true when either P or Q is true, so that's 3 out of the 4 cases.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
In the fourth case, both P and Q are false, and that means P is equivalent to Q.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And therefore, in all 4 cases, it's true.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
P implies Q or Q implies P, that's also valid.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Now in ordinary English that wouldn't be valid.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
If the 2 clauses or the 2 symbols P and Q were irrelevant to each other we wouldn't say that either one of those was true.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But in logic, one or the other must be true, according to the definitions of the truth tables.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And finally, this one's more complicated,

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:17,000
if Food then Party or if Drinks then Party implies if Food and Drinks then Party.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You can work it all out and both sides of the main implication work out to be equivalent to Not Food or Not Drinks or Party.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So that's the same as saying P implies P, saying one side is equivalent to the other side.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And if they're equivalent, then the implication relation holds.
