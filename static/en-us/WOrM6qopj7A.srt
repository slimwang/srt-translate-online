Alex net VG google annette and resnet

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,269
are important neural network

3
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:08,580
architectures you might want to use in

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,980
future projects in even if you build

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,230
your own neural network from scratch

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,449
you'll still want to fine tune it you

7
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:17,399
can save your network is you train and

8
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:19,199
then come back later to experiment with

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,539
new data an additional layer or

10
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,969
different hyper parameters as you

11
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:25,679
proceed to the final project think about

12
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:27,689
how you might use all the techniques you

13
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:29,730
learned including convolutions pooling

14
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,130
dropout and transfer learning to build

15
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,808
your own neural network for behavioral

16
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:39,229
