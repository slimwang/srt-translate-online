00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,900
There are only three basic primitives we ever send to the graphics processing

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,856
unit, points, line segments and triangles. Of these, triangles are by far the

3
00:00:09,856 --> 00:00:13,874
most important. For example, just about everything you see in a 3D game is

4
00:00:13,874 --> 00:00:17,560
ultimately made of triangles. Sometimes it's obvious where the triangles are

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,622
used, such as in Minecraft. Sometimes it's not, as in this shot from battlefield

00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:26,995
3, captured by Duncan Harris at dead end thrills. We're going to touch on points

7
00:00:26,995 --> 00:00:31,287
and lines only briefly so we can focus on triangles. Defining a point is simple,

8
00:00:31,287 --> 00:00:39,543
you just specify a 3D location. For example, this point is at 0.4 in x, 0.2 in y

9
00:00:39,543 --> 00:00:44,070
and 0.0 in z. By the way for all these examples I'm going to make the z values 0

10
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,453
but it can certainly have a different value. In 3D computer graphics you tend to

11
00:00:48,453 --> 00:00:53,108
set all three coordinates x, y, and z even if you are mostly working in 2D. By

12
00:00:53,108 --> 00:00:57,211
defining a second point we can create a line segment. The order of the points

13
00:00:57,211 --> 00:00:58,323
does not matter.
