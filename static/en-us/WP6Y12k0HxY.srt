00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,320
You've just built your first
Android App that renders Google Maps.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,460
You've learned how to create
a map fragment in the UI and

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,610
have that initialize Maps for you.

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:13,810
You also learned the beginnings of how
to get and use the Google map object

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:17,740
to allow users to change the map
while the app is running.

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,170
You've just begun to scratch the surface
of what's possible with Maps

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,410
in your Android apps.

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,370
Are you ready for more?

9
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:23,880
Great.

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,530
Let's go deeper.
