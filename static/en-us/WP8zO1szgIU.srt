1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, let's take a quiz.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In this scenario we have some large software under test,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and part of it is a library that's been flaky and has been giving us problems.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's say this library is implementing numerical functions,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and these numerical functions have been sometimes throwing floating point exceptions

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and crashing our system.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What happens is the vendor has given us a new version,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
but what we don't want to do is just roll that directly into our production system

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
because in the past we've gotten burned by that sort of thing

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
where we have deployed a new version and it contains flaws

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
that were worse than the flaws in the previous version.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What we're going to do is we're going to spend some time checking this thing out

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and trying to make sure that even if it's not that great

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
it's at least not worse than the previous version.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The question I have for you is what kind of testing is this most like?

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Is it unit testing?

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Is it white box testing? Is it black box testing?

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Or, on the other hand, is it stress testing?

19
00:00:50,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Okay, please take a minute to mark what you think is the best answer.
