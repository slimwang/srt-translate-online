1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In this exercise, I'm going to write some logical expressions

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
in propositional logic and ask you

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
if these expressions are always true or always false

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
or if their truth value depends on the values of the propositional variables.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The first sentence is smoke implies fire

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
is equivalent to smoke or not fire.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Is that true or false, or does it depend on the values of smoke and fire?

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The second sentence, again, smoke implies fire

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,000
is equivalent to not smoke implies not fire.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The third sentence, smoke implies fire

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,000
is equivalent to not fire implies not smoke.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The fourth sentence, big or dumb

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
or big implies dumb.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The final sentence, big and dumb

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,000
is equivalent to not, not big or not dumb.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
For each of these, tell me if they're always true regardless of the values of the variables,

17
00:01:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
always false or sometimes true and sometimes false.
