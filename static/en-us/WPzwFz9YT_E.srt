1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's go through a possible answer together.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I have to name my procedure with t_.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
That tells the interpreter that I'm defining a token.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Now I give the name of the token, LANGLESLASH.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That was given as part of the problem.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
All of our tokens are actually functions.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We've been eliding that bit. We're still going to skip over it.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Next I have to have a regular expression for the string that matches the token,

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and here again there's only 1 string that matches,

10
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and I'm going to return the token unchanged.
