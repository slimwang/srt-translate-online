00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Propositional logic. It's a powerful language for what it does.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And there are very efficient inference mechanisms for determining

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
validity and satisfiability, alhough we haven't discussed them.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But propositional logic has a few limitations.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
First, it can only handle true and false values.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
No capability to handle uncertainty like we did in probability theory.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And second, we can only talk about events that are true or false in the world.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We can't talk about objects that have properties,

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
such as size, weight, color, and so on.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Nor can we talk about the relations between objects.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And third, there are no shortcuts to succinctly talk about a lot of different things happening.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Say if we had a vacuum world with a thousand locations, and we wanted to say that every location is free of dirt.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We would need a conjunction of a thousand propositions.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
There's no way to have a single sentence saying that all the locations are clean all at once.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So, we will next cover first-order logic which addresses these two limitations.
