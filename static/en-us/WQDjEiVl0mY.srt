1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,920
So one of the problems was that Dev and

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:07,390
Ops were not talking with each other
early in the development process.

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,010
Ending up with incompatible environments
is a pretty bad result from that.

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,921
Suppose that Dev knew what Ops knows.

5
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:18,164
That the production system has to all
work together as an integrated unit that

6
00:00:18,164 --> 00:00:19,610
can be tested and scaled.

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:24,386
It can't be patched together from pieces
the last minute before launch, and

8
00:00:24,386 --> 00:00:27,040
suppose that Ops knew what Dev knows.

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,970
That the system under development
needs to change rapidly.

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,060
The technologies involved just
aren't going to be the same forever.

11
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,020
With that kind of shared knowledge,
Dev and

12
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,590
Ops could work together to come up
with a common deployment environment

13
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:43,110
that would work well both in
development and in production.

14
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,320
That would deploy well onto servers at
scale, while also developers make all of

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,090
the changes that they need
to build new features.

16
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,030
This is just one example of how
technical change can be made in

17
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,580
response to the social and
organizational challenges of DevOps.

18
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,340
There are different ways to implement
this particular change, but

19
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,850
first, let's take a look at the
situation in which this problem arises.
