00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So we covered a lot of material in the customer segment part of the business model canvas.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We talked about the jobs to be done. We talked about pains. We talked about gains.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We talked about multi-sided markets, and we've closed with market type.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Let me give you an example of a couple of startups who actually went

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and tried to define our customer segments.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So here was one.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The startup was actually trying to understand how to find foreign students at universities,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and so they were putting together their archetype and this was just the definition of meet the student

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and here's who they are and here's their family and oh this is their first time in America.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And because it was about providing financial services to foreign students,

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
they actually understood something about their credit score, about social security number,

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
US address, whether they were responsible academically and financially,

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and whether their social network was responsible.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Another example of a customer segment was someone making new kite boarding equipment.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Who were their customers? Professional kite surfers.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
They're solely concerned with performance. But they had another segment. Average kite surfers.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And they had a third, prospective kite surfers, and though I don't think they were this young

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
they were actually trying to understand how to segment their market

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and what their specific performance needs for kite surfs were in each segment.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The other thing that we're interested in doing if you remember in customer segments is

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
understanding a day in the life of a customer.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Now sometimes this could actually be diagrammed as to how do they spend their time.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And this happens to be how does a designer spend their time

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
putting together an architectural product.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So how much they spend in phase 1 and then in prototyping and manufacturing and final product,

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and so this was giving them a view of what it would look like and so they can now describe to me

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and others, "Oh! And our product fits right here and here's why," etc.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Here was another example of someone trying to understand the customer problem

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
of couples who happen to be on separate coasts or long distance from each other.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And they were trying to understand what the problems were and so they were able to

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
articulate all the key pieces and kind of rank them by priority.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And I thought that this was a great way to kind of diagram the problem.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Here was another example of a team putting together a detailed archetype

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
of a set of customers.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
They gave their archetype a name, Pat the Professional.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Specified who Pat was, upwardly mobile professional, salaries, what they did,

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
how much they spend, what their demographics are, what their traits were,

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,000
what their motivations were, how many were there, where they worked, where they bought, etc.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I thought this was a great example of a professional class consumer

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
who was shopping frequently online.

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Another example, in medical devices, trying to understand two segments,

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
oncologists and pathologists, here's what they did, here's what they cared about,

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and more importantly here's how they're paid.

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Here's how they're paid in the hospital and here's how they got reimbursed.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Here's another example of a mammography product,

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
how patient care works inside of a hospital and how people got reimbursed.

47
00:03:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So you could find these examples and more on the link below.
