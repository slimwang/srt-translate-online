00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,478
The usual default setting for a matrix is what is called the identity matrix. It

2
00:00:04,478 --> 00:00:08,410
consists of zeros everywhere, except along the diagonal, which is set to ones.

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,127
If you multiply any coordinate by this matrix, you get exactly the same

4
00:00:12,127 --> 00:00:15,930
coordinate back out. The first draw of the matrix selects the first coordinate

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,560
out of the coordinate array, the second row selects the second coordinate, and

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,318
so on. Try it yourself. In three.js, we create a Matrix4 by this bit of code. By

7
00:00:25,318 --> 00:00:29,805
default, this matrix is the identity matrix. If during processing, we want to

8
00:00:29,805 --> 00:00:34,903
reset the Matrix4 to identity, we call the identity method on the object itself.
