1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,969
So now let's review something
we had looked at before.

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:07,400
We had started a lecture off talking
about that images best represented

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,180
in this coordinate frame, x and y,
but an object in the real world.

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,440
And I referred to them as capital X,
Y, and Z.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,880
With Z is in the inside the camera
lens itself, that is the depth.

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,595
Y and X basically show the width and
the height of an object.

7
00:00:22,595 --> 00:00:26,350
So if I had an object like this, I
actually would actually capture an image

8
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,560
and, of course,
the coordinate frame X and Y here.

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,610
We represented that scene in 3D
this way, where now basically,

10
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,510
I've turned it around.

11
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,010
Z is going in this direction.

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,340
Y and X are this way.

13
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,650
And of course, the same object is here,
shown by this arrow.

14
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:45,470
And here, I'm just giving it, you know,
values of X0, Y0, and Z0 in capitals.

15
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,790
Let's build this to kind of see what
the camera model would look like and

16
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,360
how we can compute depth.

17
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,430
These are the coordinate frames
in real-world coordinates.

18
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,510
Of course,
in a camera an image is formed.

19
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:01,180
Here I basically show this image and
the coordinates X and X and

20
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,150
Y, sub i for image.

21
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:07,640
Of course, this image is being
formed at focal length f.

22
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,634
And if you remember when we
looked at cameras we knew

23
00:01:10,634 --> 00:01:12,238
did all of the calculations.

24
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:15,853
That is, the similar triangles
to figure out that xy,

25
00:01:15,853 --> 00:01:19,623
xi over f is equal X0,
Z0, because you know,

26
00:01:19,623 --> 00:01:24,680
focal length is this distance, and
these are two similar triangles.

27
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,830
And of course,
I want to be able to use this to compute

28
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,420
where the x would be in the image.

29
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,190
And this would be my equation,
similarly for y, Y sub i.

30
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,620
That is the pixel information.

31
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,090
In this image it's basically
related to both the focal length,

32
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,780
how far it is, and
knowing information like where the Z is,

33
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,070
how far away this object
is from the scene.

34
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,870
Notice, this information is not
contained in this image, that is,

35
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,530
where is Z.

36
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,531
And that's the point that we want to
actually now start thinking how to

37
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:53,420
actually compute.

38
00:01:53,420 --> 00:02:00,180
So in essence, this equation would
apply the same if this point was here.

39
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,090
So this point here could
actually be at this location.

40
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,900
Same equations would apply.

41
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,620
Also if, I can basically find
any point in this line here,

42
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,440
which is the ray of light that's
going through this point.

43
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,960
So, the point I wanted to emphasize
here is there is a fundamental

44
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,720
ambiguity here.

45
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,630
That is, any point on this line

46
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:24,750
in the same ray maps to the same
point on the image plane, right?

47
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,810
Any point here, of course,
the values of Zs are different.

48
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,940
The values of X and Y are different.

49
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,636
But when it comes down to where there
are, that is x sub i and y sub i.

50
00:02:33,636 --> 00:02:36,598
All of those values of
any point in this ray

51
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:40,530
of light is going to project
exactly to this point.

52
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,030
In essence, what that suggests is
I can actually scale any of these

53
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,780
three values, X naught, Y naught, or
Z naught for the world coordinates.

54
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,020
Basically that means put the same scale,
I mean, this, the same equation.

55
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,860
So in essence, that suggest is there is
a scaling factor here between both of

56
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,770
these images that will actually
produce the same x i, y i, and

57
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,500
actually make sense, right?

58
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,056
As I move closer,
the object is get, getting smaller.

59
00:03:06,056 --> 00:03:08,380
And therefore,
this would be the scaling factor.

60
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,040
So, moving farther in, closer,
would be the scaling factor, and

61
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,740
of course, by multiplying and dividing
by the same k, we can see that impact.

62
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,210
So this is the ambiguity.

63
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:20,540
This is the one we want to resolve
in variety of different ways, and

64
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,240
that resolution of that ambiguity will
give us depth or structure of a scene.
