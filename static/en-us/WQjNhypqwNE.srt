1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,550
Now that Git is installed, you'll need to download the asteroids repository.

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,610
To do that, you'll need to be somewhere with internet access,

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,340
which is why I've left the forest.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,200
Now let's get started and download the repository.

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,320
I'm sure you've downloaded files before, but

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,280
in this case, what we're doing is a little different.

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,400
Because we don't just want to download the actual files,

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,910
which would be the files from the most recent comment.

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,840
Instead, we want to download the entire history.

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,490
Git has a command allowing you to copy an entire repository from one

11
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:28,910
computer to another.

12
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,830
The command is called git clone because it creates a clone of the repository.

13
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:39,640
To use it, type git clone followed by a URL to the other repository.

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,830
We put the URL for the asteroids repository in the instructors notes, so

15
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,220
go ahead and copy that URL and clone the repository like this.

16
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,770
Now I won't need Internet access anymore for

17
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,100
the rest of the lesson, so I'm going to head back to the forest.

18
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,480
Once the repository is finished cloning, go ahead and cd into it.

19
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,360
Now you should be able to use git log and git diff just like I did earlier.

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,420
Go ahead and give it a try.

21
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,500
In order to get the colored diff output like you saw earlier, with the red for

22
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,810
deletions and green for

23
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:15,981
insertions, run the command git config --global color.ui auto.

24
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,370
If you don't do this, you'll just see black and

25
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,890
white diffs, which will be harder to read.

26
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:26,960
The git config command just changes your settings in Git and the --global flag

27
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,270
means that it will apply to all of your Git projects and not only this one.

28
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,230
Use git log to find the ID of the commit that reverted the controls.

29
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,610
This commit has the message Revert controls.

30
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,530
Enter the idea of that commit in this box.

31
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:45,710
Then use git diff to find how many lines were added and

32
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,420
deleted by that commit and enter those numbers here.

33
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:54,020
Recall that to find the difference between two commits, you use the command git

34
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,670
diff, the ID of the first commit and then the ID of the second commit.
