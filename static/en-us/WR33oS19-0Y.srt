1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now, a simple way for you to start

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
with your customer segment hypotheses is rank

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
each job according to what you believe

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
is its significance to the customer.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And you get to guess on day 1 is it crucial or trivial?

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And take a guess about how frequently it occurs,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and outline what specific context a job gets done.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I call this the day in the life of a customer.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
That is, you ultimately ought to be able to go up

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
to a white board and diagram for me or anybody else

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
here's what a customer does from the moment they get up

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
to when they go to work or when they're at school or something else,

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and here are the products they use and the car they drive

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and what they read, et cetera, and if you really don't have a deep understanding

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
of that customer and where your product fits

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
you're really going to have a hard time understanding them.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Now, just remember on day 1 all you're mostly doing

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
is guessing, but the whole objective

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
of getting out of the building is trying to fill in

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
this day in the life, so actually when you say something

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
about here's how we ought to go advertise to them or reach them

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
or get Google AdWords to them that you're just not saying

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
it's because I think so.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's because you're saying I've spoken to a ton of these people,

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and they'd love to buy our stuff, but here's how we reach them,

26
00:01:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
or here's the key message we need to deliver.
