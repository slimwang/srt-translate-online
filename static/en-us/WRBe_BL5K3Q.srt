00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,050
Before you start discussing mental disorders in detail, I want to ask you

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:07,226
something. Do you know somebody with a mental disorder? Have you seen someone

3
00:00:07,226 --> 00:00:11,461
on TV or even in public, with, let's say, schizophrenia? How did that make you

4
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:16,215
feel? Were you uncomfortable? Were you afraid? Unfortunately, historically,

5
00:00:16,215 --> 00:00:18,915
people with mental disorders were shunned and even isolated from their

6
00:00:18,915 --> 00:00:24,252
communities. They were also subjected to bizarre treatments. All because people

7
00:00:24,252 --> 00:00:27,684
didn't understand where these mental illnesses came from, or what was causing

8
00:00:27,684 --> 00:00:32,296
this behavior. Now, throughout this lesson I want you to think about this

9
00:00:32,296 --> 00:00:35,116
negative stigma and how, the increase of mental health literacy, we can

10
00:00:35,116 --> 00:00:39,415
diminish this stigma. Fortunately, today we've come a long way in understanding

11
00:00:39,415 --> 00:00:43,324
the causes of mental illness. In fact, the're entire media campaign is

12
00:00:43,324 --> 00:00:47,048
dedicated to teaching people about what mental illness is. And there's no

13
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:52,563
reason for someone today to be stigmatized because of mental illness. In fact,

14
00:00:52,563 --> 00:00:57,100
we should look at it just like we do any other human illness such as diabetes.

15
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,570
People with diabetes face daily challenges as do people with mental illness.

16
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:05,740
However, by managing their symptoms, both can live a happy and fufilling life.
