00:00:00,305 --> 00:00:04,700
Okay, now in order to go further, let us start thinking in terms of,

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:12,010
how we can put all of these precepts and goal, into some feature value language,

3
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:16,520
so that we can store it inside Sole. It is one attempt at capturing all of

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,070
this knowledge, so I can say that it's the 7th inning. Inning is 7th.

5
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,600
It's the top of the 7th inning. It's the top here. Runners are on 2nd and

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,030
3rd base. 2nd and 3rd base. And then so on and

7
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:32,119
so forth. Note that at the bottom I have goal is to escape the inning.

8
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:36,300
Which I think means in this particular context, to go to the next inning,

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,320
without letting the batter score anymore points. So now that we have. Put all of

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,150
this precepts coming from the world and the goal, into some kind of simple

11
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:51,270
representation which has features and values in it, the fun is going to begin.
