1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,530
So somebody that that's applying for

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,930
a job in a startup hopefully
knows what they're going into.

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:10,130
It's a very different environment
compensation wise clearly, but

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:15,790
also the scope of work and
what every person gets to work on.

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,700
The good news is startup work and

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,210
big corporate work
are very different things.

7
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,680
Not good or bad just different.

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,390
And I think employees recognize that.

9
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:32,380
Making sure you explain what it takes
to be an employer in your startup,

10
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,920
how it's different than
Company X perhaps that

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,490
that person worked with before and
just as important,

12
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:44,480
acknowledging the risks Identified in
corporate perhaps there's less risk.

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,700
In start up life
significantly more risk, but

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,400
also greater rewards if
the start up does well.

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,750
So making sure the employee understand
that risk reward balance and

16
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,030
how that shifts between corporate
to start up is really critical.
