1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,910
In our code, we're going to initialize
the adapter

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,950
within the Placeholder Fragment
onCreateView method.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,160
Because that's where we want the ListView
to be populated with data.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,555
We're using a ArrayAdapter, and we can
initialize it with four parameters:

5
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:14,693
A context,

6
00:00:14,693 --> 00:00:16,557
the ID of a list item layout,

7
00:00:16,977 --> 00:00:20,041
the ID of a text view within that list item layout,

8
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,885
as well as a list of data.

9
00:00:21,885 --> 00:00:24,870
We'll go through each of these
parameters one by one now.

10
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,670
First, for context -- it contains global
information about the app environment.

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,000
It allows us to access system
services and resources,

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,230
as well as the application specific
resources that we've defined.

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,720
We use the fragments containing
activity as the context.

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,490
So, we're going to call getActivity
for our parameter here.

15
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,890
Since the adapter needs to know
the layout for each list item,

16
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,370
it needs some reference
to the XML layouts that we've defined.

17
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:56,500
The r.java class is a generated file
that creates human readable identifiers

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,030
for our resources.

19
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:02,860
For the list item layout, we refer to it
in code as R.layout.list_item_forecast.

20
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,996
This was the name of the XML file
that we created earlier.

21
00:01:07,876 --> 00:01:11,400
Next, the array adapter needs to know
how to take the weather forecast string

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,850
and set that to be displayed
in a text view.

23
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,474
So you pass in the ID of the text view
that we defined earlier,

24
00:01:17,474 --> 00:01:18,978
in the list item layout.

25
00:01:19,392 --> 00:01:22,009
Even though these two
resource IDs look similar,

26
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:26,106
one starts with R.layout
while the other starts with R.id.

27
00:01:26,106 --> 00:01:32,133
R.layout refers to a layout file, while
an ID refers to a specific XML element

28
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,574
with the matching ID attribute.

29
00:01:34,574 --> 00:01:36,772
And lastly, we pass in weekForecast,

30
00:01:36,772 --> 00:01:40,350
which is the array list of forecast data
that we defined earlier.

31
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,450
Now go ahead and initialize your adapter.

32
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,370
Check this box when you're done.
