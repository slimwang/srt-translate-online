00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now I can tell you I'm tempted to check mark "eat pizza,"

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
but that isn't the most important thing a statistician does.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The most important thing is to look at the data.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I can't over emphasize how important this is.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
A great statistician differs from an okay statistician by the ability to spend a lot of time

6
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
just looking at data.
