00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,110
Let's discuss more about
the Bayesian Detection Rate.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,910
We can use the base
theorem to expand this.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:11,040
And we got this formula here P(I) is
the prior probability of attacks.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,440
Meaning this is the probability of
intrusion evidences in the data.

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,180
An intuitive example is that on
a typical day, what's the percentage

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,550
of packets that contain intrusion
activities in our network.

7
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,250
There's an interesting phenomenon
about Bayesian detection rate

8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,360
called the base-rate fallacy.

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,050
Even if the false alarm rate is very
low, as long as it is not zero, then

10
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:40,700
the Bayesian detection rate is still low
even if the base rate is also very low.

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,130
For example,
using the formula in the previous slide,

12
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:49,140
if we plug in these numbers,
meaning the detachment rate is 100%,

13
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,765
false alarm rate is 10 to the -5,
and the base rate is

14
00:00:53,765 --> 00:00:59,140
2 times 10 to the -5, then
the Bayesian Detection Rate is only 66%.

15
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,560
In other words, one-third of the time
when the ideas produces an alert,

16
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,510
there is no intrusion.

17
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,785
If you look at these
numbers more carefully,

18
00:01:07,785 --> 00:01:10,720
100% detection rate is perfect.

19
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,930
False alarm rate of 10
to the -5 is also great.

20
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,230
This is not 0, but is very, very low.

21
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:21,620
So you may ask,
is this low base rate realistic?

22
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,310
This is 2 x 10 to the -5.

23
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,430
It depends on where do you
measure the base rate.

24
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,700
For example, if you measure base rate at
the network packet level meaning that,

25
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,930
the number of packets that
contain intrusion activities

26
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,520
which can be hundreds or thousands to
a total number of packets in the network

27
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,190
which can be tens and
hundreds of millions.

28
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,722
Then this base-rate can
be quite realistic.

29
00:01:43,722 --> 00:01:49,250
So the base-rate falicy says that, as
long as the false alarm rates' not zero,

30
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,920
then when the IDS produces an alert

31
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,530
the probability that an intrusion
has actually occurred is also low.

32
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,000
So how do we address this problem?

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,230
We can reduce the false alarm rate
to be zero, or as much as possible.

34
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:07,400
In fact, that's what the vendors
of IDS have been trying to do.

35
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,300
Or we can deploy the IDS
to the appropriate layer so

36
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,380
that, at that layer,
the base rate is sufficiently high.

37
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:20,000
Modern day ideas use a heirarchal
architecture to achieve this.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,520
We can also use multiple
independent models.

39
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,380
This is similar to medical diagnosis
where multiple tests are used to

40
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,500
reduce the overall false positive rate
and increase the base indication rate.
