You did this before, but I wanted you to do it again just for practice. Your

2
00:00:04,712 --> 00:00:09,835
sample size is 25. So there are 24 degrees of freedom. And then if the alpha

00:00:09,835 --> 00:00:17,224
level is 0.05. And we're doing a 2 tailed test. Then 0.025 is in each tail.

4
00:00:17,224 --> 00:00:22,798
Therefore, our t critical value is 2.064 and negative 2.064.
