1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So welcome to Unit 6.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In Unit 6 we're going to look at ways to use cryptography

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
to solve a wide range of problems.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In Unit 5 we focused all on using cryptography

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
to solve the traditional problem of authentication

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and then communication with secrecy and integrity.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What we're going to look at in Unit 6 is

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
different kinds of problems we can solve using cryptography.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The first thing we'll look at is Anonymous Communication,

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and we'll learn about how to use a chain of asymmetric encryption

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
to enable two parties to communicate over a network

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
without anyone knowing that they're even talking with each other.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Then we'll look at how to do voting,

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and there are lots of issues with voting--we won't get into all of them--

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
but we'll look at the issue of can you provide an accurate tally--

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
know that each vote is counted without revealing who voted for whom.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This will also be done using a chain of asymmetric encryptions

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
but with some added features to ensure that the vote tally is correct.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Then we'll look at ways to provide digital cash--

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
a way to represent and transfer value similar to paper cash

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
that can be done all with cryptography.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This will involve introducing some new techniques.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We'll look at a centralized way of doing that

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
which can be done using a new technique called blind signatures.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And we'll also look at a decentralized way of doing that

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
that doesn't require any trusted authority

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
but uses proofs of work to create value.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And this is what the bitcoin network does.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This is just a small sampling

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
of the kinds of things that you can do using cryptography.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
All of these can be used just using the tools we've seen in this class.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And we'll see ways to use asymmetric cryptography

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
in many different ways in these examples.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We'll also see ways to use symmetric cryptography,

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
including hash functions,

36
00:01:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
as well as one-time pads.
