What's great about division is we can always check our answer. We know division

2
00:00:05,051 --> 00:00:10,199
and multiplication are inverse operations of each other, so if I take my answer

3
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:14,957
4x to the 6 plus 6x to the 4th minus 3x squared and multipliy it by 2x, what we

4
00:00:14,957 --> 00:00:19,993
were originally divided by, we should get our same polynomial. 2x Times 4x to

5
00:00:19,993 --> 00:00:24,667
the 6 is 8x to the 7th, 2x times 6x to the 4th is 12x to the 5th And 2x times

6
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:30,091
negative 3x squared is negative 6x cubed, this is great. We know our polynomials

7
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:34,389
match, so this must be the correct answer to our division problem.
