00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,930
A lot of people seem to think that
web apps can never compete with

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:09,890
native mobile apps for reliability,
speed and user engagement.

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:13,580
And itâ€™s hard to build
a business case for them.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,660
You know what?

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,840
They used to be right.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,460
But two things have changed.

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,530
First, it turns out that most people

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,940
buy most of their apps when they
get their phone or shortly after.

9
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,770
Worse, most people install a few
common apps and call it a day.

10
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,010
That makes it harder for
developers to compete.

11
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,080
But people still keep using the web.

12
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,950
And a few new technologies let you
offer key features customers want,

13
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:43,590
from native apps.

14
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,990
We call these progressive web apps.

15
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,412
Progressive web apps are web apps
that took all the right vitamins.

16
00:00:52,412 --> 00:00:57,421
They are experiences that combined the
best of the web and the best of apps.

17
00:00:57,421 --> 00:01:01,848
They give users the kind of reliable,
fast, and engaging experience that

18
00:01:01,848 --> 00:01:06,220
they've come to expect from native
apps that delivered through the web.
