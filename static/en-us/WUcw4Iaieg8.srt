1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,820
Now, if you were to take a look a little
more carefully at these photoreceptors,

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,840
and actually look at them for
real, you would see two types.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,810
You would see rods and cones.

4
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,400
Now, we've, we've looked at this picture
before when we're talking about color,

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,230
but now we want to
talk about the anatomy.

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,200
So, the rods are these little,
skinny structures here, and there

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,840
are something like, it says 120 million
rods, plus or minus, within your retina.

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,540
They are very, very light sensitive,

9
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:33,380
about 1000 times more light sensitive
than the cones, if given time to adapt.

10
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,940
We'll see that in a minute.

11
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,530
And it can sort of help
you discriminate between,

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,340
of different illumination levels
at very low overall illumination.

13
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,710
The other structures here are the cones,
and we've actually seen these before.

14
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,745
The cones are the things that
allow you to discriminate color.

15
00:00:50,745 --> 00:00:52,605
We talked about them when
we talked about the short,

16
00:00:52,605 --> 00:00:54,885
medium and long wavelength cones.

17
00:00:54,885 --> 00:00:58,945
The cones are also the ones
that are packed within your,

18
00:00:58,945 --> 00:00:59,905
what are called your fovea.

19
00:00:59,905 --> 00:01:02,745
That is that middle area that
has the very high resolution.

20
00:01:02,745 --> 00:01:04,905
We'll talk about the impact
of that in a minute.

21
00:01:04,905 --> 00:01:09,910
And it's the cones that give you
sort of what we tend to think

22
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:14,950
of as the high quality vision, and the
rods sort of provide everything else.

23
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,460
Now by the way, even if you didn't
have an electron microscope, and

24
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,560
even if you hadn't sort of
peeled apart peoples' retinas.

25
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,040
It sounds kind of gross.

26
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,800
You would know that there are at
least a two kinds of systems

27
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,390
going on in the eye.

28
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,980
And one of the ways that this was
discovered is what's referred to as dark

29
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,820
adaptation experiments, okay.

30
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,200
So in dark adaptation,
here's what we do.

31
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,360
We, we put you in a dark room for
months at a time, no.

32
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,948
You put somebody in a dark room, and
you, let's say after one minute,

33
00:01:43,948 --> 00:01:48,382
you say, how bright a light do I have
to have a light to be before you can

34
00:01:48,382 --> 00:01:49,708
tell that it's on.

35
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:51,042
Okay, if you do that?

36
00:01:51,042 --> 00:01:53,860
And then later we do it all over again
and we do it for two minutes, and

37
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,208
then we do it for three minutes.

38
00:01:55,208 --> 00:02:00,031
Right, so we track to see how
much light you need in order

39
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:04,040
to detect that there's
some illumination.

40
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,790
Now we've all had this
experience before right?

41
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,900
You walk in from a bright day light into
a dark room and it takes a little while.

42
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,830
We say for your eyes to adjust.

43
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,560
Well, that adjustment is not
your pupil opening and closing.

44
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,980
That's a rapid response.

45
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,630
What's happening is, is that the pho-,

46
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,930
is that the photo receptors in your eye
are adjusting to the amount of light.

47
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:23,550
All right?

48
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:28,290
And if I were to track that,
I would see this kind of a curve.

49
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,580
Okay, I would see a curve that
starts going down like this, and

50
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,050
starts to look like it's
going to flatten out.

51
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,940
And then somewhere, this says about
eight minutes, varies on person to

52
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,600
person, somewhere around there, all of
a sudden it starts to drop down again.

53
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,370
Okay.

54
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,430
What's happened is your
rods are now kicking in.

55
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,440
Your rods are now coming into play.

56
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,590
And you can go way much,
much, much lower threshold.

57
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,220
All right.

58
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,010
And so, you know, when,
when you have a single system

59
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,320
you never get psychfisicers that
have sharp breaks like that, right.

60
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,910
And basically what you're seeing
here is there are two curves.

61
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,840
There's a curve here for cones.

62
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,010
And a curve here for rods.

63
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,220
And this was where they intersect,
all right?

64
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,780
And that's the sort of well-known
phenomena which implied that there was

65
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,410
multiple systems within the retina
in terms of light sensitivity.
