1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,570
Now that you've seen how to run the
sample, now's a good time for you go and

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,060
try it out for yourself.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,900
The first thing I want
you to do is to build and

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,200
install the sample to your phone and
wearable.

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,410
Then, switch between the watch
faces I just demonstrated.

6
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,950
Finally, I want you to select
a sample digital watch face.

7
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,530
Then I want you to use
the configuration activity

8
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:22,900
to select the same colored background as
the text for the interactive watch face.

9
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,470
So the question is what happens when
the watch goes into ambient mode?

10
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,170
And note that if you're
using the simulator,

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,345
you can enter ambient mode by pressing
the power button emulator interface.
