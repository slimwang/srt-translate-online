00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here's a fairly direct quiz to test your knowledge of

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
environment lookups when we have nested, or chained, environments.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So we have a global environment that maps a to 1,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
b to 2, c to 3, and three other environments.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You are in the last one.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And down here I have five questions.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I want to know the value of a, b, c, d, and e

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
as we would have computed it in our JavaScript interpreter.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Fill in the blanks. Tell me what each one is.
