1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,059
Now let's say you had a phobia of snakes, and your therapist going to use

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:09,218
systematic desensitization. First you learn the relaxation techniques, then

3
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:13,244
your therapist starts pairing the relaxation techniques with snake-related

4
00:00:13,244 --> 00:00:17,857
stimuli. Now I want you to place the level of exposure you are about to see on

5
00:00:17,857 --> 00:00:21,553
a hierarchy that you would expect therapist to use when gradually exposing you

6
00:00:21,553 --> 00:00:28,684
to a snake. Seeing a picture of a snake in a terrarium, seeing a real snake in

7
00:00:28,684 --> 00:00:35,268
a terrarium across the room. Holding a snake, seeing the word snake in print,

8
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:42,241
seeing a picture of someone holding a snake. Hearing the word snake, imagining

9
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:48,522
a snake, and seeing someone hold a snake from across the room. Write a letter

10
00:00:48,522 --> 00:00:51,882
in each one of these boxes that goes from the least exposure, so the first

11
00:00:51,882 --> 00:00:55,298
things that you'd be exposed to to get rid of your snake phobia, to the most

12
00:00:55,298 --> 00:01:00,402
exposure. For example, this would be the last day of your therapy and you are

13
00:01:00,402 --> 00:01:02,410
no longer scared of snakes.
