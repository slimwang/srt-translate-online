00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,496
So we know that we need to move this parabola up in order to make it fit our

2
00:00:04,496 --> 00:00:09,208
real world situation, but by how much do we need to move it up? If I'd like to

3
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:13,933
have one of the roots of our parabola after we've moved it upward, equal to 0,

4
00:00:13,933 --> 00:00:17,871
then by how much do we need to translate this parabola upward?
