00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,520
What you'll find when you start to poke around, either at the code or

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,100
at the documentation, is that a large value of

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,400
C means that you're going to get more training points correct.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,290
So what that means in practice is that you get the more intricate

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:14,850
decision boundaries with the larger values of C where it

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,580
can wiggle around individual data points to try to get everything correct.

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,200
But at the cost of something that,

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,820
that could be a little bit more complex than you liked it.

9
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,340
Figuring out exactly how much you want a straight decision.

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,050
Figuring out how much you want to have a smooth decision boundary versus one

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,720
that gets things correct is of course part of the artistry of machine learning.
