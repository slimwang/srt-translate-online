00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,932
Previously we initialized an instance of
RPSGame and assigned it to self.game.

2
00:00:05,932 --> 00:00:08,790
What does self.game refer to?

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:09,978
Take a few seconds to guess.

4
00:00:09,978 --> 00:00:12,258
[BLANK_AUDIO]

5
00:00:12,258 --> 00:00:17,423
Since we're in the RPSController class,
self refers to the RPSController,

6
00:00:17,423 --> 00:00:21,998
self.game refers to the game
property of the RPS controller.

7
00:00:21,998 --> 00:00:24,230
In Objective C, just like in swift,

8
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,370
we can use dot syntax to access
properties of an instance of a class.

9
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,650
So if we wanted to say
orchestrate a tie,

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,540
we could access the move
property of each turn like this.

11
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,580
Notice that we never wrote any getters
or setters for the game property.

12
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,140
Objective C generated
them automatically.

13
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,070
Swift generates getters and
setters automatically, too.

14
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,820
In fact, you might not even
know what I mean by getters and

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,860
setters because in most cases you
can get away with not writing them.

16
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,110
If we were using a custom setter,

17
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,100
the code to set self.game would
look something like this.
