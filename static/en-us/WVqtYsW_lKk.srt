00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,725
Now, these three equations we came up with are great and all, but Grant is a

2
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:07,965
visual person. And frankly, so am I. So, we can help Grant make a decision about

3
00:00:07,977 --> 00:00:11,995
which of these three brands of cleaning solution would be best to go with, let's

4
00:00:12,007 --> 00:00:15,990
make some xy tables. I've given you values of x already, for each of the tables.

5
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:20,070
And I'd just like you to fill in the corresponding values of y, according to the

6
00:00:20,082 --> 00:00:21,380
equation above each table.
