1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the approximation factor here is a 2,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
because the length of the shortest tour

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
is larger than the weight of the tree.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And the solution that we output is twice the weight of the tree,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
so it must lie somewhere in between here,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
which tells you that this solution here

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
is at most twice as large as an optimum solution.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So Dave can now be very happy

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
because he has a factor 2 approximation algorithm for his problem.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Which, of course, should he ask you,

11
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
you can easily explain to him, because you figured out most of this by yourself.
