1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,320
The result of convolution and correlation is the same when these choose

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,360
the right answer by checking one of the boxes here.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,250
When the kernel uses symmetric in both X and Y or U and V.

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:16,460
Or the kernel uses not a box response.

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,970
Kernel used has negative values.

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,180
Image being filtered is gray scale.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,580
Or image has symmetric histogram.
