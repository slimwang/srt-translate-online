1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,960
So now that we have seen how to compute

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,676
manufacturing costs, let's do a manufacturing cost quiz. Let's say

3
00:00:06,676 --> 00:00:09,214
that we can build a one millimeter squared processor for

4
00:00:09,214 --> 00:00:12,156
watches, which we will call Watch Processor, or WP. Let's

5
00:00:12,156 --> 00:00:15,351
also say that we can build a 100 millimeter squared

6
00:00:15,351 --> 00:00:18,901
processor for laptops, or we will call it laptop processor

7
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:21,550
or LP. Which of the following is true about their

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,340
cost? The cost of a laptop processor is 100 times

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,680
the cost of a watch processor. The cost of a

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,410
laptop processor is more than a hundred times the cost of

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,548
a watch processor. Or the cost of a laptop processor

12
00:00:34,548 --> 00:00:37,570
is less than 100 times the cost of a watch processor.
