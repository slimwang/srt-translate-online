1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,410
Let's get back to the throwDown method.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,910
We managed to initialize the player's
turn with this line of code.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,625
Now we need to initialize a turn for
the computer.

4
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:11,220
We'll just use the default
init method for now.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,245
And now that we have turns for
both players, we can initialize a game.

6
00:00:15,245 --> 00:00:18,105
Notice that when you have long
method names like this that might

7
00:00:18,105 --> 00:00:22,825
not fit on one line, the convention
is to line up the colons like this.

8
00:00:22,825 --> 00:00:26,105
Xcode will do it for
you automatically if you press return.

9
00:00:26,105 --> 00:00:29,375
So now we have an instance
of RPSGame to work with and

10
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:31,435
our throwDown method is finished.
