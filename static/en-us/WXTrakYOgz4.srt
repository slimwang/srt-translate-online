00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,770
To solidify our understanding of
this inverse Fast Fourier Transform,

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:04,410
let's do an exercise.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,120
Suppose that A is at most a cubic, and

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,600
the values at the fourth roots
of unity are as shown here.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,580
And I want you to find
the coefficients of A.
