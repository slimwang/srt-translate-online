1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And now finally, we come up with the actual posterior,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
whereas this one over here is often called the joint probability of two events.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And the posterior is obtained by dividing this guy over here with this normalizer.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So let's do this over here--let's divide this guy over here by this normalizer to get

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
my percent distribution of having cancer given that I received the positive test result.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So divide this number by this.
