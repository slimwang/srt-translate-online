00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
All right, so now we're in a good position to define the set p of polynomial time decidable problems.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So this is a set, this includes a bunch of problems, a problem is in the set if there's an algorithm

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
for that problem such as that when inputs size n, the running time for solving that problem

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
is in big O then to the k for some constant k.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So there has to be some kind of polynomial upper bound of an algorithm

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
to solve that problem for the problem to be in p.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This k--this constant k is allowed to vary with the class of the problem, but any particular instance

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
still needs to be solved and into the k.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So it's nÂ˛--they're at the end of the fifth--whatever it happens to be.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And just in case it's not obvious, running times like Î of logn are in big O nk for some k.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
In this case, k=1 suffices.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The class p is often contrasted with the class np that I'm going to define next.
