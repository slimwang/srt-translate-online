00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,040
To perhaps get you a little more comfortable with looking at first order logic,

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,220
we're going to parse this a piece at a time. First,

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,929
we are concerned with valid concrete states T. In which all the invariants,

4
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:19,350
that is invC corresponds to concrete invariants, hold on that state. Now

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,340
consider the corresponding abstract states and remember the retrieve function.

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,370
We can go from the concrete states to the abstract states by using the retrieve

7
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:32,159
function. If we are in the abstract state, the corresponding abstract state. And

8
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,620
we want to execute the abstract operation with arguments, some argument list,

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,890
called args here. Then of course, it's preconditioned. Which we've

10
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:48,910
indicated with the prefix ERE, on the retrieve state,

11
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:52,877
and the arguments must hold. If the abstract precondition does hold, and if

12
00:00:52,877 --> 00:00:57,868
we have implemented the operation successfully. Then the concrete precondition,

13
00:00:57,868 --> 00:01:04,010
which has the, uses the Q version on the concrete state t, must also hold.
