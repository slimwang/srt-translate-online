1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,370
Okay, let's do a quiz.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,270
Our zoo, it turns out,
needs a database to keep track of

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,230
all the people who have
donated money to the zoo.

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,490
One of our programmers has come up
with an object oriented description of

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,080
a donor class.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,100
It has attributes for

7
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,250
a person's name, and their favorite
animal, and their phone numbers.

8
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,490
That way for instance, when there's
a new born baby gorilla in the zoo,

9
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,110
the zoo keepers can call Mary up,
and tell her about it.

10
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,620
For phone numbers,
a person might have more than one.

11
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,580
So we'll support home and
mobile, and work phone numbers.

12
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,940
So if we want to store this
information in a relational database,

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,050
instead of just in objects in memory,
how many tables do you think we'll need?

14
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,810
Oh, wait, not that kind of tables.

15
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,350
This kind of table.

16
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,610
Because a person can have more than one
phone number, we're going to want to

17
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:53,550
have one table for donors, and
one for donor's phone numbers.

18
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,190
This is the same sort of situation,

19
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,760
as when we had animals that eat
multiple different kinds of food.

20
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,140
Now, what's going to go in these tables?

21
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,170
First, what columns do you
think might go in these tables?

22
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,000
And second,
how would you represent Mary and

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,690
her two phone numbers in these columns?

24
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,920
Fill in the column names in
the top of each table, and

25
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,660
then the values that you'd put
in them in the table body.
