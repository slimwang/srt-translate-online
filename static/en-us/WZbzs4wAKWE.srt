00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,320
Now that we have seen the Iron Law of Performance, let's do a quiz on the Iron

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,510
Law of Performance. Let's say we have a

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:11,790
program that has 3 billion instructions executing from start

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,075
to completion. Let's say that our processor spends

5
00:00:15,075 --> 00:00:18,000
two cycles on each instruction, and the processor is

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,322
clocked at three gigahertz. So we can say

7
00:00:20,322 --> 00:00:23,190
that the execution time is: put your answer here.
