00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,050
Hey, remember this fact?

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,730
From a partitioned graph you create
a special vector x with plus minus

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,060
one entries depending on the partition.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:08,930
And then we said,

5
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,780
well, if you want to count the number of
cut edges then you look at this product.

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,660
Let's write this product out explicitly.

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,010
So x transpose l times x
it turns out is this sum.

8
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:23,940
It's a sum over all pairs of vertices
above l i j, times x i, times x j.

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,230
Now let's go one step further and

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,950
actually break this sum
apart into five components.

11
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:29,600
Yikes.

12
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,750
Looks complicated.

13
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,259
But don't worry it's not that bad.

14
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,090
You can with some effort
interpret these sums for

15
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,350
instance, what is this first sum?

16
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,660
Well, it's a sum over the subset
of INJ where I is equal to j.

17
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,170
In fact, that simplifies the sum and.

18
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:48,880
For example, lij for i equal to
j is just the diaganol of l and

19
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:54,510
i equals j of xi and
xj is just essentially xi or xj squared.

20
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,510
In other words, the sum and
is just lii times xi squared.

21
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,010
But you know exactly what that is.

22
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,150
The lii are the degrees of the vertices.

23
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,160
And xi squared is just always one,

24
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,400
independent of whether xi is plus one or
minus one.

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,710
So if I were to ask you to give me the
values of say, lii and xi Xi squared,

26
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:17,940
you would say lii is di, the degree
of vertex i, and xi is plus 1.

27
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,670
By the way, what is this?

28
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,980
Well, if I'm summing the degrees of all
the vertices, then what am I doing?

29
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,370
I'm basically counting
the number of edges twice.

30
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,350
My question is,
can you do the remaining sums?

31
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,190
For instance, can you interpret this sum
and then figure out what lij, xi, and

32
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:36,740
xj are?

33
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,490
So, think about that and
write your answers in the boxes.
