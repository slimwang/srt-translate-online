00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,410
Next up, you're going to need
to create a new project and

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,890
configure it to use
the Services libraries.

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,800
Now you've seen how to do
this in the intro, and

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,940
several times in this course,
but here are the steps again.

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,600
First you should create a new single
activity app in Android Studio.

6
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:16,980
When you create that app,

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,680
make sure that you use the same name
as you specified in the console.

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,000
Remember when we had
the com.audacity for

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,290
a sign in name,
you want to do the same thing.

10
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,400
Then you're going to want to configure
Build.gradle to use the Services

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,470
libraries, and

12
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,300
configure Android.manifest to
uses the Services libraries too.

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,050
And then finally, you need to
configure Android.manifest for

14
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,908
the following permissions,
android.permission.INTERNET,

15
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:46,800
android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS and
android.permission.USE_CREDENTIALS.

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,633
Do all of this before continuing.
