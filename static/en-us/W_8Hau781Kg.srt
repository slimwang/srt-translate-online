1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And the answer is a resounding 66-68 so this is the correct number.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Now if you look at these ranges very carefully, they aren't all the same size it seems.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This seems to be more like 2 but this range seems to be just 1,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and the reason is these numbers are truncated.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
They actually have decimal points that are not displayed

6
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but regardless, this category wins hands down in the statistic.
