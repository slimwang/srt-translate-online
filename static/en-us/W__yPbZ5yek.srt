00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,890
Finish factoring this polynomial by finding the factors needed to rewrite the x

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,040
term. Once you've rewritten the x term, use factoring by grouping to finish up.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,965
And you might have noticed that this problem is slightly different because we

4
00:00:11,965 --> 00:00:17,004
have a 2 here. Our coefficient, our a value for the x squared term is not equal

5
00:00:17,004 --> 00:00:17,553
to one.
