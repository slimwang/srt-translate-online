Hey, Katherine.
So

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,719
we just covered a lot
of new terminology.

3
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:06,670
>> Yeah, but
I think it will help if we type back

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,910
to what we learned about
in the last course.

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:09,840
>> That's a good point.

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,330
So, in the last course you also
talk about how to use on screen or

7
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,160
describe objects.

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,010
>> Yeah we did.

9
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,020
We talked about how objects
like the text view contain

10
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,730
state inside of it as well as
methods like get text and set text.

11
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:21,230
>> That's right.

12
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,580
But you guys didn't cover.

13
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,240
The setOnClickListener method last time.

14
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,960
And, when this method's called, it
takes an OnClickListener as its object.

15
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,450
And then on a phone, when a user clicks
on a view, then Android will go and

16
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,465
check if there's
an OnClickListener inside of it.

17
00:00:36,465 --> 00:00:39,505
>> And if there is,
then the OnClick method

18
00:00:39,505 --> 00:00:42,795
of the OnClickListener will
execute with these instructions.

19
00:00:42,795 --> 00:00:45,445
>> Yeah, and these can be any
instructions like popping up a toast

20
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:48,045
message, or changing the background
color of a TextView.

21
00:00:48,045 --> 00:00:49,005
>> Nice.

22
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:49,900
There's a lot to remember.

23
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,290
But do you remember the other
way we can talk about it?

24
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,910
>> You're not talking
about the tongue twister?

25
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:55,680
>> Yes, yes, yes.

26
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,358
Let's do it, let's do it.
>> [SOUND] Okay.

27
00:00:56,358 --> 00:01:00,055
>> When you click on something that
is clickable that previously set its

28
00:01:00,055 --> 00:01:04,920
OnClickListener, then the OnClick method
of the OnClickListener will react quick.

29
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,950
So what you want to click?
