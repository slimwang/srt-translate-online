00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,150
When you start working on your app,

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:06,020
one of the worst things that you
can do is re-invent the wheel.

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:10,450
And by that I mean, by using code that's
already been written by someone else.

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:14,170
The beauty of the internet is that
there's a plethora of information about

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,900
there that you can take from.

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,410
From Apple libraries that let
you use features on the device,

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,808
to web APIs that allow you to
access information on other sites.

8
00:00:22,808 --> 00:00:26,580
So it's going to be your job as
a developer to really scrutinize

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,780
any web API or library that
you find to really make sure

10
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,119
that it meets the requirements
of your apps.

11
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,890
Let's sync up again with some
of our pros for some tips and
