00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The next topic I want to address is called "Segmentation."

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is the problem of given a sequence of language,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
figure out how to break it up into words.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Now, in Chinese we don't have spaces between the words,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and so in order to understand if the first word of this message corresponds

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
to a single character or two characters or what,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
we have to be able to do the process of segmentation and figure out where they are.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
In English, we don't have that. Words have spaces between them.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So we don't have the segmentation problem,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
but we certainly have it in speech recognition in languages like English,

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
because this speech sounds are sometimes run together without pauses in between them,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and there are places where we do have a language without segmentation.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
For example, in the language of URLs

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
you could have a URL like "choosespain.com",

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
which is the travel site that tries to encourage you to choose Spain as your travel destination,

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
but if you segment it wrong, you'd come up with "chooses pain,"

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
which would not be the intended expression for that particular URL.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So segmentation is an important problem. Let's talk about how to do it.
