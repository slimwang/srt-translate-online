1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,666
I think it's time to switch things up a bit and see some numbers that can't be

2
00:00:03,666 --> 00:00:08,590
written as rational powers of the base. We're also going to pick a new base to

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,664
work with, log base 10, which is one of the most convenient bases to use

4
00:00:11,664 --> 00:00:16,988
because there's a button on calculators for it. In fact, I'd like you to use

5
00:00:16,988 --> 00:00:20,831
your calculator to do these problems. You'll probably be able to figure out a

6
00:00:20,831 --> 00:00:23,454
few of them on your own without the calculator, but it makes sense to use it

7
00:00:23,454 --> 00:00:27,987
just to make sure that the buttons work the way you think they do. In fact, on

8
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:32,271
many calculators and sometimes in textbooks and other places, instead of seeing

9
00:00:32,271 --> 00:00:37,379
log base 10. You'll just see the word log without a base written, this usually

10
00:00:37,379 --> 00:00:42,430
means log base 10. In fact, let's look and see what my calculator has on it.

11
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:46,827
Sure enough, there's just a button that says log with no base. This is log base

12
00:00:46,827 --> 00:00:50,983
10. So let's say I want to find log base 10 of some number. Well, 11 is my

13
00:00:50,983 --> 00:00:55,442
favorite number as you know, so let's try that. You can see I press log, and

14
00:00:55,442 --> 00:00:59,788
then enter the number that I'm looking for. Close the parentheses for good

15
00:00:59,788 --> 00:01:04,065
measure and press equals and there we go, a long decimal. I'm going to try

16
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:11,254
another just to humor myself. How about log base 10 of 2,314? Why not? There we

17
00:01:11,254 --> 00:01:15,804
go. So here are a bunch of log base 10 problems for you to figure out. I'll

18
00:01:15,804 --> 00:01:18,656
demo one on the calculator just to make sure that it's working like we think

19
00:01:18,656 --> 00:01:23,524
it's going to. To find log base 10 of 1 if I didn't want to use the calculator,

20
00:01:23,524 --> 00:01:29,212
I'd rewrite 1 as 10 to the 0. So that means this should give us 0. Let's make

21
00:01:29,212 --> 00:01:33,276
sure our calculator's working the way we think it is. So to find log base 10 of

22
00:01:33,276 --> 00:01:39,250
1, I press log and then 1. Close the parentheses and sure enough we got 0.

23
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,764
Great. Now you get plenty of chances to try this out on your own.
