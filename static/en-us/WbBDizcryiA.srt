1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Okay, so now we have these functions to validate the user's input.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's talk about how they're going to fit into things.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So we have you, and we have our servers, and you make a request for the form.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is a GET request, and the server responds with the form data,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and then you make a POST request to the server with the data.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
In this case, it will be a month, day, and year.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Now the server is going to run our validation functions,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and it's going to do 1 of 2 things.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If the data is good, the server will say, thanks,

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
but if the data is bad, the server is going to respond with the form data again,

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and the server will also include an error message telling user to reenter their values,

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and they'll have the form handy so they can do that easily,

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and then we'll go up to this phase again.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Okay, so let's talk about our approach to doing this.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We're going to have to do 3 things.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
First, we're going to have to verify the user's input.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Next, we're going to have to detect if it's an error and render the form again, maybe.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And when we're rendering that form, we're going to need to include an error message

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
because if we don't include that error message, the user is just going to hit submit on their form

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and see the form again, and they'll be confused forever.
