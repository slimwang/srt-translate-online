00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,890
When we write an equation like this, we're expressing y in terms of x. What

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,895
we're doing on the right side of the equation, in this expression, is taking x,

3
00:00:09,895 --> 00:00:14,829
and then, manipulating the value of that variable in some way. That shows how

4
00:00:14,829 --> 00:00:19,524
it's related to y. If our equation is y equals 2x plus 3, for example. What

5
00:00:19,524 --> 00:00:24,244
we're saying is that, in order to get the value of y, take the value for x,

6
00:00:24,244 --> 00:00:28,744
multiply it by 2 and then add 3. And that will give you the number that you're

7
00:00:28,744 --> 00:00:33,433
looking for. Since the number we plug in for x is going to help determine the

8
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:36,018
value of y, we can say that y depends on x.
