00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,394
>> This absolute value equation was tricky. >> The answer is actually, no

2
00:00:04,394 --> 00:00:09,368
solution. >> Why is the answer no solution? If you recall, absolute value tells

3
00:00:09,368 --> 00:00:14,124
us the distance from 0. >> Since one side of our equation is an absolute value,

4
00:00:14,124 --> 00:00:19,024
we know that absolute values are the distance from 0 and they're always

5
00:00:19,024 --> 00:00:23,720
positive. >> Do it make any sense to have a negative distance? ... >> No, we can

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,281
not have a negative distance. >> There is no value of x that will make the

7
00:00:28,281 --> 00:00:33,231
absolute value of 2x plus 3 equal to negative 5. >> It's an impossible problem.

8
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:38,102
>> So, the answer is no solution. >> Let's try one more absolute value equation.
