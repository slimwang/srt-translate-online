For this skills check, I want you to determine if each pair of lines is

2
00:00:03,375 --> 00:00:06,977
perpendicular, parallel, or neither. So, if you think these 2 lines are

3
00:00:06,977 --> 00:00:10,811
perpendicular, you would write a in this box. If you think they're parallel,

4
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:14,574
write b. And if you think they're neither, write c. Give these problems some

5
00:00:14,574 --> 00:00:18,283
thought, and make sure you think about what you're looking for. What does it

6
00:00:18,283 --> 00:00:22,244
mean to be perpendicular? What does it mean for lines to be parallel? Good luck.
