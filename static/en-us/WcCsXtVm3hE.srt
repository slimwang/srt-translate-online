1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,100
Now, one thing that's important about
the horizon is that the horizon isn't

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,630
just something you make up, right?

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,650
The horizon actually depends upon
things like your discount factor.

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:12,040
And if you have a very small
discount factor then so

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,110
far out in the future it doesn't
matter what's happening anyway.

6
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,050
And so you can do better.

7
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,850
But if you have a reasonable
discount factor then you're going to

8
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:22,000
have to look pretty far in
the future to get a good estimate

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,100
of taking a particular action
in a particular state.

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,130
>> Okay, makes sense.

11
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,800
>> Right.
So this is both good and bad, right?

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,570
Monte Carlo is kind of neat because
it's sort of neat on its own.

13
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,410
It's very useful,
it's one way of dealing with scale.

14
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,560
It's completely compatible with
options and other things that we know.

15
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,310
It has a bunch of dials in it, that we
can play with that sort of help us.

16
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,940
And that we might be able to take cool
advantage of, but you still need lots

17
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,310
and lots and lots and lots of samples in
order to make it work, which is true for

18
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,740
any Monte Carlo method.

19
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,690
>> So is there a sense in which
we traded, in big states basis,

20
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:58,530
we traded being exponential in
the number of state features say?

21
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,250
For instead exponential in
the size of their horizon?

22
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,286
>> Yeah and the trade off is, I mean
it's right here, I suppose this is our

23
00:01:05,286 --> 00:01:08,598
trade off and you're right and
that makes sense, right?

24
00:01:08,598 --> 00:01:11,702
Before with the kind of algorithms,
that we used before, you visit all

25
00:01:11,702 --> 00:01:14,768
the states, you back up information
about them and so on and so forth.

26
00:01:14,768 --> 00:01:17,118
So that clearly has to depend
upon the number of states.

27
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,221
Here, we're not worrying about the
states, what we're doing is we're just

28
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:22,700
looking forward into the future
by doing simulation.

29
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,040
And so every single time we have
to look forward into the future,

30
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,530
we have to look forward into the future.

31
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,880
And perhaps we have to look
forward very far into the future.

32
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,630
And somehow, because we're doing
this kind of Monte Carlo thing,

33
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,450
we're doing kind of, I don't know,

34
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:38,530
like a almost a non-parametric
estimate of whatever the true

35
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,190
transition model is, that's going to
require lots and lots of states.

36
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,680
And lots and lots of samples,
and more and

37
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,530
more samples the further out
into the future that we go.

38
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,190
So we are going to be trading that off.

39
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,090
We're always trading off kind of space
versus time in a particular way, and

40
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,780
here the space is
represented by the states.

41
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,070
As opposed to the time,

42
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,890
which is represented by how far
out you're going to search.

43
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,180
>> That's nice.

44
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:00,680
>> Thank you.
