00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,540
Challenge accepted. We're going to look at a a

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,930
function called the sigmoid. Sigmoid meaning s-like, right, sig,

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:11,290
sigma-ish, sigmoid. So we're going to define this, this,

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:15,530
the sigmoid using the letter. Sigma and it's going to

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,300
be applied to the activation just like we

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,450
were doing before, but instead of thresholding it at

7
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,450
zero, what it's instead going to do is

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,760
compute this function of a, one over one plus

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,090
e to the, e to the minus a, and what do we

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,760
know about this function? Well, it is. Ought to be clear that

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,290
as the activation gets less and less and less, we'd want it

12
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,030
to go to zero, and in fact it does, right. So, as

13
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,940
a goes to negative infinity, the negative a goes to infinity. E

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,880
to the infinity is something really, really big. So it's one over

15
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,110
1 plus something really big, which is like 1 over something huge,

16
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,010
which is almost zero. So, the sigmoid function goes toward, this function

17
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,950
that we defined here, goes to zero as the activation goes.

18
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:58,890
To negative infinity, that's great, that's just like threshold, and as

19
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,590
the activation gets really really large, we're talking about e to

20
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,430
the minus something really large, which is like e to the

21
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,110
almost, or like e to the negative infinity which is like

22
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,180
almost zero, so one over one plus zero is essentially one.

23
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,740
So on the one limit, it go towards zero, and the

24
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,090
other limit it goes towards one, and in fact we can

25
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,820
just Draw this so you can see what it really

26
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,410
looks like you know, minus five and below it's essentially at

27
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,700
zero, and then it makes this kind of gradual, you can see

28
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,940
why it's sigmoid s-shaped curve, then it comes back up to

29
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,800
the top and it's basically at one by the time it

30
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,270
get to five. So instead of just an abrupt of transition

31
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,570
to zero, we had this gradual transition between negative five and

32
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:41,160
five. And this is great because it's differentiable, so. What do

33
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,250
you think Charles, does this answer your question?

34
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,690
>> It does, I buy that.

35
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,800
>> Alright good so if we have units

36
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,420
like this now we can take derivatives which

37
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:54,910
means we can use this gradient decent idea all over the place. So not only is

38
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:58,280
this function differentiable but the derivative itself has

39
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,110
a very beautiful form. In particular it turns

40
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,060
out... That if you take the derivative of

41
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,450
this sigma function, it can be written as the

42
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,880
function itself times one minus the function itself. So this is

43
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,110
just, this is just really elegant and simple. So, if you have,

44
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,650
you know, the sigma function in your code, there's nothing special that

45
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,120
you need for the derivative. You could just compute it this way.

46
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,980
So we would, it's not a bad exercise to go through and

47
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:26,290
do this. Practice your calculus, we just did this together but it's

48
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,980
not that fun to watch. So I would suggest doing it on

49
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,180
your own, and if you have any trouble we'll, we'll provide additional

50
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,410
information for you to, to help you work that out.

51
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,976
>> But when you do it on your own make sure that no one is watching.

52
00:02:37,976 --> 00:02:40,620
>> [LAUGH] Well they can watch, they just

53
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,480
probably won't enjoy it very much. So, so can

54
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,200
we say anything about why this form kind

55
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,470
of makes sense? So, so what's neat about this

56
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,010
is. As we, as our activation gets very,

57
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,960
very negative, then our sigma value gets closer and

58
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,890
closer to zero. And if you look at what

59
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,350
our derivative is there, it's something like zero times

60
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:00,660
something like one minus zero, whereas the derivative as

61
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,570
you get to very, very large as, that's like

62
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:07,350
sigma's going to one. And you get 1 times

63
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,550
1 minus 1 minus 1, so essentially 1 times 0.

64
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,900
So you can see the derivatives flatten out for

65
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,600
very large and very negative a's. And when a is

66
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,630
like, zero, so what happens when a is like

67
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,390
zero? Boy, what does happen when a is like zero?

68
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,190
Charles, what happens if we plug zero into this sigma function?

69
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,840
>> You get one half.

70
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,654
>> Is that obvious? Oh, I see, because e to the minus

71
00:03:29,654 --> 00:03:32,939
a, that's zero, so e to the zero is one, one over one

72
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:35,870
plus one, so a half. And then our derivative at that point

73
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,100
is a half times a half, or a quarter, so that's kind of neat.

74
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,535
>> Mm-hm.

75
00:03:40,535 --> 00:03:42,980
>> So so this is really, this, it's, it's in

76
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,460
a very nice form for being able to work with it.

77
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,400
>> But it's probably worth saying that.

78
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,350
Surely you could use other functions that are

79
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,360
different, and there might be good reasons to do

80
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,360
that. This one just happens to be a very

81
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,820
nice way of dealing with the threshold in question.

82
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,040
>> Yeah and there's other ways that are also nice. So again,

83
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,040
the main properties here are that as activation gets very negative it goes

84
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,720
to zero, as activation gets very positive it goes to one, and

85
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,390
there's this smooth transition in between,

86
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,140
there's other ways of making that shape.
