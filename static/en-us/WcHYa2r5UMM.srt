1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,547
So clearly order mattres a lot. 
go f of x and f of g of x, using these

2
00:00:04,547 --> 00:00:08,695
two equations give us completely 
different expressions.

3
00:00:08,695 --> 00:00:12,111
We need to be super careful which 
function we're using as the input for the

4
00:00:12,111 --> 00:00:15,943
other one. 
What if our functions were f of x equals

5
00:00:15,943 --> 00:00:20,414
x squared minus four? 
And g of x equals the square root of 4

6
00:00:20,414 --> 00:00:24,537
minus x squared. 
Then what will we get for f of g of x or

7
00:00:24,537 --> 00:00:26,619
f composed of g?
