00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,248
>> Well, this ordered pair, or point would be here. If you got this right, well

2
00:00:04,248 --> 00:00:08,599
done. I haven't even told you about negative coordinates yet. To think about a

3
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:13,035
negative coordinate, instead of moving right, we want to move left. We move left

4
00:00:13,035 --> 00:00:17,754
because it's the x coordinate. We move in the horizontal direction, this way. So

5
00:00:17,754 --> 00:00:22,358
from the origin, we move three units left and then two units up. I know it can't

6
00:00:22,358 --> 00:00:26,966
be either of these points because well the x coordinate would be positive and

7
00:00:26,966 --> 00:00:31,691
ours is negative, so these are out. The same would be true for this coordinate,

8
00:00:31,691 --> 00:00:36,025
the x value would be positive 3. If you chose this point, you were a close

9
00:00:36,025 --> 00:00:40,525
second. This point is really 3 to the left or negative 3. And then down 2, so

10
00:00:40,525 --> 00:00:45,456
negative 2 in the y direction. But we don't have a negative 2, we have a

11
00:00:45,456 --> 00:00:50,883
positive 2 for our y coordinate. Once we move three units to the left of the

12
00:00:50,883 --> 00:00:54,167
origin, we must move two units up. So one, two.
