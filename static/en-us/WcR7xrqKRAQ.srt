00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,910
Okay so the next bunch of links
are about adding navigation to your app.

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,020
Things like how do you go from
one activity to another or

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,760
one screen to another.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,420
Now we have the same process as before.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,870
For each link we're about to show,
read the tutorial, and

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,720
create a new Android project to
practice the contents of the tutorial.

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,320
And then move on to the next link.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:21,820
Here we go.
