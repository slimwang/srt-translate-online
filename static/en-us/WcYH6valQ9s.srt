1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,380
We said risk assessment is challenging,
we don't understand all the threats,

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,480
we don't know what our vulnerabilities
are of course, so it's two playing two.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,160
Likelihood of a successful attack
of course is going to depend on

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,950
what sort of vulnerabilities you might
have and who's trying to target you.

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,809
But we said, well if you can
come up with a probability and

6
00:00:19,809 --> 00:00:23,264
what happens as a result of an attack,
then you can compute the risk,

7
00:00:23,264 --> 00:00:25,543
that's how you quantify or
assess the risk.

8
00:00:25,543 --> 00:00:27,802
And you can try to reduce it, but

9
00:00:27,802 --> 00:00:32,250
that's really a question of
managing that, how do we manage?

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,320
What options do we have for

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,340
managing the risk that our business
is exposed to on the cyber front.

12
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:44,060
So we talked about assessing it, but
if it's too high, then of course,

13
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,260
we'd like to reduce it.

14
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,770
So how do you reduce cyber risk?

15
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,390
As we said before we get into reduction,

16
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:54,550
assessing required the likelihood
as well as the impact.

17
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,620
So how do you assess the impact?

18
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:01,170
It's the expected loss we're talking
about, so it's expected losses,

19
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,950
really loss multiply the probability,
so we do have get to the loss, and

20
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,680
when you talk about loss it
could be reputation loss,

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,060
target of core suffered
including degrees and sales.

22
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,340
It's the cost of calling somebody in.

23
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,540
So, for example, if you're Sony and

24
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,600
you call FireEye or Mandiant to
come figure out what happened,

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,078
I'm sure they paid for that Mandiant or
FireEye got compensated really well.

26
00:01:23,078 --> 00:01:27,319
Your response, it may be legal costs,
you may have to buy identity theft

27
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:30,459
protection for your customers and
things like that.

28
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:33,450
It's real dollars, reputational.

29
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,600
What you do in the aftermath.

30
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,220
All that has to add up
to sort of the cost or

31
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,880
the loss that you would
attribute to a certain attack.

32
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,480
And expected I said was that value
multiplied by the probability.

33
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,810
So that's really risk.

34
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:53,270
Risk was probability times impact,
so maybe the impact is a loss.

35
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,900
So let's just talk about loss here.

36
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,930
So this one would still be talking
about you're assessing risk.

37
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,830
Now let's talk about
how do we manage risk.

38
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:04,670
So the only three things you can do once
you come up with some sort of a risk

39
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,830
estimate.

40
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,780
You can say well, I can live with it.

41
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,900
In that case, you're accepting the risk.

42
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,730
You may want to transfer it.

43
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,982
So the risk is transferred
to another party.

44
00:02:13,982 --> 00:02:17,625
So if something bad happens to you,
the consequences or

45
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:20,490
the cost is going to be
borne by somebody else.

46
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,840
That somebody else is going to
do it only if they are paid

47
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,010
to be in that business.

48
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,290
And that business is
the insurance business.

49
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,020
So you can buy insurance.

50
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,800
And by buying insurance, you're
transferring it to whoever insures you.

51
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,200
The other option is you can reduce it.

52
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,500
How do you reduce it?

53
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,580
Well, you're going to reduce it by
deploying new technology solutions, and

54
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,330
maybe a more expensive,
more effective firewall.

55
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:48,890
You can reduce by educating your people
or having training and things like that.

56
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,330
More security awareness,

57
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:55,240
of course, is going to ensure that it's
less likely that they make a mistake, so

58
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,650
that's going to reduce the likelihood of
the probability of some adverse event.

59
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,360
Which we know a factor,
the way we compute our risks.

60
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,590
So, managing once you have
an estimate of the risk,

61
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,640
there are a couple of options on
how you can deal with that risk.

62
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,360
As we said this transfer thing
happens in a lot of other domains.

63
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,400
You buy insurance for your car, for
your health and things like that.
