00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,800
When an entrepreneur goes to me and
investor for the first time,

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,260
I think that the most important thing
to be able to do, is articulate what

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,210
your business is and what your
vision is, quickly and so simply.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:17,400
People talk about pitch decks as being
ten slides is like an ideal thing.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,080
Now imagine if you're just going and
meeting somebody for coffee or

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,900
you're standing in a conference
in years just talking to them.

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,750
It's got to be even more
condensed than that.

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,330
And you have to be able
to demonstrate passion,

9
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,670
knowledge of what the business is and
a real plan to succeed.

10
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,660
And you have to be able
to do that quickly.

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,500
And it takes a lot of
practice to get there.
