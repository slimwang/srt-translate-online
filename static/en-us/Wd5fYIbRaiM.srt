1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,770
These numbers are great but I think it would help if we looked a little bit

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:07,316
more closely at how we just calculated each of these answers. Let's just focus

3
00:00:07,316 --> 00:00:12,885
in on this first here for a second. For the first year, what we found was

4
00:00:12,885 --> 00:00:18,555
$10,000, the amount we started out with, plus 0.03, the interest rate times

5
00:00:18,555 --> 00:00:26,895
that original amount of money, $10,000. Now, to help us understand in a

6
00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:31,055
different way what's going on here, I'd like you to factor out the 10,000 from

7
00:00:31,055 --> 00:00:37,416
this expression and then write something in these parentheses right here. Now,

8
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:42,375
you don't need to sum anything inside the parentheses. You can just leave 2

9
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,539
terms in there.
