00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,020
Let me show you a few examples and

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,338
how we can apply these to create linear filters.

3
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:07,987
This is my original image, I'm just showing a small 64 by 64 and

4
00:00:07,987 --> 00:00:09,790
I hope you can see this in detail.

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:11,990
Let's take this original image and

6
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,180
we're going to apply a bunch of filters to it.

7
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:19,888
Let's apply a simple kernel here, just a simple, again, an identity.

8
00:00:19,888 --> 00:00:21,810
What do you expect the output to be?

9
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,428
Next one, we can apply where there is not just the identity, but

10
00:00:25,428 --> 00:00:27,240
now we have shifted this by one.

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,060
What should the output be?

12
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,540
Here of course, we've seen this kind of stuff before, just the average.

13
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,930
We can not guesstimate as to what the output would be,

14
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,370
what the output should be for that one.

15
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,980
For this one, as you've looked at before, it should be the same image again.

16
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,830
We haven't actually done anything, right?

17
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,040
But just doing a convolution.

18
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:52,220
We're doing this, basically, we'll see that the image has shifted by one.

19
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,630
Basically what we've done is kind of given a shift to the image.

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,390
This one we've seen many a times, and again applying a convolution to

21
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:03,600
this one will give us a box blur, or an average blur.

22
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,720
Let's look at another example.

23
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,200
And this will give us example of how we can combine filters.

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,012
Again, my original image, and this time around I have two different kernels.

25
00:01:15,012 --> 00:01:18,860
I want to take this kernel multiplied by 2, which basically is 1 now.

26
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,720
Basically, it's saying is that I'm going to now try to give it

27
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,890
a little bit more strength at the value itself.

28
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,000
But then after that, I want to subtract it by an average.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,150
So, I can do this process.

30
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,630
Remember, the properties of convolution allows me to do something before I

31
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,490
apply it to the image.

32
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,080
I can actually do this process individually.

33
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,690
And this would be my new kernel, right?

34
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,000
I mean, twice.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,929
1 subtracted by 1 over 9, 1.9, and this basically becomes, and

36
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:48,910
this is what my height field of this kernel looks like.

37
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,950
Applying this, any guesses what would the output be?

38
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:56,840
In essence, by doing this, we have created a simple sharpening filter.

39
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,490
What we've done is basically allowed it to

40
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,145
actually create much more resolution information at the peak.

41
00:02:03,145 --> 00:02:05,718
And you move it further as you go down.

42
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:10,458
So in essence this raise the information then we subtract it by the average, and

43
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:13,970
the output is a simple sharpening filter.

44
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,578
So, by doing these kinds of combinations,

45
00:02:15,578 --> 00:02:17,805
we can actually generate a lot of different types of things.

46
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:21,075
And we will, trust me, get into a whole lot of these types of filters.

47
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:24,133
And for those of you who are now started playing around with your

48
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:26,558
different types of development platforms,

49
00:02:26,558 --> 00:02:30,018
please remember you can actually do this in Mac Lab, OpenCV Python, or

50
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:33,854
filtering, or any times of tools that you've been playing around with this.

51
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,660
And we will be doing assignments on this too
