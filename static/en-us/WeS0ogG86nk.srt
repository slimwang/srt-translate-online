1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,801
So you could have used either the population standard deviation or just the 2.71

2
00:00:05,801 --> 00:00:13,504
for standard error. So our x bar is 40. We have 40 minus 2 times 2.71 as our

3
00:00:13,504 --> 00:00:24,207
lower bound, and then 40 plus... 2 times 2.71 for our upper bound, so that comes

4
00:00:24,207 --> 00:00:31,336
out to 34.58 and 45.42. So we're pretty sure, that if everyone started using the

5
00:00:31,336 --> 00:00:35,704
Beaber Tweeter, then the mean of the population, and the mean of the

6
00:00:35,704 --> 00:00:40,696
corresponding sampling distribution of size 35, Would be between these two

7
00:00:40,696 --> 00:00:47,563
values. So our distribution could be anything from here, centered at 34.58,

8
00:00:47,563 --> 00:00:54,685
where this value 40 is still within that 95% range. Or to here centered at

9
00:00:54,685 --> 00:01:04,352
45.02, where our mean is still within that 95% range. This interval from 34.58

10
00:01:04,352 --> 00:01:11,965
to 45.42 is called the 95% confidence interval for the mean.
