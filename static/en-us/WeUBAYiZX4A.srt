00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,269
I said earlier that the reason we needed
to put parenthesis around 3w + 12n, or the

2
00:00:04,281 --> 00:00:08,406
total amount of money that Grant would
have gained from the orders that have now

3
00:00:08,418 --> 00:00:12,561
been canceled, was because this is one sum
of money, we want to subtract the whole

4
00:00:12,573 --> 00:00:16,773
thing, not just part of it. If we didn't
have parenthesis here then we would only

5
00:00:16,785 --> 00:00:20,853
be subtracting the money that he would
have earned from the wipers that are now

6
00:00:20,865 --> 00:00:25,211
canceled, but we would still be adding the
amount of money that he would have gotte

7
00:00:25,452 --> 00:00:28,692
from the nozzle orders that are now
canceled. But we know that both of these

8
00:00:28,704 --> 00:00:32,131
sets of orders have been cancelled, so we
need to make sure that both of them are

9
00:00:32,144 --> 00:00:35,518
subtracted from the original sum of money.
So let's put those parentheses back.

10
00:00:35,601 --> 00:00:38,745
However, I don't really want these
parentheses here in the end version of

11
00:00:38,757 --> 00:00:42,690
this expression, so we need to get rid of
them somehow. Intuitively like I just

12
00:00:42,702 --> 00:00:46,777
said, you want to subtract both this
quantity 3w the money from the cancelled

13
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:51,038
wiper orders and this quantity 12n the
money from the cancelled nozzle sales. So

14
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:55,291
we want to subtract both of them and if I
get rid of these parentheses I should just

15
00:00:55,303 --> 00:00:58,881
be able to switch this plus sign to a
minus sign and have the expression that.

16
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:02,844
That I want. This makes sense. Here's our
original amount of money that Grant

17
00:01:02,856 --> 00:01:06,482
would've earned from all of the orders
that he had. And then we take away both

18
00:01:06,494 --> 00:01:10,300
the wipers that he's not selling anymore
and the nozzles he's not selling anymore.

19
00:01:10,388 --> 00:01:13,938
That makes sense. Now the problem is
simple, you've done this so many times

20
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,754
before. You just need to rearrange the
order of the terms, so that like terms are

21
00:01:17,766 --> 00:01:22,519
now. Next to each other and then simplify.
So, first we rearranged the order of the

22
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:26,629
terms so that w terms are next to each
other and the n terms are next to each

23
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:30,675
other and then we just add their
coefficients together and multiply it by

24
00:01:30,687 --> 00:01:35,115
the proper variable. So 87-3 is 84 and the
variable there is w and 72-12 is 60 and

25
00:01:35,127 --> 00:01:39,761
the variable there is n. So here's our
final answer. Answer, 84w + 60n. Awesome

26
00:01:39,773 --> 00:01:44,343
job. That quiz had a bunch of steps in i
t, and some new material. So if you got it

27
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:46,786
even partially right, that's really great.
