00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,120
The first answer to keep snooping sys admins from knowing

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:06,250
everyone's passwords. That's actually correct. That's there's no reason why you

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,480
as a website owner should, you know, know your user's passwords.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,490
Or maybe there are a few reasons but not very good

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,250
ones. And this, you know, eliminates a whole, you know, issue

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,860
that you have to worry about. Because people often use the

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,980
same password for many websites. This also correct answer. I wish

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,200
people didn't, and you may think well, it's not my problem.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,430
But, if you're accepting user's passwords you do have

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,550
a bit of a moral obligation to keep them safe.

11
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,820
Because no matter how loud you yell and scream,

12
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,320
people are going to continue to use the same password,

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,850
allows the passwords for many websites. If the database

14
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,240
is compromised the passwords are reasonably safe, this is also

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,440
true. They're not completely safe of course. You know

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,460
they have your database now, they know what those hashes

17
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:56,860
are they can figure out the passwords in some potentially huge amount of time.

18
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,660
But it's a lot safer than just giving them the passwords. And if you

19
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,160
don't, you will regret it. This is also true. And I'm going to share

20
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,160
a tale of, of me goofing on this and how much I regret it.
