00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,203
To get started I want to show
you something really cool.

2
00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:06,173
This is a list of the top iOS apps for
December 2014.

3
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:08,970
And they're ranked by
monthly active users.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,748
So if we take a look here,
you can see USA Canada, Mexico.

5
00:00:13,748 --> 00:00:15,248
It's broken down this way.

6
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:17,450
There are a lot of popular social apps.

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:17,970
Facebook.

8
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,880
There's Twitter over here.

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,810
Instagram.

10
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:21,670
FaceTime.

11
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:22,240
What I'm going to do is,

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,050
I'm going to take a subset of the USA
list from apps one through ten and

13
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,500
I want you to indicate which
of these apps that you use.

14
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,280
And, I'll tell you in a minute
why we're doing this.

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,040
So here you can see that same list, and

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,980
I want you to put a check mark next
to each of the apps that you use.

17
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,690
If you haven't used any of these apps,

18
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,530
you can check,
I have used none of these apps.
