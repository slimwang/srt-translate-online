1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's look at the two cases.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The first case is where n is prime.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
When n is prime, Ï†(n) is equal to n - 1, so we're done.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We have exactly what we need for that from Fermat's Little Theorem.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Case two is where n is not prime, but we know that a and n are relatively prime.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
In this case, we know since n is not prime,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
there are some numbers that are not relatively prime to n.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Let's put those in a set. We'll call it R.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We're going to multiply that set by a mod n to get a new set we'll call S.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Now I have a quiz about R and S.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Here are the choices.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check all of the statements that are true.
