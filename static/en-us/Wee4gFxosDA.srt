00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,040
To illustrate concepts with relational databases, we're going to use some data

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,805
on the Aadhaar program, that is acquired from India's online Open Data Portal.

3
00:00:08,805 --> 00:00:11,730
Aadhaar is a relatively, new initiative in India.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,930
It is a 12 digit, unique number that,

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,310
enables identification for every resident of India.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,020
According, to the Indian government.

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,780
Once instituted, the Aadhaar will provide a universal identity infrastructure,

8
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,130
which can be used by any identity-based application.

9
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,710
The dataset, we'll be using describes the number of people, who enrolled in or

10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,970
were rejected by the Aadhaar program.

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:37,620
Cut by various characteristics, such as district, subdistrict, gender, and

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,870
age across India.

13
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,510
As data scientists, the Aadhaar program is interesting to us, because it is

14
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:48,710
a huge dataset, representing one of the most significant populations on Earth.

15
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,610
We can study the Aadhaar enrollment dataset to learn a bit more about

16
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:52,900
India's population.

17
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,650
And also, what type of people are applying for and

18
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,680
successfully enrolling in the Aadhaar program.
