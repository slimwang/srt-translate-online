Soon enough you will be writing your
own XDR files and implementing RPC.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:08,930
But right now let's take
a look at what would happen if

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:13,385
we were compiling this square.x
file that's used in the examples

4
00:00:13,385 --> 00:00:15,705
that we talked about in
the previous videos.

5
00:00:15,705 --> 00:00:16,693
So here is a short quiz.

6
00:00:16,693 --> 00:00:23,334
For this square.x file, that's also
provided in the instructor's notes,

7
00:00:23,334 --> 00:00:28,264
what is the return type of
the square proc_1 procedure,

8
00:00:28,264 --> 00:00:34,227
when the square.x file is compiled
with rpcgen -C or rpcgen -C -N?

9
00:00:34,227 --> 00:00:35,967
Write your answers in the text boxes.
