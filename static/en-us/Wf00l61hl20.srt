00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,050
You've seen how to find the first match now we want to find them all. In our

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:08,343
picture example we just want to collect all of the portraits. This one, and

3
00:00:08,343 --> 00:00:12,750
this one. Now if we want to collect them we need to put them somewhere. And you

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,926
just learned how to collect stuff, namely with an ArrayList. So we have two

5
00:00:16,926 --> 00:00:21,150
ArrayLists, the one that contains the elements that we inspect and the one in

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,700
which we will collect our matches. Now for each element in the original

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,921
ArrayList we check if it's a match and if so we add the matching element to the

8
00:00:30,921 --> 00:00:38,830
ArrayList matches. When this loop is complete matches contains all matches.

9
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,286
Like I said this one is actually simpler because we don't need to keep track of

10
00:00:42,286 --> 00:00:45,580
whether we have found the first one we don't need to stop after we found the

11
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:49,710
first one. Go ahead and implement it in Java.
