We know that 70% of Udacity students are aged 30 or less. That means that the

2
00:00:05,455 --> 00:00:11,123
probability of selecting a random student aged 30 or less is 70% or 0.7. That's

3
00:00:11,123 --> 00:00:16,779
why this is called the probability density function. The area under this curve

4
00:00:16,779 --> 00:00:23,153
represents the probability. See how we can visually model statistical concepts?

00:00:23,153 --> 00:00:24,215
It's so cool!
