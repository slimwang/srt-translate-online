1
00:00:00,378 --> 00:00:03,400
Typically you're going to
spend the first eight months

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,210
on some form of a road show.

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:10,010
This is where you, you yourself, or
you and your business partners, or

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,930
just your business partner, will
travel to different investor groups,

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,930
and possibly trade shows looking for new
investors, and basically do the pitch.

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,830
Here's what we're doing, here's what
we believe, here's the course we're on,

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,850
here's why we feel we'll succeed,
and here's why we need your money.

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,000
And once you've done that for, anywhere,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,470
five to eight months,
you'll get a few bites.

10
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,270
And those bites lead to meetings.

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,550
And those meetings whittle
down to one key, core meeting.

12
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:43,420
That first investor who's going
to open their checkbook and

13
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,500
give you a wad of cash.
