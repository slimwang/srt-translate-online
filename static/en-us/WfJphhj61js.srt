00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,990
So I asked you to try your best at
reading this article on linear layout,

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,310
knowing that you probably
would run into concepts and

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,590
terms that you may not understand but
that's totally okay.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,870
Hopefully, each time you
read the documentation,

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,320
you'll understand
a little more each time.

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,350
We're going to spend the next few
videos learning about layout weight in

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,710
more detail.

8
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:21,040
But here's one thing that could
be useful to our problem at hand.

9
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,550
This section is called Equally weighted
children, and it talks about how we can

10
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,860
create a linear layout where each child
is given an equal amount of space,

11
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,520
whether it's a vertical layout or
a horizontal linear layout.

12
00:00:32,545 --> 00:00:33,705
For a vertical linear layout,

13
00:00:33,705 --> 00:00:37,715
we would set the layout height attribute
of each child view to be zero dp.

14
00:00:37,715 --> 00:00:42,665
Then we would need to set the layout
weight attribute of each view to be one.

15
00:00:42,665 --> 00:00:45,305
I'll show you what this looks
like in the next video.
