1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,000
All right.
So instead of doing a super duper formal

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,430
proof, here's how I like to think
about this particular result.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,730
So here's a picture that
I'm hoping is helpful.

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,260
It's kind of a weird graph
of the x axis is the arms.

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,610
In this case, this is a five arm bandit.

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,920
And the y axis is the value of that arm.

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,540
And these rectangles represent

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,690
our uncertainty integrals
of that arm's value.

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:26,880
Does that make sense?

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,470
>> Okay.
They're not the arms themselves,

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,020
that's just the uncertainty.

12
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:34,130
>> Yeah, if they were actually arms
then I'd have to draw like [NOISE].

13
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,700
>> [LAUGH]
>> Ooh, that's terrible.

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,680
That was supposed to be a hand,
so I apologize.

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,590
>> That's a seven-fingered hand.

16
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:39,100
That's okay.

17
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,180
>> Yeah, I think that was the problem.

18
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,190
You know what it is, it's to make up for
the fact that, like,

19
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,610
Mickey Mouse only has four.

20
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,700
>> That's perfectly reasonable.

21
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,540
>> So if we do this.

22
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:51,000
If we make sure that each arm,
we are 1 minus delta over k sure

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,380
that its estimate is within
epsilon over 2 of what r.

24
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,840
Our sample to valuation is.

25
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,990
So how big are these bars, exactly?

26
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,080
>> Oh, okay, I see.

27
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,340
So those are uncertainty bars or
error bars.

28
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,970
So that means your estimate is right
smack in the middle of each of them.

29
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,890
>> Right, so we have our estimates for
each of the individual arms and that

30
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:14,540
estimate is, we're pretty sure, epsilon
over 2 close to the actual value.

31
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,050
Right, so that would mean that you
could be epsilon over 2, too high or

32
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,290
epsilon over two, too low,
which means the total

33
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,610
height of those bars is 2 times
epsilon over 2 or epsilon.

34
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,700
>> And those estimates hold
true with some probability.

35
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,210
>> Sure.

36
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:34,070
>> So each one is correct with
probability, 1-delta, over k.

37
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:37,170
So the first thing we need to
do is basically make sure that

38
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,970
all these estimates are correct
because if one of them is wrong,

39
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,570
then it casts doubt over
the entire calculation.

40
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,050
So what's the probability that

41
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,820
all of these estimates are actually
correct simultaneously.

42
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,470
>> Well, if I pretend they're all
independent of one another then

43
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,180
isn't it just one minus
delta over k to the k?

44
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,520
>> Delta over k is the probability
that a given arm is wrong.

45
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,800
One minus delta over k is
the probability that that arm is right.

46
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,480
So if that probability is one, for

47
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,630
example, then raise it to the k power,
sure

48
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,060
they're all going to be right because
they all have certainty of being right.

49
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,128
But if it's a little bit less,
you know 0.95 or something like that.

50
00:02:14,128 --> 00:02:17,650
Then it's 0.95 and this one has to be
right, it's another probability 0.95 and

51
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,800
this one has to be right.

52
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,170
So we ended up with the raised
to the K power of that

53
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,460
individual arm probability.

54
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,300
>> Right.
>> It turns out for

55
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,070
various reason that this kind of
quantity is hard to work with, and

56
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:30,280
also sometimes, I think not in this
case, but sometimes it's also a little

57
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,220
risky because it assumes statistical
independence of all the estimates.

58
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,510
And sometimes it's safer to just say

59
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,590
maybe they're not
independent of each other.

60
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:42,630
Maybe they actually all fail together or
all fail separately.

61
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,940
So we use a standard trick
to get around this idea.

62
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,970
And this is the idea that we can
estimate the probability that

63
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,390
at least one is wrong.

64
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,620
If we know the probability that
one is wrong, it can't be since

65
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,540
there's k of them, it can't b any
worse than k times delta over k.

66
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,380
And this kind of follows from if you
think of it as like a Venn diagram.

67
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,980
Here's the probability that one
thing is bad, here's the probability

68
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,480
that the other thing is bad, here's
a probability that a third thing is bad.

69
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,120
What's the largest that this can be.

70
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,810
The maximum badness probability is
actually going to be the sum of

71
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:17,430
these if their
intersections are all zero.

72
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,650
And so this is really like taking
the union of all those sets.

73
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,220
So this is referred to
as the union bound.

74
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,740
Which I don't know, to me sounds
like kind of a fancy name for

75
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,910
not such a fancy idea.

76
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,880
We're just going to add
the probabilities because

77
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,790
we don't know how to account for
the overlaps.

78
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,600
>> Oh, but that just follows
from probability, right?

79
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,210
The probability of a or
b is just the probability of

80
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:40,960
a plus the probability of b minus
the probability of a and b.

81
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,430
And sort of the worst case in this
situation is that a and b is zero.

82
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,160
>> Right.
So this is just how these probabilistic

83
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,670
quantities are defined and what we're
saying is if we want to maximize

84
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,950
the probability of this or,
that at least one of them is wrong,

85
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,020
then if we set this intersection
to zero that maximizes it.

86
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,890
So it really is just,
the sum is an upper bound.
