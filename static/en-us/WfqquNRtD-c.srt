1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,313
To check whether both of them are 3, you want to check whether the first one is

2
00:00:04,313 --> 00:00:09,862
3 and the second one is 3. In a condition, that would look like x equals,

3
00:00:09,862 --> 00:00:15,356
equals 3 and, and y equals, equals 3. To check whether at least one of them is

4
00:00:15,356 --> 00:00:21,280
3, you want to know if one is 3 or the other is 3. So, x equals, equals 3 or

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:27,433
which is the vertical bar twice, y equals, equals 3.
