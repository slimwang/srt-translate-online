1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,310
So, let's do some coding.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,514
To start with, let's use an example
stock with missing values.

3
00:00:06,514 --> 00:00:12,600
We will be using fakedo.csv and this
file is included in your data folder.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:18,120
So as usual, we will be reading
the csv into the data frame and

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,279
we will do some plotting.

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,330
So now let's go and
plot this data and see what turns up.

7
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,000
So, here is the graph.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,818
For the given range of dates,
you can notice that there is a gap in

9
00:00:30,818 --> 00:00:34,525
the beginning and also a gap at
multiple places in the middle.

10
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:36,550
So now, let's try to fix this.

11
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:42,160
We only need to add a single
statement to fill those gaps.

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,887
As you must have read
in the documentation,

13
00:00:44,887 --> 00:00:47,908
method ffill corresponds
to forward filling and

14
00:00:47,908 --> 00:00:52,414
inplace is equal to TRUE will save all
the changes in the same data frame.

15
00:00:52,414 --> 00:00:55,604
Try removing this and see what happens.

16
00:00:55,604 --> 00:00:59,210
Now, let's plot and
see how the graph looks now.

17
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,358
So here's the graph.

18
00:01:00,358 --> 00:01:04,090
If you look closely, you will
observe the forward filling effect.

19
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,842
The stock prices retained their
previous values throughout.

20
00:01:08,842 --> 00:01:13,830
However, note that the missing
values at the beginning of the range

21
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,500
have not been filled.

22
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,800
Think about what you need
to do to take care of that.
