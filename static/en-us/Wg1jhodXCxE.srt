[Homework Assignment #2] This is homework assignment #2 in CS 373,

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and it's all about Kalman filters. [Kalman Filters]

00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
[Measurement Update] So question #1 is measurement update.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Let's start with 2 Gaussians and say they have identical variances. Let's multiple them.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We know that the resulting Gaussian's mean will be just at the center between those 2 Gaussians.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I wonder if the variance Σ² is now smaller, larger, or the same as either of the individual Gaussian.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please check one of the three.
