00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,620
Our first lesson is not on one
algorithm in particular, but

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,620
on a design technique called,
dynamic programming.

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,070
This belongs in the same mental
category as divide and conquer.

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,710
It's not an algorithm in itself,

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,470
because it doesn't provide
fixed steps to follow.

6
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,760
Rather, it's a general strategy for

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,890
thinking about problems, that often
produces an efficient algorithm.

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,740
The term dynamic programming,
by the way, is not very descriptive.

9
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,908
The word programming is used
in an older sense of the word,

10
00:00:26,908 --> 00:00:28,859
that refers to any tabular method.

11
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:30,525
And the word dynamic, apparently,

12
00:00:30,525 --> 00:00:33,680
was just used to make
the technique sound exciting.

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,220
With those apologies for the name,
let's dive into the content.
