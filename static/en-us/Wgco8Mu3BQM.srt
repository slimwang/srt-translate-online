00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,034
Well, we know that x cannot equal 0. If x equaled 0, then this first fraction

2
00:00:06,034 --> 00:00:10,636
would have a denominator of 0, and the second fraction would also have a

3
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:15,516
denominator of 0. We know denominators can never equal 0 for fractions, they

4
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:20,062
would be undefined. So, even when we attempt to solve this equation, if we were

5
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:24,210
to get an answer of x equals 0, we would have to exclude it from our solution

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,316
set. We know x can never be equal to 0.
