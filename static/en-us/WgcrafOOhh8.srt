1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,630
I'm really proud of us for figuring out a way to make the prisoner's

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:06,990
dilemma a little more friendly. It turns out, though, that this, this idea, this

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,530
sort of core idea, is very general and kind of cool. So, it leads

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,945
us to a topic that we could call, repeated games, and the folk theorem.

5
00:00:14,945 --> 00:00:15,593
>> Mm-hm.

6
00:00:15,593 --> 00:00:19,280
>> So the general idea here is that when you're in the repeated game setting,

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,900
this possibility of retaliation, the possible of, you

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,710
know, not being cooperative actually opens the door

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,710
for cooperation. Because now it becomes, it can become better

10
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,500
to just get along and cooperate than to get retaliated against.

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,050
>> Right. And that makes sense as long as the retaliation is plausible.

12
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,860
>> Well, we're not talking about

13
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,790
plausibility of the retaliation. We're just talking

14
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,510
about, right, because the tit for tat, it's, it's not analyzed in that way.

15
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:48,172
It, it doesn't say whether or not it's actually plausible. It just says, well,

16
00:00:48,172 --> 00:00:49,225
if you have this strategy and you

17
00:00:49,225 --> 00:00:50,941
play against this strategy, there's no incentive

18
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:51,350
to switch.

19
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:51,920
>> Right.

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,420
>> But we'll, yeah, we'll get into this plausibility thing in a little bit.

21
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,965
>> Oh, I, I stumbled across a word. Okay, go.

22
00:00:56,965 --> 00:01:00,870
>> [LAUGH] But I want to point out one thing first, which

23
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,590
actually kind of irritates me. Kind of along the same lines as

24
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:08,720
like, regression is the wrong word and reinforcement is the wrong word.

25
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,570
Folk theorem is the wrong word. So, what is a folk theorem.

26
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,530
>> It's two words.

27
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,170
>> In general mathematics, sorry say again?

28
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,720
>> A folk theorem is two words.

29
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,080
>> That's fair, yes. So, I think it's actually

30
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,590
two different terms of art. So in mathematics folk theorems

31
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,630
are results that are known, at least to experts in

32
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:30,370
the field, and they're considered to have established status but

33
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,570
they're not really published in their complete form. There

34
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,700
isn't some kind of original publication saying, oh look, I,

35
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,920
I found this thing. It's more, something that like, kind

36
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,410
of everybody knows, and so you don't really give anybody

37
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:46,760
credit for it. So it's like a theorem that is in the general

38
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:52,220
mm, cloud of understanding. It's sort of among the population, among the group.

39
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,610
>> Wait! Does, does anybody every prove these folk theorems?

40
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:58,120
>> You can, yeah! All folk theorems are provable. But it's

41
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,180
not like you say you know this is Charles Isabel's theorem.

42
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:01,600
>> Mm.

43
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,190
>> It's like. No, it's just a folk theorem. It's

44
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,022
like. Charles, Charles can prove it. We can all prove it.

45
00:02:06,022 --> 00:02:08,800
But we, we're not really sure whoever proved it first.

46
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,430
It was just one of those things that everybody knows.

47
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,780
>> Oh, so it's like an oral tradition.

48
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,300
>> Yeah, yeah. I think that's a good way to think about it.

49
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,860
>> Okay. I'm just imagining mathematicians sitting around

50
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,440
a fire in the winter, cuddled up against

51
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,200
one another sharing theorems that have been proved

52
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,340
since the beginning of time to one another.

53
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,350
>> Exactly. Right that's the image that I have as well. This, just it's

54
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,490
folk theorems. It's this sort of, you know, I learned it from my grandmother and

55
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,350
now I'm telling you.

56
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,337
>> Hm. I like that. I like to think of mathematicians that way.

57
00:02:35,337 --> 00:02:36,720
>> [LAUGH] As grandmothers.

58
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,110
>> Yes.

59
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:42,640
>> So so that's what a folk theorem is in mathematics. However, in game

60
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,060
theory it means something different. It is

61
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,080
referring to a folk theorem, but it's also

62
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,520
referring to a particular folk theorem. So

63
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,360
the folk theorem in game theory refers

64
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,590
to a particular result that describes the

65
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,960
set of payoffs that can result from Nash

66
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,550
strategies in repeated games. So it's a funny thing, it's a funny way that they

67
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:05,030
use the word. It's, it's a, it's a folk theorem but it's also the folk theorem.

68
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,070
>> Hm, well, well, maybe it was actually,

69
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,948
proven the first time by some guy named Folk.

70
00:03:08,948 --> 00:03:12,016
>> That's a good idea, we should probably, we should push

71
00:03:12,016 --> 00:03:15,640
that forward like call him Folke or something like that. Folke's theorem

72
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,140
>> Yeah.

73
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,154
>> But but no. [LAUGH]

74
00:03:20,154 --> 00:03:21,510
>> Oh well, I tried.

75
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,286
>> Yeah that's that's really great idea

76
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,780
that we're going to just move on from.

77
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,200
>> [LAUGH]

78
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,490
>> But what I, what I'd like to do next is kind of build up to this

79
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,280
notion of the Folk Theorem and it's going to

80
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,260
require a couple basic concepts that are not too

81
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,370
different from stuff we've already talked about, but

82
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,230
we're going to kind of make them concrete and then we're

83
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,140
going to show how they all come together to

84
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,820
provide us with this idea of a Folk Theorem.

85
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,380
>> Okay.
