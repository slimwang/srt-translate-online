1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,550
The number that you would fill in, in these boxes, is negative 1 3rd. So,

2
00:00:03,562 --> 00:00:07,680
instead of thinking of dividing each side by negative 3, you could instead think

3
00:00:07,692 --> 00:00:11,105
about multiplying each side by negative 1 3rd. Multiplying by negative 1 3rd is

4
00:00:11,117 --> 00:00:15,172
actually pretty much exactly the same as dividing by negative 3. The reason for

5
00:00:15,184 --> 00:00:19,691
this is because of fraction multiplication, and its relationship to division.

6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,650
So, if we have negative 3 time negative 1 3rd, we convert negative 3 to a

7
00:00:23,662 --> 00:00:28,055
fraction of negative 3 over 1. Then, if we just do some fraction multiplication,

8
00:00:28,154 --> 00:00:32,399
so you mutiply the top by the top and the bottom by the bottom, we end up with

9
00:00:32,411 --> 00:00:36,420
negative 3 times negative 1, or positive 3 over 1 times 3, which is just

10
00:00:36,542 --> 00:00:40,785
positive 3 again. And 3 over 3 is just 1. So, multiplying by fractions is just a

11
00:00:40,797 --> 00:00:44,880
different way to think about doing division. I want you to decide which way

12
00:00:44,892 --> 00:00:49,190
works better for you. Thinking of dividing this side by the coefficient that's

13
00:00:49,202 --> 00:00:53,405
in front of x, or multiplying by its reciprocal. Either way is completely fine.
