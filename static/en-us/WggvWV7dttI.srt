1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,260
I'm here with Tairi Delgado, who's
one of the course managers here at.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,060
They're the ones who really work one
on one with students to help them

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,070
through projects or
help them understand material.

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,410
I thank you so much for
talking to me today.

5
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:10,870
>> Yeah, thanks for inviting me.

6
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,000
>> So
the first thing I wanted to ask you was,

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,560
many people have this conception that
online education is very impersonal.

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,771
>> Because we're kind of taking
the synchronous in person

9
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:20,920
communication out of it.

10
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,240
Do you think online education
generally is that impersonal?

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,090
>> I think it really is
what you make out of it.

12
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,640
Personally for me, knowing how a lot
of students interact with each other.

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,580
I see students connect with each other
through chat, Facebook, LinkedIn.

14
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,900
Getting together in groups.

15
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,460
And I think that kind
of level of interaction

16
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,680
It doesn't have to be impersonal,
it could be something very rewarding.

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,310
You can meet somebody from Dubai or
Mexico or China,

18
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:51,130
somebody that you would never
have a chance to meet before.

19
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,690
And instantly you could have
a connection with something that

20
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,710
you both have a mutual passion for.

21
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:02,033
When I look at online education,
I think in many ways It

22
00:01:02,033 --> 00:01:06,820
could be a way to learn things
more in a personal way.

23
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,400
Because, at least my experience
when I was in college was that

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,660
you would sit in a classroom with 200,
300 people and

25
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:19,520
it's very hard to talk to your
professor and get one-on-one advice.

26
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,270
I found the most personal experience
you can possibly ever have is a small

27
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:30,020
group of people that were your friends
that were taking classes together.

28
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,890
You could really get the chance
to work on the problems

29
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,730
are really collaborate with each other.

30
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:40,190
The next best experience I had was, you
know very few times but you know, when

31
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:44,886
you had a one on one tutor who really
understood what you were struggling with

32
00:01:44,886 --> 00:01:48,160
and knew the material very well, and
knew how to personalize things for you.

33
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,010
I think online education has
a benefit of doing both.

34
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:56,490
Because when you're going to these
classes you have the opportunity to

35
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,380
practice on these quizzes at your own
pace, and when you put in your answer,

36
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,950
it's not like somebody's just
marking whether it's right or wrong.

37
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,570
They're actually trying to tell you
specific feedback about what's wrong and

38
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,900
how to actually fix it.

39
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,080
And, you get immediate feedback
to work on and practice it more.

40
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,720
And I think with the ability of getting
groups of people to study together,

41
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:25,640
I think you don't usually have
that in all, like, settings.

42
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,920
So it's, to be able to have that,
I think,

43
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,185
you know,
can make online education really great.

44
00:02:29,185 --> 00:02:31,150
>> Uh-huh.
So it sounds like you're saying that,

45
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,300
and correct me if I'm wrong,

46
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,690
that there's certain ways that we can do
things online that not only break that

47
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,290
impersonal nature that people think
when they think of online education.

48
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,960
But in many ways make it even actually
more personable because you've

49
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,490
got people talking over the Internet so
they can be available all the time.

50
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,050
They can leave messages and
come back to them later, and

51
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:54,090
as a result it's not bottled into
this one hour of lecture time, when

52
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,900
we're have a great discussion but now
class is over and we have to move on.

53
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,877
Or you know press has one hour for
office hours a week and

54
00:02:59,877 --> 00:03:01,817
you could go to talk to him then, but

55
00:03:01,817 --> 00:03:05,766
can't ever interact with them on
a regular basis, it sounds like we're

56
00:03:05,766 --> 00:03:10,129
really building in a way to interact
consistently throughout the experience.

57
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:12,369
>> Right, actually I'll take
it even one step further.

58
00:03:12,369 --> 00:03:16,863
I think the traditional model is, like
you would go talk to your teacher to get

59
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,350
all of the knowledge that you want.

60
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,920
But I think in this age, where we're
constantly learning new things,

61
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,860
and revitalizing our skill sets,

62
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,030
sometimes you just need to
be able to learn new things.

63
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,870
And also facilitate

64
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:37,130
collaboration with a group of small
people that you would be working with.

65
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:44,460
So I think this model has changed
more from a teacher directed model of

66
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:49,920
presenting lectures, more towards this
online content that you can learn.

67
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,060
And then if something
doesn't quite make sense,

68
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,280
you have a group of people that
are willing to support you because

69
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,440
they're trying to
accomplish the same thing.

70
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,230
I think that is a powerful motivator,

71
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:05,490
having a group of people that you could
interact with and help each other out.

72
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,010
Whereas, instead of always
going to the teacher,

73
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,740
you have a lot more
resources to connect with.

74
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,300
>> Yeah, absolutely.

75
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,790
I think that's especially
the case in our OMS program, and

76
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,040
as well as some of the NST nano-degrees.

77
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,660
That because they're so flexible,
because they're so open, and because

78
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,860
they're so cost effective, we attract
people we wouldn't attract otherwise.

79
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,050
And so, some of the classes
I've worked on in the past,

80
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,620
we've had experiences where someone in
the class is already an expert in their

81
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,520
field in something we're talking about,
and we can basically say, you know,

82
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,360
you don't really need to
listen to us about this.

83
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,540
You've got so-and-so over there,

84
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,960
she's working on a world
class project in robotics.

85
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,190
>> Right.
>> And she knows far more about

86
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,300
this than we do.

87
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,260
And she would never take years off of
her career to go get a Masters degree,

88
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,970
but if she can do it flexibly like this,
she comes and does this, and

89
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,680
then she in turn builds
the class up even more.

90
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,680
Because having her there as a resource,

91
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,410
even if she's just a student in the
class, is incredible for everybody,so.

92
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:04,280
>> Yeah, the fact that you bring that
up actually cause, we constantly,

93
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,450
at least I know for myself like,
even though like I've

94
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,160
gone through the content I know it
pretty well, there's times when

95
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,950
you're interacting with students you
realize that there's more to learn.

96
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,780
And, like you said, every student
brings their own perspective.

97
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,920
And I think, on top of that, when
we're talking about these study groups

98
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,800
is that, what we tend to
find is that when students

99
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,270
explain things to other students they
tend to learn content even better.

100
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,720
So I think that's one of
the actual benefits that normal

101
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,520
classroom settings don't
really account for.

102
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,780
It's like having a lot of time for
students to help each other out.

103
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,130
Because in the end that's going to be
what's going to drive them the most.

104
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,600
>> Yeah, having that classroom
that's kind of available 24/7 even

105
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,220
though you don't want students to think
they're expected to be there 24/7.

106
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,620
Having it always available
kind of means that

107
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,520
things that we usually have to put
into the set aside time for lectures,

108
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,520
can now just happen organically
over a much longer period of time.

109
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,070
But the conception that online education
is very impersonal doesn't come

110
00:05:59,070 --> 00:05:59,880
from nowhere.

111
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,310
It came from some courses that are done
in a model that makes it very difficult

112
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,580
to feel like you're connected.

113
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,510
So, in theory, we have some students
who are taking this class who

114
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,450
will go on to be instructors for online
classes, or who will go on to be TAs for

115
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,790
other classes at the OMS.

116
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,530
What would you recommend to them for
when there are teaching

117
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:17,710
classes in the future, making sure
to foster the kind of class that

118
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,010
could develop this community,
this communication between students?

119
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,270
>> Right.
I think that's a really good question.

120
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:27,770
So I would take a look at what kind of
environment you're trying to set up, and

121
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,570
what incentives that gives.

122
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,240
So, case in point,

123
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,230
I remember when I was back in college, a
lot of times it was greater on a curve.

124
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,230
And so one thing that we noticed
is that a lot of the classes that

125
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:43,290
were graded on curves didn't really
a foster a lot of sense of community,

126
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:46,060
because students felt that they
competed with each other rather than

127
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,850
wanting to help each other out.

128
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,460
But in the end it kind of drew back
the ability to learn in general.

129
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:57,180
Like, I felt like, because you're so
focused on competitive scoring,

130
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,990
you're not willing to take the time
to really learn from somebody else.

131
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:06,940
And you also want to take a look
into like what motivate students,

132
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,120
like why are they in
the classroom in the first place,

133
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,250
like what what passions they have that
are driving them to take these classes?

134
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:20,070
Some things that I found when I was
going to classes was that incentivizing,

135
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,980
collaboration with small groups.

136
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:27,850
Getting students to,
from the very beginning, have

137
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:31,270
a voice about who they are and why they
are interested in taking this class.

138
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,920
Being able to connect with other people,
so

139
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,640
they can find mutual people in
the class they want to interact with.

140
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,530
And then from there help them setup
some kind of guiding rules that will

141
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,545
allow them throughout the course
to work with each other.

142
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:47,433
Ohter things that I've noticed is that
you know when professors allowed or

143
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:53,690
instructors allowed opportunity for
students to kind of play around and

144
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:59,150
venture on their own a little bit, to
really learn the material on their own.

145
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:03,510
Really helps a lot for me at least
because you're going to want to

146
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:08,435
prescribe a lot of quizzes or
homework assignments, and

147
00:08:08,435 --> 00:08:13,390
I think in many ways when I had classes

148
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:18,710
that I didn't have to, every week submit
like a homework assignment, but rather,

149
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:23,610
take the time to really focus
on the problem sets and

150
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,820
quizzes and concepts that I felt
that I really needed to study with.

151
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,770
And then studied with my group, well,

152
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,410
people from my study groups
allowed me really to thrive.

153
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:37,580
I think sometimes homework
could be more, at times,

154
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,830
it feels sometimes like you might be
just doing more work than actually

155
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,930
learning quality material that you
feel like you really need to focus on.

156
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:48,850
Homework, I felt, was something that
you were supposed to practice on, but

157
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,630
in the end it was something
that you were graded for.

158
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,710
So, like, a lot of times,
it didn't really

159
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:57,260
Incentivize people to just play around
and just kind of explore a little bit.

160
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,340
I mean, obviously,

161
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,510
you can't expect somebody to know
something the first time around.

162
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:08,020
Like, what is it to do a linear
regression or maybe how to add a whole

163
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,170
bunch of variables together if you're
learning algebra for the first time.

164
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,550
Sometimes you just need
to practice that and

165
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,770
sometimes students are going to
know what they should focus on.

166
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:22,485
As long as you give them ideas of
how to be self-sufficient learners.

167
00:09:22,485 --> 00:09:25,630
So, the last component I would make
is that, if you really want to set up

168
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:29,090
a good learning environment, it's not
only just collaboration and incentives.

169
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:33,240
But also, how to help students
learn to be self-directed learners.

170
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,240
Like what are the main
ways that people learn,

171
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,760
and what kind of incentives
perform habit over time that

172
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,700
students will want to develop so
that they can always learn new concepts?

173
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,280
>> So it sounds like, really,
what we need to do is make sure we're

174
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,980
leaving room for
students to collaborate.

175
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,110
We're leaving room for
students to learn from failure.

176
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:57,550
And we're leaving room for
students to learn how to learn.

177
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,350
And those are all things I
think are very real to the way

178
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,550
we learn in the real world.

179
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,700
They don't often, or don't always
make it into the classroom where we

180
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,630
have a very artificial
learning environment.

181
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,050
But generally it's very
important to look at how people

182
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,980
learn naturally when they're not
in the classroom environment.

183
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,070
Their not given homework, or quizzes,
or tests, or anything like that.

184
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,670
But they're just out there learning
from their experiences and

185
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,700
trying to facilitate the same kind
of learning in the classroom.

186
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,000
>> Yeah.
>> So thank you so

187
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,650
much for chatting with me today and
for your insights.

188
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:24,810
>> Thank you David for inviting me.

189
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:25,720
>> Yeah, absolutely.
And thank y'all.

190
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,380
>> Thanks.
