1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The start symbol is S. It's the first one to appear in our grammar.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
One possibility is s goes to ee which goes to ei using rule 2 and rule 4

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
so this string is definitely in the language of our grammar.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I could also have picked rule 2 followed by rule 3, and then eventually this will boil down to ei plus i.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This string is also in the language of the grammar.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Now, we have aib. Well, I can get the a and the b from this rule 1 here.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
But then if I don't want to make more a's and b's, I have to use this rule 2 to get rid of the s

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and that requires that I bring in this e, and there's no e in this string so that's not looking good.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
All right. How about this, aa, bb?

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I can get that by looping around the first rule twice and then ei.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yeah, this string is in language of the grammar.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Over here, I've got the a and the b around it.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We'll note that these a's and b's follows the same balanced parentheses pattern

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
we've been doing a few times.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The real question is whether ie plus can be generated from s.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We can get the e, we can get the i, but if we use the plus rule

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
it has to have an e on both sides so you know we really need another i in here

18
00:01:09,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but we don't have it so this string is not in language of the grammar.
