00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,670
Let's check out the final advice Moore
had for us on value propositions.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,988
Now, you'll notice he uses
the term positioning statement.

3
00:00:05,988 --> 00:00:07,420
And that's totally okay.

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,560
Many people use the term
positioning statement and

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,100
value proposition interchangeably.

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,480
>> So, you hear a lot about
positioning in marketing.

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,620
And I think your first
instinct is to think about,

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,680
that's something I'm supposed to do.

9
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,150
But the first way you want to think
about positioning is actually

10
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,830
where you fit in your customer's head.

11
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,976
So, in other words, the world,
or your customer base,

12
00:00:28,976 --> 00:00:32,658
only has a certain number of little
compartments to put things in.

13
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:36,420
And so the first question is, what
compartment are they putting you in?

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,980
And so remember in that positioning
statement we were talking about where we

15
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,420
said, our product or service is a blank.

16
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,813
So the first positioning is to
make sure you're in the right box.

17
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:48,113
You're put in the right
aisle in the supermarket.

18
00:00:48,113 --> 00:00:49,835
And that seems obvious,

19
00:00:49,835 --> 00:00:53,690
but sometimes there are multiple
boxes you could be in.

20
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,846
So it's important to think about,
where do I want to compete and

21
00:00:56,846 --> 00:00:58,698
in what category do I want to compete?

22
00:00:58,698 --> 00:01:02,630
So the first thing is then just get
yourself into the right category.

23
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,190
Then the second thing is,

24
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:08,570
the way customers actually understand
you, is relative to your competitors.

25
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,890
In other words, that's how they
understand the category, and

26
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,690
that's how they're going to
understand you and

27
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,570
how you're different than the rest
of the people in the category.

28
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,830
So it's important that you assemble
a set of legitimate competitors

29
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,360
that you have respect for.

30
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,070
You don't want to be the best
house in a bad neighborhood.

31
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,730
You actually want to
be the best house or

32
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,540
the right house in a good neighborhood.

33
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:34,666
So, you want to pick worthy competitors
that, for some situations, you would

34
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:39,648
acknowledge, they're actually better
at solving that problem than I am.

35
00:01:39,648 --> 00:01:40,483
But together,

36
00:01:40,483 --> 00:01:44,820
we're all in the business of providing
this general type of service.

37
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,940
And then the last piece of positioning.

38
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,258
So after we've done
the generic category.

39
00:01:49,258 --> 00:01:52,430
After you've established what
we call the competitive set,

40
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,038
then the last piece of positioning
is okay now, why are we different?

41
00:01:56,038 --> 00:01:56,959
How are we different?

42
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,732
And why does that matter specifically to
the value proposition that the customer

43
00:02:01,732 --> 00:02:04,130
will be bringing to this purchase?

44
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:07,670
So you're helping the customer saying,
the question you want to answer is,

45
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:11,420
you would want to call us when?

46
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,230
And the opposite of that answer is,
on the other hand,

47
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,400
if it were more of this situation, you
probably should call one of the others.
