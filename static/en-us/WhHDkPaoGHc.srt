00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,170
So, this game looks good, and you play it a couple of times, and now, the following scenario happens.

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:09,160
Now, let's say you watch other people play the game first and you notice the following thing:

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,740
In the last 40 throws, no six was thrown.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,190
My question to you is, of course, why could that be.

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,250
Could that be due to pure chance?

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:24,140
Could that be due to something being wrong with the die or maybe even someone is cheating?

7
00:00:24,140 --> 99:59:59,999
Please check all of those that are correct.
