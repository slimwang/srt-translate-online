00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
The question, of course, is if this table here actually suggests that

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,560
randomized algorithms for 3-SAT will always be faster than deterministic algorithms.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,150
And I would argue no here, simply for the reason that such a statement

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:17,060
would in some way have to be proven or at least argued for

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:22,020
with more than just empirical data, but I believe we can also think of some other reasons

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,180
why randomized algorithms currently have better upper bounds than deterministic ones.

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,650
So my question for you to think about is, what could be the reasons

8
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,190
that the randomized 3-SAT algorithms that we've just seen in the table

9
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,470
have generally better bounds than the deterministic ones?

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,890
Could it be because randomization is more powerful somehow than determinism?

11
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,690
Could the reason be that no one has yet had the right idea

12
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,260
simply how to design a better deterministic algorithm?

13
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,920
Or could it be that analyzing deterministic algorithms is in a way

14
00:00:51,920 --> 99:59:59,999
more complex than analyzing randomized algorithms?
