1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,500
Couple of other things are looking at
the previous example that I just showed

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,520
you that we should make concrete.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,080
A good function for steel detection
has one stable, sharp beat.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,602
For example, again the same
function that we looked at, f.

5
00:00:12,602 --> 00:00:17,190
And if I was actually to trace this out,
this is not a peak here.

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,650
This would be problematic.

7
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:19,970
Here it has multiple peaks,

8
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,780
would be problematic because I
wouldn't know which scale to choose.

9
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,470
This is the kind of behavior you want.

10
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,380
You want to be able to kind of see
as the region size gets bigger,

11
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,990
this function basically
gives me one peak.

12
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,300
Again, some of the ideas here basically
suggest that we can actually do this for

13
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,770
most normal images.

14
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:41,200
A good function would be the one
that responds to the contrast or

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,530
intensity changes in an image.

16
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,850
I'm aware all of this still
sounds a little abstract, so

17
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,920
let's look at a few examples
to make this a bit concrete.

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,130
Here is an example of the same
building at two different scales.

19
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:58,240
In the case, this is an example of
a zoomed up image, and now zoomed out.

20
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,630
Here basically look at the scale and
basically we look at the function.

21
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:02,930
This a nice peak here.

22
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,450
This is the one we want to look at.

23
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,440
And at the same scale level,
this is visible at this point.

24
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,010
So in essence, now we need the two
scales for these two images.

25
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,670
This allows us to look at scale, and
actually model the scale that will allow

26
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,820
us to make our detector
invariant to scale
