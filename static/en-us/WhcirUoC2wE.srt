00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,002
Another trick to aiding our ability to recall previously learned information,

2
00:00:04,002 --> 00:00:08,366
is by using a mnemonic device. A mnemonic device is a method to help us

3
00:00:08,366 --> 00:00:11,982
remember information. For example, we may come up with a rhyme to remember

4
00:00:11,982 --> 00:00:15,950
something or perhaps an acronym. So, if we have to remember the grocery list

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:19,777
that we made earlier in the lesson, this one. We can circle the first letter of

6
00:00:19,777 --> 00:00:24,305
each of the items, and come up with an acronym. We gave you a pneumonic device

7
00:00:24,305 --> 00:00:27,539
in lesson 2, when we where describing how to remember the difference between an

8
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:33,178
independent and a dependent variable. We told you to remember that the

9
00:00:33,178 --> 00:00:38,446
independent variable starts with an I, and investigator starts with an I. So

10
00:00:38,446 --> 00:00:42,606
it's the investigator that manipulates the independent variable. That was a

11
00:00:42,606 --> 00:00:43,500
mnemonic device.
