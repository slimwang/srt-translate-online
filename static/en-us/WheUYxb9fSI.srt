1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,260
Now that we've seen all the code
to render the watch face,

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,190
we still need to look at how
the colors were configured.

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:06,839
Let's load up

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,670
DigitalWatchFaceWearableConfigureActiv-
ity.

5
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,350
This activity runs on the wearable and
is available

6
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:16,045
by the little gear icon when the watch
face face is selected on the wearable.

7
00:00:16,045 --> 00:00:17,865
This is a standard
Android Wear Activity.

8
00:00:17,865 --> 00:00:19,715
There's nothing special about it.

9
00:00:19,715 --> 00:00:21,485
It implements a wearable list view, and

10
00:00:21,485 --> 00:00:24,055
shows a list of colors to
set as the background.

11
00:00:24,055 --> 00:00:28,475
If we look at the on click handler, we
can see it calls UpdateConfigDataItem.

12
00:00:28,475 --> 00:00:30,025
This method then sends out updates to

13
00:00:30,025 --> 00:00:32,295
other listeners on
the Android Wear network.

14
00:00:32,295 --> 00:00:34,195
Let's go back to the main project.

15
00:00:34,195 --> 00:00:36,400
If we look at the phone
application project,

16
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,070
we can see
DigitalWatchFaceCompanionConfigActivity.

17
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,380
This is an activity that
runs on the phone side.

18
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,600
It's also a standard Android activity
that brings up some selectives for

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,710
different colors in the UI
like we tried earlier on.

20
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:53,680
This code sends out updates to Android
Wear devices using the message API here.

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,420
It can also receive data item
changes made from the wearable

22
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,640
configuration activity as well.

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,170
The main difference here is that
the phone side implements many more

24
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,150
configuration options while
the wearable side was kept simple

25
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,410
due to the size of the display
