00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,089
Let's take a look inside the app. So so far I can think of two potential objects:

2
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:12,160
people which are actors and movies. What would be the relationship from actor to

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,239
movie. An actor can star in many movies, but a movie can only have that actor in it

4
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:23,429
once. There are no clones of that actor. So the relationship is one to many, that is

5
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:29,079
one actor to many movies. Let's look at some potential attributes for movie.

6
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:33,270
Keep in mind you may have a different answer for this, but we picked title, release

7
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:38,509
date, a path to the movie poster and the ID of that movie in the movie database

8
00:00:38,509 --> 00:00:44,128
website that we were using, to be attributes of the movie entity. For actor, we had

9
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:51,859
name, image path to the actor’s picture and movie database website ID. For attributes

10
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:54,909
for actor, you may have also ahead date of birth,

11
00:00:54,909 --> 00:00:58,479
movie starred in, awards won or something else.

12
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:04,459
For actor, we had name, image path to actor’s picture and movie database website ID.
