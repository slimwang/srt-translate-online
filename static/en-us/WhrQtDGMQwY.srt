00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,080
The question that I'm going to pose to you

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,370
is, why you think the structure of the operating

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,850
system is important, and I'm giving you several

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,290
choices and you can choose as many of these

5
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:14,390
choices as you'd think is appropriate in terms

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:18,180
of your own perspective on why you think the

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,120
structure of the operating system is important. The first

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,340
one is protection, second one is performance, third one

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:29,490
is flexibility, the fourth one is scalability and the

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,300
fifth one is agility, and the final one is responsiveness.
