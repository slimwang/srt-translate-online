00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,795
Katrina travels at 10 miles per hour. Great work if you found this number. We

2
00:00:05,795 --> 00:00:11,524
can start solving this equation by multiplying through by the LCD. The lowest

3
00:00:11,524 --> 00:00:15,904
common denominator in this case is x minus 5 times x plus 5, the product of

4
00:00:15,904 --> 00:00:22,430
these two denominators. When we multiply we'll get 15 times x plus 5 here plus

5
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:30,079
15 times x minus 5 here. Equal to 4 times x minus 5 times x plus 5. I

6
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:35,670
multiplied these two binomials together since we have a minus b times a plus b.

7
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,198
That's a squared minus b squared, our difference of squares pattern. Next we

8
00:00:40,198 --> 00:00:43,794
distribute the 15 here and here and we distribute the positive 4 to get this

9
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:49,940
new equation. Combining like terms on the left side of the equation, we'll have

10
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:57,610
15x plus 15x which equals 30 x. The positive 75 and the negative 75 sum to 0.

11
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:01,820
Next we want to try and factor this quadratic equation. So we'll need to move

12
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,890
this 30x over to the right hand side in order to set the quadratic equal to 0.

13
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,245
I'll list the 4x square term first then the negative 30x term and then negative

14
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:17,430
100. All of these terms are even, so we can divide our entire equation by two.

15
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,490
Here we'll want to use factoring by grouping in order to factor this quadratic.

16
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:26,325
We find factors of 2 times negative 50, which is negative 100 that sum to

17
00:01:26,325 --> 00:01:32,102
negative 15. Negative 20 and positive 5 multiply to give us negative 100 and

18
00:01:32,102 --> 00:01:38,515
they sum to negative 15. So we'll use these two numbers to rewrite negative 15x

19
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:44,370
as negative 20x plus 5x. Then we just use factoring by grouping to get two

20
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:50,441
factors of 2x plus 5 and x minus 10. We set each of these factors equal to 0 so

21
00:01:50,441 --> 00:01:56,695
x can equal 10, or x could equal negative 5 halves. We know x really represents

22
00:01:56,695 --> 00:02:02,340
Katrina's speed. So, we can't use the negative value. It's invalid. This is how

23
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,260
we know Katrina travels at 10 miles per hour.
