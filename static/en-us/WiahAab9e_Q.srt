1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,794
Cache and Network rays,
sometimes referred to as fastest,

2
00:00:04,794 --> 00:00:09,796
request the resource from both
the cache and the network in parallel,

3
00:00:09,796 --> 00:00:13,300
then it responds with
whichever returns first.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:18,210
Usually this will be the cached
version if there is one.

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,480
This strategy will always make a network
request, even if the resource is cached.

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,950
But, if or when the network request
completes the cache is updated so

7
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:34,020
that future cache reads will
always be more up to date.
