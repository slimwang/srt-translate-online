1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,969
In this step, I injected
the forecast data into AppJS, and

2
00:00:04,969 --> 00:00:09,733
updated the code so it displays
as soon as the page is loaded.

3
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:10,892
Let's take a look.

4
00:00:10,892 --> 00:00:15,367
At the top of my app.js file I've
injected the initial weather

5
00:00:15,367 --> 00:00:18,245
forecast data that I want it to display.

6
00:00:18,245 --> 00:00:19,786
Then at the bottom,

7
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:25,070
I called app.updateForecastCard
with the injected data.

8
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:29,080
That way as soon as the app
loads the JavaScript will grab

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,140
the injected code and
immediately get it on screen.
