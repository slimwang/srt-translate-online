00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,070
Alright welcome to the last problem set.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,850
Let's go ahead and dive in with a question about decidability.

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:10,940
Given a program on a RAM and an input to that program, which of the below are decidable?

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,000
The RAM runs at least 1,000,000 steps before terminating.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,880
The RAM runs at least 1,000,000 steps and will eventually terminate.

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,710
Or the RAM runs at most 1,000,000 steps before terminating.

7
00:00:19,710 --> 99:59:59,999
Check all that are decidable.
