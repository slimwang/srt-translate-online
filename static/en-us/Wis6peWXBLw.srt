1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So I really hope you enjoyed all this, and the reason is

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I really want you to do a program basic statistics by yourself.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So, for the rest of your life, you know how to program it.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
When you know how to program it, you know how to do it,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and it will empower you to solve basic problems in probability.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I should tell you in my own life, I've built a lot of robots, and I've applied Bayes rule like crazy.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
My job talk at Stanford was all about Bayes' rule applied to robotics.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's a very powerful paradigm and I hope you enjoyed it.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
If you want to dive deeper, there's always Udacity CS373,

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
which talks about programming and about half of the classes variations of Baye's rule.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'll spare you with the details here because it's a basic introduction class,

12
00:00:49,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but stay tuned for the next unit, I have another great surprise in store for you.
