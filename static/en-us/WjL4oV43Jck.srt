1
00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:08,266
So now that we now that the slope of two to the power of X at X equals zero is slightly less than one,

2
00:00:08,267 --> 00:00:14,266
and the slope of three to the power of X at X equals zero is slightly larger than one,

3
00:00:14,267 --> 00:00:20,866
so it's not hard to imagine that somewhere in between two and three, there is a number called E--

4
00:00:20,867 --> 00:00:28,232
Euler's number--so that E to the power of X has a slope of exactly one at X equals zero.

5
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:40,166
This function is called The Exponential Function. Whereas two to the power of X and three to the power of X are just exponential functions.

6
00:00:40,167 --> 00:00:46,432
As this exponential function, The Exponential Function is so important, it gets a special name;

7
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:53,299
It's not just E to the power of X. It's called exp of X. This is the natural exponential function.

8
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:58,066
And we already know that its basis, E, is a number between two and three.

9
00:00:58,067 --> 00:01:02,299
Now we can start from this idea and compute Euler's number.

10
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:11,799
E is nothing but E to the first power. Great. Let me write this one as 10,000 divided by 10,000.

11
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:18,599
Up to now, this looks completely crazy. Where am I going? I'm going to apply the laws for powers.

12
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:28,332
This is E to the one over 10,000 to the power of 10,000. Remember that rule--if you take a power of a power,

13
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:35,166
you multiply the exponents. This is what you get. But E to the power of one over 10,000,

14
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:40,299
that's something pretty close to X equals zero on this blue curve.

15
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:48,166
So rather than looking up the value on that blue curve, I'm using the red line, the tangent line, to compute that value,

16
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:57,232
to approximate that value, that is. The slope is one, so we can just put X in here, plus the Y intercept is one as well.

17
00:01:57,233 --> 00:02:02,666
And now I'm using this equation for the tangent line to approximate this value.

18
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:13,699
The value of E to the X at X equals one over 10,000. So this is approximately equal to one over 10,000 plus one.

19
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:22,466
We simply looked up that value using the tangent line. Let me plug that in. Then we have E is approximately equal to--

20
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:29,832
I changed the order here to make it look nicer--one plus one over 10,000, to the power of 10,000.

21
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:35,432
Guess what? We have an equation, well, an approximate equation, for Euler's number.

22
00:02:35,433 --> 00:02:45,766
The official definition for Euler's number is the following: E equals the limit of N goes to infinity of one plus one over N

23
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:50,566
to the power of N. I hope that you can now easily guess where this comes from.

24
00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:58,066
The larger this number gets, the better these approximations get. And the result is 2.7 something.

25
00:02:58,067 --> 00:03:06,132
Footnote: This equation is pretty elegant when it comes to deriving E, but when it comes to computing the actual value of E,

26
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:07,933
this equation is pretty inefficient.
