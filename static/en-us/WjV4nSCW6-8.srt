1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,736
So relative minimum is a value of the function that is lower than other values

2
00:00:04,736 --> 00:00:09,432
of the function, but just values that are near that point. So, this is why the

3
00:00:09,432 --> 00:00:14,094
point "D" on this function over here is a relative minimum since we know that

4
00:00:14,094 --> 00:00:18,312
the range of this graph goes all the way down to negative infinity D Is

5
00:00:18,312 --> 00:00:22,848
definitely not the lowest point on the graph. In fact we can see, looking at

6
00:00:22,848 --> 00:00:26,352
points over here. To the left hand side of the graph. That there are values

7
00:00:26,352 --> 00:00:30,380
visible to us right now. That are lower than the value of the function at D.

8
00:00:30,381 --> 00:00:35,308
However, compared to all the values adjacent to D. Whether you move to the left

9
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:39,191
or to the right, the function has its lowest value at this spot. This is

10
00:00:39,191 --> 00:00:43,175
different from a global maximum like at G. There's no other point on this

11
00:00:43,175 --> 00:00:46,660
parabola where the function has a lower value than it does at G.
