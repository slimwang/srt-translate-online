Athena and Grant have shown us that all sorts of polynomials, not just

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:08,106
quadratics, can have imaginary zeroes. So now we found zeros that are integers,

3
00:00:08,106 --> 00:00:12,684
rational numbers, approximated numbers, and even zeros to the imaginary parts.

4
00:00:12,684 --> 00:00:15,484
I think it would be a good idea if at this point we took a step back, and

5
00:00:15,484 --> 00:00:18,734
talked about how all these different kinds of zeros can work together to build

6
00:00:18,734 --> 00:00:24,443
up a single polynomial function. Remember, a polynomials zeros, factors in

7
00:00:24,443 --> 00:00:28,389
degree, are all very closely related to one another.
