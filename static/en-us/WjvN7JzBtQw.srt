1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,320
So that ends our conversation about lightness constancy.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,070
The, as I said, the, the truth is our computational methods are still

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,810
not really adequate in this space.

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,090
It could be it hasn't received enough attention to think of it from recovering

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,100
each element.

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,070
It's received, actually, more attention in the computational photography domain.

7
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,250
And I think if you take Professor Irfan Essa's class in

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,280
computational photography, which I highly recommend,

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,610
I think we spend a lot of time talking about that there are a lot of algorithms

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:31,370
related to computational photography that are connected to computer vision.

11
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,740
And this is an area where this lightness and

12
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,970
color constancy is an area where we need more work.

13
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,380
So the good news is there's plenty of research in computer vision to be done.

14
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,540
So hurry up and go get your degree and come join us in the field.
