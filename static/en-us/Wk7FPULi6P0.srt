00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,614
These two lines are parallel. We can solve each equation for y, so we can

2
00:00:04,614 --> 00:00:09,884
compare the two equations. Let's solve this one for y. I can subtract negative 2

3
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:14,782
x from each side of the equation, and I get negative 3 y is equal to negative 2

4
00:00:14,782 --> 00:00:19,434
x plus 6. Then, I divide each side of my equation by negative 3 to get y is

5
00:00:19,434 --> 00:00:24,092
equal to two-thirds x minus 2. These two equations are in different forms, but

6
00:00:24,092 --> 00:00:28,407
represent the same equation. I can see that my original two equations have the

7
00:00:28,407 --> 00:00:32,907
same slope, and different y-intercepts. This must mean that they're parrallel.
