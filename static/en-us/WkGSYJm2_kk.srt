1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,870
So to review, Translation and rotation.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,810
From frame A to B.

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,980
To express this in the non-homogeneous or regular coordinates.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,290
We take the location of some point p in the A frame, we rotate it and

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:13,620
then we translate it.

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,490
In, in Homogeneous coordinates, we write it as this single matrix.

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:23,570
Where the matrix has the rotation matrix in it in the top left and

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,530
the translation vector located here in the right-hand column.

9
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,140
And the key is that homogenous coordinates allow us to

10
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,120
write this coordinate transforms as a single matrix, but

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,200
I said that four times already, so you're saying like get on with it already.

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,920
So, now finally, we can talk about going from World to Camera frame.

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,377
Here's our equation, using sort of non-homogeneous regular coordinates.

14
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:47,147
Where the idea is, if we have some point p in the world, so

15
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:51,390
it's a point location in the world frame, we have to rotate it,

16
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,577
orient it with, to know which way it would be oriented in the camera frame, and

17
00:00:56,577 --> 00:01:01,350
then we have the translation from the World to Camera frame, okay?

18
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,810
So, we have this sort of ugly equation that would get us from a point in

19
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:09,105
the world to a point in the camera so that p in the C frame,

20
00:01:09,105 --> 00:01:11,440
that's now the point in the camera frame.

21
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,930
In homogeneous coordinates, it's just expressed like this.

22
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,251
The top left three by three is the coordinate,

23
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:19,800
the right-hand column is the translation.

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,350
And that whole four by four is referred to as

25
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:27,530
the extrinsic parameter matrix, okay?

26
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,170
This is the thing that transforms a point in

27
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,540
the world to a point in the camera frame.

28
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:39,540
By the way, that bottom row is not so important unless we're doing inverses,

29
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,490
that bottom row is what makes this equation invertible.

30
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,280
So when sometimes we're doing projections we're going to use the three by four

31
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,220
instead of the four by four, but don't worry about that till the next lecture
