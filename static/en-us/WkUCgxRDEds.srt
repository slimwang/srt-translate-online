1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,900
As with privacy consent, there
are several data segmentation models.

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:10,370
A completely patient controlled
model is the norm for PHRs,

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,750
where there is no obvious alternative
other than a friend or family member

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:19,000
who may be more familiar with medical
terminology than the patient.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,440
We mentioned a Provider Assisted Model,
but

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,520
this does require that busy
providers spend time on the task.

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,470
And even if they are willing, this may
not work well if the patient's data is,

8
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:34,260
as is often the case,
spread among a number of providers.

9
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,900
There are other approaches, including
Organization Controlled Models,

10
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,670
Hybrid Models and Innovative Tools.

11
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,620
That are typically aimed at providing
patients with more support.

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,230
All of these ultimately try to simplify
the complexity in the underlying

13
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:52,310
clinical data, which in turn relies on
better structures than are typically

14
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,230
found in today's EHRs.
