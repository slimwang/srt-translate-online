1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,850
Okay, so opening our file in the browser is probably not what you expected.

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:11,490
Looking at it in developer tools, the structure is exactly as you defined it,

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,940
but the style description isn't there and

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:18,996
the browser uses it's default style for all of the elements, and as you can see,

5
00:00:18,996 --> 00:00:25,520
it's not very pretty and the visual layout is completely off as well.

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,320
Let's go ahead and add in some styles.

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,690
Do you remember earlier when I talked about the HTML file telling

8
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,640
the browser where to find the style information?

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,570
Yeah, we need to add that.

10
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,950
First, you need to add a single line at the start of the HTML file.

11
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,860
This tells the browser that the type of document is an HTML document.

12
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:50,980
Then you need to add the top level tag html because everything here

13
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:56,240
is html and don't forget, every time we have the start tag,

14
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:01,680
we also need to have the end tag and then, so our code is easier to read, we'll

15
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,840
indent our HTML structure so that it's located in between our two html tags.

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,610
After the html tag we need to add a head tag.

17
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,290
This is where you'll add the link to the style file.

18
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:21,230
To add a link to the style file, we start typing, link, and then hit Tab.

19
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:26,150
Here, Sublime Text has automatically filled in all of the information we need,

20
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,610
except for the name of the file that contains our style information, which,

21
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,414
in this case, is called style.css.

22
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,090
After the closure of the head tag, we then add the body tag.

23
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,680
Now, contained within our body tags will be our HTML structure that we

24
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,850
wrote before.

25
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,070
So we need to move this code in between our body tags.

26
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:52,650
Again, for code readability, we've indented the html structure.

27
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,090
So that we have a bit more to look and

28
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,740
work with, let's replace the placeholder description with some text.

29
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,410
You can choose to write your own text or

30
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,540
simply use what we provided in the Instructor notes.

31
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,758
Once the text is added, save the file and then refresh your browser page.

32
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,500
You can see that it updated with the text that we've included and

33
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,050
since you've linked your style sheet to your HTML file,

34
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:22,990
you can go to the style.css file and add some style to the page,

35
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,760
and just for fun, how about we add the following style.

36
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,310
Save the file and refresh your browser.

37
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,830
Then tell me what happened.

38
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,920
Did the box with class description turn red?

39
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,910
Did all text turn red, or

40
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:44,470
did the text in the description box turn red, or did nothing happen?
