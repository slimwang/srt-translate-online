1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,900
All right, let's look at the solution
to systems with no solutions.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,130
Let's go through each of the statements.

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:07,130
For the first statement,

4
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:11,050
the planes defined by the equations do
not have a common intersection point.

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:14,560
In fact, this is more or
less the definition of what it means for

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,850
a system not to have a solution since.

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,810
A solution to a system is
a common intersection point

8
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,350
of the planes defined by each equation.

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,680
Second, there are more than three
planes or equations in the system.

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,970
It may be tempting to select this as
a criterion for having no solutions,

11
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:35,110
especially if you are familiar with
overdetermined systems of equations.

12
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,740
However, there are instances of systems

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,240
with more than four
planes having a solution.

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,338
Take a look at this system,
x + y = 1, y + z = 0,

15
00:00:45,338 --> 00:00:49,510
z = negative 1, and x + 3y + 2z = 1.

16
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:55,090
The first three lines of this system
actually have a unique solution,

17
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,200
0, 1, negative 1.

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,380
The last plane also contains
the point 0, 1, negative 1.

19
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:07,090
In fact, this last equation is just
equation 1 plus two times equation 2.

20
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,560
So even if a system of planes
has more than three equations,

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,490
it's still not enough to
show that it's inconsistent.

22
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,040
But is it necessary for

23
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,020
a system to have more than three
planes in order to be inconsistent?

24
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,933
No, you can have inconsistent
systems of planes with three or

25
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:24,598
even just two equations.

26
00:01:24,598 --> 00:01:30,503
Here's an example, x + y + z = 0,
and x + y + z = 1.

27
00:01:30,503 --> 00:01:33,917
These two planes are parallel since
they have the same coefficients in front

28
00:01:33,917 --> 00:01:35,036
of their variables, but

29
00:01:35,036 --> 00:01:38,680
they aren't the same plane since
they have different constant terms.

30
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,330
Therefore, they don't intersect,
so this system is inconsistent.

31
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,980
Third, we encounter an equation
of the form 0 = k, for

32
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,110
some nonzero number k while
doing Gaussian elimination.

33
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:55,180
This condition is both necessary and
sufficient.

34
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,940
If we encounter a contradiction like
this while going through the elimination

35
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:03,110
procedure, then we know that the initial
system could not have had a solution.

36
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,600
Conversely, if we don't encounter
a contradiction like this,

37
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,288
then we always end up with
the solution of some form,

38
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:12,210
though it may be a parameterization
of an infinite set of solutions.
