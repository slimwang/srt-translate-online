1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,110
So Andrea, we've set up a good
foundation for our app and

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:04,920
now we're ready to add
in the vocab words.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,020
>> Do you have an idea of
what words we can include?

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,953
>> Yeah, I came up with a list of words,
here they are.

5
00:00:09,953 --> 00:00:11,352
>> Cool, this is great.

6
00:00:11,352 --> 00:00:14,650
>> Yeah, at one point I was thinking
about using words for animals and

7
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,710
places, but I figured that
phrases would be more useful.

8
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,003
>> Yeah, I think phrases will be fun for
our students to learn.

9
00:00:20,003 --> 00:00:22,434
>> [FOREIGN]
>> [FOREIGN]

10
00:00:22,434 --> 00:00:25,401
>> [FOREIGN]

11
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:26,667
>> [LAUGH] Sounds great.

12
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:29,980
So Jessica, how do we go ahead and
build the next step of the app?

13
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,720
>> Yeah,
there's a lot of words on this list.

14
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,060
How about we just focus on
the first category for now, so

15
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,470
the numbers category.

16
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,640
>> I see, so
we get the numbers list working and

17
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,560
then we can just repeat the same pattern
for the family, phrases and color words.

18
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,305
>> Yeah, exactly, so let's revisit the
course map and I can give our students

19
00:00:44,305 --> 00:00:47,106
an overview of what we're
going to cover in this lesson.

20
00:00:47,106 --> 00:00:48,280
>> [FOREIGN].

21
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,370
>> So right now we're in
lesson two out of four.

22
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,050
So here are the details of what
we're going to cover in Lesson 2.

23
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,310
So first, we're going to learn about how
to store a list of words in the app,

24
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,950
and we're going to talk about data
structures, such as Arrays and

25
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,350
ArrayLists to help us store these words.

26
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,070
Next, we'll learn how to
display a list of words.

27
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,200
And here's an example of what that
looks like in our numbers activity.

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,920
Then we'll go on to display a list
of English and Miwok word pairs.

29
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,450
And here's what that looks
like in the numbers activity.

30
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,710
And lastly, we'll get to add the words
from all the remaining categories.

31
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:22,170
So here's a sneak peek of what that
looks like in all the activities.
