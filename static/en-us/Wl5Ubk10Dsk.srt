00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,250
In this session we're going to talk
about another collection type called

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,500
dictionaries.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,344
And like arrays,

4
00:00:05,344 --> 00:00:09,140
dictionaries access their values
using unique keys instead of indexes.

5
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,760
And that's why called them dictionaries,
because it's like looking up

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,070
a definition for
a keyword in the dictionary.

7
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:15,720
Let's get started.
