1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,370
I want to talk just a little bit about two of these other constraints that we

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,220
talked about for the correspondence problem.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,720
And I can talk a lot about them, just give you some insight.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,220
One is uniqueness and the other is ordering.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:16,670
So, uniqueness says that there's no more than one match in the right image for

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,270
every point in the left and vice versa.

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,340
Same thing.

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,020
Okay?

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,880
So why does it say no more than one?

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,980
Shouldn't it be exactly one?

11
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,160
Well, no.

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,880
The problem is occlusion.

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,740
And that's illustrated here.

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,910
Let's suppose I have a green bar in front of a red bar.

15
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:36,540
All right.

16
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,040
So.

17
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,300
Here's my left image and here's my right image, and

18
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,820
these are the pixels being seen in my left image and

19
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,220
these are the pixels being seen in my right image, all right.

20
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,060
You'll notice, I have two red ones here, then two green and

21
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:57,210
a red, and here I have a red, two green, and two red.

22
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,240
And the problem is that these pixels are occluded.

23
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:08,470
And what we mean by occluded is that they're only visible, sometimes they're

24
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:13,190
called half occluded, because this pixel is only visible in the left image.

25
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,170
And this pixel is only visible in the right image.

26
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,020
Right there.

27
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:17,690
Okay.

28
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,980
This happens at occlusion edges.

29
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,120
So, if I hold it like this.

30
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,050
So, if Megan, if I asked Megan to close her left eye,

31
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:30,020
your other left she can see, she can't see this thing with her left eye.

32
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,560
But if I asked her to change her other one, she can see it with the right eye.

33
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,270
So, the, the tip of this finger is only visible in, in one of her eyes.

34
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:41,490
So, that's, that's why you don't have necessarily a unique

35
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,820
solution that every pixel is matched in every in every frame.
