00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,602
Vertical assymptotes occur when the denominator is 0. This means you have to

2
00:00:04,602 --> 00:00:09,665
solve x squared minus 7x plus 12 equals 0. So, we can factor this to x minus 4

3
00:00:09,665 --> 00:00:14,390
and x minus 3 equals 0, which gives us the vertical asymptotes of x equaling 3

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:20,246
and x equals 4. To see if we have horizontal and oblique or slant asymptotes,

5
00:00:20,246 --> 00:00:23,606
we need to look at the degrees of the polynomials in the numerator and the

6
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:29,000
denominator. As the numerator is just one, it has a lower degree than the

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,942
denominator, which means that we have a horizontal asymptote. So, what is this

8
00:00:34,942 --> 00:00:39,845
asymptote? The horizontal asymptote tells me roughly where the graph will go

9
00:00:39,845 --> 00:00:44,774
when x is really, really big. And we can see that in this case, when the x gets

10
00:00:44,774 --> 00:00:50,750
bigger, that the function will move closer and closer to 0. So, the asymptote

11
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:56,993
is y equals 0. And for e, we have no slant or oblique asymptote.
