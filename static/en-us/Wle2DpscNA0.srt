00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,410
It is almost all of the above.

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:07,510
jQuery does add a few kilobytes to the size of your pages, so

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,890
it will add a minute amount of time to your page loads.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,481
But, given all of the syntactical sugar you gain,

5
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:16,990
most developers are more than happy to add it to their Web sites.

6
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,870
On a personal note, I want to add that while I was making this class,

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,420
my opinion about jQuery actually changed a little bit.

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,670
I generally tend to use just plain old JavaScript to do

9
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:33,060
DOM manipulation because I don't want to add the extra kilobytes to my pages.

10
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,270
But honestly, after doing the research in developing this class and

11
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:41,630
spending more and more and more time with jQuery, it really is pretty awesome.

12
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,670
So, I'm going to go ahead and draw a smiley face here.

13
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,340
It's an ugly smiley face, but that's how I'm feeling right now.

14
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,860
So, good job for finishing, guys.
