00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,149
We've spent our time talking about research methods. But one crucial aspect we

2
00:00:04,149 --> 00:00:09,397
did not discuss in detail is ethics and psychology. It's important to know that

3
00:00:09,397 --> 00:00:13,894
before any study is conducted, whether it's with humans or animals. It must be

4
00:00:13,894 --> 00:00:18,430
approved by a federally mandated committee. For humans, it's the Institutional

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:25,260
Review Board. And for animals, the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,570
All committee members must be trained and certified to serve. Let's talk about

7
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,248
the IRB. For humans, two important questions are asked regarding any research

8
00:00:35,248 --> 00:00:40,834
proposal. First is, should the study be done at all? Here, committee members

9
00:00:40,834 --> 00:00:44,802
are going to look at the risks versus the benefits of participating in that

10
00:00:44,802 --> 00:00:50,442
research. If committee members feel that the benefits outweigh the risks, the

11
00:00:50,442 --> 00:00:57,180
second question is asked. This is, what constitutes adequate informed consent?

12
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,074
Here the experimenters have to tell the participants, exactly every step that

13
00:01:01,074 --> 00:01:07,876
they will need to complete throughout the experiment. Another important aspect

14
00:01:07,876 --> 00:01:12,037
of ethics in psychology is the right for the participant to leave the

15
00:01:12,037 --> 00:01:17,964
experiment at any time without negative consequences. Finally, once a

16
00:01:17,964 --> 00:01:21,618
participant has completed the experiment, it's important to debrief that

17
00:01:21,618 --> 00:01:25,985
person. Meaning we have to let the person know what the purpose of the study

18
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:30,188
was, and they have the right to ask any questions regarding the study. Some

19
00:01:30,188 --> 00:01:33,779
main points to remember about research ethics, are that we don't want to put

20
00:01:33,779 --> 00:01:39,602
anybody in harms way. We don't want to deceive anybody, unnecessarily and we

21
00:01:39,602 --> 00:01:45,584
must ensure participant's privacy. Research ethics are fundamental in the study

22
00:01:45,584 --> 00:01:50,247
of psychology. In fact, ethics are the most important part of psychological

23
00:01:50,247 --> 00:01:51,520
research.
