00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,100
Back in the days when there was just
one screen density for devices,

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:08,840
a designer might create a pixel perfect
logo or other graphic in Photoshop.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,860
Now that was fine,

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,490
until more screen densities started
coming along, like HDPI and XHDPI.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,040
You'd need to redraw the pixels
in the graphic at a larger size

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,550
to ensure it was the same
physical size but

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,840
look perfectly crisp on
the higher density screen.

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,120
With four or
five popular density buckets these days,

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,890
this practice can get really tedious,
really really quickly.

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,400
Designers who don't want to repeat
themselves should use a graphics app

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,530
that can work with and
export vector graphics.

12
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,690
Apps like Photoshop and

13
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,570
Gimp are geared primarily to
working with rastrographics.

14
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,660
That means they store the actual
color information for

15
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,000
each pixel in the resulting image.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,300
Those raser images can be
scaled down with no problem but

17
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,120
you start to see blurring and other
bad artifacts when you enlarge them.

18
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,120
Vector graphics apps like Ink Scape,
Illustrator, and

19
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,520
Sketch, instead store information about
the individual shapes in the image.

20
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,250
For example, the center and
the radius of the circle.

21
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,640
So you can scale the image up or
down without any loss of quality.

22
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,890
The shapes will just be
drawn at a larger size.

23
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:16,670
While Photoshop lets you work with
vector graphics too, Illustrator and

24
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,705
Sketch actually let you export your
graphics to vector format like SVG or

25
00:01:21,705 --> 00:01:23,505
Scalable Vector Graphic.

26
00:01:23,505 --> 00:01:27,785
In newer versions of Android, you can
directly use vector images in your app,

27
00:01:27,785 --> 00:01:30,905
using a format similar to basic SVG.

28
00:01:30,905 --> 00:01:34,385
Sure beats exporting a bunch of png
files over and over again, right?
