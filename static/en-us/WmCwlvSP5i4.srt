00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,450
Crossing the gulf of execution, and the

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,120
gulf of evaluation, involves users asking themselves

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,771
a series of questions. For each of

4
00:00:09,771 --> 00:00:13,290
the seven questions, indicate whether the question occurs

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:19,083
at the users goal. The action done to the world. The Gulf of Executiuon. Or

6
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:25,103
the Gulf of Evaluation. What do I want to accomplish? Or what is my goal?

7
00:00:25,103 --> 00:00:31,086
What action can I do now? How do I do it? And after I've taken action, what just

8
00:00:31,086 --> 00:00:33,993
happened? What does what just happened, mean? Am I

9
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:36,960
okay with what just happened? Have I accomplished my

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,850
goal? It's important to note that typical behavior, is

11
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,850
not about going through all stages in a linear

12
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,130
fashion. We tend to weave back and forth when

13
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,390
trying to accomplish a goal. And not all of

14
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:55,520
the activity In the seven stages of action, is conscious. Goals tend to be

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,520
conscious. But even they may be subconscious.

16
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,290
The seven stages of action that are made

17
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,960
up of the Gulfs of Execution and

18
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,820
Evaluation. Provide a helpful checklist for designers to

19
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,840
use when creating something. And next, Don

20
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,410
introduces important design rules, that are linked to

21
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,710
the seven stages of action.
