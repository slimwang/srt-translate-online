1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,490
So let's talk about approximation quality.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,640
Because, obviously, even though you've decided that you're content with a solution that is not optimal,

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,360
you still want to ensure a certain quality of your solution.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,390
And we'll be looking at 2 different types of approximation algorithms in this unit.

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:20,270
The first 1 is called a constant factor approximation.

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,640
And what a constant factor approximation is, well, as the name says,

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,770
there is some constant C, so when you have an optimization problem

8
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,960
where you want to minimize some quantity,

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,000
this algorithm will guarantee you a solution that is no worse than C x the best possible solution.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,970
For a minimization problem, your solution will be

11
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:42,660
â‰¤ C x the optimum, or the best possible solution.

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,980
And that is a guarantee that this constant factor approximation gives you.

13
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,570
So this is for minimization, and for maximization--so minimization problem

14
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:54,400
you're trying to find this point here; for maximization problem, you're trying

15
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,400
to find this point here, basically.

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:03,580
Your solution is at least as good as 1 over C x the optimum.

17
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,940
So let's do a quick quiz to practice this.

18
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,820
So say you have a factor-2 approximation algorithm,

19
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,940
which means that C = 2.

20
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,650
So you have a factor-2 approximation algorithm for vertex cover.

21
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,440
You run the algorithm on an input, and it returns to you a vertex cover of size 100.

22
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,940
And, of course, this is a correct answer, so it is, indeed, a vertex cover,

23
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,190
we just don't know if it's the smallest possible vertex cover

24
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,360
because we're using an approximation algorithm.

25
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,660
What I would like you to tell me now is 2 things:

26
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,950
First of all, what is the maximum number of vertices in an optimum solution,

27
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,370
and please enter your answer here, and what is the minimum number

28
00:01:38,370 --> 99:59:59,999
of vertices in an optimum solution? And please enter this number here in this box.
