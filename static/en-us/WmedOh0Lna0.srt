1
00:00:00,588 --> 00:00:03,380
Now we weren't very strict
in grading this question

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,280
because there's technically no right or

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,880
wrong answer for which order
you should write your code in.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,460
And since there's a dependency
on our designer for

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,245
these images,
it can affect our schedule as well.

6
00:00:15,245 --> 00:00:18,115
However here's one approach
that we recommend.

7
00:00:18,115 --> 00:00:21,015
So let's modify the list
item layout in step 1.

8
00:00:21,015 --> 00:00:23,635
For now we can use
a placeholder image here

9
00:00:23,635 --> 00:00:26,040
until we get the final images we need.

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:26,790
Even with that,

11
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,860
we should still be able to run
the app after making this XML change.

12
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,210
Now deciding what the next step
should be is a little bit harder

13
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:39,030
because changing one thing could cause
a ripple effect in other places.

14
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,370
You could have several
different answers here.

15
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,470
But in the best case, if the designer
has those images ready, we can add

16
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:50,920
them into the app in step 2 then we can
start referring to the correct images.

17
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,700
So we can modify each word in the list
of words to refer to the correct images

18
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,970
for step 3.

19
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,290
So lastly we should make
sure that the WordAdapter

20
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:04,730
creates proper list item views
to reflect each word object.

21
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,540
So this means that
within the WordAdapter

22
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,550
we need to modify the instructions on
how to create a proper list item view.

23
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,950
So these instructions should
include setting the correct image

24
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,070
onto the image view in
the list item layout.

25
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,322
Now if you didn't receive the images
from the designer until later,

26
00:01:24,322 --> 00:01:27,918
you could have used placeholder
images up until the very end.

27
00:01:27,918 --> 00:01:30,931
And then go back and
incorporate the actual images.

28
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:33,315
So if your ordering
reflected that situation,

29
00:01:33,315 --> 00:01:35,290
that's an acceptable answer as well.
