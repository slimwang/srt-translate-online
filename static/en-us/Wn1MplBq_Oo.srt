00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,130
We are now in a better position to understand the

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,700
details of Network Address Translation. The trick whereby one public

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,980
IP address is able to serve many computers on a

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,650
private network, be it a home, a business or a

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,450
coffee shop that we discussed earlier. Recalling our earlier scenario,

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,310
your combined modem/router has this public IP address and your

7
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,610
computer has this private IP. When you send a packet

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,720
to the Udacity site, the router switches out your IP address

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,370
for its own. This way the Udacity site

10
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,930
will know where to send the response. The router

11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,110
also however, changes the port number and the transport

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,570
layer packet and it remembers the translation between. Your

13
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,530
private IP and port number and this public port

14
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,150
number that it sent as part of a message.

15
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,330
This way, when Udacity sends a packet back, notice

16
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:51,160
how he flips the destination and source IP's and

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,490
the destination source ports. Your router then

18
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,130
can change the IP and port number back

19
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,620
so that the packet gets routed to your

20
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,960
computer. Instead of to your printer, and to

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,800
the right application. Like this. So the destination

22
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,100
IP becomes yours and the port number becomes

23
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,200
the same one that you originally sent, so

24
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,300
the packet gets routed to the correct application.
