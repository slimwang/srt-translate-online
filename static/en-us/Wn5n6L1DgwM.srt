1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,566
To get 0 on the right-hand side, we just subtract the fraction we originally had

2
00:00:04,566 --> 00:00:08,962
there from both sides. So we end up with 1 over x plus 2, minus 3 over 2x minus

3
00:00:08,962 --> 00:00:13,453
4, and that's greater than 0. We don't have to flip the sign here or anything,

4
00:00:13,453 --> 00:00:18,262
because we're just subtracting, we're not multiplying or dividing by a negative.
