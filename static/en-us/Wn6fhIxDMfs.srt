1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,320
Wait a second,
why do we need probabilities?

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,754
I guess it makes sense for prediction,
because we don't what the value of x is

3
00:00:07,754 --> 00:00:11,319
at time t since we only have
information until time t minus 1.

4
00:00:11,319 --> 00:00:13,391
But what about correction?

5
00:00:13,391 --> 00:00:17,780
We know what the measurement
is at time t.

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,470
Why can we not get
a definitive value for Xt?

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,240
Why is this a probability distribution?

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,590
Is it because the state end
measurement are different quantities?

9
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:34,175
Like in our pendulum example,
where we said the state could be just

10
00:00:34,175 --> 00:00:39,475
the angle theta and the observation
was the location of the target.

11
00:00:39,475 --> 00:00:42,725
Or could it be that observation
values are unreliable

12
00:00:42,725 --> 00:00:47,059
due to underlying sensor noise or
even imperfect detection algorithms?

13
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,580
What if observations are missing or
beyond known limits?

14
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,900
Is that a good reason to model state
as a probability distribution?
