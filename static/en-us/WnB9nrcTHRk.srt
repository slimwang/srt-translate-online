1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,270
So now let's try to apply the concept
that we have learned to an actual cache.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:07,660
We know that the main memory
in a computer is large and

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,880
very slow to access compared
to processor speed.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,490
And also we know that there
is lots of spatial and

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,950
temporal locality present
in our data accesses.

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,620
Most programs exhibit a lot of
spatial and temporal locality.

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,300
So for an access to a memory location
what do you think we should do?

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,030
Should we go to the main memory for
every access?

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,920
Should we have a small memory inside the
processor core, and then we bring stuff

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,770
we access there so that next time
we need it, we can find it quickly?

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,990
Or should we have a huge memory
next to our processor chip,

12
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,530
because it won't fit
on the processor chip?

13
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,400
And then,
as we read from the main memory,

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,530
we bring everything into this
memory that is next to us.
