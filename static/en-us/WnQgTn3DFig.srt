1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is sending all of the ki values would be sufficient.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Those are the values that the bank would need to unblind the messages,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
because the bank can decrypt all the messages using its private key

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and then divide out the k raised to the eB power from the results.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It would be okay to send this, but there's no need.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
There's no security loss in sending the ri values except for the one from message x,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
but the bank is going to learn those anyway.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Since after it divides out to ki^eB power, it has all these values.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
At the end of this protocol, Alice will be able to compute message x signed by the bank.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Now, Alice can spend the bill, give it to Cathy.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Cathy can verify the signature, and she could deposit the bill in the bank.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The bank checks if this ID has not been spent before and believes that it's a valid bill.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
If Alice spends the bill again, when Doug gives it to the bank,

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
the bank checks the signature but finds that this ri value was previously used.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The bank knows the bill was double spent.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The problem is the bank doesn't know who double spent the bill.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The bank received the bills from Cathy and Doug, but they weren't the double spenders.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
They were the ones that were duped in the accepting the bill.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Alice was the double spender, and because of this blind signature scheme,

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
the bank doesn't know that Alice is the one who spent the bill, and so for this approach to work,

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
we need a way to trace the double-spent bill back to the person who double spent it,

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
but we also want the bills to be anonymous so that sounds like a contradictory property.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
There's actually a way to achieve this.
