00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,488
Could we have done the same thing with a loop over here? Not really because in

2
00:00:04,488 --> 00:00:10,610
this loop we didn't traverse all of the pictures, we skipped the zeroth one.

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,516
You can only use the enhanced for loop when you look at all of the elements of

4
00:00:14,516 --> 00:00:19,161
an array list. And there's another reason when you use the enhanced for loop

5
00:00:19,161 --> 00:00:24,556
you don't actually know the index value. Of any of the elements. And, over

6
00:00:24,556 --> 00:00:27,884
here, we needed the index value because we had the i-th element, and then the i

7
00:00:27,884 --> 00:00:33,108
minus first element. But, I'll give you a challenge question, and that is, to

8
00:00:33,108 --> 00:00:37,392
rethink the logic of this loop, and rewrite it, as an enhanced for loop, like

9
00:00:37,392 --> 00:00:43,300
this. And to make that a little bit easier, you get to position the first

10
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:48,717
image, at offset ten. So put ten pixels before the first image, before the

11
00:00:48,717 --> 00:00:51,479
second, before the third, and so on.
