1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,820
Now, let's actually start looking at

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,060
how we would represent a digital image as a function.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,830
We've already looked at, that I've given all images an axis basically kind of

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,870
traversing, and in continuous variables x and y.

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:18,320
Or, indices in the discreet space, like a matrix, with i or j.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,260
We've also discussed that I want to start representing this image as a matrix,

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,000
so here is basically a six-by-six matrix.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,560
Now I've filled this matrix in with some values.

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,510
Again, there are values that vary from 0 to 255.

10
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,260
The intensity values of each and

11
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,770
every pixel of this six-by-six just a sample image that we we want to look at.

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,500
Now what we want to try to see is, okay, what would this kind of a function or

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,210
a matrix have in terms of functional characteristics and

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,990
how would we actually look at that signal?

15
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,840
One way of looking at this would be in the continuous store form.

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,030
And remember when I actually previously showed you this example of

17
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,440
just doing a slice and looking at the variables recorded.

18
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,380
Actually generate a plot very similar to this.

19
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,900
So if I was to just look at the, this axes of six values.

20
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,580
And this, of course, is just a pictorial of a much bigger image.

21
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,610
It would start showing your continuous signal

22
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,920
varying in different intensity values.

23
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,240
And of course the way we can actually represent that continuous signal,

24
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,720
there are various ways that is possible and

25
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,245
we will be looking at that in a future lecture.

26
00:01:21,245 --> 00:01:24,430
Discrete signal on the other hand would just be these discrete functions at

27
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,790
each and every index value with no continuation going on between them.

28
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:32,040
But again, it captures a whole lot of detail in a discrete form for

29
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,340
an image like this.

30
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,370
Also another way to look at the same matrix, or

31
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:41,130
same kina for information would be looking at it with a height map on an image.

32
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,280
So again, on this instance what I do is I look at the y axis and

33
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,770
the x, the x axis.

34
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,670
I just turned it around just to help us visualize this better.

35
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,610
And on the third dimension, the top one,

36
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,040
I would be basically showing the intensities.

37
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,860
That's what this image represents.

38
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,270
If you look at the same mandrill image, now remember,

39
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,800
the intensity values of one or higher zero would be black.

40
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:06,320
So here, for everywhere the blacks are, you see kind of a a valley.

41
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,570
And then you start seeing peaks and a lot of detail where the whites are.

42
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,090
And actually you can see kind of the ridges forming.

43
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,580
So in essence, this starts making it look like small hills, and

44
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,270
mountains, and ranges, and stuff like that.

45
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,640
We'll be looking at it more carefully, and

46
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,230
I'll actually be even showing you animated versions of this in a bit.

47
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,640
That'll start kind of explaining what are the values of these types of, or

48
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,470
what is the value and what are the advantages of this kind of an image.
