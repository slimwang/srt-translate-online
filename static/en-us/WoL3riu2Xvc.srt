00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,370
You start in your home directory.

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:05,130
So the full path /home/vagrant
is the correct enter here.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,835
The full path to a file within
this directory could be

4
00:00:08,835 --> 00:00:12,720
/home/vagrant/.bash_logout.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:18,620
You could've also used the file .bashrc,
or the file .profile.

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,360
If you're interested in learning more
about what these files actually do,

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,460
look at the instructor notes.
