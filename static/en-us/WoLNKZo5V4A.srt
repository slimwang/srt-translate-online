1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This is a straightforward implementation of the forward Euler method.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This x at the initial step is actually 2D vector. S is the y.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The result will again be a 2D vector with those two values for the two trajectories in it.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The resulting diagram may need some explanation.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We see the distance between the x values of the two trajectories over the course of time.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Initially, they are really close--10^-14.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And then they grow and eventually become macroscopic--10^100.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The important thing to be seeing is this linear slop.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
But actually it's not linear.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We are working with a logarithmic vertical axis,

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
which means that the distance grows in exponential fashion.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It takes about 30 units of time to increase the error from 10^-14 to 10^-4.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
These are 10 orders of magnitude, a factor of 1 to 10 billion.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This leads to the following conclusion:

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
whenever there is an uncertainty about the initial conditions--

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
however tiny--the effect of this uncertainty will quickly grow to a visible size.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So, even those the system is deterministic,

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
once we have fixed the initial conditions, everything is determined--

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
even though that is the case, it's behavior looks random.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This sensitive dependence on initial conditions is the hallmark of deterministic chaos.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That is to be expected.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Every system, which includes convection, also inherits this aspect.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
If somewhere a butterfly flaps its wings, some days or months afterward

24
00:01:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
this is going to change the weather at some remote location on the earth.
