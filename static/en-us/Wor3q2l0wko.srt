1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,040
Now this is something you should be proud of.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,105
It's hard to learn JavaScript, but it's even harder to learn it well.

3
00:00:07,105 --> 00:00:10,690
Now you may still feel a little bit shaky around implementing things like this,

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,570
but that's completely normal.

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,910
So, I'm going to give you a few other ideas on how to

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,900
change your todo application.

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,910
Because although it's cliche' to say, practice does make perfect.

8
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,530
Here's some things that you can add to the todo application.

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,540
Let the user set the priority status when their creating the todo item.

10
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:33,740
Let users filter or sort by that same priority status.

11
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,270
Expand the priority status feature to have more than two levels.

12
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,410
Right now it's either priority or not priority.

13
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,600
What if there were different levels of priority?

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,340
Priority one, two and three?

15
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,140
What about adding a recycle bin for recovering deleted todos.

16
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,260
You could add colors, so that way people using your

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,850
application can associate different todos with each other by using colors.

18
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,430
You could add a whole labeling system for sorting and filtering.

19
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,850
And those are only the ideas that I came up with,

20
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,060
there are tons more things that you can do with this particular application.

21
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,300
Some of these are fairly trivial to implement, and

22
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,500
some of them are quite a bit more work.

23
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,710
And here's the best part,

24
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:18,030
if you make any of these changes or any others, they'll be your changes.

25
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,240
You will also be making whatever CSS changes are necessary, and

26
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,930
that is exciting.

27
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:27,770
You're finally at the point where you can do this stuff completely on your own.

28
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,160
So here's my challenge to you, try it.

29
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,440
If you're feeling hesitation or trepidation, go ahead and

30
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,750
change your attitude from, oh, I don't know if I can do that.

31
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,950
To, I know I can do that, my self.

32
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,900
It might just take me a little bit of time, or I might need to do some research.

33
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,990
And that right there, that change is the hardest part.

34
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,910
It's changing your mind, you're not grappling with the code, or

35
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,330
the technical problem.

36
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,350
You're grappling with yourself.

37
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:02,500
So, take your hesitation, throw it out the window, and do it.

38
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,910
Start on the project.

39
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,310
Start solving the problem.

40
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,060
Now here are two things that have worked for

41
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,500
me that I would like to share with you.

42
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,340
The first is to be a detective.

43
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,420
Remember that in the world of computer programming there is no magic at all.

44
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,220
So any code that you have and

45
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,030
any problems that you have, are discoverable and understandable.

46
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,180
You can go in and you can change things.

47
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,090
You can change the way they work, and you can fix them.

48
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,800
So remember that, there's no magic.

49
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,220
The second thing is, I'd like you to write code everyday.

50
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,010
That's a challenge.

51
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,669
John Resig, the original author of jQuery wrote,

52
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,320
the feeling of making progress is just as important as making actual progress.

53
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,870
So, I'd like you to add this to your calendar, every single day

54
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:54,200
make yourself a notification, or a reminder, to write some code.

55
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,510
So congratulations.

56
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,970
You've made it through this course.

57
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,630
But don't let it stop here.

58
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:03,060
Keep the momentum up, keep building things and reading, and

59
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,910
learning, and exploring.

60
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:08,470
And as you build cool things, go ahead and share them on the Udacity Forum,

61
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,990
because it's always good for other students to see what you've been building,

62
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,540
for you to see what they've been building,

63
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,970
and we always love seeing what you guys built.

64
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,450
Keep it up, good work, and have fun.

65
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,880
We'll see you later.
