00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,530
Now, I have talking a little about implication. Let's see how do we

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:09,320
actually write, implication and logic. So here is a sentence, if animal

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,260
lays eggs and animal flies, it is implication is that the animal is a bird.

4
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,780
In logic we write this using the symbol, arrow symbol, or

5
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:25,120
an indication, so if the animal lays eggs and animal flies,

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,560
implication animal is a bird. So here is the left hand side of the implication,

7
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,330
here is the left hand side of the implication.

8
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,360
The left hand side of the implication, implies the right hand side
