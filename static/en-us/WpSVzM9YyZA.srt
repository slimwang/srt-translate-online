1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,590
The /22 represents the length of the network ID, and the

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:09,650
remaining 10 bits are for host in that /22 prefix. So

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,710
those 10 bits reserved for the host for that /22, mean

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,760
that this /22 prefix represents 2 to the tenth IP addresses.
