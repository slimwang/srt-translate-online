1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,540
My name is Steve, Steve Chen,
I am most well known for

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,620
being one of the co-founders
of YouTube and

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,770
one of the probably the earliest
employees of PayPal, PayPal link.

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:16,830
And a little known fact I was also one
of the earliest engineers at Facebook

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,330
for about 3 months before so

6
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:24,720
that was kind of this in sandwich
between PayPal and starting YouTube.

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,888
I was working at Facebook and so
in 2005 when I was filing my taxes,

8
00:00:29,888 --> 00:00:34,721
I was filing taxes with both PayPal,
Facebook and YouTube on it.

9
00:00:34,721 --> 00:00:37,022
And I don't think anybody else
can make that claim, ever.

10
00:00:37,022 --> 00:00:43,279
[LAUGH] I think for a while there, so
I left YouTube in about 2009, 2010.

11
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:49,844
And probably for the first 12 months
there, was trying to figure out, because

12
00:00:49,844 --> 00:00:55,381
all throughout the twenties and even
early 30 was just working on startups.

13
00:00:55,381 --> 00:00:59,530
And it was always the kind of, there's
no difference between Monday, Wednesday,

14
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,087
Saturday, Sunday there's no
difference between whatever, 9 AM and

15
00:01:03,087 --> 00:01:04,430
3 AM in the morning.

16
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,860
And so I've been doing that for
over a decade,

17
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,710
and I was always thinking throughout
that decade while I was having fun.

18
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,990
There were all these other things
just starting to get into coffee and

19
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,920
photography and headphones and
just speakers and watching all these

20
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,600
movies that came out throughout all that
time that I never got a chance to watch.

21
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,760
But after the first 12 months I just
realized that none of it is as fun

22
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,500
as kind of the challenge and
the excitement,

23
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,910
the sort of just everything that
motivates people to start companies.

24
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,150
Nothing really compares to that,

25
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:43,330
so got back into starting a company and
so that's what I'm doing now.

26
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,210
I went back to Google, Google Ventures
as an entrepreneur in residence for

27
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:50,680
about 18 months and
got the support from Google Ventures.

28
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,500
And then just about a month and

29
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,350
a half ago in August of 2015, left
Google Ventures because we were ready

30
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,839
to start getting external funding and
doing our own hiring.

31
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:05,905
With the early days of
YouTube started and

32
00:02:05,905 --> 00:02:09,840
sort of in that 2005 time frame.

33
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,602
I think that the idea and
domain name itself,

34
00:02:13,602 --> 00:02:19,056
we bought it on Valentine's Day,
so February 14th 2005.

35
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:22,155
There was another co-founder,
Chad Hurley,

36
00:02:22,155 --> 00:02:26,492
we were in Menlo Park California and
if you can imagine we search for

37
00:02:26,492 --> 00:02:29,990
a YouTube on Google and
zero results came up, right.

38
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,760
And so we went out,

39
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,760
bought the domain name youtube.com and
started talking about this site.

40
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,720
The site itself originally the idea was,
it's a little embarrassing

41
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,450
to talk about but it was actually
supposed to be kind of a dating site.

42
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:49,640
It was supposed to be a dating
site where instead of posting your

43
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:55,330
personal pictures and your personal
introduction you would post a video and

44
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,120
that would just aggregate
everything together.

45
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,630
A little introduction to yourself but
you would actually see this person and

46
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,700
be able to interact with them.

47
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:08,680
Which you know we started developing
all the back end was still more or

48
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,540
less the same as of what
you see with YouTube today.

49
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,770
Being able to upload videos.

50
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,110
Being able to transcode videos.

51
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,970
Being able to embed these videos onto
different sites out there on to social

52
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,820
networking sites.

53
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,010
And the development of the site
took about three months.

54
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,646
And we launched in May of 2005.

55
00:03:24,646 --> 00:03:28,450
And for the first week,
it was a total flop.

56
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,830
We didn't get a single video uploaded.

57
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,640
That was within the category domain of

58
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,970
what we thought the site
was going to be.

59
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:39,740
Nobody was introducing themselves
using the site as a video dating site.

60
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:45,640
However, what we saw was that
videos were being uploaded and

61
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,970
so within that first week,
we quickly changed.

62
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,080
Again the back end of the site,
we made exactly the same.

63
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:58,160
It was just changing, instead of
searching for male or female in the age,

64
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,750
you would just search for whatever
you wanted to search for in a video.

65
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,570
And the look and
feel of it was changed a bit,

66
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:08,600
but it was a very quick
two day effort to convert

67
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,800
what was a sort of a dating video
site into a general video site.

68
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,800
And one of the things is,
Chad, I met Chad,

69
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,230
the other cofounder at PayPal, the first
day I moved out here to California.

70
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:25,620
He was the original designer of PayPal
and I was one of the first engineers and

71
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,270
we worked on a number of projects
together at PayPal, And same thing,

72
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:35,340
I think one of the ideas of startups and
success of startups

73
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,710
is this idea of pivoting from what
you're originally starting to do and

74
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,700
something else instead.

75
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:45,815
And PayPal, many people know what
it is now, many people use it as

76
00:04:45,815 --> 00:04:50,758
a P2P payment service or
personal business payment service.

77
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:56,159
But when it first started, it was
this palm pilot security application

78
00:04:56,159 --> 00:05:00,940
that one, it never really got off
the ground as a security app.

79
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,970
And two, these days I don't know
many people that still own,

80
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,550
carry around palm pilots.

81
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:10,410
But the valuable lesson there was just,
if you take a look at what the users

82
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,560
are doing, what the user feedback is,
and if people aren't using it, taking

83
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,840
that technology and maybe pivoting it
to something that the users will use.

84
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,500
And we did that at PayPal when we
took the security side of it and

85
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,250
created a payment service on top of it,
and the same thing at YouTube.

86
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,900
And in the beginning it was not so,

87
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:33,920
the relationship with MySpace
started with just the ability for

88
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:39,350
MySpace users to embed HTML onto
their profile pages and YouTube had

89
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:45,640
an HTML snippet that you could copy and
paste and put into your MySpace profile.

90
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,940
After a while it became more of
a formal relationship because so

91
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,470
many of their users were using YouTube,
but it became almost a marriage.

92
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,800
That if YouTube went down,

93
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,970
so much of the content on MySpace
would not be available to view.

94
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:02,800
So we started actually formalizing
that relationship when we became,

95
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,510
we became aware that so many of
their users depended on our service.

96
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:12,310
I think especially early on in
a start up in a company when you

97
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,247
have very limited internal resources,
right.

98
00:06:16,247 --> 00:06:18,437
I think some of these partnerships,

99
00:06:18,437 --> 00:06:22,181
especially early on when you
don't get a lot of these invites,

100
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:26,440
a lot of people asking you to be
a partner, you get easily excited by it.

101
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,050
I do think that it's
valuable to not be overly

102
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,920
aggressive in accepting
some of these partnerships.

103
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,385
So early on at YouTube but

104
00:06:34,385 --> 00:06:38,100
sort of an example of this was,
we had a lot of people asking us for

105
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,320
white labeling the product and
just removing YouTube off the label,

106
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,620
removing sort of any references to
YouTube, and they just wanted us and

107
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:51,600
were willing to pay hundreds to
thousands of dollars for this.

108
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,850
And at that time,
that meant a lot for a YouTube.

109
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:58,940
But at the end of the day,
we always still hinged on

110
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,840
the fact that the brand name of YouTube
was very important to the product.

111
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,750
And the earlier the company I think,

112
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:12,020
the more resource starved the company,
the harder it is to make that decision.

113
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,760
But I do think that it's very
important to actually choose

114
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,370
the right partnerships that actually
will help the company in the long

115
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:24,260
run rather than just something in
the next few months or next few weeks.

116
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,230
I think that there are even a few
companies that wanted to put their own

117
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,470
video player on YouTube.

118
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,380
When I was there, we didn't allow it.

119
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,320
I think now YouTube has
accepted some of those deals.

120
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,180
But I think it's a whole
different world by this point.

121
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,520
And some of these guys, I mean they
just, it's like ABC or something,

122
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,550
there's like only one unique
creator of this content,

123
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,290
you either do it their way or
you'll never get their content.

124
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:59,080
I think it's important to
approach the question of

125
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,520
any kind of partnership or
any kind of agreement is looking at it,

126
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,590
from their perspective what they benefit
from a deal in the making with you,

127
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,510
and I think in the case of
YouTube it was always the same.

128
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,580
We didn't provide the revenue share,
really.

129
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,870
We didn't do the sort of ads early on,

130
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,500
at least when we were there prior
to the acquisition by Google.

131
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,300
So when we did these deals it was always
for marketing purposes, it was always.

132
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:30,260
Yes, prior to the acquisition of Google,
there was still

133
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,780
not a lot of ads coming in, so
there was not a lot of ad revenue, so

134
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:37,850
there was not a lot of the revenue
share that you see on YouTube.

135
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:42,558
So, what can we actually offer
the content creators out there.

136
00:08:42,558 --> 00:08:46,730
It was really still for, at that time,

137
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,220
it was really still for
short length content.

138
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:54,280
So things are 30 seconds to two and
a half minutes.

139
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,790
It wasn't for long length.

140
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:59,530
In fact, we had a rule that no content
could be longer than 10 minutes for

141
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:03,340
the large chunk of the start of YouTube.

142
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,110
And so it was for short-length content.

143
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,050
It wasn't for, so

144
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:11,630
you wouldn't upload an entire 30 minute
episode of The Daily Show or something.

145
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:14,460
You wouldn't upload
an entire two hour movie.

146
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,660
One, we didn't allow it.

147
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,750
And two, we didn't want
the platform to be seen as that.

148
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,830
It was still for short pieces of
content that was uploaded to the site.

149
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,270
So when it came to actually working
with these content creators,

150
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:29,530
we branded YouTube as a way to be able
to market your longer form content.

151
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:35,600
So it was just maybe seen as a place,
a platform to show movie trailers for

152
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,440
your movie, but you wouldn't actually
upload the entire movie onto YouTube.

153
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,910
I think that's gradually evolved and

154
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:48,100
changed over a period of time as higher
quanlity content has become possible.

155
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,200
A bandwidth of 30 getting cheaper,
people are more accustomed to watching

156
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,250
this content on multiple devices now
that YouTube actually offers and

157
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:01,080
caters to watching the same content
on multiple devices at one time.

158
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,967
But at the time during 2005 all the way
throughout 2007 it was always sort of

159
00:10:04,967 --> 00:10:07,406
short form content,
it wasn't the same quality.

160
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:12,065
And it was a way to be able to get more
people that would have not heard your

161
