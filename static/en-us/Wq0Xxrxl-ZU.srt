Great. So now, looked at this way, you can

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,540
think of the k means procedure as actually moving around

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,230
in the space and it follows one of the

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:13,030
optimization algorithms that we talked about. So here's three of

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,370
the algorithms that we talked about: hill climbing, genetic

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,060
algorithms and simulated annealing. These

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,240
are all randomized, optimization algorithms

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,010
and one of these is kind of a lot like K means so which one do you think it is?

9
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,540
>> Okay let me think about it.
