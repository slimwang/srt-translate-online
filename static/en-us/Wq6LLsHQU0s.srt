00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,719
The solution to this question 
is ListPreference.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,870
When the setting is tapped, it presents 
a list of choices as a dialogue.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,550
When the user selects an option, 
it's saved into Shared Preferences.

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,015
Here are the steps to do this.

5
00:00:12,155 --> 00:00:15,600
Within the pref_general.xml file,
we add a list preference.

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,450
We give it a title, and this maps
to the string temperature units.

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,770
We also need to give it a key
for the shared preferences,

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,200
and so we specify that to be units.

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,870
If there is no value 
in shared preferences,

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,640
then it falls back
to a default value of metric.

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,060
The preference also wants to know 
the list of all possible values here.

12
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,110
The two possible values
are metric or imperial,

13
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,170
so we pass those in as an array, 
into entry values.

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,740
Now, these are just constants 
for use within the logic of our app.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,880
These are not the user visible strings.

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,410
So we need to create entries 
which is an array of user visible strings

17
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,930
that maps to each one 
of these possible values.

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,300
To have the temperature unit preference 
show up in the settings activity,

19
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,130
we modify the on create method. 
We add this line of code

20
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,510
for the temperature units setting. 
When the user makes

21
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,209
a selection in the dialog, 
we set the preference summary

22
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:08,290
to be the new value 
of either metric or imperial.

23
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,130
Here, when we receive 
a high and low temperature,

24
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,180
we read from shared preferences
to know whether the temperature

25
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,030
should be converted 
to imperial units or left as metric.

26
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,840
Then we return the formatted string 
for display in the UI.

27
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,190
That completes the code 
for saving the temperature unit setting.
