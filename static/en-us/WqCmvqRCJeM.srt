1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
One way of solving this is the following. We check h times the step number, is the current time.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,000
If the current time is larger than or equal to 2 hours, and if we didn't fire the boost before,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
we fire the boost and then remember that we actually did fire the boost.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So next time around, the boost is not going to be fired.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You could in principle also check for equality over the time exactly equals to ours or not.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
But that's very dangerous with floating point numbers.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You may miss by a very tiny fraction when the boost is to be done,

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,000
we change the velocity by 300 m/s that is times the vector which looked somewhat crazy.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What we need is a vector of length 1 in the right direction, that is in the direction of travel.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
300 times that vector is going to provide us

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
with a vector of length 300 in the direction of travel.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So what happens to velocity? We take the existing velocity divided by it's length.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This way, we get the vector of length 1 in the direction of travel.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
300 times this vector is just the vector that we need to change the velocity vector.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
There is one more line in this solution. If we fire the rocket, we place a red dot and this is the result.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We see the orbit starting here and then the rocket boost takes us to a different orbit.
