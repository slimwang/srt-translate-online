1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,490
Here is two more examples of class rectangles describing

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,110
classes in a in a system.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,840
On the left is the rectangle class.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,860
It has two instance variables describing points.

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,876
These might be, for example, the upper left-hand corner or

6
00:00:20,876 --> 00:00:22,274
lower right-hand corner.

7
00:00:22,274 --> 00:00:27,358
The particular instance variables attributes have names p1 and p2.

8
00:00:27,358 --> 00:00:32,019
And they have types point which presumably you've also declared in

9
00:00:32,019 --> 00:00:33,170
your UML model.

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,990
In the operation section, there are three groups of operations,

11
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:42,790
each group is separated by a stereotype.

12
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:48,290
You can see the stereotypes because they

13
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,630
appear within the double angle brackets.

14
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:55,240
For example, at the top, there's a stereotype for

15
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,340
constructor, in the middle there's one for

16
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,820
query operations, and at the bottom there's one for update operations.

17
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,069
Within the, those three groups,

18
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:07,910
there's obviously going to be a constructor operation.

19
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:13,550
There's query operations for giving the area, and the aspect ratio

20
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:18,760
of the rectangle, and they're going to return real numbers.

21
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,360
Real is a primitive type within UML.

22
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,410
And at the bottom we have update operations for moving and

23
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,400
scaling the rectangle.

24
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,960
On the right is the reservation class.

25
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,290
You notice things are a little different here.

26
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,330
We don't have any attributes.

27
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,480
We begin initially with operations, and

28
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,820
then we have two additional horizontal units.

29
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,180
One for responsibilities and one for exceptions.

30
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,430
Note specifically that the words operations, responsibilities and

31
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,370
exceptions here are not part of UML.

32
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:51,540
They're just here to show you what the boxes are being used for.
