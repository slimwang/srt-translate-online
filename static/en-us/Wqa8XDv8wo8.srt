1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is all of these involve cryptography,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and the reason for that is they all involve secrets.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Let's go through each in turn.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So the first is opening a door with a mechanical key.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What's the secret there?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Well, let's look at a key.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So, the secret is actually the shape of the key.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Now that I've shown you this key,

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
there's no secret any more.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
If you can look at the ridges on the key,

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
well, you know the secret.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You can make a copy of the key

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and open whatever door this opens--

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
hopefully it's not something very important--

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
since I've just shown the key in a public video,

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and it's actually possible to do this

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
from a fairly large distance.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There was a group of students at University of California, San Diego,

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
that showed that from taking a picture

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
several hundred feet away you could learn

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
enough about a key to create a replica

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
that would open the same door.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Playing poker certainly involves secrets.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It wouldn't be much of a game if everyone

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
could see everyone else's cards.

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Logging into your Udacity account involves

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
entering an email and password,

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and I'm not going to actually type my password now,

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
because--one of the things I hope you'll start to understand from this class is--

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
even if you don't see it because of the stars here,

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
the fact that you can hear the audio of my keyboard

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
would give you a pretty big clue about what my password is

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and the number of characters.

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And--unlike the key that I showed you--

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
this protects something really important

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
so I'm not going to expose my password.

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We will talk, in one of the future units,

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
about how to manage passwords correctly.

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This involves a lot of encryption--your password is a secret--

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
but you also want to manage passwords--

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and check them--in a way that doesn't require storing those secrets.

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You don't want to store passwords in a way that could expose them easily,

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and we'll talk about that more in unit 2.

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The final option--doing a search using google.com--

45
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
is an interesting one.

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
This actually changed about a year ago--

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
whether or not that involves encryption--

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and, if you try it today, you'll note when you enter google.com

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
what happens is, you actually get redirected

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
to https://google.com and--you can see the lock in the browser--

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
this means it's using a protocol called TLS

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
to encrypt all the traffic between you and Google.

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So--both the keywords that you're typing are not exposed on the internet--

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
as well as the search results,

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and we'll talk more about that in a later unit in the class

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
that involves both asymmetric and symmetric encryption.

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
There's lots of interesting things about the protocol

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
to protect web traffic, that we'll talk about later in the class.

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So the key point is that secrets are all around us,

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
that they're very useful for solving problems,

61
00:02:33,000 --> 99:59:59,999
you're using cryptology all the time, every day.
