00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,469
Here's the state transition diagram for

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:05,310
a simple non-deterministic
Turing machine.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,860
The machine starts out in Q zero,

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:11,540
and then it can move the head to
the right upon reading a zero or a one.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,770
Or, upon reading a one,
it can transition to state Q one,

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,840
again moving the head to the right.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,620
This is the non-deterministic part.

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,200
For a given state and

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,670
symbol red, there's more than one
possible transition to follow.

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,770
In branches where this transition
is followed, the machine

11
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,870
reads one more zero one and then
expects to hit the end of the input.

12
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,800
Remember that by convention if there's
not transition specified in one of these

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,230
state diagrams, then the machine simply
moves to the reject state and halts.

14
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,790
That keeps the diagrams
from getting cluttered.

15
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:52,580
My question to you, then, is what
language does this machine recognize?

16
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,600
Check the appropriate answer.
