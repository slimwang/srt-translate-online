00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:01,810
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:05,689
In this lesson, we're going to go over
online customer acquisition techniques.

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:08,920
You can achieve many different goals
with online advertising but we'll be

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,010
focusing on customer acquisition rather
than brand awareness, for example.

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,940
>> So we're going to divide
this lesson into two parts.

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:16,870
Now in the first half,

7
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,430
we're going to talk about paid
tools to acquire new customers.

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,880
Such as SEM, programmatic media buying,
affiliate marketing,

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,080
social media marketing,
which includes video marketing.

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,990
>> Then we'll go into free
customer acquisition tools and

11
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,180
talk about engaging
with your community and

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,890
inbound marketing including content
generation and email marketing.

13
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,590
So let's get started with
some background information

14
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,370
about the three engines of growth.
