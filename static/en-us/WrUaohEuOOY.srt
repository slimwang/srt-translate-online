believed that attachment was based on how a parent interacted with the child.

3
00:00:04,793 --> 00:00:08,249
If the parent was secure and warm towards the child, then the child would have

4
00:00:08,249 --> 00:00:12,738
a secure attachment. If the parent was anxious or avoidant, then the child

5
00:00:12,738 --> 00:00:17,403
would have that same type of attachment. However, recent research shows that

6
00:00:17,403 --> 00:00:21,523
this is an over simplification. Children are born with a biologically based

7
00:00:21,523 --> 00:00:25,663
temperament. Some are really easy going, others might get distressed really

8
00:00:25,663 --> 00:00:30,106
easily. It's temperament that interacts with parenting style, and that creates

9
00:00:30,106 --> 00:00:31,620
attachment style.
