00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,098
Here are the classes that I found. Person, we know about that one. String and

2
00:00:05,098 --> 00:00:10,146
Array List, I'm not worried about those, many classes use them. System right

3
00:00:10,146 --> 00:00:14,741
here, where we have system.out. And Print Stream, that's a hard one actually,

4
00:00:14,741 --> 00:00:20,002
because the print stream class is never mentioned explicitly. One would just

5
00:00:20,002 --> 00:00:25,804
have to know that system.out is an object off the print stream class. Now, I am

6
00:00:25,804 --> 00:00:29,772
a bit bothered about that dependency, because it means that the car class can

7
00:00:29,772 --> 00:00:33,678
only work in an environment where I actually have a console, that would mean

8
00:00:33,678 --> 00:00:39,998
any computer. And these days, does your cell phone have a console, does a

9
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:45,515
toaster oven? I don't really like to build on a dependency on system.out and

10
00:00:45,515 --> 00:00:48,670
print stream if I can avoid it.
