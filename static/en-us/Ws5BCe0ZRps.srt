Okay, for this quiz, what I want you to do is simplify these fractions. You're

2
00:00:04,973 --> 00:00:09,631
going to simplify these fractions and then pair it with the image that it

3
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:15,315
matches. For example, when I reduce 6/8 I got 3/4. I would look at my images and

4
00:00:15,327 --> 00:00:20,113
then I see, oh, f, I have 1, 2, 3, out of 4. So f would be the answer for 6/8.

5
00:00:20,222 --> 00:00:22,786
You could put your answer in these boxes.
