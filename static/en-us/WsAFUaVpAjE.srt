00:00:00,102 --> 00:00:03,784
The first thing we want to do, is what's called "procedural abstraction."

2
00:00:03,784 --> 00:00:05,585
This is a really powerful idea--

3
00:00:05,585 --> 00:00:09,692
this is--one of the ways we avoid having to do things over and over again by hand,

4
00:00:09,692 --> 00:00:11,338
is that we can write the code--

5
00:00:11,338 --> 00:00:13,658
write it once, and use it many times--

6
00:00:13,658 --> 00:00:16,817
changing the inputs to get different behaviors.

7
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:18,990
If you look at each segment of code here,

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,874
these lines were copied exactly the same way.

9
00:00:22,874 --> 00:00:25,037
We did the same thing, over and over again--

10
00:00:25,037 --> 00:00:27,173
the same five lines of code--

11
00:00:27,173 --> 00:00:29,525
to find the start of a link in "page,"

12
00:00:29,525 --> 00:00:31,356
to find the start and end quote

13
00:00:31,356 --> 00:00:32,776
and then to extract the URL,

14
00:00:32,776 --> 00:00:34,975
and then to print the URL.

15
00:00:34,975 --> 00:00:37,019
The only thing that was different was the value of "page."

16
00:00:37,019 --> 00:00:38,923
We kept updating the value of "page"--

17
00:00:38,923 --> 00:00:42,604
we did that as we went through the code--

18
00:00:42,604 --> 00:00:45,116
we updated the value of "page" with this assignment

19
00:00:45,116 --> 00:00:47,793
and, before this one, we updated the value of "page"

20
00:00:47,793 --> 00:00:51,736
with this assignment.

21
00:00:51,783 --> 00:00:54,693
So, the idea behind procedural abstraction, is that

22
00:00:54,693 --> 00:00:56,885
anything that we're doing over and over again

23
00:00:56,885 --> 00:00:58,709
we want to abstract--

24
00:00:58,709 --> 00:01:00,176
we want to make it a procedure--

25
00:01:00,176 --> 00:01:02,259
and we want to make the things that change, inputs.

26
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:06,442
That means, instead of having to type in this code over and over again,

27
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:08,427
we want to make "page" an input--

28
00:01:08,442 --> 00:01:11,540
"page" is the input; that's something that changes--

29
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,008
and we want to make the URL--

30
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:17,218
that's the result we want--

31
00:01:17,218 --> 00:01:18,871
an output.

32
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:20,493
That's our goal, to turn this into a procedure,

33
00:01:20,493 --> 00:01:22,391
where "page" is the input--

34
00:01:22,391 --> 00:01:24,842
we can do the same code, over and over again,

35
00:01:24,842 --> 00:01:26,086
and every time we do it,

36
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,708
we want to get this URL value as the output.
