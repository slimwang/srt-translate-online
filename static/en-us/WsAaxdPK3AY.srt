1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,730
So an obvious question is
why are they doing it?

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,270
What's in it for them?

3
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:08,520
And I said what's in it for
them is that they monetize the data.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,490
All right, this is like walking
into a bank and stealing cash.

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,410
They're able to do it online.

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,040
So one way that this works
is that you steal data,

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,660
you sell it to somebody who's
actually able to use it.

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,680
So if you're going to
sell it to somebody.

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,080
What kind of price does it fetch you?

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,110
So we have a couple of examples.

11
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,340
The security code that you
have on your credit card.

12
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,580
Credit card number or other information
that is stored in magnetic strip.

13
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,790
Paypal/eBay account.

14
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,680
Some health information about you now
that we have electronic medical records.

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,470
Think about how much would credit
card information sell for?

16
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,050
How much would an eBay account sell for?

17
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,900
Then we'll come back and
see what those numbers look like.
