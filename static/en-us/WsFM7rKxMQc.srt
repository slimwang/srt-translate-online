00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,241
Okay, let's try to find a couple more equations of lines. For these two problems

2
00:00:04,241 --> 00:00:08,367
we're given slightly different information. For the first problem, I want to

3
00:00:08,367 --> 00:00:12,462
find the equation of a line that goes through the point 3 negative 4, that has

4
00:00:12,462 --> 00:00:16,536
the slope of 0. You can put your answer in this box. For the second problem, I

5
00:00:16,536 --> 00:00:20,568
want you to find the equation of a line that goes through the point 3 negative

6
00:00:20,568 --> 00:00:27,345
4. With undefined slope. And you can put your answer in this box. Good luck.
