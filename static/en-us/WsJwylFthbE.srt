1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,230
Let's do a quick exercise to demonstrate
the states of a media player.

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,360
But you're going to be playing
the part of the media player.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,560
So sit down for a moment and
wait for my first instruction.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,710
Now think of a song in your head and
prepare to sing it.

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:14,478
All right.
Now start singing it aloud.

6
00:00:14,478 --> 00:00:17,919
[BLANK_AUDIO]

7
00:00:17,919 --> 00:00:20,000
And pause.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,100
Now I'd like you to resume
where you left off.

9
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,448
[BLANK_AUDIO]

10
00:00:24,448 --> 00:00:26,260
And now stop!

11
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,450
And completely forget that song.

12
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,530
Now I want you to think of
an entirely different song but

13
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,780
don't sing aloud just yet.

14
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,586
Alright, start singing it now.

15
00:00:36,586 --> 00:00:39,177
[BLANK_AUDIO]

16
00:00:39,177 --> 00:00:41,720
And stop great job.

17
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,940
Take a moment, sit back and relax.

18
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,540
So why did I make you sing.

19
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,570
Well to help explain this concept.

20
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,550
So playing the audio files
within the MediaPlayer class

21
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,050
is managed via a state machine.

22
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,960
And this means that there are different
states that we can transition between

23
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,010
as the media player plays a song.

24
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:01,240
So we can draw a diagram known
as a state machine diagram

25
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,080
to help visualize the different
states the media player can be.

26
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,490
So first off is idle state, which means
that the media player object is just

27
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:12,730
sitting there Idle,
not making any sound.

28
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,350
And this is just like how you were idle,
sitting there waiting for

29
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,480
my instructions.

30
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,380
Following that is the prepared state,
meaning that the media player

31
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,480
is preparing to play a certain
audio file like a song.

32
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,960
And this is just like how you
were thinking about a song and

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,270
preparing to sing it, but
didn't make any sound just yet.

34
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,690
And then comes the Started state,

35
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:33,470
meaning that the media player is playing
a certain audio file like our song.

36
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,750
So this is similar to when you
started to sing the song aloud.

37
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,930
>> Row, row, row your boat,
gently down the stream.

38
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,640
And then comes the pause state
when you want to pause the song.

39
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,020
And this is like when
you pause your singing.

40
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,980
Now from the Paused state you can
move back to the Started state.

41
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,776
If you want to resume
the song where you left off

42
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:53,076
[MUSIC].

43
00:01:53,076 --> 00:01:55,381
Now any time you can
stop singing the song,

44
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:58,600
meaning that the media
player is in its stop state.

45
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,820
Now there's one catch.

46
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,590
Once you stop the media player,
you can't resume it again.

47
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:06,240
You need to set it up to prepare to
sing it again by specifying which song

48
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,100
you want to play.

49
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,889
So either the same or a different song.

50
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:13,310
And that's why I had you think of
a different song and prepare to sing it.

51
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,680
And then I had you sing the new song,
moving us back to the started set again.

52
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,490
>> ABCDEFG
>> As you can see, there are a number of

53
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:26,340
different states to the media player
>> Use the control how audio is played

54
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,040
back to the user.

55
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,640
And again this is referred to
as a state machine diagram.

56
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,270
We actually presented a simplified
version of the MediaPlayer life cycle

57
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,640
in order to help you understand
the big picture first.

58
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,590
Now the official documentation
page contains the complete

59
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,290
state machine diagram.

60
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,670
Which usually virtue in the future, so

61
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,220
at first I know we can
all a very overwhelming.

62
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,352
But notice that the diagram has to say,
so we talked about, so idle, prepared,

63
00:02:52,352 --> 00:02:57,000
started, paused, stopped,
and a couple other ones.

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,950
Know that it also provides details
on what media play methods

65
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,980
we can call in order to
transition between these states.

66
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,260
So feel free to take a look at
the state diagram on your own and

67
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,600
we've linked it below in the notes.
