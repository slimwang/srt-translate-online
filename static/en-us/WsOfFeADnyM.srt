1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,350
Your next task is to update the sample
app to let users see the daily special.

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:05,900
But of course,

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,070
you'll need daily specials to suit
all kinds of food preferences.

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:12,380
Vegetarian, vegan, fish only and more.

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,410
And you want diners of all nationalities
to be able to read the daily special

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,180
in their own language.

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,310
How do you code your app to offer
the right daily special and

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,810
the right language for each person?

9
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,250
According to their food preferences.

10
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,570
>> Really?

11
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,790
You want me to code like that?

12
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:35,300
>> No, you don't have to write
conditional code for every possibility.

13
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,360
You can't, anyway because who knows
what your chef is going to dream up for

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,280
the daily special next month.

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,120
Let alone tomorrow.

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,930
The good news is that using TagManager
you only have to write the code once,

17
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,700
in a straightforward way and

18
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,400
then you can use TagManager
to set the special each day.

19
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,818
You can update the value in
the dashboard whenever your chef invents

20
00:00:56,818 --> 00:01:00,960
a new, creative concoction to
offer to unsuspecting diners.

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,620
You won't need to update your app code
just because the chef switches to

22
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,200
a gingerbread garnish
instead of a honeycomb sauce.
