1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,500
Now we want to find out if this is significant. Do we really have a better

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,600
chance of climbing Mount Shasta with Summit Up guide company? Just like with

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,090
all tests, we have a null hypothesis. If there's nothing special about this

4
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,420
guide company, Summit Up, meaning they have no effect on our likelihood of a

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,910
successful summit attempt. Then we would predict our chances of success to be

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,350
the same as that for the population. That means that our null hypothesis is

7
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:33,570
basically our expected frequency. We could turn this into percents as well. If

8
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,480
our null hypothesis were true and the guide company provides no added value to

9
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,910
our likelihood of success. Then we would expect a successful outcome about 33%

10
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:49,600
of the time and an unsuccessful outcome 67% of the time. Basically the null

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,580
hypothesis states that there is no difference from our known population. Before

12
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:58,960
we continue with our example, let's explore the null hypothesis a little more

13
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,460
because it changes depending on the situation. Let's say we're asking if people

14
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,950
prefer Coke or Pepsi. What do you think our null hypothesis would be? Type in

15
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,560
the percent for each.
