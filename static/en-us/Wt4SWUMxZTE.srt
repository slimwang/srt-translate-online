00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,990
Let's take a brief moment to look at the big picture of what we've learned.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,890
Now, we've learned a whole bunch of new terms so far.

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:11,790
Under models, we've learned about observables, computed observables, and

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,620
observable arrays.

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,070
Now, we really haven't learned anything new regarding the ViewModel.

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,360
It's just our functions that we need to run sometimes.

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,290
But we definitely have learned something new about our view.

8
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,130
We've learned about bindings.

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,940
Now, just as a quick review,

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,360
our observables are the variables that we're storing in the model.

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,560
But rather than them being simple variables, we're utilizing Knockout's

12
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,040
observables functions in order to keep track of when things change.

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,700
We have computed observables, which are computed whenever they're accessed

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,700
based on the value of other variables.

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,280
Our observable arrays are very similar to observables.

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,410
We want to use those whenever we have repeating elements, such as multiple cats.

17
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:02,210
Then if you add a cat or remove a cat, Knockout will know which one changed and

18
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:04,440
it will re-render the view automatically.

19
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,650
And speaking of the view, bindings are the things that

20
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,940
tie this together with our models, via our ViewModel.

21
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:17,440
Declarative bindings are the data-bind equals blah blah blah.

22
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,580
Now that we've done this bigger picture review, let's go ahead and

23
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,790
dive into computed observables and see what they're like in practice.
