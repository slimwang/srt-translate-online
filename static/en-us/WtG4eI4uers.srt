1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:05,080
Let us use the assignment of car as the conveyance,

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,500
to illustrate how these different words get assigned to different categories,

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,090
different slots in this frame. Now,

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:18,650
we know that car was a conveyance because of the role that this preposition, by,

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,770
plays here. That is, an intelligent agent might make use of the structure of

6
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:29,000
the sentence to make sense of the story. We have designed human language in such

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,680
a way that there is a particular structure to them. Prepositions, for instance,

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,400
play a very important role. Here are some of the common prepositions: by, for,

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,770
from, to, with. Each preposition plays certain thematic roles.

10
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:47,860
By can be an, by an agent, or by a conveyance, or by a location. Similarly for

11
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,660
the other prepositions. So the moment we see by, here we know that,

12
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:57,710
whatever is going to come after by, the care can be a agent, or a conveyance, or

13
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,950
a location. Note again that the categories we are using here

14
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:05,099
are semantic categories, we are not saying noun, or verb or

15
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,110
anything like that, what we are saying here is beneficiary and duration, and

16
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:14,060
source which are semantic categories, that allow us to draw inferences. But

17
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,400
how did we know that car was a conveyance, and not an agent, or a location?

18
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,380
In general, while the structure of language does provide constraints, these

19
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,480
constraints do not always definitely determine the meaning of that particular

20
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:32,360
word. We'll use additional knowledge to find the exact meaning of the word car.
