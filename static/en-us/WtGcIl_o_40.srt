1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:07,387
Well, 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 is 10. And 10 divided by 4 is 2.5. So the mean is

2
00:00:07,387 --> 00:00:13,028
2.5, represented by Mu. This is called the expected value. Even though we don't

3
00:00:13,028 --> 00:00:18,832
really expect to get 2.5, because it's not even an option. But since that's the

4
00:00:18,832 --> 00:00:23,392
mean of our population, we expect to get somewhere around 2.5 if we take a

5
00:00:23,392 --> 00:00:25,350
sample from this population.
