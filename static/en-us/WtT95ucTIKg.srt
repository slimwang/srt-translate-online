00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,930
Let's see if we understood what the problem is with the simple barrier. If we

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:09,070
have thread zero, that creates a thread one. They both do some work. They use a

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:12,380
barrier to synchronize, and then immediately after

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,330
that, thread one ends and thread zero is

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,190
the only one that continues. Does the simple

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,460
barrier work for this code: yes, or no?
