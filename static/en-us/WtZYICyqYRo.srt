00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,031
I can look at this graph and know that the y intercept or this point, is 2. So I

2
00:00:05,031 --> 00:00:09,850
move 0 in the horizontal direction since I see that's the origin and then I

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:14,976
moved vertically up to. So our point is 0 comma 2. You might have also set the x

4
00:00:14,976 --> 00:00:19,493
value equal to 0. If you did that, you would still get y is equal to 2.
