00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
[Norvig] Another way to search is called backwards or regression search

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
in which we start at the goal.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So we take the description of the goal state.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:21,000
C1 is at JFK and C2 is at SFO, so that's the goal state.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And notice that that's the complete goal state.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's not that I left out all the other facts about the state;

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
it's that that's all that's known about the state is that these 2 propositions are true

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and all the others can be anything you want.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And now we can start searching backwards.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We can say what actions would lead to that state.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Remember in problem solving we did have that option of searching backwards.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
If there was a single goal state, we could say what other arcs are coming into that goal state.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
But here, this goal state doesn't represent a single state;

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
it represents a whole family of states with different values for all the other variables.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And so we can't just look at that,

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
but what we can do is look at the definition of possible actions that will result in this goal.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So let's look at it one at a time.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let's first look at what actions could result at C1, JFK.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We look at our action schema, and there's only 1 action schema that adds an At,

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and that would be the Unload schema.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Unload of C, P, A adds C, A.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And so what we would know is if we want to achieve this,

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:50,000
then we would have to do an Unload where the C variable would have to be C1,

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
the P variable is still unknown--it could be any plane--

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and the A variable has to be JFK.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Notice what we've done here.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We have this representation in terms of logical formula

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
that allows us to specify a goal as a set of many world states,

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and we also can use that same representation to represent an arrow here

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
not as a single action but as a set of possible actions.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So this is representing all possible actions for any plane, P,

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
of unloading cargo at the destination.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And then we can regress this state over this operator

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and now we have another representation of this state here.

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But just as this state was uncertain--not all the variables were known--

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
this state too will be uncertain.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
For example, we won't know anything about what plane, P, is involved,

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and now we continue searching backwards until we get to a state

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
where enough of the variables are filled in and where we match against the initial state.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And then we have our solution.

41
00:03:03,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We found it going backwards, but we can apply the solution going forwards.
