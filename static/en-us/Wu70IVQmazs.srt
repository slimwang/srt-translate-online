1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,920
Let's quickly talk about the high
level differences between mobile and

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:04,490
desktop VR.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,860
First, mobile VR devices
are phone based.

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,140
They use their IMU for tracking.

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,930
Because of this, mobile VR only
has three degrees of freedom.

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,100
It can only track your head's
rotation but not its position.

7
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,105
Mobile VR is untethered,

8
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:24,750
this means that there's no wire
connecting to headset to a computer.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,990
This is really nice because you
won't ever get tangled up in a cable

10
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:29,780
by using the headset.

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,352
Lastly, mobile VR less powerful
than Desktop VR in terms

12
00:00:34,352 --> 00:00:35,887
of graphics performance.

13
00:00:35,887 --> 00:00:38,710
It's small hardware
powered by a battery.

14
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,260
And so you have to optimize more
to make great looking mobile VR.

15
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,100
Let's contrast this with desktop VR.

16
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,510
On the desktop,
you get full 6DoF tracking.

17
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,260
Because the graphics processing is
happening on a desktop computer,

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,760
the headset is tethered.

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,670
This means a long cable runs
from the headset to your PC.

20
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,330
Also because a desktop computer
is running the VR software,

21
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,660
you have a lot of computing power.

22
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,420
This means that the VR simulations,

23
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,100
generally speaking,
can have higher visual quality.

24
00:01:09,165 --> 00:01:13,835
And lastly, desktop VR also sometimes
has hand controllers, the Vive and

25
00:01:13,835 --> 00:01:16,395
Oculus Touch are both examples of this.

26
00:01:16,395 --> 00:01:19,975
So those are the major differences
between the current generation of mobile

27
00:01:19,975 --> 00:01:22,185
and desktop VR systems.

28
00:01:22,185 --> 00:01:25,185
Now let's talk about the different
types of VR development platforms.
