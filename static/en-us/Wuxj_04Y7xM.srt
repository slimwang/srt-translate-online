00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,732
The vertex is at negative 5 halves, negative 1 4th. Please note that x plus 5

00:00:05,732 --> 00:00:11,283
halves is the same as x minus negative 5 halves and y plus 1 over 4 is the same

3
00:00:11,283 --> 00:00:16,096
as y minus negative 1 4th. So, that is why these are the coordinate of the

00:00:16,096 --> 00:00:16,664
vertex.
