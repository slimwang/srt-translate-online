1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,040
So the process for actually getting
an investment varies depending on

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,250
who you're taking the money from.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,170
So for example,

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,410
in places like an accelerator like
in effect it's very structured.

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,270
There is a date in which have
to submit your application.

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,750
The application there
includes many questions.

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,970
We then review the application.

8
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,630
We invite part of the companies for
interviews.

9
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,600
They come for interviews,
we decide who it is.

10
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,550
We have a date in which we announce
to them that they're in, so

11
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,820
that's very structured and very easy.

12
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,190
Which is a big benefit for

13
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,340
the company, because they know when
it starts, they know when it ends.

14
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,570
When you look at angel investors or
early stage funders,

15
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,540
it's very different.

16
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,900
The reason is that the angel investor or

17
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:41,330
the funder not have any risk constraints
on when do they need to invest.

18
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,990
And as the early stage investor,
theoretically the best thing for

19
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,520
you is to delay a little bit and
see what's going to happen next,

20
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,870
and what's going to happen next.

21
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,650
And sure if you're about
to launch something,

22
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,410
I'll be stupid to not wait and
see how does that go right?

23
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,070
Because I'm going to give you money.

24
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,240
Now that's not true of course, why?

25
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,650
Because as an investor if
you're delaying the company,

26
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:01,950
you're basically setting yourself up for

27
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:05,239
failure because as we said,
speed is the most important thing.

28
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,500
However, the outcome of this is that
the processes are very unstructured.

29
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,540
And I can tell you that
there were companies where,

30
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,880
at the end of a one hour meeting,
I told them I'm in.

31
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,270
And then we worked on the documents for
another few days and I invested.

32
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,680
And I can tell you there were companies
that took me half a year to invest.

33
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,290
Because it took me half year to cross
the chasm of believing in the team.

34
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,580
That the team is strong enough where
there's something that we call

35
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,810
here's product market fit
that everybody knows, but

36
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:39,392
there's also what's called a founder
product fit or a founder market fit.

37
00:01:39,392 --> 00:01:43,990
And so, many times it takes me a period
of time to get to know the founders,

38
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,650
to believe that they're the right
people to win this domain.

39
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,230
And many times they're great people but
they're just not the right people for

40
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:50,800
this domain.

41
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,500
So it's everything from one hour
to six months and it is for

42
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,290
the entrepreneur to manage the process.

43
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,510
That's one of the things that
entrepreneur are missing in most times,

44
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,570
in most cases.

45
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:06,950
And when I said to manage the process
clearly part of it is creating this

46
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,380
vector of movement of investors that
are starting to invest in your company.

47
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,750
Because investors at the end
of the day they're people and

48
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:18,800
as people, well most of them are people,
and as people there is the herd effect.

49
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,810
And when you hear that other
people started committing

50
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,370
it makes your life a lot easier.

51
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,860
And so as investor, you need to sort of
plan to have everything culminates to

52
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,230
people starting to invest and
then going gone and everybody investing.

53
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,220
That does include planning side
which we know that was possible.

54
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:38,109
But when I say managing the process,
the meaning is that you do not need,

55
00:02:38,109 --> 00:02:40,150
you can't let the ball drop.

56
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,530
And if you expect the investor to
be the one leading the process

57
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,450
then you're wrong because the investor
has 50 like you, that are all waiting.

58
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,090
And it's going to be the ones
that are driving the process

59
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,110
that are going to be
getting more attention.

60
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,320
And so I'm not and there is
the thin line between nagging and

61
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,170
overdoing it and
running the process properly.

62
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,820
But if you're just sitting in there
waiting for the email to come back and

63
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,890
waiting for
somebody to set up the meeting and

64
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,040
not being proactive,
you're losing on two form.

65
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,970
The first thing is that somebody
else is doing to consider getting

66
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:09,940
less attention.

67
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,610
The second thing,

68
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:15,220
your ability to present the right
character to the investor goes away.

69
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,270
And so be proactive, manage the process.

70
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:22,470
And know that by basically
getting many investors

71
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,020
to get to the decision point at the same
time you're dramatically increasing your

72
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,210
chance of raising the money you want.
