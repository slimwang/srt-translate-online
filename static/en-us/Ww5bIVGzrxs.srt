00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,465
Now let's do a question, to help summarize the

2
00:00:02,465 --> 00:00:05,120
optimizations we just talked about. Check the box if you

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,870
think the optimization given, has the merit provided in the

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,215
column. Most of these should be pretty clear. The tricky

5
00:00:12,215 --> 00:00:16,070
one is whether journaling helps improve overall performance. And it

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,650
really depends on what one considers the alternative to be.

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,740
If the alternative is leaving changes in memory for longer.

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,630
Then no, it doesn't improve performance. But if the alternative

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,920
is spending lots of seek time trying to backup in memory changes to the disk,

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,160
then obviously it does help. Let's assume the latter, so that this one is true.
