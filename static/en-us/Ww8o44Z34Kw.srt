1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,910
After you start seeing changes
in the metrics, keep testing.

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:07,110
See if you can further perfect
your offering, landing page or

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,350
messaging or
whatever it is that you're testing.

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,500
I don't want you to get discouraged
of your hypothesis was wrong.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,280
That's actually great.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,030
You learned something new.

7
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,300
You now know that's not what you need
to do to improve your business and

8
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,680
you can narrow down other options and
keep working through your list of ideas.

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,140
So let's hear from Talley,

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,410
who was proven wrong with
a hypothesis she once made.

11
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,090
>> So it's interesting,
we ran some experiments lately and

12
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,540
I'm going to say something
really controversial and

13
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,000
all the design people
are going to be outraged, but

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,030
what I found out is that the language
and the text that you use on your

15
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:49,240
landing page have tremendously
more effect than the imagery.

16
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,300
So it's interesting, right?

17
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,680
We were trying, what you really
want to get right is the message,

18
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,340
is what you're saying to
people that the product is and

19
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,000
every single product can be represented
probably in 30 different ways.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,845
So figure those out and try to find the
one sentence that resonates with your

21
00:01:05,845 --> 00:01:09,262
user, that they read the sentence and
they say, yes, this is it,

22
00:01:09,262 --> 00:01:10,558
I want to sign up for that.

23
00:01:10,558 --> 00:01:13,121
And we experimented a lot
with this language and

24
00:01:13,121 --> 00:01:17,030
we improved our conversion rate on
the home page by hundreds and hundreds

25
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:21,130
of percentages and then we did the same
with the imagery and we thought, oh,

26
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:26,060
now we'll do the imagery and it will be
another 100% increase, but not so much.

27
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,970
Once we found the right
language people just knew, oh,

28
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,820
they read it, they knew they wanted it,
and they signed up.

29
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,203
>> When you're setting up an A/B test,
one of the things you want to have in

30
00:01:34,203 --> 00:01:36,820
mind is what's the effect
you want to say.

31
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,270
Usually we will saw with
the metric we want to move.

32
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,800
So for instance, if we have a new
product like voice messaging and

33
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,048
we want more people to put use it,
we can assign a test group and

34
00:01:47,048 --> 00:01:51,300
a control group where we advertise
more heavily to the test group, and

35
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:56,010
see how the product is used
differently by the testing control.

36
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,370
The first step to diagnosing any
problem that you see in your data

37
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,430
is cutting it by different dimensions.

38
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,557
So a dimension can be
pretty much anything.

39
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:07,391
It can be country, if you have
an app that's out internationally,

40
00:02:07,391 --> 00:02:11,494
it can be by platform if you have out
on Android and iOS and by anything else

41
00:02:11,494 --> 00:02:16,300
that you know about your users that you
can use to try and isolate the issue.

42
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:21,080
If for example, your app is aBarkment
and you suddenly see that the number

43
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,590
of postings that are going up onto
your site have dropped really heavily,

44
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:31,060
you could then cut that by the different
interfaces that people can post from.

45
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,070
So you can look at the number of
posts which are coming from iOS,

46
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,220
from Android, and
from your desktop site.

47
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,356
If you see that one of those
is the one that's dropping,

48
00:02:40,356 --> 00:02:44,435
you can then look in the code and
see if you have a problem with your.

49
00:02:44,435 --> 00:02:48,152
An important thing to look out for when
doing an A/B test is to make sure that

50
00:02:48,152 --> 00:02:51,456
you have enough people going into
either side of your experiment,

51
00:02:51,456 --> 00:02:55,114
that you can be confident that the
result that you're seeing is real, and

52
00:02:55,114 --> 00:02:56,900
not just a result of random chance.

53
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:02,240
If you Google for
A/B test significance calculator,

54
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,890
you can actually get free on line tools
where you can put in the number of

55
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,100
people going through your experiment and
the number of people successfully

56
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,200
completing whatever objective it is you
have in mind and it can tell you what's

57
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,620
called a confidence interval and in
the industry normally, we look at a p95.

58
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,020
And that means for any result that
you see, you can be 95% sure that

59
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:26,020
the experiment is really giving the
result and it's not just random chance.

60
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,550
And also when you found out which one
of your experience is the better one,

61
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:33,040
you can actually roll out that
new user experience to everyone.

62
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,210
You can do it without having to go
through a new App Store submission,

63
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,750
either through the Play Store or
the App Store.
