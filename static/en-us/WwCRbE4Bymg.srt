00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,680
If we were talking about using the viter, visitor pattern inside a compiler,

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,680
then the concrete visitors might one might do type checking,

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,700
one might do pre-printing, and so on.

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,590
And, the concrete elements might correspond to

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,200
things like assignment statements, or declarations, or other parts of the Code.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,100
The object structure class, itself, represents the parse tree as a whole, and

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,610
is your starting point for doing the navigation through the structure.
