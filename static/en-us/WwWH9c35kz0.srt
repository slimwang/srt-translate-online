1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Yes, 0.4 is the product of these two values over here.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So, in reality the solution is just to apply the product p1 * p2,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and hitting the 1 button gives me indeed 0.4.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I can now go and change this probability to 0.1 and 0.8.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You probably already figured out that the answer is now 0.08,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and indeed, my code gives me the following result, 0.08.
