1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,410
Next we're going to be speaking with
John Kansky, the interim president and

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,290
CEO of
the Indiana Health Information Exchange.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,000
Well, John, I want to thank you for

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,480
taking the time to be
with us this morning and

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,580
to help the students learn more about
the Indiana Health Information Exchange.

6
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,865
They're already aware of the challenges,
the financial challenges,

7
00:00:21,865 --> 00:00:26,360
the sustainability challenges faced
by health information exchanges.

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,910
As you look around the country,
where do you think we are on that?

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:30,760
>> I, yeah thanks, Mark.

10
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,150
The sustainability has
long been discussed and

11
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,950
debated as a key part of health
information exchange and

12
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,590
I think it's helpful to view that in
terms of the three types of health

13
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:50,000
information exchanges that have
merged in the marketplace.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,570
There are a number of state run
exchanges run by their respective state

15
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,370
governments, largely funded by
our recent era high tech funding.

16
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:04,970
There are private or proprietary
exchanges that are run by and

17
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:09,360
controlled by single organization like
a large health system for example.

18
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,470
And then there's the type of exchange
which I think most of us have been

19
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,550
thinking about for a number of years,
and the type of exchange that we

20
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:21,180
are in Indiana which I call a regional
inter-organization exchange.

21
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,320
We have to sustain
ourselves by delivering

22
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,570
services that our customers
value in exchange for fees, and

23
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:33,200
making sure that those fees, the revenue
from those fees exceed our expenses.

24
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,630
The other two types of exchanges,
the state run and

25
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:40,530
the proprietary,in some cases have
the opportunity to be sustained by their

26
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,840
sort of parent organizations.

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,960
If the state government chooses
to levy attacks or generate or

28
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,570
provide dollars from the general
fund of the state government,

29
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,210
they really don't have
a sustainability challenge.

30
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,870
And in the case of the proprietary or
private exchange,

31
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:01,380
they're sort of sustained at the whim
of the organization that runs it, so

32
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,610
I feel that question is most
interesting for the region exchanges.

33
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:11,160
And again, we really have to run
ourselves like a business or

34
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,230
despite the fact that many of us
are not for profit organizations,

35
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:18,590
you need to be very conscious of
having revenue in excess of expenses.

36
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,220
The way to do that is to focus
on services that your customers

37
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,070
value enough to pay for.

38
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:28,460
It sounds fairly mundane and it sounds
more like a business class than

39
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:33,870
informatics, but it's very important for
HIEs to remember to sustain themselves.

40
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,630
>> The students are familiar with what

41
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,240
IHIE does thanks to some examples
that you sent before the class.

42
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,390
Let's take a moment and look at
what it takes to do those things.

43
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,260
Can you tell us a bit about
the IHIE organization?

44
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,610
>> Sure, absolutely.

45
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:57,120
And again, stressing that our, we're not
affiliated with the state government,

46
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,800
but certainly have a good
relationship with them.

47
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,750
We're a non-for-profit
501 C3 organization.

48
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,370
We have a board of health care

49
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:08,520
stakeholders from across the state
including many of our large customers.

50
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,120
We have a governance body which
is extraordinarily important.

51
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,440
Which governs the data
use of our data and

52
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,820
allows, it provides for
confidence between competing

53
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:30,260
organizations to share their data and
have it used for our services.

54
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,700
And the structure of our organization,

55
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:38,060
we're about 54 people separated
into three management stacks.

56
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,510
One which is software and
product development,

57
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,940
one which is all the customer
facing functions like support,

58
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:50,380
implementation and customer relationship
management and product strategy.

59
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,880
And then finally a third stack which
is largely IT infrastructure and

60
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,749
administrative function.

61
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,298
>> At the heart of all this, of course,

62
00:03:59,298 --> 00:04:04,740
is this normalized,
curated database of clinical information

63
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:09,650
that you've accumulated from the many
different kinds and varieties and

64
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:14,560
brands of EMRs that I'm sure in
use across the state of Indiana.

65
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,720
How do you do that?

66
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,100
How do you bring all that
together into something that for

67
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,050
example can create the Indiana
network for patient care.

68
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,510
Which makes every patient look as though
they have a single record even though

69
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,800
that date may be,
may exist in many different EMRs.

70
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,550
>> So how we do that is through
many real time interfaces.

71
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,500
And an ongoing task of
what we call data mapping,

72
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,130
which a little bit more specifically
is semantic normalization of the data.

73
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:51,100
The best way to explain that, that I've
found, is that we like to say that

74
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,760
one organization will send
us their data in Italian.

75
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,700
Another organization
sends it in Portuguese.

76
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,910
Another organization
will send it in German.

77
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,250
We translate everything to Latin,
so that we can combine it into that

78
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:07,300
virtual patient, single patient record,
that you referenced.

79
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,220
That gives us the ability, which is
really the key for our past, present and

80
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,650
the future that we're
going to be able to deliver.

81
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:19,300
That gives you the ability to look at
a patient's record at the point of care

82
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:24,930
as if it came from one place, even
though the data came from many places.

83
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,830
It also gives you the opportunity
to analyze across a population or

84
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:35,960
to manage the health of a population
using data, knowing that you

85
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:41,750
have the complete view of that
population, patient by patient.

86
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,520
It is very expensive.

87
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,170
I want to acknowledge that.

88
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:49,470
To put the labor into normalizing
the data and maintaining the interfaces

89
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,620
which gets back to that
question of sustainability and

90
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,000
having to work very hard to make sure
you're delivering value to customers

91
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,280
to cover the cost of that semantically
normalized system of repositories.

92
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,880
>> Well, that's very interesting.

93
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,020
I've used you as the primary example
of centralized HIE in the course.

94
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,698
Does IHIE see a role for some of
the newer technologies designed for

95
00:06:13,698 --> 00:06:15,520
a federated environment?

96
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,920
Technologies such as Direct,
RESTful APIs and more recently Fire.

97
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,990
>> Sure.
Let me start by commenting that we

98
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:28,270
describe ourselves as a centrally
managed federated structure.

99
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,570
Meaning our repositories,
the data in our repositories,

100
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,800
continues to be owned and

101
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,080
legally controlled by the organizations
that provide the data to us.

102
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,530
It's not our data.

103
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,670
But it is centrally managed in a single

104
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,780
data center which gives us
the best of both worlds.

105
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,740
We have the performance of a centrally
managed structure with the governance

106
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:56,350
advantages and comfort of the providers
knowing that it's federated.

107
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,930
But that's not the question
that you asked.

108
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:03,690
So, let me comment on some of the newer,
emerging standards.

109
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:09,370
This is a very practical answer because
HIEs have to be practical organizations.

110
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,580
We can only base our services on
what's available in the marketplace.

111
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,690
So using Direct as an example, Direct
is one of the newer standards that's

112
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:21,590
finding its way driven by meaningful
use into the marketplace.

113
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:26,060
And to that extent, we are providing
services based on Direct.

114
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:32,190
Some of the other standards that
are still evolving, we pay attention to.

115
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,740
We study, we try to anticipate.

116
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:39,220
We try and participate at a federal
level in learning about and

117
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:45,120
influencing those standards but
we of necessity to sustain ourselves,

118
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,780
base our services only on those
that are in the marketplace and

119
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:53,480
to an extent Direct is
emerging as a useful standard.

120
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,780
>> Well, thank you.

121
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,730
And to conclude, as you look
toward the future, all right.

122
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:05,750
Can you tell us what additional services
or directions you see IHIE going?

123
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,640
>> Certainly, and this is an interesting
area for us because you always have to

124
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:14,480
be responsive to what your
customers are looking for next and

125
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,830
what In our business what
the government is steering towards.

126
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,410
So, I took a couple of notes of
things that I thought might be worth

127
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,380
highlighting.

128
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:27,110
For example, one of the things
we have done in the past, but

129
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,010
we know we're going to
be doing a lot more of.

130
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:33,265
And, I wanted to stress, because,
I don't believe there are many, if any,

131
00:08:33,265 --> 00:08:38,390
other HIEs doing this is
that we are increasingly

132
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:42,500
able to put structured data from our

133
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:47,260
repository system into the EHR's in
response to some clinical event.

134
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,170
So for example,

135
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:52,730
say a patient shows up at the emergency
department of a hospital.

136
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,480
We're able to take data from
the repository corresponding to that

137
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,040
patient, matching them with
their identity on the fly and

138
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,920
send that data, which comes from many,

139
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,750
many other sources outside the
enterprise where they just presented,

140
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:13,270
and deposit that data electronically
in the EHR at that facility.

141
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:16,110
That's something we've only
accomplished with a couple

142
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,500
of different organizations
in our customer base and

143
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,740
it's been those that have been somewhat
more sophisticated in terms of their IT.

144
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,880
But I definitely see things going
that way, if for no other reason than

145
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,210
we don't want physicians, clinicians to
be pulled out of their native EHR, but

146
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,849
still need to be able to view data
from outside the organization.

147
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,970
One more example well,
I'll give two quickly.

148
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:46,190
Medication data is something
that's in great demand and

149
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,130
high value at the point of care.

150
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:54,169
We're working hard to increase the
amount and make it more comprehensive.

151
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,700
In terms of the data that we can
make available at the point of care,

152
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,492
we've always done that but it's a very
difficult thing to try to aggregate.

153
00:10:02,492 --> 00:10:08,000
It's worth noting that that even means
working with the state legislature

154
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,200
in Indiana to sometimes influence policy
to make the data more available and

155
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,740
remove obstacles.

156
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,050
The last thing that is,
I think, worth noting,

157
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:22,660
is analytics is a word that is thrown
around quite a bit these days,

158
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,960
almost to the point that it loses
its meaning without being defined.

159
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,140
There's a lot of things
in that category.

160
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,700
We've already tried a couple of
things in the analytics space,

161
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,730
with mixed success and
it's a great question I think for

162
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:39,380
HIEs whether the marketplace
is going to expect them to

163
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,680
analyze the data that they
are able to acquire and aggregate.

164
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,710
Or whether the market is expecting
them only to provide the data and

165
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,200
not necessarily the analysis.

166
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,500
I think that's an open question.

167
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,330
>> Well John, this has been
a fascinating conversation.

168
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,910
IHIE is something that anyone
interested in health informatics

169
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,430
needs to know about and
needs to follow and I

170
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:07,630
appreciate your taking the time today to
help the students understand it better.

171
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,300
>> Happy to do it.

172
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:08,800
Thank you.
