00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,110
So, as you dive into the code of SVMs,

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,160
it is a piece of software that truly ignores outliers.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,000
So, just to practice this, in this example over here of red data and

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,580
blue data, where there seems to be exactly an outlier,

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,780
say you're willing to ignore an outlier.

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,290
Which separated line would you pick?

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:19,560
Just choose one of the three
