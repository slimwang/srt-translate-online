00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,080
So here's a quick quiz just to make sure that you got it.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,100
Suppose this red line is the principal component.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,109
It's our new neighborhood quality feature.

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,120
Of course, that's kind of a meaning that we ascribe to it.

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,750
mathematically, it's just defined as the definition of maximum variance.

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:15,620
And the question is,

7
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,940
once we project down all our data points onto this principal component,

8
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,660
what is the data distribution that we get for our new feature?

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,160
So, click the box that looks right to you.
