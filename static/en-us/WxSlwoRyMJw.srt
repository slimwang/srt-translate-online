>> Sometimes the equation isn't as easy to work with. Here this isn't in slope

00:00:03,772 --> 00:00:07,862
intercept form. I don't have y equals mx plus b. This one's actually in standard

3
00:00:07,862 --> 00:00:11,654
form. So we want to change it into slope intercept form so we can more easily

4
00:00:11,654 --> 00:00:15,618
graph it. If we don't want to create a table to graph this equation, then we can

5
00:00:15,618 --> 00:00:19,745
convert it to slope intercept form. If I subtract x from both sides I get

6
00:00:19,745 --> 00:00:24,459
negative 2 y equals 4 minus x. Im going to rearrange these terms so the x term

7
00:00:24,459 --> 00:00:29,151
comes first. So I have negative x first and then positive 4 right after it.

8
00:00:29,151 --> 00:00:33,966
Finally, to solve for y, we divide each term by negative 2, this isolates y.

9
00:00:33,966 --> 00:00:38,996
Remember this is a negative 1 as the coefficient in front of x. When we simplify

10
00:00:38,996 --> 00:00:43,154
this we have positive 1 half x minus 2, 4 divided by negative 2 makes negative

11
00:00:43,154 --> 00:00:49,202
2. Here's an equation we're familiar with. There's our y intercepts, our b, and

12
00:00:49,202 --> 00:00:54,163
there's our slope, our m 1/2. We can just graph this like before.
