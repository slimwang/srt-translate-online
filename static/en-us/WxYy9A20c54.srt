Hi and
welcome to educational technology.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,660
My name is David Joyner and
I'm thrilled to bring you this course.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,320
When we started this
program back in 2014,

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,200
I would have wondered if a course
like this was actually possible.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,590
Most of our online courses
are built around their lectures.

6
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:13,650
And while conversations and

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,440
discussions do happen, they usually
aren't foundational to the course.

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,020
But when this course is taught on
campus, there are no lectures.

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,640
It's all discussions, conversations,
activities, project presentations.

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,160
There's nothing really that we can
pre-prepare, and so I would have

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,420
wondered if a course like this would
translate to the online environment.

12
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:28,992
And, in fact,

13
00:00:28,992 --> 00:00:31,990
that was one of the main criticisms
that some people had of this program.

14
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,740
People said that you can't have a real
Master's program without a lot of

15
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,800
interaction between teachers and
students, but

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,280
you can't have that interaction online.

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:38,830
And so

18
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,710
they wondered if you could actually have
an effective online Master's program.

19
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,720
But then we started to actually
deliver our courses and

20
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,340
we found something interesting.

21
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,950
Not only could we have discussions
online that were as good as we have in

22
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,170
person, but
oftentimes they were actually better.

23
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:55,140
The structure of the online interface
gave students a lot of power to propose

24
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,620
and guide their own discussions,

25
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,750
and students responded to that ownership
by really making the classes better.

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,972
So it's really because of you
all that this class is here.

27
00:01:02,972 --> 00:01:06,920
You all showed us that we could have
a class like this in an online program.

28
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,520
In this class, we're going to try and
push that envelope even further.

29
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,080
We're going to try and

30
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,400
build an entire class around those kinds
of interactions and conversations and

31
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,720
discussions without any
pre-prepared lecture material.

32
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,010
We're going to build the entire class
around a project to really try and

33
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,525
build something that's
a useful contribution to

34
00:01:21,525 --> 00:01:22,950
the educational technology field.

35
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,070
We're looking forward to
seeing what you come up with.

36
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,680
And we're really excited to get started.
