00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,707
First off, let's look at a typical method call. As you know, all the way on the

2
00:00:04,707 --> 00:00:11,310
left is the object, on which the method is called. Next comes the name of the

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:17,740
method. And the values, that we supply to the method, are called the arguments.

4
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:22,600
That's just a technical term. This particular method call is called with the

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,140
arguments 20 and 0. Let's have a look at another method call, again here is the

6
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,940
object, the method name. This particular method call has no arguments, there's

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,550
just nothing between the two parenthesis. But this method call returns an

8
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:43,510
answer, it returns the number of pixels in the picture. That answer, or as we

9
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:48,150
say, that return value, is then stored in the variable that you see on the

10
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:52,980
left. What about the method call up here? This method call has no return value,

11
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,620
it simply, carries out an action, namely to grow the picture.
