1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,610
So let me reiterate here again what to expect from this class,

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:07,170
why you should be taking it, and what I am expecting out of this class.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,620
And well actually, more importantly, the topics I'm covering and

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:10,960
the goals of this class.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,140
So one thing of the offset, I want to make sure it's clear to everyone.

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,070
This is not a photography class.

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,820
What that means is I'm not going to be teaching you the basics of how to

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,610
take pictures or also to take good pictures.

9
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,282
I, personally, am a photographer.

10
00:00:25,282 --> 00:00:27,890
Hopefully, I'll share with you all of the kinds of different things I

11
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,050
have done in the area of photography.

12
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:35,120
But, I have an amazing job where I can actually also work in the field that

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,390
I actually am also a hobbyist in.

14
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,500
I take photography for, as a hobby, but I really want to kind of

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,260
spend time also on the technology related questions associated with photography.

16
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,440
So this class is really about the technology related content.

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,880
You will learn about the back end technology.

18
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,740
We open the black boxes of cameras and other types of image analysis softwares.

19
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,810
Again take a very computation driven effort through it.

20
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:07,660
Now, I do argue that learning about what's behind the tools that

21
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:11,640
you use may actually help you bec, become a better photographer.

22
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,670
But, that's a, not a direct, you know, prerequisite of this class.

23
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,980
If you are taking pictures already you may enjoy this class a lot more because

24
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,580
you'll learn more about the technology behind it.

25
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,780
But, more importantly if you don't know anything about photography,

26
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,530
this won't teach you much about photography.

27
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,240
But, it'll teach you about the cameras that you use, and the tools you use,

28
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,510
and you know, some may argue that might make you a better photographer.

29
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,050
This is also a hands-on class.

30
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,530
So you will learn by doing things yourselves.

31
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,330
So, that's important too.

32
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,490
Many people have asked questions like,

33
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,670
oh, I'm not really comfortable with a lot of programming.

34
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:49,040
Well, this class will get into a little bit of programming.

35
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,170
Or quite a bit.

36
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:53,220
And you will need to know some of the tools that require you to actually

37
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,230
manipulate images using simple programs.

38
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,520
So I do want everybody to be aware of that.

39
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,090
At one point,

40
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,790
you will learn by doing by yourself, and with the class you will share things.

41
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,950
As I said, we have homework assignments, and peer feedback assignments,

42
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:10,590
to just kind of keep things interesting, and also learning from each other,

43
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,810
while learning from the content and the material shared with you.

44
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,520
So, to summarize this class is going to be an interesting class where we're

45
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,550
going to learn about the technology aspects of photography.

46
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,470
Computational photography's are a discipline of its own.

47
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,100
We're going to cover our ideal ways to introduce to

48
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,850
you the concepts of computational photography.

49
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,880
You will learn by doing things and you will hopefully have fun and

50
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,330
the tag line that I love to share with this class all the time is you will

51
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,540
learn to have fun computing with photographs.

52
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,700
So that's the goal and hopefully you'll have fun doing it.

53
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,200
Thank you.
