1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So we've seen several different strategies

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
and we've compared them and tried to find one that was better,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and we could keep doing that, trying to improve and make

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
a strategy better and better, but what if we could make a leap?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Instead of incrementally coming up with a slightly better strategy,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
would it be possible to leap to the best strategy?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
To make it sound more mathematical, we can call it the optimal strategy.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Can we do that and what would it even mean?

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
On the surface it's not exactly clear.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
When we did search, we didn't know what our first action was.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We started out in some state and we knew there were

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
several different states we could go to, and from there,

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
there were other states we could go to.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
All we knew is that we were trying to arrive at some goal location.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
But we knew if we just specified how the domain works,

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
how you get from one state to the next,

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and if we specified an algorithm that found the best path,

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
the shortest path, or the least cost path, that eventually,

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
by applying that algorithm to that description of the world,

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
we would arrive at the best possible solution.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So maybe we can do the same thing here.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Even though we're dealing with uncertainty,

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
maybe we can still define what the world looks like

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and discover the optimal solution.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So when we were doing search, it was always sort of

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
one agent doing the searching, so let's call that "me,"

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and what am I looking for?

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Am I looking for the best path or the worst path?

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Well, obviously, we're looking for the best path and

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
we can describe that and once we've got that description

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
we've got to search it outward.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Now we've gone beyond search in two ways.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The most obvious is we're dealing with probability,

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
so we've got dice or whatever other random element there is,

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and then in addition to that, for the big game,

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
we introduced another complication, which is our opponent.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And now this question of what each of these three are trying to do,

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and I want you to tell me, is our opponent trying to get the best,

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and that means best score for "me," or is the opponent trying

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
to get the worst score for "me," assuming we're diametrically opposed.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So the worst score for "me" would be the best score for the opponent,

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
or is the opponent trying to come up with the outcome that is average?

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And tell me the same for the dice.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Is the dice with "me" in trying to get the best result for "me?"

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Is the dice plotting against "me" in trying to get the worst result for "me?"

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Or is the dice going to average out?

47
00:02:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
