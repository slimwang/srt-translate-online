1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,980
That was back in the late 90's, and

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:06,050
what was really cool was this holistic
notion of, of the human motion.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,830
We also didn't have a large database.

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,150
You have a small number of,
of examples, so

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,060
it's not sort of the large
discriminative database learning kind of

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,650
stuff that goes on in
action recognition now.

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,572
What we're going to do next time is,

8
00:00:19,572 --> 00:00:21,940
we're going to take a look at
a different approach that takes some,

9
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,350
look at, looks at videos as a time
series, time series analysis.

10
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,690
And just some basic
approach to doing that.

11
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,610
And again, this will be something where
much like the SVM's that we just talked

12
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,910
about, we said we can only give
you a sm, small taste of it, and

13
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,685
if you want to know about it, you should
take the course in machine learning.

14
00:00:38,685 --> 00:00:43,090
We're going to show you a very simple
notion of a form of a graphical

15
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,550
model approach to doing
action recognition, and

16
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,260
if you want to do more that that,
again, you'll take machine learning.

17
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,670
But that's what we're
going to do next time.
