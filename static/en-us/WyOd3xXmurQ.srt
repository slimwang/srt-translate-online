1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,630
So today I showed you a variety
of fun and interesting things.

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:06,470
You will also have, exposure to them in
an assignment that we are going to have

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:07,600
on exactly the topic.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,040
So, basically taking a bunch of
pictures and generating panoramas and

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,610
other types of artifacts
like Photosynth.

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,670
The whole purpose of this is, of course,
ho we can use photos to show space or

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,610
environments.

8
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:22,370
We can imagine this has value in
real estate and in architecture,

9
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,000
and all that kind of stuff,
beyond tourism.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,280
We talked a little bit about
the whole concept of photo tourism.

11
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,090
That is,
somebody took a bunch of pictures.

12
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,030
How can we actually tour that site
without actually going there?

13
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,060
Of course, it's always fun to go there.

14
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,690
Photosynth and
also something we looked at in detail.

15
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,820
And I just kind of touched on
the whole concept of street views.

16
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,730
Again, it's building on a whole lot of
concepts that we have looked at already.

17
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:47,560
Lot of detail, again, refer back to
the original paper by Noah Snavely,

18
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,190
Steve Seitz, Richard Szeliski.

19
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:52,890
There's a newer paper by the Google
folks on the photo tours,

20
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,500
which is running on Google right now.

21
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,990
There are many other similar
examples that are out there.

22
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,540
I encourage you to look for
them and post them in Piazza.

23
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,390
And of course, the Szeliski book
also has more details on this.

24
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,162
One thing I also recommend
when you are actually on the,

25
00:01:06,162 --> 00:01:09,800
photo tour site is you will actually
see examples of additional work.

26
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,555
For example, building Rome in a day,
where a bunch of pictures that are taken

27
00:01:14,555 --> 00:01:19,110
of the city of Rome, how they can be
used to actually model the whole city.

28
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,060
That's the kind of stuff that both
is being done for more targeted,

29
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:26,300
you know move your own car with a bunch
of different cameras in the city, or

30
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:31,220
have more citizen-generated imagery
to generate, models of cities.

31
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,560
There is another paper also referred
to as Building Rome On a Cloudless Day,

32
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,220
which basically does, attempt to do the
same kinds of reconstruction of cities

33
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,360
like Rome, but with less computation.

34
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,610
That is, lack of a cloud,
computer cloud, that is.

35
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,280
Again, loads of stuff on this one.

36
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,220
We'll discuss this on
Piazza as much as we want.

37
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:49,980
But hopefully,

38
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,580
I hope you have enjoyed all
the concepts of your coverage so far.
