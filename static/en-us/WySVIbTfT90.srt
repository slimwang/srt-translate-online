00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,270
Now that I have a login and
disconnect function,

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,740
I'm going to add the following
code to my header template.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,670
Now a link to login appears
if the user is logged out.

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,730
And a link to disconnect appears
if the user is logged in.

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,690
Whew.
Well that was a lot of code, but

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,030
let's see how it looks now.

7
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,370
I'll fire up my server and
visit my restaurants page one more time.

8
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:21,250
Now when I login, I have the option to
login with Facebook or with Google.

9
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,560
And logging out is just
a simple click of a button.

10
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,830
Pages that don't belong
to me I cannot edit.

11
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,950
But if I'm logged in and I'm the owner
of a page, I do have the editing option.

12
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,340
