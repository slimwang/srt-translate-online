00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,840
Earlier I showed you how to
create a new textView and

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,939
then call a method to
change the text on it.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:07,800
What if I want to change the text size?

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,400
I can just call textView.setTextSize and
hit Enter.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,803
And then just pick
a random value like 56.

6
00:00:17,803 --> 00:00:21,310
And then I can run it on my device.

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:23,700
And this is what it looks like.

8
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:25,790
Wow, that's big.

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,498
Then I can change
the text color as well.

10
00:00:27,498 --> 00:00:34,040
I can do textView.settextcolor and
then pass in a color.

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,390
I showed you the possible
colors earlier.

12
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,090
So let me just pick one like green.

13
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,223
When I run this on the device,
it shows up in neon green.

14
00:00:43,223 --> 00:00:46,028
If you look through
the textView documentation,

15
00:00:46,028 --> 00:00:49,550
you may have found other
methods you can call.

16
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,260
For example,
you can call textView.setMaxLines.

17
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:57,590
This limits the number of the lines that
the text view shows to only two lines.

18
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,930
If the text is longer than that,
then it just gets cut off.

19
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,070
To test this,
we'll need a really long string here.

20
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:07,660
And, actually, in order to know
whether this is working properly,

21
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,910
I should comment this out first.

22
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:13,360
I'm going to run the app to make sure
that this string is actually longer than

23
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,390
two lines of text.

24
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,810
Okay, we verified that it's actually
two and a half lines of text.

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,180
Once I uncomment this line of code
to set the max line limit to 2 then

26
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,680
when I run the app then it should
truncate this to two lines here.

27
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,880
And it does, cool.

28
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,480
So hopefully you got some good practice
in with calling methods on an object

29
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,100
like textView.

30
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,060
It's actually uncommon to
call a setContentView and

31
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,820
then pass in a single view like this.

32
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,990
Normally the content view of your
activity will be a lot more complex.

33
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,230
And so that's why we would normally
leave it as setContentView and

34
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,490
then passing in the resource
ID of an XML layout.
