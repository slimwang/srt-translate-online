1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,120
>> So, let's recap lesson one. Our task, was to learn what

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:09,520
is user experience? And the steps we followed were, we defined user

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,910
experience and we gave you a super-awesome example and demonstrated how a

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,370
need for speed and portions is a really great example of user-experience.

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:22,610
>> That was my favorite step. Yes. And the second step was we disambiguated

6
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:26,472
UI from UX. We talked a little bit about the difference between visual and

7
00:00:26,472 --> 00:00:29,680
non-visual code. We also gave you two really great

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,150
examples of how to improve your apps user experience today,

9
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,250
with the sign in and check out flow. And we

10
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,250
also touched on Lowe's wire framing, which is a really

11
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,985
great technique for starting at the high level and not

12
00:00:41,985 --> 00:00:46,445
focusing on the details to start with. So in Lesson

13
00:00:46,445 --> 00:00:49,010
two, you're going to learn how to make applications that people

14
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,170
love to use, by focusing in on your end user.

15
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,910
But before we get into lesson two, you're

16
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,460
going to watch some interviews from some real users.

17
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,840
>> Yeah, and as you're watching these videos

18
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,360
of real users actually interact with applications, make

19
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,240
a note of what makes them unhappy, and

20
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,020
what makes them happy, in, in these applications.

21
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,680
>> And also make a mental note of whether the

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,990
things they mention are related to visual or non-visual code.
