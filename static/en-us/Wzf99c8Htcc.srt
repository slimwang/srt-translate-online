1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,300
Suppose I know something about the
motion, the, the geometry of the points.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,410
For example,
let's suppose that I'm on some plane.

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,620
All my points are on a plane.

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:10,960
Here's my equation of a plane.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,390
So, all my points, X, Y,
and Z sa satisfy this.

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,624
Remember, we showed this before when
were mapping everything on a plane and

7
00:00:17,624 --> 00:00:19,000
saying how it would've moved.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,636
We ended up with a 3 by 3 matrix,
but it was a homogeneous system, so

9
00:00:22,636 --> 00:00:24,820
we could scale it any way we wanted.

10
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,520
So if we wanted to, we could set
one of those elements to a 1,

11
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,640
and then we only had to solve for
the other eight.

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,290
There were eight unknowns, so therefore
we needed how many points, Megan?

13
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:32,840
How many points?

14
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,630
How many point?

15
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,880
Four points.

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,220
Here is the, the equation,
using just the X Y values,

17
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,301
and you'll see, a1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

18
00:00:43,301 --> 00:00:48,450
8, eight point, eight unknowns, four
points needed, so when it's on a plane.

19
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,080
Now, if it, plane is very,
very far away, what does that mean?

20
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:58,490
Well, what it means is if the difference
in the distance on the plane is small,

21
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,850
compared to the distance from
the plane to the camera.

22
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,130
You can show that this is
the simplified model, right?

23
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:11,250
It's just six unknowns,
otherwise know as an affine transform.

24
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,090
This is one of the reasons that
affine transforms are used so much.

25
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,190
When things are on a plane,

26
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,180
on a wall, on the floor, even on maybe,
front of a body, for awhile.

27
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,900
Mine used to be more
planar than it is now.

28
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:27,080
For small amounts of motion,

29
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,210
you can think of this being as
a plane that's relatively far away.

30
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,650
And what that means is that this,

31
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,280
that that plane will undergo
an affine transformation.
