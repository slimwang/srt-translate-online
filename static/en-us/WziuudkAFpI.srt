00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,949
Thinking back to what our variables x and y stand for, x is the number of

2
00:00:04,961 --> 00:00:10,107
gallons of solution that Grant will buy, and y is how much it's going to cost

3
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:15,496
him to buy that much. If we fix the amount that Grant's going to spend, at $850,

4
00:00:15,611 --> 00:00:21,638
what that really means is fixing our y value at 850. So, the line we need is

5
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:30,346
just y equals 850. Let's graph that. And here is our lovely horizontal line.
