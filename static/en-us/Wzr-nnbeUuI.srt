00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,420
There are many ways of doing this, here is one that I think is fairly simple.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,031
Let's look at the inner loop first. So we want to go through all of the cars

3
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:12,605
and drive them. And we want to keep doing that until all of the cars have

4
00:00:12,605 --> 00:00:17,362
reached their destination and that's the challenging part. All of the cars

5
00:00:17,362 --> 00:00:21,390
started at location zero and then they moved to location one. And now maybe

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,530
this one here doesn't need to go any further. And I need to, have to have some

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,974
way of stopping this car from moving. So what I'm simply going to do is I'm

8
00:00:29,974 --> 00:00:34,036
going to remove him from the list of cars. So that's the part here. If this car

9
00:00:34,036 --> 00:00:37,815
has arrived, then I'll just remove that car. And remember, when I remove an

10
00:00:37,815 --> 00:00:42,100
element from the array list, then I don't reccomend the index. But I do it over

11
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,680
here. And I keep doing that while I have cars to drive.
