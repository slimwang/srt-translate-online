1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,785
So let's try another quiz.

2
00:00:01,785 --> 00:00:04,000
This one's going to be quite a bit trickier.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,814
Here the question is, "What does the 'sum' procedure do?"

4
00:00:06,814 --> 00:00:09,000
And here's the definition of 'sum,'

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
so here we're defining the procedure of sum.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It takes two inputs, "a" and "b,"

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and its body assigns to "a" the value of "a" plus "b."

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So the choices are: Nothing;

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
that it takes two numbers as its inputs, and outputs the sum of the two numbers;

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
that it takes two strings as its inputs,

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and outputs the concatenation of those two strings.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So the final choice is that it takes two numbers as its inputs,

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and changes the value of the first input to be the sum of the two numbers.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,477
This is a quite tricky question.

15
00:00:39,477 --> 00:00:43,000
I would encourage you to try some experiments in the Python interpreter

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
to see if you can determine for sure what the sum procedure does.
