1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,279
Alex net was developed at the university

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:04,950
of toronto by Alex Khrushchev ski suits

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,690
giver and their professor Geoffrey

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,789
Hinton although the fundamental

5
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:10,710
architecture of Alex not resemble the

6
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,230
net from 1998 Alex that was a

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,440
breakthrough in several respects first

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,960
and foremost Alex not use the massive

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,390
parallelism afforded by gpus to

10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,778
accelerate training using the best gpus

11
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:27,629
available in 2012.the Alex net team was

12
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:29,368
able to train the network in about a

13
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:30,510
week

14
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,759
additionally Alex net pioneered the use

15
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,859
of rectified linear units as an

16
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:37,409
activation function and dropout is a

17
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:39,659
technique for avoiding overfitting in

18
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:42,210
2011 the year before Alex that was

19
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,308
developed the winner of the image net

20
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:46,229
competition successfully classified

21
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:48,750
seventy-four percent of images or in the

22
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,670
terminology the competition it's error

23
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,890
was twenty-six percent the next year

24
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,929
Alex net lowered its error to fifteen

25
00:00:54,929 --> 00:01:02,329
percent this was a huge leap forward
