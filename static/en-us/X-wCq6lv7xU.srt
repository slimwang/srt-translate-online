00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,029
Okay so here's the answer code, and

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:04,810
here's an image of what our
data snapshot looks like.

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,780
You were listening to the list
name location in the database.

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,540
It has no children nodes, so the child
method is not one that you'd use.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,160
That's because you already
navigated to this location here.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,150
So now the question is whether
we want the key or the value.

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,360
This is the key and this is the value.

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,480
The key stays the same.

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,930
The value stores the list
name set by the user.

10
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,150
You can think of these data
structures as representing objects.

11
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,200
Each key is like a member
variable of an object and

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,920
each value is the value
of that variable.

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,050
The name of the member
variable doesn't change, but

14
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,940
the value can update quite a bit
depending on what is being stored.

15
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,450
In fact,
the comparison between JSON data and

16
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,950
an object is not at all farfetched,
and we're going to see this shortly.
