00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,243
This question was a bit tricky. Whenever we start factoring, we should remove

2
00:00:04,243 --> 00:00:09,256
the greatest common factor first. 9 is the greatest factor that goes into 9x

3
00:00:09,256 --> 00:00:14,150
squared and 36y squared. So I can factor that 9 out of my expression and I'll be

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:19,230
left with x squared minus 4y squared. So the first term is a perfect square

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,094
since x squared equals x squared, and the second term is also a perfect square

6
00:00:24,094 --> 00:00:29,494
since 2y squared is 4y squared. We can factor this inside parenthesis using a+b

7
00:00:29,495 --> 00:00:34,650
times a-b. When I write the factored form, I want to remember to keep my GCF, my

8
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:39,618
greatest common factor. That stays on the outside of the other parentheses. So

9
00:00:39,618 --> 00:00:44,053
here's our factored expression. And in this case we have three different

10
00:00:44,053 --> 00:00:49,915
factors, one of them being the GCF of these terms. You might have thought to

11
00:00:49,915 --> 00:00:54,655
factor this as 3x plus 6y times 3x minus 6y. There's a common factor of 3 in

12
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:58,762
this term, so we can factor it out. There's also a common factor of 3 in these

13
00:00:58,762 --> 00:01:03,104
two terms, so we can factor a 3 out from this parentheses as well. So I've 3

14
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:09,220
times x plus 2y times 3 times x minus 2y. And we can easily see by distributing

15
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,456
we'd wind up with these parentheses back from before. We know the order of

16
00:01:13,456 --> 00:01:17,614
multiplication doesn't matter, so I can just multiply the 3 times 3 and then

17
00:01:17,614 --> 00:01:21,382
list my other two factors. This would have been another way to get our same

18
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:25,629
result. If you want to avoid removing common factors between pairs of terms,

19
00:01:25,629 --> 00:01:29,988
then it's best to factor out the GCF first. If we do that, then we won't need to

20
00:01:29,988 --> 00:01:31,093
do this in the end.
