Hi! My name is Kunal and I'm delighted that

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:06,510
you are considering this course. Now, before we dive in,

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,980
I want to introduce myself and also share with

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,460
you two reasons why I'm really excited to teach this

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,780
course. First, I love teaching. Before joining Udacity, I

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,040
was a sixth-grade science teacher in India. I remember really

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,920
enjoying presenting new ideas to my students. That would

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,820
make them question what they already knew. That experience lead

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,810
me to pursue a Master's Degree from the School of

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,490
Education at Stanford University. The second reason, is that I love

11
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,500
to create things with programming. Now, in this course, we are

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,520
going to use the Python programming language to create a bunch

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,140
of projects. And my hope is that you would want to

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,700
share these projects with your friends. Here are some of them.

15
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,290
The first one, is project take a break. Do you know

16
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,830
a friend who works too many hours? Hint, that person could

17
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,550
be you. We will write a program that schedules

18
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,980
breaks throughout the day, reminding that individual to listen to

19
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,890
music, get up and dance to their favorite song,

20
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,110
or just walk away from the computer every once in

21
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:06,710
awhile. Another one is called project profanity editor. Imagine

22
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,310
you get an email from your boss, requesting your help

23
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,840
with something. You reply, I can take a shot

24
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,670
at it but accidentally you end up including an awkward

25
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:20,350
word. Oops. We will write a short Python program that detects curse

26
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:24,820
words and saves you from embarrassing moments in the future. The final project

27
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:29,090
is project movie databases. In this project we will learn how to make an awesome

28
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:37,570
webpage, that lists your favorite movies, and shows their trailers. [SOUND]
