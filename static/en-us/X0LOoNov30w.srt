1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Yes, the answer is 2.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
There are exactly 2 elements that fall between $130,000 and $140,000.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Obviously the final bar is of size 2 again,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
because there are exactly 2 elements.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Now, this histogram differs from the bar chart in that the vertical axis is just a frequency count

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
whereas before it might have been a median home sales value.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
In 1-dimensional data sets that are numerical, this could be informative.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You can say, for example the majority of workers in this company

9
00:00:33,000 --> 99:59:59,999
are in this salary bracket where as a much smaller number are in higher salary brackets.
