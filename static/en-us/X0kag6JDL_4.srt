00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,753
Here are the answers.

2
00:00:01,753 --> 00:00:09,200
If u,v goes from A to B,
then u is reachable from s but v is not.

3
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:14,350
We conclude that the edge u,v must
not be in the residual graph.

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,830
So the edge must be saturated, and
the flow is equal to the capacity.

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,650
If u,v happened not to
be in the original flow,

6
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:24,990
then the capacity would be 0 and
the equation still holds.

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,910
If on the other hand u is in B and
v is in A,

8
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,350
then there can't be any
flow going from u to v.

9
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,410
Otherwise, it would be possible
to unsend this flow and

10
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,710
the edge u,v would be
in the residual graph.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,430
So this tells us that there
is no flow going from B to A.
