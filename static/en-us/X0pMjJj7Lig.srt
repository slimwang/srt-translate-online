00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,410
Now that we've filled in the tree, which
nodes can be pruned with Alpha-Beta?

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,530
So go through and click any of
the check boxes for nodes or

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,970
branches that you think would be
pruned by the Alpha-Beta algorithm.
