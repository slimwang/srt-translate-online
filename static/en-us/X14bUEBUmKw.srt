1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:02,105
So let's say we have 32 threads,

2
00:00:02,105 --> 00:00:04,842
each of which has a different item to look up in a hash table.

3
00:00:04,842 --> 00:00:07,510
Let's say all those threads map to the same bucket,

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,852
and there's 32 items in that bucket,

5
00:00:09,852 --> 00:00:12,048
each of which will be the target of one of the lookups.

6
00:00:12,048 --> 00:00:17,076
So all 32 threads will loop through the chain until all 32 threads have found their item.

7
00:00:17,076 --> 00:00:20,758
If we consider the fundamental unit of work here, the thread iterations,

8
00:00:20,758 --> 00:00:24,823
what fraction of thread iterations here actually do useful work?
