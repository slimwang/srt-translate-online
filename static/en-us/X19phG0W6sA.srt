>> Now, the second step of parsing our map involves loading all the tileset data

2
00:00:03,468 --> 00:00:06,992
described in the file. For each tileset, we need to create a new image, set a

3
00:00:06,992 --> 00:00:10,583
call back function for once it's loaded, and then set the source value to the

4
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:14,357
tilesets image attribute. This is the same basic image loading process that

5
00:00:14,357 --> 00:00:18,485
we've been using previously. It's worth pointing out now, that we're kicking off

6
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:22,023
asynchronous loads of images for our map data, which already has been

7
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:25,886
asynchronously loaded. As such, we may want to actually wait on setting the

8
00:00:25,886 --> 00:00:29,766
fully loaded flag to true until after all the images are loaded. To do this,

9
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:33,796
you'll need to use a counter variable to keep track of how many images have been

10
00:00:33,796 --> 00:00:37,702
loaded, and only set the fully loaded flag to true once all the tilesets have

11
00:00:37,702 --> 00:00:39,735
bee successfully loaded into memory.
