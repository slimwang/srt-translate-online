00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,950
In this lesson, you'll learn how to
set up your development environment.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:03,710
Namely, your editor.

00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,320
>> Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,920
I thought you told me I
could build a web tack with

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,190
just Notepad and a browser.

6
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,230
>> Well, yeah, I mean in theory you can.

00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:16,525

00:00:16,525 --> 00:00:20,305
in practice there are tools that make
the experience much less frustrating.

9
00:00:20,305 --> 00:00:23,915
If done just the right way, you can
achieve what most developers dream of.

10
00:00:23,915 --> 00:00:25,275
The state of mind called flow.
