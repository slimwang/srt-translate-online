1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,370
So now what we're going to do is we're going to step through bare with me

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:09,070
this whole second order Taylor expansion about u,v of 0,0.

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:13,150
By the way you should appreciate that I am not writing this.

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,500
So you actually can read it and it will be PDF presented of some sort so

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,930
you can get it from there or you can go to Rick book it's, it's all there.

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,080
But believe me you don't want me to write this you just want me to

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,862
be humourous and light hearted.

8
00:00:23,862 --> 00:00:28,090
All right, so here we have our Taylor expansion written just as before.

9
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,380
So we're going to knock these derivatives down one at a time.

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,010
We're going to start with our first derivative, right?

11
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,380
We have to do the first derivatives then the second derivatives.

12
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,680
So the first derivative we're going to look at [LAUGH], the first,

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,150
first derivative we're going to look at.

14
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,060
Is respect to the u direction.

15
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,810
Now u is the offset in the x direction.

16
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,010
Okay, just remember that u is the offset in the x direction.

17
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,090
And we're going to take the derivative of this function E

18
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,310
of u,v with respect to u.

19
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,530
Okay, let's see, well we've got this square term here, so

20
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:00,710
that gives us this, we, we raise it to, to single power instead, and

21
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,540
then we have to take the derivative of the inside term with respect to u,

22
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,820
and, let's see, there's no u's in there, that's go away.

23
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:11,430
So there's a u in here, so I have to take the derivative of I of x plus u,

24
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,390
y plus v, with respect to u.

25
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,090
Okay?

26
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,550
Not me, you.

27
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,160
Anyway.

28
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,440
Well, remember, u is in the same direction as x, so

29
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,620
the derivative of the image in the u direction is the same as the derivative of

30
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,510
the image in the x direction.

31
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:30,420
So I need the image gradient I sub x.

32
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:30,920
Got it? Good.

33
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:32,910
I'm not going to do v.

34
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,660
V's exactly the same thing except instead of xs, you get ys.

35
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,380
Now what we do is we're going to do the second derivative.

36
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,270
So we're just going to take the derivative of this with respect to u.

37
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,910
Well, there's two parts here.

38
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:46,330
Right? We've got this part, and we've got that part.

39
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:51,530
Right? So the derivative of a product is u times dv plus v times du.

40
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,090
Remember?

41
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,520
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

42
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,670
Except Us and Vs is a terrible choice because we've got different U's and V's.

43
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,640
But basically the derivative of

44
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,430
the first time the second plus derivative of the second time.

45
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,100
The first what is that going to look like?

46
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,300
That's going to look like this.

47
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:02,980
Okay?

48
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,040
So we take the derivative of a part that's the image and

49
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,550
multiply it so that just gives us this twice.

50
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:13,290
And then the second one is we take the derivative of the derivative and

51
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,730
multiply that by the original.

52
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,315
That gives us the second derivative.

53
00:02:16,315 --> 00:02:17,160
-okay?

54
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,540
The math's pretty easy, you can work it out.

55
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,840
This is the e respect to u, u term, all right?

56
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,840
So we've done the first derivative, the second derivative, u and v are the same.

57
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,680
The only thing left to do from that matrix, we had e, u, u, e, v, v,

58
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,900
we need the the cross derivative and

59
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,240
that just looks like this where we take the derivative of,-

60
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,190
The previous one of u except to v now.

61
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,930
And we get something that looks like this.

62
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,860
And you'll notice that this has the gradient in y, the gradient x.

63
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,600
Remember x is the same direction as u, y is the same direction as v.

64
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,630
And it also has this cross derivative.

65
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,710
We haven't talked a whole lot about the cross derivative,

66
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:55,250
and in fact, we're not going to talk even more today about cross derivative.

67
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,660
because later we're going to make it go poof!

68
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,720
Go away. So we won't even think about it.

69
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,000
So now we have our first derivative, u,v is the same.

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,160
Our second derivative u,u.

71
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,370
v, v is the same.

72
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,750
And our cross derivative.

73
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,400
Right?

74
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:06,900
Right.
