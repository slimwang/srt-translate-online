1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,236
So that's one way you impose a
constraint on the flow field in general.

2
00:00:05,236 --> 00:00:09,268
It has some strengths like one of the
strengths are that it allows you to bias

3
00:00:09,268 --> 00:00:13,428
your solution with a particular prior
that is like you really prefer smooth or

4
00:00:13,428 --> 00:00:15,163
maybe you prefer more.

5
00:00:15,163 --> 00:00:18,916
You, you work some constraint
into a general overall thing.

6
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:22,390
I will tell you that in general there
are much better ways of doing it than

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:27,160
this, in particular imposing constraints
on a local basis and guess what?

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,170
That's what we'll do next time.
