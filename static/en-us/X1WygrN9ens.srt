00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
[Norvig] The answer is that alarm is dependent on both John and Mary.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And so we can draw both nodes in, both arrows in.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Intuitively that makes sense because if John calls,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
then it's more likely that the alarm has occurred,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
likely as if Mary calls, and if both called, it's really likely.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So you can figure out the answer by intuitive reasoning,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
or you can figure it out by going to the conditional probability tables

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and seeing according to the definition of conditional probability

9
00:00:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
whether the numbers work out.
