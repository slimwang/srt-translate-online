Just because one particular truth
assignment doesn't satisfy a Boolean

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:07,490
formula, doesn't mean that there
isn't a satisfying assignment.

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,620
See if you can find one for
this formula.

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,530
Unless you're a good guesser,
this will take longer than just testing,

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,740
whether a given assignment
satisfies the formula.
