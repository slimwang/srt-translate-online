00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,300
Now before we wrap this project up, I want to

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,850
take a minute to connect some of the ideas that

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,300
we have seen in this lesson thus far. We started

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,290
out by creating squares and we wrote a piece of

5
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:15,890
code that said brad is equal to turtle.Turtle. What we

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,090
were really doing behind the scenes there is creating an

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,818
object or an instance of the class turtle. What we

8
00:00:22,818 --> 00:00:26,820
could then do with that instance is things like brad.forward.

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,730
We then wanted to do things like read contents

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,960
from a file on our computer, so we wrote a

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,300
piece of code that said quotes equal to open a

12
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,422
file location. What we were really doing behind the scenes

13
00:00:38,422 --> 00:00:42,070
there, is create an object of the type file. We

14
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:46,560
could then do things with that object like quotes.read. And

15
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,460
when we wanted to access a website on the internet,

16
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,040
we wrote a piece of code that said connection is

17
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,270
equal to urllib.urlopen. Now this piece of

18
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,930
code also returned a file-like object or instance

19
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,210
and we could then do things with

20
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,900
that instance, like connection.read. In all three of

21
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,600
these examples, we created instances or objects

22
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,373
and then we used those objects. Now some

23
00:01:11,373 --> 00:01:16,620
of you may say that in the profanity editor example, all we used were functions.

24
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,650
Functions like open and URL open and that there was no class like we saw in the

25
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,890
previous example with turtle. Well even though on surface

26
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,450
it looks like we did not use any classes

27
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,420
in the profanity editor example, if you look at

28
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,950
how functions like open and urlopen are actually implemented

29
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:39,470
in Python, we will find that some classes init

30
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,580
like function is being called to return these objects.

31
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,730
Okay, let's look at one more example of how to

32
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:49,820
use classes. Things will get a lot clearer after that.
