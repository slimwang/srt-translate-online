1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,830
This was a tricky one.

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,630
I really hope you just went ahead and
ran these lines,

3
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,180
to find out what they do.

4
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,280
the thing to realize,

5
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,090
is that this foo is going to be
the value of the variable foo.

6
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,570
This foo is just the string foo.

7
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,000
In here, again this foo is
the value of the variable foo.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,521
So that's bar, and
this foo is just the string foo.

9
00:00:18,521 --> 00:00:24,006
So it's "$foo + foo =${foo +"foo"}" So

10
00:00:24,006 --> 00:00:27,530
bar + foo = barfoo, there we go.

11
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,150
Over here the list method allows
us to generate a new list,

12
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,670
by applying a closure to
each item in the list.

13
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,450
That would be Collect, awesome work.

14
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,910
That's all the Groovy we'll
discuss directly in this course,

15
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,050
though you'll get to write plenty more.

16
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,560
If you're ready for
a bit of a break from me and

17
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,205
Mark, we've got some suggestions for
where to go to learn more.

18
00:00:44,205 --> 00:00:48,280
Learning new languages is one One of my
favorite things about working in Tech,

19
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,600
and Groovy is a particularly handy
language to have in your back pocket.

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,840
Check out the links in
the instructor notes to learn more.

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,890
Next up, we'll use our new Groovy
knowledge to start configuring

22
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,680
Gradle builds.
