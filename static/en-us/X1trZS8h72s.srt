1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,030
Now, could you talk a little bit about
sort of how we go from adversarial

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:08,070
mindset to beating diversity and

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,450
thinking about how to exploit
the humans at the other end?

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:16,364
>> Well, I think what our adversaries do
And you want an adversarial mindset so

5
00:00:16,364 --> 00:00:20,535
you can for this thinking and look for

6
00:00:20,535 --> 00:00:23,365
these vulnerabilities
before someone else does.

7
00:00:23,365 --> 00:00:28,210
I think typically what they'll do is
they'll probe the perimeter of a system.

8
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,010
Looking for vulnerability.

9
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,430
And it's really on multiple layers.

10
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,910
You can think of the technical layer,
and if the system is secure technically,

11
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,780
which is a very rare thing, but
let's assume that's the case.

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,130
Or maybe if they decided the amount
of work, the work factor involved

13
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,400
to bypass something technically
just too expensive in some ways.

14
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:54,060
Then they'll go looking for the ever
present weak link, which is the human,

15
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:59,270
and often times by
studying the given users

16
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,720
Finding their weaknesses themselves,
their personal vulnerabilities.

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,120
Those can then be exploited.

18
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:09,750
So I tend to think against
well-resourced and motivated adversary,

19
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,630
that the adversary will always
prevail given enough time and

20
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,770
resources to put into it
