1
00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:03,718
So let's try an example. Suppose we wanted to find the days between dates. 2013

2
00:00:03,718 --> 00:00:08,686
Janurary 24, and 2013 June 29th. If we were going to do this as a human we might

3
00:00:08,686 --> 00:00:13,366
look at a calendar. I happen to have a calendar handy and thanks to my auntie in

4
00:00:13,366 --> 00:00:17,086
Belfast for sending me the calendar and we could count the days using the

5
00:00:17,086 --> 00:00:22,463
calendar so let's look at the calendar. We have our starting day is January 24

6
00:00:22,463 --> 00:00:27,581
and we might count the days between January 24. How many do we have left in

7
00:00:27,581 --> 00:00:32,701
January. So there would be 1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 days left in January. So there'd

8
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:37,890
be seven days in January. Then we have, have all of February, all of February is

9
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:46,209
28 days. Then we have all of March, 31 days. All of April, 30 days. All of May,

10
00:00:46,209 --> 00:00:52,367
31 days. And then we have June. We don't want to count all of June because we

11
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:58,132
are stopping on June 29th, so we are going to add 29 days from June, and if we

12
00:00:58,132 --> 00:01:03,206
sum all those up we should get our answer. And as a human we know how to compute

13
00:01:03,206 --> 00:01:07,072
sums by entering sums into Google, and we get 156.
