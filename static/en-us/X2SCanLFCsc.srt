1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,715
CDN is an example of what is called an

2
00:00:03,715 --> 00:00:07,360
overlay network. Let me explain what an overlay network

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,370
is. In the previous example, I said my node

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,080
id is 80. And the content corresponding to the key

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,690
149 is stored at my node id 80. And

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,730
this is something the chip discovered, and once you've

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,660
discovered it, you want to come to me to get

8
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,920
the content from me. But how will you do that?

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,370
What does 80 mean from the point of

10
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,940
view of the internet? As you know, the physical

11
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:35,800
infrastructure of the internet works with IP addresses.

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,830
But what you have is 80. It's not an

13
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,490
IP address. And the operating system only understands

14
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,050
IP addresses, to route packets on the Internet from

15
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,280
source to destination. So we need, at the user

16
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,260
level, because we are doing this sharing of content

17
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:57,740
at the user level, a way of mapping such virtual addresses, 80, 60, and so

18
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:03,310
on, to IP addresses. So we, as friends, who have decided that well, we want to

19
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,860
form a social network to share information content,

20
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,690
and so forth, we've exchanged such mapping information

21
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:16,820
and constructed a routing table at the user level. And this is what is called an

22
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:21,860
overlay network, a virtual network on top of the physical network. So, for

23
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:26,640
example, if you, using that SHA1 hash, found

24
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,520
that your IP address maps to node ID 60, you'll say, okay,

25
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,540
sure, my node ID is 60. And my IP address is such and

26
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:42,500
so that is how I'm going to construct a user-level routing table.

27
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:48,550
All I know is your node ID, and that node ID maps to some IP address.

28
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:53,940
And I can use this correspondence between the node ID and the IP address,

29
00:01:53,940 --> 00:02:00,034
to have a way of sending information to you. And maybe, a friend of yours

30
00:02:00,034 --> 00:02:04,478
has exchanged routing information with you, and he

31
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:07,771
has told you that his node ID's 80.

32
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:10,231
And he has also given you how to reach

33
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:15,180
him. Given that node ID. And you've shared that

34
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,020
information with me as well saying that you know,

35
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,790
I have buddies, and these are all the note

36
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,680
IDs of my buddies. So that's how I construct

37
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,000
this routing table, which is really a table that

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,020
consists node IDs of my friends and friends of

39
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,230
friends, friends of friends of friends, and so on.

40
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,880
That's how I construct this user level routing table. Now

41
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,510
if i wanted to send a message to my buddy,

42
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:44,160
let's say B, and his node ID is 60. Because

43
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,000
B has given me his IP address, when I send

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,420
a message to node ID, I can covert that to

45
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,130
the IP address, give it to the physical network, and

46
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,710
it goes to the physical network gets delivered to B.

47
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,980
What if I want to send a message to some other

48
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:04,650
node C. I know the node id of c because my buddy b exchanged that with

49
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,990
me. But I have no idea what the IP address of c is. But on the other hand, I do

50
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:15,240
know that b has a way of getting to c. And so in my routing table, what I'm

51
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,040
going to say is that given a name of

52
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,290
a particular node, I know the virtualized node ID associated

53
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:28,080
with that node, 64B, 84C, and I also know what

54
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,840
the next hop is in the user space, in the

55
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,270
virtual space of getting to that particular destination. In the

56
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,750
case of B. I know I can directly send it to

57
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,050
60, because I have an IP address for B. On

58
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,360
the other hand, if I want to send it to C,

59
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,720
I have the node ID of C, but I have

60
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,690
no idea what that maps to in terms of IP address.

61
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,270
I know that my buddy B has a way

62
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,630
of getting it to C, and that's what I'm going to

63
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:58,267
use. I'm going to say, if I want to send something

64
00:03:58,267 --> 00:04:01,080
to C, I simply hand it over to my buddy

65
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,020
who's at node id 60. So the routing table says,

66
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,660
given a node id, who's the next hop I should

67
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,600
give it to so that it'll eventually get there? Now

68
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,360
the physical network, of course, is much more elaborate than

69
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,709
this user level, overlay network. Now, for instance, let's say

70
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,870
I want to send a message to C. His node

71
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:25,610
ID is 80, but I have no idea how to send it to him except to know that if I

72
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:32,150
give it to my buddy B, who's at node ID 60, he'll know how to get it over to, to

73
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,720
C. So, I'm going to send it to B, and

74
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,710
when it comes to B, B knows. From his routing table,

75
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,860
the IP address for C, and therefore he will

76
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,860
send it to C and it'll eventually reach C. So,

77
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,360
at the user level, you can see that so far

78
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,020
as I'm concerned, if my node ID is 50, and

79
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:59,370
my node name is A, when I wanted to send a message to C, what I did, was to send

80
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:05,040
it to B. And it took two hops at the user level. It took two hops to go from A

81
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,650
to C, went to B my buddy and B then sent it over to C. So this is a user

82
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:14,330
level traversal of the message. But in reality, under the

83
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:18,290
covers, what is going on, is when I send this message

84
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,380
from A to B, it is going through the physical

85
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,970
network and reaching B. And when I send to message

86
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,220
to A to C. Even though it is two hops

87
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:30,050
over here, internally in terms of the number of network hops

88
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:35,090
that may have to be incurred in the physical network for the message to reach

89
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,550
eventually the destination C, it might take many

90
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,389
more hops. That's what an overlay network is.

91
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,670
A virtual network on top of the physical

92
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:49,120
network. And this particular overlay is a content

93
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,670
distribution network, because it allows content to be

94
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:56,130
shared and distributed among a set of users,

95
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,920
who have exchanged information with one another so that they can

96
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:05,120
discover one another, if not directly, indirectly through friends of friends.
