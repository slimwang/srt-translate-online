1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,430
>> So we just gave you two concrete examples

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,910
of how you can improve the UX of your app.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,760
>> Exactly. The Sign-In and Check Out buttons to replace

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,200
forms are a really good idea. But, I know that

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,730
I've actually ended up creating my own sign-in and check

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,330
out forms. And I spent a lot of time optimizing them.

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:18,820
>> Yeah, me too.

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,650
>> I'm sure you've done the same.

9
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,810
>> I, I've done the same thing. I've spent a lot of time trying to

10
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,660
design the perfect sign-in form, and I've tested

11
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,330
it with users and tried really hard to

12
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:26,540
optimize it.

13
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,000
>> Yeah. So the, the solution as we've presented them to you

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,410
are actually just Band-Aids. There's an underlying cause actually there is an

15
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,300
underlying problem which results in us. Coming up with these forms, and

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,860
really focusing on the forms rather

17
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,300
than focusing on the applications themselves.

18
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,400
>> If your first instinct was to optimize locally, and not to just

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,420
replace sign-in and check out with one of these solutions, what was your

20
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,380
thought process? Were you thinking too detailed? Were you thinking

21
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,070
too high level? Were you not thinking of the bigger picture?

22
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,000
Were you trying to reuse existing code? Or is it

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,910
something else? Or none of the above? Check all that apply.
