00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,043
First, we check if the clip is already loaded. And if it is, and we call the

2
00:00:04,043 --> 00:00:09,266
callback function with that clip sound. If it isn't, we create a new clip and

3
00:00:09,266 --> 00:00:14,604
we fire off an XMLHttpRequest to load that sound clip. Now, the response type

4
00:00:14,604 --> 00:00:18,498
from this request won't be plain text but it will be an array buffer, and

5
00:00:18,498 --> 00:00:25,205
that's something we need to decode. Using the Decode Audio Data method. We'll

6
00:00:25,205 --> 00:00:30,006
store dat audio buffer into da clip. And den call our callback function once

7
00:00:30,006 --> 00:00:35,060
more. Finally, we'll send the request, and return da clip data at the very end.
