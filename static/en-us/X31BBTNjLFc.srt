00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,502
>> Now the final example and I want to
show you this pretty interesting example

2
00:00:03,502 --> 00:00:07,085
that was produced by a bunch of people
at Microsoft with collaboration with

3
00:00:07,085 --> 00:00:08,167
a lot of universities.

4
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:13,131
>> RoomAlive is a proof of concept
prototype that transforms any room

5
00:00:13,131 --> 00:00:17,839
into an immersive, augmented,
magical gaming experience.

6
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:21,792
RoomAlive uses projectors and
depth cameras to cover an entire room,

7
00:00:21,792 --> 00:00:26,147
including the people and the furniture
inside with pixels that can be used for

8
00:00:26,147 --> 00:00:27,489
both input and output.

9
00:00:27,489 --> 00:00:34,291
With RoomAlive, users can touch,
shoot and dodge augmented content.

10
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:37,664
That seamlessly coexist with their
existing physical environment.

11
00:00:37,664 --> 00:00:42,325
Our system consists of multiple
projector camera units or ProCams for

12
00:00:42,325 --> 00:00:42,880
short.

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,180
Each unit contains a depth camera,

14
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,095
a commodity wide field of view projector
and it's own computational unit.

15
00:00:50,095 --> 00:00:52,679
These ProCam units can
be used individually or

16
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:56,995
combined through a scalable distributed
framework to cover an entire room.

17
00:00:56,995 --> 00:00:59,801
The ProCam units
are auto-calibrating and

18
00:00:59,801 --> 00:01:04,590
can self localize within the room as
long as their views have some overlap.

19
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:09,512
The auto-calibration requires no
expertise or calibration fiducials,

20
00:01:09,512 --> 00:01:12,956
so the pro cams can easily
be installed by end users.

21
00:01:12,956 --> 00:01:17,472
One just positions the pro cams in
the room and the system does the rest.

22
00:01:17,472 --> 00:01:22,091
The system automatically creates
a unified model of the room by combining

23
00:01:22,091 --> 00:01:24,484
the depth maps from each ProCam unit.

24
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:29,156
In addition to the 3D model, our system
automatically extracts the surfaces in

25
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:33,776
the room, identifying vertical and
horizontal surfaces and the floor plane.

26
00:01:33,776 --> 00:01:37,366
We expose this information
together with the 3D model and

27
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:40,892
the ProCam controls in the plugin
to a unity game engine.

28
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:45,826
This enables game designers to offer
rich immersive gaming experiences.

29
00:01:45,826 --> 00:01:49,166
To show how RoomAlive can
transform your living room,

30
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:52,151
we have created four
interactive experiences.

31
00:01:52,151 --> 00:01:55,900
RoomAlive supports procedurally
texturing the living room,

32
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,737
transforming the room
into a new environment.

33
00:01:58,737 --> 00:02:02,551
Here the living room can be
transformed into a holodeck,

34
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:06,999
an indoor factory or can show a river
running through the floor with

35
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:09,472
dynamically generated raindrops.

36
00:02:09,472 --> 00:02:13,824
Virtual critters can also be
procedurally generated to appear around

37
00:02:13,824 --> 00:02:14,937
the living room.

38
00:02:14,937 --> 00:02:18,976
>> So here you see actually an example,
where a whole lot of other ideas have

39
00:02:18,976 --> 00:02:21,903
been brought together into
one Interesting setup.

40
00:02:21,903 --> 00:02:26,699
It's a projector camera system, except
they use def cameras, like connect

41
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:31,273
combined to a projector, which allows
them to extract much more detail,

42
00:02:31,273 --> 00:02:34,026
3D information,
a depth map of the scene.

43
00:02:34,026 --> 00:02:37,642
And then of course, the light is shown
based on the knowledge of the 3D scene.

44
00:02:37,642 --> 00:02:38,391
So, and of course,

45
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:40,916
the calibration process is very
similar to what we had seen before.

46
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:45,878
An interesting example of creating
augmented reality experiences like this

47
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:50,760
in much more of a spacious do, domain
with various types of augmentations in

48
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,262
the display space with a variety of
things like, you know, colors and

49
00:02:55,262 --> 00:02:56,966
also objects showing up.

50
00:02:56,966 --> 00:03:00,090
Again, please look at the website for
more details on this one.
