1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,440
The thing behind how you
build an ad words campaign,

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,650
is similar to how you
build any campaign.

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,060
Just remember to understand
your user and target audience.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,560
Explore different key words and
different messaging and

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,895
keep iterating and
optimizing until you see your desired.

6
00:00:12,895 --> 00:00:14,443
Results.

7
00:00:14,443 --> 00:00:17,335
Now, Ad words can be a bit expensive
when you're new and starting out,

8
00:00:17,335 --> 00:00:20,045
because it's a popular tool and
competition can be high.

9
00:00:20,045 --> 00:00:21,855
But, people keep searching and

10
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:26,225
they keep paying attention to the top
paid result, so it's worth optimizing.

11
00:00:26,225 --> 00:00:26,835
But don't worry.

12
00:00:26,835 --> 00:00:28,505
There are other options you can explore.

13
00:00:28,505 --> 00:00:30,305
You can try looking for
younger channels,

14
00:00:30,305 --> 00:00:32,785
like paid ads on YouTube or Instagram.

15
00:00:32,785 --> 00:00:35,395
Or you can even explore
completely untapped platforms and

16
00:00:35,395 --> 00:00:36,705
find new opportunities for growth.
