00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,870
So I look to through documentation for AV Foundation framework.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,440
By the way, a link to this website is also available in the instructor notes.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,440
And in here when I scroll down,

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,090
I came across this class called AVAudioUnitTimePitch.

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,920
Now this seems like a very verbose name.

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,490
But when I clicked on it,

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,560
I found out that this class does exactly what we want to do.

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,170
It says that AVAudioUnitTimePitch, provides good quality playback rate and

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,090
pitch shifting.

10
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,910
Now, if I read through this class,

11
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,930
I find that it has a variable called pitch that I could change.

12
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,210
The documentation says that the default value of this variable, Is 1.0 and

13
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,670
the range of values for

14
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:41,150
this variable can be anywhere from negative 2400 to positive 2400.

15
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,570
All of this seems really promising.

16
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:48,530
All I need to do now, is to figure out how to use AVAudioUnitTimePitch.

17
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,120
And that's where you can help.

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:55,640
Your challenge is to find an example, Of how to use AVAudioUnitTimePitch.

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,470
And it's okay if you find an example on the internet that you don't

20
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,710
fully understand yet.

21
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:03,710
Specifically, I would love for you to identify any new websites that you thought

22
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:08,000
were promising, and then to try out any new code ideas that you discovered.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,420
