1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And surprisingly, they happen to be exactly the same y as in the top--y.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
However, this specific data set, you get for example that 6-2

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
this expression over here is the same as 7-3.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
If we look at this carefully and work these things out, we find that 16, 0, 1, 9 set are answers.
