00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,590
We'll start our specification
exercise in using English.

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,250
I'd like you to provide
an English language description

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,240
of the expected behavior
of y equals the sort of x.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,230
Where x is an input sequence of integers
and y is an output sequence of integers.

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,090
And assuming that you're
sorting in ascending order.

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,410
So think how you would say
this in precise English.

7
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:22,430
>> Okay.

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:28,288
So, given a input vector x of integers,
we will return to y and

9
00:00:28,288 --> 00:00:33,930
output vector of integers in which for
each element that is an x,

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,210
the element that comes after it
will be greater than that element.

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,930
>> You mean and why, the outcome?

12
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:41,850
>> And why, yes, yes.

13
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,540
So, once it's sorted, each element and
why, of the element that comes

14
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:51,350
after it will be greater than it,
except for the last element.

15
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:55,990
>> Well, first of all, say the input had
some duplicates, is it greater than, or

16
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,750
greater than or equal?

17
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:02,130
>> Okay so it could be greater than or
equal to if we have duplicates.

18
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,470
>> Okay, and
what do we do about the last one?

19
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,730
>> The last one will not have
a element to come after it.

20
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,180
>> Right.
>> So it will be the greatest element

21
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,750
and the, the output vector.

22
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,000
>> Or
possibly equal to the one before it?

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,555
>> Yes.

24
00:01:14,555 --> 00:01:15,055
[LAUGH]
>> Ok.

25
00:01:15,055 --> 00:01:16,985
So there's a lot going on in,

26
00:01:16,985 --> 00:01:20,520
in trying to express that
in a precise fashion.

27
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,270
Let's see what we can,
what we can do about it.
