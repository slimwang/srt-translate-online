00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,383
We'll finish this lesson by talking about Correlation and Causation. We briefly

2
00:00:05,383 --> 00:00:08,746
discussed this in lesson one with the Golden Arches theory of conflict

3
00:00:08,746 --> 00:00:13,484
resolution which has since been disproven. But still, it's kind of funny to

4
00:00:13,484 --> 00:00:18,580
think that McDonalds might cause world peace. We found this really cute cartoon

5
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,530
online the link is at the bottom it's a little joke that illustrates the

6
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:26,079
difference between correlation and causation. But we're leaving out the last

7
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,394
line because that's the punchline. First we're going to discuss correlation vs

8
00:00:30,394 --> 00:00:35,906
causation. Causation means that one variable caused another to happen. For

9
00:00:35,906 --> 00:00:39,812
example, the fact that it was raining caused a bunch of people to bring their

10
00:00:39,812 --> 00:00:46,104
umbrellas to work. But correlation just means that there's a relationship. For

11
00:00:46,104 --> 00:00:50,558
example, do happy people have more friends? Is it just because they're happy

12
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:54,876
that they have more friends? Or, does them being happy cause them to act a

13
00:00:54,876 --> 00:01:00,412
certain way which then causes them to have more friends? We never know, there

14
00:01:00,412 --> 00:01:05,093
are always lurking variables. We might have two variables X and Y, and they

15
00:01:05,093 --> 00:01:09,578
have a relationship, but only because both of them are influenced by variable

16
00:01:09,578 --> 00:01:17,626
A. Or maybe, X influences Y through variable A. A is called a mediating

17
00:01:17,626 --> 00:01:22,082
variable. By just looking at scatter plots and the correlation, we don't know

18
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:28,455
what the case is. We can just see some kind of relationship. In order to make

19
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:32,609
causal statements, for one thing, the independent variable would have to occur

20
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:36,453
before the dependant variable and we have to be able to rule out any lurking

21
00:01:36,453 --> 00:01:43,590
variables. With age and pets, this one's kind of easy because we know that

22
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:49,640
having more pets doesn't cause you to age. But others, like happiness and

23
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:55,232
number of friends are kind of ambiguous. Maybe having more friends causes you

24
00:01:55,232 --> 00:02:00,039
to be happy or maybe being happy causes you to have more friends. We don't

25
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:04,577
know. Even if one comes before the other, this doesn't necessarily mean that

26
00:02:04,577 --> 00:02:09,259
the first variable caused the second. I'm sure you can think of all sorts of

27
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,540
examples where that wouldn't be true.
