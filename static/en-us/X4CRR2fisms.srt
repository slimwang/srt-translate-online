00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,930
We've just argued that if N is
polynomial, and we take its output, and

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:09,940
feed that into M, which is also
polynomial in its input size,

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:15,060
then the resulting composition
of M with N is also polynomial.

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,260
So, we can add in polytime
to our claim here.

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,530
And by this argument we've
proved the following theorem.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:30,220
If a is a polynomial reducable to B and
B is in P then A must be in P.

7
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:35,920
Just convert the input to prepare it for
the decider for B and

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,070
return whatever the decider for B says.
