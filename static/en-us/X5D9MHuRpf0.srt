00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,890
The final category of connectors to

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,340
look at it are called Distributor Connectors.

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,520
They're role is also primarily facilitation.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,290
They identify the interaction pads and they rout things among them.

5
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,480
In a sense, they are assisting other connectors.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,849
A primary example here is DNS, Domain Name Services.

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,930
Whereby various components on the internet can talk to

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,120
each other using names rather than strictly by addresses.

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,870
Some of the variations that are possible with

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,890
distributor connectors include naming.

11
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,570
That is are they structured based.

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,170
Can they be hierarchical or flat?

13
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,200
Or are they attribute based?

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,920
What's the delivery policy?

15
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,900
Is it best effort, exactly once and so on?

16
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,030
And is the mechanism unicast?

17
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:48,490
That is point to point or multicast or broadcast, and then routing, okay?

18
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:49,650
Is there a bounded list?

19
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,050
Or is it more ad hoc?

20
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,430
And is the path static, cached, or dynamic?
