00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,665
Okay. We're going to talk a little bit more about correlation measures. We've

2
00:00:02,665 --> 00:00:06,520
already mentioned r squared. Remember, r squared gives us the strength of the

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,194
relationship between two variables. Sometimes r squared is called the

4
00:00:10,194 --> 00:00:15,334
coefficient of determination. Because r squared is a proportion, it ranges from

5
00:00:15,334 --> 00:00:19,216
0 to 1. And our r squared value of 0 means that the variables are not at all

6
00:00:19,216 --> 00:00:25,230
related. And our r squared of 1 means they are perfectly related. This rarely

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,067
ever happens in everyday life. It's hard to imagine variables that are

8
00:00:29,067 --> 00:00:33,315
perfectly related. When conducting the t test, the formula for r squared can be

9
00:00:33,315 --> 00:00:38,246
derived from the information from our t test. The formula for our r squared is

10
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:43,474
t squared over t squared plus our degrees of freedom. The t here is not the

11
00:00:43,474 --> 00:00:49,208
critical value, it's the value we get from the t test itself. In computing r

12
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:53,240
squared, all we have to do is compute our t value from the formula, square it,

13
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,400
put that in the numerator, square it again, add our degrees of freedom and then

14
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,050
divide.
