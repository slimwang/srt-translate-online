00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,563
There are two ways you can figure out what this z-critical value is. One is to

2
00:00:04,563 --> 00:00:11,695
look at the z table and find the value for which 2.5% is less than that. So, if

3
00:00:11,695 --> 00:00:18,374
we look for 0.025, or 2.5%, we see that it's here at negative 1.96. So, that

4
00:00:18,374 --> 00:00:25,619
means that this z-critical value is negative1.96 because 2.5% is less than

5
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:31,940
that. And since this distribution is symmetrical, that means that this

6
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:37,890
z-critical value would be positive 1.96. Another thing you could have done is

7
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,182
noted that if 2.5% is up here in the blue region, then 97.5% is below the

8
00:00:42,182 --> 00:00:50,950
z-critical value. Then, you could have looked for 0.975 in the z-table and then

9
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:57,679
you would get positive 1.96. This is called the two tailed test. When we split

10
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,630
the alpha level in half, we see that its two tailed. And then our z-critical

11
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:06,903
values become both the positive and negative of the same number.
