00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,880
Some of the characteristics of services are flexibility. That is,

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,210
you are essentially refactoring, if, if you have an existing application, you

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,060
want to make that service oriented you factored into, into pieces that then you

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:19,470
could combine in interesting ways. Meaningful here on the slide means each of

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,790
the services is something that's meaningful to the end user. They're stateless,

6
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:30,290
for the reasons described with web services. Stateless means that typically

7
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:34,190
the code is actually simpler than it would be if you have to remember variables.

8
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,080
And also it's transparent with respect to middleware. Typically,

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,310
there's a middleware technology solution that takes your descriptions.

10
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,360
Takes your configuration information and

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,520
generates the the, the middle work pieces that need to be generated.
