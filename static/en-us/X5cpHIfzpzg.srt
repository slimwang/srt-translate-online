1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is 0.008.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
At each step, there's a 1/5 probability of seeing that particular vote

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
at both stages and knowing how it was mixed.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
In order to trace the vote all the way back, we need to see that same vote each time.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That will be 1/5^3rd which is 1/125 which is 0.008.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So that means there's a tradeoff here, if you do more auditing, if you increase this from 1/5

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
to a higher value, that would increase the probability that a given voter could be identified.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It will also decrease the probability that the mix nets could cheat without getting caught.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So here, we have a tradeoff between the privacy of the voters

10
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and the likelihood of detecting cheating.
