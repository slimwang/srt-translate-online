1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,210
So how do we find similar frames?

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,570
Again, what we are trying to
compare each and every frame,

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:10,630
frame i versus frame j, basically we
can do now is create a simple matrix.

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,150
And here is my output.

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,620
This is an interesting way
of looking at things, right?

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:20,760
In this case, assume that if it's
a black value, it's the most similar.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,160
That is, they're pretty much the same.

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,420
If I did a Manhattan distance
between two pixels, two frames that

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,060
are the same, so if I just did say
that's our difference between f1 and

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,210
f1 itself, what would I get?

11
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,540
Well, I'd get distance zero.

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,410
In this case, zero would mean
a black pixel in this image.

13
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,160
So basically, this kind of starts
showing an interesting structure.

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,580
This is for
the candle example we've looked at.

15
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,830
And now we start looking at it,

16
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:46,890
you kind of notice that yes, the most
similar one is the image itself.

17
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,620
That's why the diagonal is black.

18
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,510
But once in a while, you see it
sometimes off diagonal and off course.

19
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,710
You also see other
frames that are similar

20
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,520
that are actually somewhere far off.

21
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,230
So, for example, here might be a frame.

22
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:03,958
This might be f50, but here it's f100.

23
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:05,408
That is also somewhat similar so

24
00:01:05,408 --> 00:01:08,400
now I can actually look for
these types of things.

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,400
So, we can compute the Euclidean
distance between all of them for

26
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,820
all the N frames.

27
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,910
And now, basically,
this is what our major axes looks like.

28
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,820
These were the most similar.

29
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,300
So of course, one way of transitioning
in the traditional way in video is just

30
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,020
going this way, right?

31
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,650
We go from the beginning to the end,
and we play all the frames.

32
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:30,020
In this matrix here,
black are similar frames, because again,

33
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,160
the distance is almost zero, while and
white are dissimilar frames.

34
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,730
Similar frames are the ones that
would be the best to jump to.

35
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,200
So now I can of course go here, and

36
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,270
rather than go all the way there,
I can jump to another one.

37
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,950
Black are the most similar frames,
so I can move to this one.

38
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,220
And then of course I
can jump back this way.

39
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,260
And that's the looping we come up with.

40
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,720
So I've already just shown
you one simple loop.

41
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,230
You can imagine we can do
loads of loops like this.

42
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:57,330
I can go up here and
jump back and go there.

43
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,980
Go up here, jump here, and
come around and keep on looping.

44
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,190
And that was the yellow dot you
saw at the bottom of the candles

45
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:03,790
that I was showing you.
