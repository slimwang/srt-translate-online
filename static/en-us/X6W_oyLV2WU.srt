1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,070
So why is what we've covered so
far, important?

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:10,130
Because these are some of the reasons
that the US spends far more per capita.

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,750
Typically twice as much on healthcare,

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,830
than other advanced
industrialized nations.

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:20,190
That's certainly true if you
again compare the US to France.

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,380
Moreover, while increases in US
healthcare spending have slowed in

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,520
recent years, for reasons that aren't
yet clear, historically our healthcare

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:37,210
cost have grown much faster than
those in the same group of nations.

9
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,220
The inexorable growth of chronic
disease, is one of the key reasons why.

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,376
That spending might be okay if
we were getting a great result.

11
00:00:45,376 --> 00:00:50,512
But again, comparing the US here,
to this group of

12
00:00:50,512 --> 00:00:55,530
industrialized countries and
even some others,

13
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,199
we rank 26th in life
expectancy shown here.

14
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:04,358
We're also a clear outlier,
spending far more, but

15
00:01:04,358 --> 00:01:11,120
dying younger than the citizens of these
other countries that spend far less.

16
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,860
Clearly a serious problem, but

17
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,720
you may be asking, what does it
have to do with health informatics?

18
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,260
We turn to that now.
