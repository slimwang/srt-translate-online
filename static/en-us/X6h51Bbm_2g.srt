1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,050
So the answer to this question
actually is the second one.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,010
One reason, we're going to get into
some details as to how exactly

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:13,560
it's different, but you can think
about you're doing control transfer.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,200
You're going from one
part of the program,

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,790
that's your user part,
to the operating system.

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,570
So you're doing what you would
have to do, saving, for example,

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,810
when you're going to return and
things like that.

8
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,280
Pass arguments barometers,

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,720
but you're also switching the so
called protection domains.

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,900
You're going from user space, so

11
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,950
user land we call it,
to the operating system.

12
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,750
The operating system is trusted.

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:43,160
It's a distinct protection domain then
the application code that we're running.

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,760
And when you do that,

15
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,240
now you're going to be able to do
things that you couldn't do before.
