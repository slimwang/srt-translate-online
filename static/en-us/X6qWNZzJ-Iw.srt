1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,990
Thank you, Professor.

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:05,120
So I am back with more Python and
more graphs.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,630
This time, let's scatter some data.

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,730
I mean,
let's learn how to build a scatter plot.

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:16,640
We will compare scatter plot of
SPY versus XOM and SPY versus GLD.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,810
So let's read this data and
compute daily returns as well.

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:25,510
As usual, We call get_data
function with this symbols and

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,360
also compute daily returns.

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,810
Next we first plot scatter plot for
SPY versus XOM.

10
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,780
Kind parameter of the plot
function of the data frame

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,970
will help us achieve this.

12
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,580
So we mention we need a scatter plot,
but

13
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,430
since the data frame daily return
has values for three stocks.

14
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:50,870
We have to mention which should be our
X axis and which should be our Y axis.

15
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,922
As we are plotting SPY versus XOM,

16
00:00:53,922 --> 00:00:58,960
we assign X attribute aas SPY and
Y attribute as XOM.

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,080
Ready to see the output?

18
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,230
This is our SPY versus XOM.

19
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:08,160
Now let's similarly plot SPY versus GLD.

20
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:15,480
Since we want GLD on our y-axis, we just
replace the y label from XOM to GLD.

21
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,010
So here are two scatter plots.

22
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:21,800
SPY versus XOM and SPY versus GLD.

23
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,880
But we want to recreate
the graph that Professor drew.

24
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,660
So we fit a line to the scatter plots.

25
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,990
For that, we need the help of
another good friend of ours.

26
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,290
Which is numpy.

27
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,295
So let's import it.

28
00:01:33,295 --> 00:01:37,447
After importing the numpy library
we areall set to fit a line to our

29
00:01:37,447 --> 00:01:38,440
scatter plot.

30
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,510
So we have a set of points, and

31
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:45,580
we want a line which has
an equation of degree one.

32
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,900
So we go ahead and
fit a polynomial of degree one.

33
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,140
This is what polyfit
function of the numpy does.

34
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,940
So let's use it.

35
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,010
We will first do it for SPY and XOM.

36
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:02,300
The polyfit function needs x-coordinates
and y-coordinates to fit a line.

37
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,910
For us the x-coordinates
are the daily return values for

38
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:10,419
SPY and the y-coordinates are daily
return values for the XOM.

39
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:13,490
The one denotes the degree
of our function.

40
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:16,160
Calling this function
will return two things.

41
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,590
The first is the polynomial coefficient
and the second is the intercept.

42
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:27,390
Since we have a polynomial of degree 1,
it would be of the form y = mx + b.

43
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,990
So m is the coefficient and
b is the intercept.

44
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,840
We name them as beta and alpha.

45
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,260
Just as Professor explained.

46
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,010
Now we finally plot these values.

47
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:44,540
The idea for plotting the line is,
for every value of x that is SPY,

48
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:52,160
we find a value of y using the line
equation, which is mx + b.

49
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,130
This parameter denotes that we want
a line plot with the color red.

50
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,310
Now, let's check our graph.

51
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,530
Here is the fitted line.

52
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,510
Let's do it for GLD so
that we can compare them both.

53
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,610
We also print the beta and
alpha values for each.

54
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,470
Now, let's compare the beta values

55
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:16,380
which shows how the stock
moved with respect to SPY.

56
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,540
You can see that the beta values for

57
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,170
the XOM is greater as
compared to that of GLD.

58
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:27,720
Which means that XOM is more reactive
to market as compared to GLD.

59
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,710
On the other hand,

60
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:34,100
the alpha values denote how well
it performs with respect to SPY.

61
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,410
Numbers over here say that
GLD performed better.

62
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,130
Let's cross check.

63
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,010
You can see the upward movement of
the GLD as compared to the SPY.

64
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:48,560
One last thing is to find
the correlation yet again.

65
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,740
The data frame has a function
corr which means correlation, and

66
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,030
we can define which method to use.

67
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,280
We use the method pearson.

68
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,290
It is the most commonly used method
to calculate the correlation.

69
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,770
There are other methods as well, check
the instructor's note for more detail.

70
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,710
We get the output in the matrix format,

71
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:15,260
with correlation of each
column with each other column.

72
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,560
You can see that the SPY and
XOM are highly correlated.

73
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,660
The value of the correlation for
GLD and SPY is very small.

74
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,649
Let's check the graph.

75
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,590
You can observe that the dots
do not fit the line closely.

76
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,998
And that's why the correlation value for

77
00:04:32,998 --> 00:04:38,520
the SPY versus GLD is less as
compared to SPY versus XOM.

78
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,450

frame scatter plot and polyfit,
