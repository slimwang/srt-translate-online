1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,140
So how can we answer?

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,454
Of course, one is cheaper but
the risk reduction is also lot smaller,

3
00:00:05,454 --> 00:00:06,709
it's 150 only.

4
00:00:06,709 --> 00:00:08,733
And it's the cheaper because it's 100K,
but

5
00:00:08,733 --> 00:00:11,200
the risk is only reduced by 150 here.

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,440
Other one is two and
a half times as more expensive, but

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,240
it's reducing the risks lot more, 500K.

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,170
So, we said one way we can think
about it is risk leverage.

9
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,555
So the risk leverage was reduction
in risk, so the first case,

10
00:00:25,555 --> 00:00:29,626
it's 150, divided by the cost,
and that's 100.

11
00:00:29,626 --> 00:00:34,120
So the risk leverage is 1.5 for the
first solution, or the cheaper solution.

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:34,690
So this is 1.5.

13
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,464
For the more expensive
solution it's 500, the amount,

14
00:00:38,464 --> 00:00:43,209
this is how much the risk is reduced by,
divided by 250 which is the cost.

15
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:47,285
So risk leverage is higher for
the more expensive solution, and

16
00:00:47,285 --> 00:00:50,770
based on that reasoning you
would recommend this one.
