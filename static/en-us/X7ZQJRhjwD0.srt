00:00:01,222 --> 00:00:03,344
﻿Now we showed how useful it is to have an API

2
00:00:03,344 --> 00:00:05,822
for regular expressions that we can say

3
00:00:05,822 --> 00:00:15,379
for example plus an option, alternative of literal A, literal B

4
00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:18,899
and these function calls are convenient to manipulate

5
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:20,488
but that’s an awful lot to type,

6
00:00:20,488 --> 00:00:22,353
especially when the string notation for

7
00:00:22,353 --> 00:00:24,423
regular expressions is so much simpler,

8
00:00:24,423 --> 00:00:28,284
we can represent this as this simple string,

9
00:00:28,284 --> 00:00:31,938
and so what I want you to do in this homework

10
00:00:31,938 --> 00:00:34,750
is to write a grammar and a parser that maps

11
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,500
from this string to this expression.

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,019
So you should first define regular expression grammar

13
00:00:41,019 --> 00:00:43,150
using the tools that we’ve provided,

14
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,371
build the parser for that, that’s going to give you a tree,

15
00:00:45,371 --> 00:00:49,941
so when we parse let’s say, RE is our main symbol,

16
00:00:49,941 --> 00:00:52,725
then some text with this grammar

17
00:00:52,725 --> 00:00:54,827
then that’s going to give you some sort of tree,

18
00:00:54,827 --> 00:00:58,025
but it’s not quite this API form,

19
00:00:58,025 --> 00:01:02,373
so then I want you to write another function to convert

20
00:01:02,373 --> 00:01:05,259
from the tree to the API,

21
00:01:05,259 --> 00:01:06,810
and so here’s what it looks like.

22
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,704
You are going to define your grammar,

23
00:01:08,704 --> 00:01:10,968
RE is going to be the main left-hand side symbol

24
00:01:10,968 --> 00:01:13,225
to parse the regular expression that’s given for you,

25
00:01:13,225 --> 00:01:15,179
you parse it and convert it

26
00:01:15,317 --> 00:01:17,994
and then you have to convert this

27
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:21,019
to make that cause into the API.
