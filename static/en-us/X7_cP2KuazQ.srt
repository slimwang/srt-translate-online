00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,418
Most of us know the story of the Shepard boy that cried wolf.

2
00:00:04,418 --> 00:00:08,010
The moral is that, of building trust.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,311
Model building is no different.

4
00:00:10,311 --> 00:00:14,692
For any model to be useful, it needs to be verifiable.

5
00:00:14,692 --> 00:00:19,089
In fact, we have already looked through several examples,

6
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:23,830
where we have iterated through the questioning, modeling, and

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,290
verification steps, to build robust models.

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,650
In this lesson, we will take a closer look at what it means to verify a model,

9
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:38,019
and how you, the model builder, can go about doing so.

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:44,830
We will go through several examples, of how to make a classification model and

11
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:45,970
validate it.

12
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:51,130
We will touch upon, how we will obtain the best performance from a model and

13
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,500
define, what are the measures of performance.

14
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,340
We will also introduce to you, the quantitative tools to

15
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,260
compare different models and how to choose between them.

16
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:08,930
To illustrate this, we will use location data collected by AT&T's connected cars

17
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:14,330
and try to identify these cars based on the driving patterns over time.

18
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,860
So, let's get started
