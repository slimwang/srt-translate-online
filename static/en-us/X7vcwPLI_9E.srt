00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,560
We can capture the basic intuition behind work on cognitive architectures by

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,390
a simple equation, architecture plus content equals behavior.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,490
Let us look at this equation from two different perspectives.

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:17,000
First, imagine that you want to design an intelligent machine

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,430
that exhibits a particular kind of behavior. This equation says that,

6
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,510
in order to do that, you have to design the right architecture, and

7
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,680
then put the right kind of knowledge content into that architecture,

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,390
to get the behavior that you want from it. That's a complicated thing.

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,800
But suppose that I could fix the architecture for you. In that case,

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,410
if the architecture is fixed, I simply have to change the knowledge content to

11
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:47,950
get different behaviors, which is a really powerful idea. From a different

12
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,260
direction, suppose that we were trying to understand human behavior.

13
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,920
Now we could say, again, that the architecture is fixed, we could say that,

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,190
this behavior is arising because the knowledge content is different.

15
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,550
We can map now, behavior to content because the architecture is fixed.

16
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,150
That simplifies our understanding of how to design machines or how to understand

17
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:18,830
human cognition. By the way, the same thing happens in computer architecture.

18
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,430
I'm sure you have, are familiar with computer architecture.

19
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:25,860
Computer architecture has stored programs in it, that's the content, and

20
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,520
that running of the stored program gives you different behaviors.

21
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,992
The computer architecture doesn't change, the stored program keeps on changing,

22
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:36,820
to give you different kind of behaviors. Same idea with cognitive architectures.

23
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,200
Keep the architecture constant, change the content. Now, of course,

24
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,640
the big question will become,

25
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,830
what is a good architecture? And that's what we'll examine later.
