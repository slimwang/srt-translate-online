00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,291
Remember that the equation we had before.
If the amount of money that Grant would

2
00:00:05,303 --> 00:00:09,804
earn if all of his original orders had
gone through, was equal to 87w plus 72n.

3
00:00:09,914 --> 00:00:15,024
But this was before any orders had been
canceled. And in the last quiz, we just

4
00:00:15,036 --> 00:00:19,998
found out how much money Grant would have
earned from the orders that are now

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,511
canceled. And that was just equal to 3w
plus 12n dollars. A couple of quizzes ago,

6
00:00:24,602 --> 00:00:28,612
we also found an equation for Grant's
total future earnings, taking his canceled

7
00:00:28,624 --> 00:00:32,762
orders into account. Of course, it was a
pretty general equation, that didn't have

8
00:00:32,775 --> 00:00:36,781
any variables numbers in it yet. They said
that his total future earnings will be

9
00:00:36,793 --> 00:00:40,878
equal to the money from all the original
orders, minus the money he would have made

10
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,058
from the orders that are now canceled. So
let's combine all this information, using

11
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:49,401
substitutions, into a single equation, for
Grant's total future earnings. Earnings.

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,091
So which of these expressions down here
would correctly replace the question mark

13
00:00:54,103 --> 00:00:58,645
to come up with an equation for Grant's
total future earnings, taking the cost of

14
00:00:58,657 --> 00:00:59,476
each wiper and nozzle into account.
