1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,060
There's a philosophy in web development.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,830
New browser technologies
cannot break old websites.

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,009
Once a site has been built with
stable web standard technologies.

4
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:13,928
It should continue to work forever.

5
00:00:13,928 --> 00:00:18,270
HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript have evolved quite a bit.

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,160
We're currently on HTML version five.

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,720
Hence the five there.

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,000
And we're also on CSS version three,
notice the three.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And we usually call these HTML5 and
CSS3.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,800
Each new version has added new
features to the markup languages.

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,336
But few if any at all,
features have been removed.

12
00:00:38,336 --> 00:00:44,835
So, any website written for
browsers in 94, 95, or really any time,

13
00:00:44,835 --> 00:00:50,528
should look exactly the same
on browsers developed in 2016.

14
00:00:50,528 --> 00:00:54,537
As a result of adding more and
more features to these languages,

15
00:00:54,537 --> 00:00:58,370
there are lots of ways to
solve problems on the web.

16
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,700
And here are just a few that
you'll be learning about soon.

17
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,440
But over time, best practices change.

18
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,950
But that doesn't mean that
yesterday's best practices just stop

19
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,250
working overnight.

20
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,460
Part of being a web developer
is staying up to date and

21
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,260
being able to discern old from new.

22
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,940
Or last year's gold standard
from tomorrow's tech.

23
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:24,980
Now, to be fair with these examples
in particular, all of these are very,

24
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,350
very valid ways to develop websites.

25
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,609
But there are some differences and
some features are newer than others.

26
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:37,170
In fact, web technologies
are constantly changing.

27
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,470
New ones are popping up all the time and

28
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:43,920
even the stable ones are changing
on a scale of weeks, it seems like.

29
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,450
And as I said before,
we can't possibly teach you

30
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:52,790
everything that there is to know about
the world wide web's technologies.

31
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,428
Instead, we want to teach
you how to stay up to date.

32
00:01:56,428 --> 00:02:01,088
We want you to develop opinions about
new technologies as they come out.

33
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:04,540
And we want you to keep learning so
that you keep having fun, and

34
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,180
you keep building websites.
