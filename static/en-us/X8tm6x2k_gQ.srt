1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,100
Alright Michael, you ready?

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:01,819
>> Yeah.

3
00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:03,540
>> Okay. What's the answer? Walk me through.

4
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,340
>> I will walk you through. Alright. So

5
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,320
let's, let's do this. Let's write the Euclidean distance.

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,180
Well let's write the Manhattan distance, because I don't,

7
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,440
I don't want to take square root to my head.

8
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:11,880
>> Okay.

9
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,190
>> Let's write the Manhattan distances next to the Xs.

10
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,230
>> OKay.

11
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:15,910
>> Or the Ys.

12
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:16,230
>> Alright.

13
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,170
>> Either way.

14
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,680
>> Let's do it next to the Xs. So this is

15
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,690
the Manhattan distance or MD as the cool kids call it.

16
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,610
>> [LAUGH]

17
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:25,400
>> Is that true?

18
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:25,720
>> Yea.

19
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,840
>> The cool kids called it L one.

20
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,650
>> No, no, no have you ever heard a cool kid ever say something like L one?

21
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,580
>> Well, to me the cool kids are the people

22
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,190
at neps who know more math than I do. Yea, do

23
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,180
you think any of them are going to watch this video?

24
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,210
Actually I'm afraid all of them are going to watch this video.

25
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,740
>> Now I'm really afraid.

26
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,730
>> Mm-Hm so you better get it right, every ones watching.

27
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,340
>> All right, well let me do, let me complete the Manhattan distances.

28
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,620
So the first one what you do is you take the 1 minus 4.

29
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,143
>> Mm-Hm.

30
00:00:51,143 --> 00:00:54,700
>> And that's three. And you take the 6 minus 2 and that's 4. And you add the

31
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,390
two together and you get 7. Which interestingly is

32
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,380
the same as y, but I think that's a coincidence.

33
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,796
>> Okay. [CROSSTALK]

34
00:01:03,796 --> 00:01:05,821
>> And now I'll do all the rest of them

35
00:01:05,821 --> 00:01:10,000
'cause I pre-computed them of Four, six, eight, four, six. Alright,

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,480
so now we've got it set up so we can do

37
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,740
one and three nearest neighbor relatively quickly. So, the one nearest

38
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,520
neighbor, the closest distance, is four.

39
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,340
>> Mm--hm.

40
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,860
>> But unfortauntely there are two points

41
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,290
that have that two comma four in set

42
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,350
number one. We have outputs of eight and

43
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,680
50 because they. Almost agree with each other.

44
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,913
>> Uh-huh.

45
00:01:27,913 --> 00:01:32,940
>> Not. And if we take the average of those two things we get 29.

46
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,990
>> Yep. That is correct Michael.

47
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:41,380
>> Great now in terms of the three nearest neighbors we have the fours and

48
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:41,910
the sixes.

49
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,038
>> So the four, three nearest neighbors.

50
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:45,413
>> Yep.

51
00:01:45,413 --> 00:01:50,970
>> Somewhat awkwardly. And the we have the average of those things which is

52
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,760
what. Eight, fifty and sixteen and sixty

53
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,060
eight which gets us thirty five point five.

54
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,640
>> Right. Obviously. [LAUGH] Okay. Alright,

55
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,540
so that was pretty straightforward. And those

56
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,110
answers aren't too far off from one another. So what about the Euclidean case?

57
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:06,930
>> Alright,

58
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,530
so one thing to point out. I, I was worried

59
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,620
about computing square roots but it occurs to me that

60
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,020
I actually don't have to compute square roots because that's

61
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,170
the monotonic transformation, and we only care about the orders.

62
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,240
>> Hm, okay.

63
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,450
>> So for Euclidean distance, or as I like to call him casually, ED,

64
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,220
>> Mmhm.

65
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,460
>> We can just take the square differences summed up.

66
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,170
>> Okay, so this would be ED squared.

67
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,130
>> Yes, it would be ED squared.

68
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,590
>> Okay, ED.

69
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,040
>> Good.

70
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,394
So the first one, it'll be the one minus four is three, squared is nine. And the

71
00:02:37,394 --> 00:02:42,960
6 minus 2 is 4, squared is 16. And 9 plus 16 is 25. So the first one will be 25.

72
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,960
>> And notice the square of 25 is pretty easy to compute.

73
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,730
>> Yeah, but the other ones aren't going to be. It just

74
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,960
so happens that we've got a pythagorean triple on our hands.

75
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,430
>> Mm. I love those.

76
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:57,006
>> Al right so the remaining ones, the x squared are eight,

77
00:02:57,006 --> 00:02:59,310
26, 40, ten, and 20.

78
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,310
>> Hm, none of

79
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,780
those are easily square rootable.

80
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,840
>> Exactly, though 40 feels like it really was trying and failed.

81
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,190
>> Yeah. An eight over shot and now it's

82
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,120
a perfect cube. So, eight is the smallest distance.

83
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,400
>> Yep.

84
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,660
>> And again, seemingly, coincidentally, they

85
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,450
Y value associated with that, is eight.

86
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,460
>> Hm.

87
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,139
>> So an eight, eight is our answer.

88
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,660
>> Good and that's correct.

89
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,480
>> And the three closest are eight, ten and 20.

90
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:28,620
>> Mm-hmm.

91
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,120
>> And if we

92
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:37,610
average the Y values for those that's eight, 50 and 68, which gives us

93
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:42,910
an average of 42. The meaning of life, the universe. And pretty much everything?

94
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,820
>> Yes! And that is absolutely correct. So that's kind of That's kind

95
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,950
of cool that you get completely different answers depending upon what you do.

96
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,800
>> Yeah, it does seem very different, doesn't it?

97
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,290
I mean there's like several orders of magnitude spread here.

98
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,280
>> Well, that's.

99
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,940
>> Maybe not orders of magnitude but orders of doubling.

100
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,390
>> Yes, there are orders of doubling spread. Well, you know what

101
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,260
Michael, I actually had a specific function in mind when I did this.

102
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,400
>> Okay! Let's find out which one is the right one!

103
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,900
>> Well, the function I had was Y was equal to the

104
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,780
first dimension squared plus the second dimension. So, let's call that X1

105
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:19,010
and X2, and this was actually the function that I had in

106
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,240
place. So, you square the first term and you add the second.

107
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,460
>> Okay, and

108
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,200
so like looking at the second last one, for example, seven

109
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,020
squared is 49 plus one is 50 Oh, [UNKNOWN]. It's very consistent.

110
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,120
>> Thank you. So what would be the actual answer for four comma two?

111
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,050
>> Okay so four squared is 16 plus two is 18. Which is close to none of them.

112
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:43,980
>> Right. So there's a lesson here, there's several lessons

113
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,700
here. And one lesson I don't want you to take away.

114
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,750
So here's the lesson. So I actually had a

115
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,540
real function here. There was no noise. It was fairly

116
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,410
well represented. The proper answer was 18 and basically none

117
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,810
of these are right. But the first thing I want

118
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,560
you to notice is you get completely different answers, depending

119
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,760
upon exactly whether you do one versus three, whether you

120
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,920
do Euclidean versus Manhattan. And that's because these things make

121
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,510
assumptions about your domain that might not be particularly relevant.

122
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,250
And this sort of suggests, that maybe this thing

123
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:23,090
doesn't do very well. Uh, kNN doesn't do very well because

124
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,310
none of these are close to 18. That seems

125
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,380
a little sad. But I've good new for you Michael.

126
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,120
>> Okay.

127
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,970
>> The good news is that, actually kNN tends to

128
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,980
work really, really well. Especially given it's simplicity, it just

129
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,150
doesn't in this particular case. And there's really a reason

130
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,800
for that, and it has to do with this sort of.

131
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,040
Fundamental assumptions in bias of kNN, I happen to pick an example that

132
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,340
sort of violates some of that bias. So I think it's worth to take a moment

133
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:54,500
to think about what the preference bias is for kNN and to see

134
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,730
if that can lead us to understanding why

135
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,300
we didn't get anything close to 18 here.

136
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,580
>> Okay that sounds useful.

137
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,620
>> Okay, so let's do that.
