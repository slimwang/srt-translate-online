1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,899
Have you ever been asked to do
something, and then given no guidelines

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:06,949
on what it should look like or
what you should include?

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,589
Imagine if you'd asked the Udacity
ask you to complete a project and

4
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:10,890
gave you no free break.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,210
I'm sure that would be frustrating.

6
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,519
Knowing what the employer wants gives
you direction in your application, and

7
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:20,280
will make it easier for you to edit your
resume and prepare for the interview.

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,850
You want to be someone who can perform
the necessary job functions, and

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,370
help drive the mission and
goals of the company.

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:30,200
The best employee not only has the
technical proficiencies, but passion for

11
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:31,699
the job they're doing.

12
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:36,320
Take Udacity, everyone who works at
Udacity is passionate about education.

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,639
Even if you are a leader in your
field if you aren't interested in

14
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:42,418
education you'll not be a good fit for
this company.

15
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:46,475
Let's walk through how you would find
out what the employer is looking for and

16
00:00:46,475 --> 00:00:49,173
how you can communicate
that in your application.

17
00:00:49,173 --> 00:00:51,799
I'm currently on the jobs
page of Udacity.com.

18
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:55,365
Before I even open a job posting I
can make inferences about the job.

19
00:00:55,365 --> 00:00:58,789
For example,
Udacity is hiring in multiple countries,

20
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:01,649
so their products and
programs are international.

21
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,090
I'd make sure to include in my resume or
cover letter, any past experiences

22
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:08,480
working with international teams and how
I resolved conflicts that may come up

23
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,780
from logistics in collaborating across
different time zones, for example.

24
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,780
I also see words like community,
partner, and mentorship a lot.

25
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,820
That tells me Udacity is looking
to build a worldwide community for

26
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:20,949
its students.

27
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,719
So I want to include in my application
my passion for connecting people.

28
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:27,929
I think I have a pretty clear idea
about what's important to Udacity, but

29
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,510
sometimes it's not clear immediately
what a company is looking for.

30
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,379
Browsing through the rest of
the website usually helps.

31
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,469
Now, I'm on the home page and the words
that pop out as I'm scrolling down are,

32
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:42,996
innovation, student community,
industry-recognized, data, mobile,

33
00:01:42,996 --> 00:01:45,359
face-to-face, job-ready.

34
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,760
This helps me answer the question that I
will want to address in my cover letter,

35
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,070
and will definitely be
asked in an interview.

36
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,529
Why do you want to work at Udacity?

37
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:57,510
I may answer that I want to use my
skills to help make online education

38
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:01,170
more personable by connecting students
to real people or make sure Udacity

39
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,890
curriculum not only teaches students but
helps them get a job in emerging field.

40
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:10,159
This exercise took only a couple
minutes but was really insightful.

41
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:13,139
Before doing this, I may have
assumed Udacity's mission was to

42
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:15,750
produce quality content
with top tech companies.

43
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,240
Sure, that's a goal, but their mission
seems to be about making education

44
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:24,189
accessible worldwide and making sure
that education helps students get jobs.

45
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:27,419
Being able to connect to a company's
mission is the difference between being

46
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:29,639
qualified for the job and
landing the job offer.

47
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:34,209
You may also want to pursue jobs that
you may not have the experience or

48
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,360
background for.

49
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,210
Showing that you understand what's
important to the company and

50
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,719
that you're going to do everything
you can to help drive the mission

51
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:45,650
makes the employer more inclined to take
a chance on you and hire you anyway.

52
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,080
That worked for me.

53
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,110
At one of my first jobs,
my boss told me that I had the least

54
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,110
amount of experience out of
everyone they interviewed.

55
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,870
However, I was so excited about the work
they were doing that she was confident I

56
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,450
would be valuable to
the organization and she hired me.
