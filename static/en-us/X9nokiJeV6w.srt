00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,520
When you drag and
drop a file into a folder,

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,350
you're taking advantage of a computer's
GUI, or graphical user interface.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,320
You're not actually taking a file and
putting it into a folder, but

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,490
it's a useful way of visually
representing a moved file.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,250
The reality is,
computers don't have eyes, for now, and

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,740
that visual interface is just for
humans.

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,060
To speak directly to a computer,
you can use a command line interface,

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,540
which may look familiar if
you've ever seen The Matrix.

9
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,340
Programmers use the command line
because there are certain tasks that

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,310
simply can't be done with a GUI.

11
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,880
In fact,
anything you can do with your mouse

12
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,140
can be done from the command line, too.

13
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,610
Proficiency working with your computer
in this way will speed up your workflow

14
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,000
and prepare you for life as a developer.
