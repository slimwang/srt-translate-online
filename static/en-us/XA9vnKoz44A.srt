00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,340
Okay, Charles, so what do you, what do you think about this?

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,630
>> Wait, how old are my children?

3
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,950
>> Let's say what their adult height is going to be.

4
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:10,610
>> I would expect them to be a little bit smaller than me.

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,735
>> A little bit smaller than you?

6
00:00:12,735 --> 00:00:13,379
>> Mm-hmm.

7
00:00:13,379 --> 00:00:15,251
>> So, so their, the average height, their

8
00:00:15,251 --> 00:00:17,487
average height of your children, you would you say

9
00:00:17,487 --> 00:00:19,810
it would be like an average height person?

10
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,310
Or like your height or sort of in between?

11
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:22,170
>> In between.

12
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,660
>> In between. All right. So it

13
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,720
turns out that if you actually do this, you measure people's

14
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,830
heights and you measure the heights of their children, that that

15
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,860
is in fact what you tend to see. That very, very

16
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,560
tall people, like you tend to have taller than average children.

17
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,770
But the height is between. It actually regresses to the mean.

18
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,760
And here we really do mean regresses in the sense of

19
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,420
going back to this kind of more primitive state that, if

20
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,440
you think about average height people, as being like your ancestors,

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,347
then, you know, you as a, as a very tall

22
00:00:53,347 --> 00:00:55,950
person tend to have kids that that tend regress back

23
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:00,240
toward that average value that sort of, more older, more

24
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,030
ancient value. So does that that make some sense to you?

25
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,630
>> That makes some sense. But one comment and

26
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,970
one question. Comment, that is awesome because I've always actually

27
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,890
wondered what regresses to the mean actually means. The second,

28
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,708
what prevents us from all being the same height then?

29
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,300
>> Yes, so what,

30
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,940
what seems to be happening is that there's a kind of a noisy process and some

31
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,410
people turn out to be taller, but then

32
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,140
the, then the next generation there's a little

33
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,750
bit of a history effect in people stay

34
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,540
taller, but it tends to drift back towards

35
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,210
the mean. So it's, so it's, it's sort of like a random walk, to some extent.

36
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,220
>> Oh, that actually kind of makes sense.
