00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,227
Now not every right triangle will have a special ratio. For example this right

00:00:04,227 --> 00:00:07,566
triangle will not be in the ratio of the Pythagorean triples that we've seen

00:00:07,566 --> 00:00:12,494
before. But using Pythagorean Theorem, I know you can find this missing side

00:00:12,494 --> 00:00:14,430
length, what is it.
