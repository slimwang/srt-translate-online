00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,980
>> Now that we've reminded ourselves of what a square root sign actually means,

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,948
what do you think the next step in moving towards solving our equation should

3
00:00:07,948 --> 00:00:12,182
be? Remember, we want to get x by itself on one side of the equation eventually.

4
00:00:12,182 --> 00:00:16,059
So should we start off by multiplying both sides by the quantity 2x plus 4?

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:20,546
Should we multiply both sides by the square root of 2x plus 4? Should we square

6
00:00:20,546 --> 00:00:25,704
both sides, or should we multiply both sides by 2? Clearly these are all steps

7
00:00:25,704 --> 00:00:30,272
that we could take and would be legal in the context of solving equations. But

8
00:00:30,272 --> 00:00:34,461
which one will actually move us as close to our answer as we can get in one

9
00:00:34,461 --> 00:00:34,835
step?
