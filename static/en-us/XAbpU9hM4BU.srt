1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,059
Let's fix the issue of determining when
we should transition to the second

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:05,430
view controller.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,170
We can do this by changing the segue
to only be called from code, and

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,540
not to directly by the storyboard when
we pressed the stop recording button.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,510
We know that we're recording our voice
that records sounds view controller.

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,100
Once recording is finished, we need to
send that file over to the second scene.

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,389
The play sounds view controller.

8
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,970
How do we change the current segue
to be called just by code and

9
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,450
not from a UI button?

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,189
If you look in the main
dot storyboard file here,

11
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,240
we can see the two scenes
are connected via a segue.

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,040
In particular this segue's wired
up to the stop recording button,

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,490
every time this button is pressed,
Storyboard will perform the segue.

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,740
What we really want is to be able to
call this segue programmatically,

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,190
once we know that the AV audio recorder
has finished writing out the file.

16
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:54,270
This is easy to do,
let me walk you through it now.

17
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,880
Let's start by deleting
the current segue,

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,950
select the segue here in the document
outline, and press the delete key.

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,390
Xcode will complain that
the second scene is unreachable

20
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,620
since we have no way to segue into it
from anywhere else in the storyboard.

21
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:13,370
You can see that warning in the Xcode
status bar here, to fix the warning and

22
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,710
set up a segue that we can
control programmatically.

23
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:16,820
I'll hold Control key and

24
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,330
drag from the first View Controller
to the second View Controller.

25
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,910
The easiest way to do this is
from the document outline.

26
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,050
I'll expand the view
controller scene here so

27
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,330
that I can see both view controllers.

28
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,770
From the record sound view controller,
with the control key held down,

29
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:35,215
I'll drag into the view controller and
select show segue.

30
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,480
Now that these two scenes are connected
via segue, we can have the storyboard

31
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,700
perform the segue by calling
a function named perform seg.

32
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,110
We'll set up the perform seg call
shortly, but in order to distinguish

33
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:50,750
this segue from any other one,
we need to give it a unique name.

34
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,520
Select the segue here in
the document outline, and

35
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,190
in the Attributes Inspector,
let's give it a unique identifier.

36
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,964
I've given it the name stopRecording,

37
00:01:58,964 --> 00:02:00,850
these names are case
sensitive by the way.

38
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,055
Make sure you spell it correctly.

39
00:02:03,055 --> 00:02:06,538
Next we need to know when
AV Audio Recorder has finished

40
00:02:06,538 --> 00:02:08,970
writing out the recorded voice file.

41
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,200
To do that we need to use
a concept called delegation.
