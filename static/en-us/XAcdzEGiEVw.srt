This solution is positive 20. Great thinking if you found this number. To find

2
00:00:05,955 --> 00:00:11,952
g of f of 5, we first want to find the f of 5. We'll find the output for f when

3
00:00:11,952 --> 00:00:15,905
the input is 5, and then we'll take that output, and plug it in to g to get a

4
00:00:15,905 --> 00:00:21,986
new output. F was my tripling function, so I know the f of five would be 3

5
00:00:21,986 --> 00:00:29,890
times 5 which equals 15. So we know the output of f when the input is 5 is 15.

6
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:35,381
So we can replace this f of 5 with the number 15. So now we just need to find

7
00:00:35,381 --> 00:00:41,179
the g of 15 to get our answer. So when x equals 15, we'll plug that in here to

8
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:48,000
get a new output. So plugging in 15 in for x here, we'll get 15 plus 5, which

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,032
equals 20. That's how we know that g of f of 5 equals 20.
