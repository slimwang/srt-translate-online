00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,035
Let's do 1 last example using sum and difference of cubes. If we have the

2
00:00:04,035 --> 00:00:08,150
expression 125Z cubed minus 1, how can we factor this? Remember that the

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:12,242
variables that we picked in the initial original equations are just place

4
00:00:12,242 --> 00:00:16,391
holders. It does not matter that we're using the variable Z here and that

5
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:20,484
there's 1 present over here. All that matters in a given expression is the

6
00:00:20,484 --> 00:00:24,417
relationship of the 2 terms to one another. The fact that this variable and this

7
00:00:24,417 --> 00:00:27,617
variable happen to have the same name does not mean that they are necessarily

8
00:00:27,617 --> 00:00:28,160
connected.
