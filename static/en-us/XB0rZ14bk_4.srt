00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And here is my answer, to return the probability of heads given a set of probabilities of heads

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and a set of probabilities for each coin, we just need to add up the probability

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
of head for each coin multiplied by the probability it could be that coin.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
To do that, I will just use this nifty little Python feature

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
that lets me walk through these lists together called zip.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We'll just take two lists and gives me the first two items, then the next two items, then next two items

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and so on and I call the probability of a coin coming up heads p coin

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and the probability of it being that coin p.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And so we just need to multiply those two things together and Python has a nice little sum functions

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
which sums up the whole thing and we will just return that.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Now the slightly trickier bit is this update piece.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:02,000
First to make my life easier, I'll just store the current value of the probability of heads.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We need this because if you recall the denominator of Bayes' Rule is the probability of the result.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Now if the result is heads, we want to update our probabilities using the

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
same basic method of walking through these two lists together.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We're going to update this by taking the probability for the given coin and

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:38,000
multiplying it by the probability that we would have gotten that result that is p coin

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
which is just the entry from coins which is the probability of heads for that coin

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and since we'd got heads that is the probability of the result given that it's the coin

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and we just divide it by the total probability of it being heads

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and if it's tails, we just need to do the reverse.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The probability of having tails given that it's a certain coin

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
is just going to be 1 minus the probability with being heads.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Again, we have to multiply it by the probability that it's that coin in the first place

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and then we again just divide by the total probability of it being tails which is just

26
00:02:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
one minus the probability of being heads.
