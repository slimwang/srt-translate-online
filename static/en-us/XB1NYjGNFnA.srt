1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now the other thing is that in a resegmented market and again we use Southwest

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
as a low-cost entry or whole foods as a unique niche supplier via positioning

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and what you really want to start asking is what factors can you eliminate that your industry

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
has long competed on or what can you reduce below the industry standard

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
or raise above the industry standard or what can be created that the industry has never offered?

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Now what's interesting is if you look at the chasm between your early adopters,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
your early evangelists and the mainstream market in a resegmented market

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
this is what Moore was kind of talking about called the chasm.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
There really is a gap between what these people want and a gap between their needs.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And if you're not careful your sales curve well it would start looking like this over here

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and actually might collapse until the mainstream adopts.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So let's take a look at what a sales curve might look like in a resegmented market.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And it's a complex sales growth chart because in the first couple of years

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
you're just kind of getting the spillover of people who kind of think you're just

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
a competitor in the existing market and your sales will kind of toddle along until if you're correct

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and you were right about that niche or low-cost segmentation

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
you will start seeing an exponential increase in sales.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And if you're wrong, well you'll just kind of be one of the many competitors

19
00:01:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
in an existing market.
