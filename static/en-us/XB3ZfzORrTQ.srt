The last term in this section that we're going to talk about is the idea of

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:08,709
metacognitive thinking. In metacognitive thinking, is the process that includes

3
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:14,220
the ability to first think and then to reflect on one's own thinking. So it's

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:19,022
thinking about thinking. So if you ponder how to solve a particular problem,

5
00:00:19,022 --> 00:00:22,926
and you first think about the solution and then you think about the process to

6
00:00:22,926 --> 00:00:28,806
get to that solution, that's metacognitive thinking. Now this ability is not

7
00:00:28,806 --> 00:00:33,362
universal. Without specific training, many people have difficulty questioning

8
00:00:33,362 --> 00:00:35,100
their own thinking.
