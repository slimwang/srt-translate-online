1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,860
Next up, we have Bake GI, which is
what we're primarily interested in for

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:05,950
our apartment.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,390
Like with real time GI,
we can set our Baked resolution

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,760
to control how much data we store for
each calculation.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,495
Since we're on mobile,
this value is actually pretty important.

6
00:00:15,495 --> 00:00:17,940
We want to set this value high enough so

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,390
that the resolution of
our lighting is good.

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,650
But not too high that we run
into performance issues.

9
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,100
So let's set it to 20.

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,920
The next property is padding, which is
the separation between all of the Baked

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,810
calculations we do for every object.

12
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,398
Currently, it's set to 2.

13
00:00:34,398 --> 00:00:37,554
If you go to the Lightmaps tab and
look very closely,

14
00:00:37,554 --> 00:00:42,240
you might be able to see some small
spacing in between each image.

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,250
Now let's play around with this and set
the padding to 20 and then hit Build.

16
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,110
Now once it's built, let's go ahead and
look at our light map.

17
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,950
As you can see, there's a lot more
spacing between images in our light map.

18
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,260
But of course we're taking up
a lot more space in the map.

19
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,460
In general, we want to keep the spacing
small so as to take up less space,

20
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:10,050
which again is really important
on mobile for efficiency.

21
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,005
Let's go ahead and
set it back down to 2.

22
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:19,105
Another property we can play around
with is indirect resolution.

23
00:01:19,105 --> 00:01:20,675
As you can probably guess from the name,

24
00:01:20,675 --> 00:01:24,677
it's another map to capture
indirect lighting calculations.

25
00:01:24,677 --> 00:01:27,547
Just like with our Baked light we don't
want to get extravagant with this

26
00:01:27,547 --> 00:01:30,657
property, so
we'll keep it at a value of 1.

27
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:35,667
We also have ambient occlusion,
which is a property that lets us control

28
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:39,218
how ambient light bounces off and
gets included by meshes.

29
00:01:40,218 --> 00:01:43,678
This property becomes most apparent
near the intersection of meshes

30
00:01:43,678 --> 00:01:45,768
like the walls for our apartment.

31
00:01:45,768 --> 00:01:49,880
Let's play with this by setting the max
distance on ambient occlusion to 10 and

32
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,977
then hitting Build.

33
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:53,160
[BLANK_AUDIO]

34
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,278
As you can see,
it creates a high contrast on our walls.

35
00:01:56,278 --> 00:01:59,550
So let's set it back down to 1 and
then hit Build.

36
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:06,238
The last property I want to
talk about is atlas size.

37
00:02:06,238 --> 00:02:09,860
This property lets us control the actual
size of the white map texture.

38
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:15,250
If you look at all the choices,
you'll see that they're all powers of 2.

39
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,760
This is because this allows Unity
to make performance optimizations.

40
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,320
If this value is too small,
it will result

41
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,470
in creating many small light map
textures, which is not optimal.

42
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,520
Too big, and
we'll be wasting space within our map.

43
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,636
Just to see what happens when
the light map is too small,

44
00:02:32,636 --> 00:02:35,436
let's set the atlas size to 128 and
hit Build.

45
00:02:35,436 --> 00:02:38,676
[BLANK_AUDIO]

46
00:02:38,676 --> 00:02:42,996
This results in getting many small
textures, which is something we want to

47
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:47,200
avoid, as this results in a lot of
wasted time indexing several files.

48
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,440
It just so happens that 1024 is
the smallest size that captures

49
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,080
all of our lighting
data into one texture.

50
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,810
So let's go ahead and
set it back to that.

51
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,536
And that covers all of the core
components of Baked GI.

52
00:03:00,536 --> 00:03:02,730
There are couple of properties
I skipped over, and

53
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,880
you can learn more about them
from Unity's documentation.

54
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,490
The last important section
to discuss is general GI.
