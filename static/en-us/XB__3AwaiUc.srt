1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,160
There are several problems
with this rule set.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,660
For example,
let's look at rule number four.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:10,890
This rule allows inbound traffic to
any destination port above 1023,

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,770
whereas, the original intent is
to allow an inbound traffic,

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,900
that is part of the email connection.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,970
In other words, it is more
permissive than its original intent.

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,760
For security purposes, we want to
make these rules more specific.

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,980
Therefore we can add another
condition to the rules.

9
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,590
This condition is on
the source port of the packet.

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,580
For example for rule number four,

11
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,800
our intent is to allow inbound traffic
that is part of an email connection.

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,370
Therefore the source port should be 25.

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,830
We can make these rules
even more precise.

14
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,400
For example,
because the intent of rule number four,

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,190
is to allow inbound traffic, there's
part of a established email connection.

16
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:55,570
We will want to check the ackbit of the
packet, and make sure that it is set.

17
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,600
This is because in TCP,
once a connection is set up,

18
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,910
the TCP flag in the TCP header is set.

19
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,140
So we can check this bit,

20
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,250
to make sure that the inbound packet
is part of an establish connection.
