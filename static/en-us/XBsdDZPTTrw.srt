00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,220
So what does it mean to
be a first-class type?

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:07,687
It means that you can use closures just
like any other type, such as ints,

3
00:00:07,687 --> 00:00:09,288
floats, strings, etc.

4
00:00:09,288 --> 00:00:13,910
You may assign them to variables and
constants.

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,450
You may put them inside arrays,
or dictionaries,

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,640
or actually any collection.

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,948
You can return them from functions and
closures.

8
00:00:22,948 --> 00:00:27,760
And you can receive them as parameters
of another function or closure.

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,230
This last part sure sounds weird, so
let's get started with the easy ones.

10
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,930
Grab a playground, and let's play.
