1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,228
Let's update
the testInsertReadDb test

2
00:00:03,228 --> 00:00:06,066
to use the WeatherProvider
to get the weather query.

3
00:00:06,066 --> 00:00:09,900
We'll start by changing the name
to testInsertReadProvider.

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,530
So, all we need to do
is take this db query

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,590
and replace it with
the equivalent content provider one,

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,230
which gets the ContentResolver,

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,320
and then queries the CONTENT_URI.

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,670
Now, the ContentProvider one
doesn't take a few of these parameters.

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:29,360
For example, it doesn't take TABLE_NAME,
because that's implied by the URI,

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,640
nor does it support group by.

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,546
The rest of it should work pretty well.

12
00:00:33,546 --> 00:00:36,211
Now let's run the test
and verify that it passes.

13
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:39,598
(silence)

14
00:00:39,598 --> 00:00:41,005
And the test still passes.

15
00:00:41,905 --> 00:00:45,032
(laughing) Again, it's very easy
to substitute out something

16
00:00:45,032 --> 00:00:47,750
that calls directly to the database
with a content provider.
