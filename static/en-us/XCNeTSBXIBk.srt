1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I now what to quiz you about dynamic programming.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Consider the following 3 x 3 world with a goal state in the corner over here.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Say the value of the goal state is defined to be zero.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The cost of motion is 1.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Quickly fill in the values for all the other cells over here,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
assuming you can either move straight or diagonally.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
In both cases the cost of motion is 1.
