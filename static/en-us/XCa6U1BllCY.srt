1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,160
Let's have a look at
text alternative images.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,630
We can use the old attribute to
provide a text alternative images.

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,480
However, we need to think about what
role an image plays in the page

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,800
to work out what type of text
alternative it should have.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,350
Let's have another look at this
newspaper page from the previous lesson.

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,360
I've got VoiceOver running and

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,390
I'm going to use the mouse pointer
Moves VoiceOver Cursor option

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,130
to let me quickly inspect things for
VoiceOver.

9
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,880
Now, you probably don't want
this on all of the time.

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,990
But it can be good for
quickly testing things.

11
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,700
>> HTML content.
>> All right.

12
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,120
So here, we have a picture of a cat
illustrating that article on cats.

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,942
VoiceOver announces this has.

14
00:00:35,942 --> 00:00:41,410
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Okay, so that was pretty sub optimal.

15
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,420
I can pull up div tools on the image and

16
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:50,440
add an alt attribute which says a cat
staring menacingly off into space.

17
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,560
All right, so
now I can try VoiceOver again

18
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,563
>> VoiceOver on Chrome, HTML content,

19
00:00:54,563 --> 00:00:57,648
a cat staring menacingly off into space.

20
00:00:57,648 --> 00:01:00,290
>> And now you have a nice succinct
description of the image and

21
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,070
move on to the article.

22
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,940
A couple comments on the alt attribute.

23
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,342
Alt allows you to specify a simple
string to be used whenever an image is

24
00:01:09,342 --> 00:01:13,445
not available, whether the image
fails to load like it has here or

25
00:01:13,445 --> 00:01:16,451
you're a web crawling bot or a screen.

26
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:21,771
Alt differs from any other type
of caption, including a title,

27
00:01:21,771 --> 00:01:27,560
in that it will only be used
if the image isnâ€™t available.

28
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,610
Caption or title typically
provides extra context for

29
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:34,250
the image,
rather than an alternative to the image.

30
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,800
Writing useful alt text
is a bit of an art.

31
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,030
In order for a string to be a usable
text alternative it needs to convey

32
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:44,020
the same thing as the image
in the given context.

33
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:48,720
To give a more complex example, we have
that logo image in the masthead link.

34
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,730
That link is going to take
us back to the homepage.

35
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,840
So it might be tempting
to write home here.

36
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,660
That's not a functional
alternative to the image.

37
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,880
It's actually going to create
a more confusing experience,

38
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,750
because then we might get the idea that
it's an image of some kind of home.

39
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:08,030
Instead, we can describe this image
pretty accurately simply as The Funion.

40
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,830
You may or may not want to explicitly
call out that it's a logo, but

41
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,770
given it's an image, that's more or
less implied anyway.

42
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,800
An easy way to check whether
alt text is sensible,

43
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,110
is to imagine all your
images are broken.

44
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,440
Can you still understand
the page content?

45
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,230
Now there's one image I left in here
that I'd like to take a closer look at.

46
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,560
You have this magnifying glass logo,
inside the search link.

47
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,731
If I checked it out with the VoiceOver,
>> Magnifying

48
00:02:31,731 --> 00:02:34,430
glass,
>> I can hear that we've hopefully

49
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:39,870
added an alt text of magnifying glass,
but if I inspect the link as a whole.

50
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,970
>> Magnifying glass search link.

51
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,240
>> We can hear that it
is actually redundant.

52
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,490
>> Magnifying glass search doesn't
convey anything that search doesn't.

53
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,390
How do we know that if we leave the alt
text out, we'll probably hear the image

54
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,320
file name which we already saw as
a potentially horrible experience.

55
00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:00,350
So in this case, I'm going to
to use an empty alt text, and

56
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,048
we'll see what that does.

57
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:05,770
The empty alt text actually removed
the image from the accessibility tree

58
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,620
altogether, so the image is now
completely skipped by the screen reader.

59
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,550
In this case it's actually what we want,
because the image was redundant.
