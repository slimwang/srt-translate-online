00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,462
>> What do we mean by this? If we look at the middle number in this data, so

2
00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:09,390
let's cross off the top and bottom and let's cross off the next top and bottom,

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:14,336
and we're left with the middle. The middle number in each of these data don't

4
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:19,386
really represent the data. In fact, they're the smallest value in each of these

5
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:24,001
columns. So, what do we need to do to make the median a useful statistic that

6
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:28,985
can actually represent the data? Calculate the average? Put the data in order?

7
00:00:28,985 --> 00:00:32,679
Eliminate outliers? Or eliminate data values that repeat?
