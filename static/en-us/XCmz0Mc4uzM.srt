1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,455
So now that we understand
how services work,

2
00:00:02,455 --> 00:00:05,950
let's review how Android 
determines your app's priority.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,270
App priority is divided
into three general buckets.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,463
Critical, high, and low.

5
00:00:12,463 --> 00:00:15,626
Within each bucket the apps
are prioritized in a queue,

6
00:00:15,626 --> 00:00:18,800
with the app that's been
at the lowest priority for the longest

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,920
the first to be executed.

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,030
Critical apps are those
that are active.

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,530
They're in the foreground, 
interacting with users.

10
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,550
That includes activities
in the foreground,

11
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,993
and apps running 
foreground services.

12
00:00:29,993 --> 00:00:33,146
High priority apps, 
include any visible activities,

13
00:00:33,146 --> 00:00:35,520
and any application
with a running service.

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,050
While less impactful than 
killing a foreground app,

15
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,340
destroying visible activities
or cancelling services running tasks

16
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,833
like background updates,

17
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:45,116
is still going to be noticeable to users.

18
00:00:45,116 --> 00:00:48,620
So, the system will only kill them
in an extreme resource crunch.

19
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,520
Apps in the background though,

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,550
they're the red shirted ensigns
of the app priority landing party.

21
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,950
Any background app
will be killed as needed

22
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:59,110
in a last seen, first killed order,

23
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,080
in order to help support
the higher priority apps.

24
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,409
I like to think of this 
as the three laws

25
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:06,659
of Android resource management.

26
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,179
Law one, Android will keep
all apps that interact with the user

27
00:01:10,179 --> 00:01:11,640
running smoothly.

28
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,146
Android will keep all apps
with visible activities

29
00:01:14,146 --> 00:01:18,772
or running services running, 
unless doing so violates the first law.

30
00:01:18,772 --> 00:01:22,630
And third, Android will keep all apps
in the background running,

31
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,410
unless this violates 
the first or second laws.

32
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:29,040
So with all of that in mind, 
consider these four apps.

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,910
What do you think 
is the priority order

34
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,720
of each of these apps, 
according to the system?
