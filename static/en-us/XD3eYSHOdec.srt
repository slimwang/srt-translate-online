00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,939
Next up, let's take a look at actions,
or those behaviors that result in

2
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:08,140
rewards and stem from
the triggers that you sent users.

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,770
Here, you'll want to optimize your
model to eliminate your user's pain and

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,650
get them to interact with your app,

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,950
thereby increasing their
potential to spend money.

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,160
Ask yourself the following questions.

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,290
Where is the most challenging
action in your product?

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,480
Why is it challenging?

9
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,880
How can you test and
improve this action?

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,060
Here's a hint.

11
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,070
Analytics play a huge role in finding
answers that are based on data.

12
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,830
Take a minute and jot down how you might
use analytics to help identify and

13
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,410
eliminate these roadblocks.
