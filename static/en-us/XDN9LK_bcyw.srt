1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,480
So thus far, we've been able to record our sound, and

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,480
then print the name of the file where we actually recorded our voice.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,310
At this point,

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,280
I want us to consider two scenarios that can cause some trouble going forward.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,239
The first one has to do with our story board, so let me go back to Xcode.

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,630
Now we know that we are recording our voice in here in the first scene, or

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,330
in Record Sounds View Controller.

8
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,070
We also know that we need that recorded file in here,

9
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,150
in the second scene, or in Play Sounds View Controller.

10
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,640
Right now, when we hit this Stop button,

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,688
we move very promptly form this first scene, to the second scene.

12
00:00:33,688 --> 00:00:36,640
Do you think we will need to pass the audio file from

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,630
the first scene to the second scene?

14
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,840
If so, how would we go about doing that?

15
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,480
So here is the first scenario that we need to think deeply about.

16
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,670
The second scenario has to do with recording audio.

17
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,840
Right now the sounds that we are recording, are really short.

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,900
About five to ten seconds long.

19
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,040
What do you think will happen if our user records a conversation with

20
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,210
a friend for about five minutes?

21
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,130
I would imagine that it will take our phone some time to process that

22
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,380
audio properly.

23
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,800
Now picture this.

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,550
Our phone is in the middle of processing a really large sound file here in

25
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:07,207
the first scene,

26
00:01:07,207 --> 00:01:11,710
while we have pushed the stop button and moved on to the second scene, and

27
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,790
already started to play the audio that hasn't fully finished recording yet.

28
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,360
That could cause some troubles.

29
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,568
So then the question is,

30
00:01:18,568 --> 00:01:21,962
how will we know that the phone has successfully finished recording in

31
00:01:21,962 --> 00:01:25,084
the first scene, before we play that audio in the second scene?

32
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:28,113
Now, I want you to think about both of these scenarios, and

33
00:01:28,113 --> 00:01:30,657
then write down your reflections in these boxes,

34
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:33,460
on how you would go about solving both of these issues.
