1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,855
In my opinion, score on the Laraway personality test does not have an everyday

2
00:00:03,855 --> 00:00:07,405
meaning. In other words, you don't necessarily know what the scores on this

3
00:00:07,405 --> 00:00:11,980
test mean without specialized training. By the way, I just made this test up.

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,434
It doesn't really exist. Notice the rest of these, number of correct items on

5
00:00:15,434 --> 00:00:19,992
an exam, that has an everyday meaning. We all know what that means. Same with

6
00:00:19,992 --> 00:00:24,354
the number of minutes to fix a flat tire. And the number of hours slept. So in

7
00:00:24,354 --> 00:00:28,735
cases where we don't understand what the variable is telling us. A mean

8
00:00:28,735 --> 00:00:32,087
difference may not be the most informative measures. And for that reason,

9
00:00:32,087 --> 00:00:35,300
statisticians have developed other effect size measures, that we will now

10
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,540
discuss.
