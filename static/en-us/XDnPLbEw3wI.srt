00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,920
Sometimes when you search for
something in Firebase,

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,540
you get a huge number of responses,
but that's not always ideal.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,200
For example, sometimes you might want
to find the first 20 results, but

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,710
ignore the rest.

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,130
So for situations like this,

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,470
you want to truncate your query
results by using limit queries.

7
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:23,630
Firebase has two limit queries,
limitTofFirst and limitToLast.

8
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,890
Each method will limit the number
of children returned from a query.

9
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:31,540
For example, if you set a limit of
three, when you use limitToFirst,

10
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,880
the first three children will
be returned from the query.

11
00:00:34,925 --> 00:00:38,460
LimitToLast functions similarly
with the only difference being

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,090
that it will return
the last three children.

13
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:45,265
Both methods can be used with
orderByChild or orderByValue.

14
00:00:45,265 --> 00:00:48,035
OrderByChild to choose
which attribute to query.

15
00:00:48,035 --> 00:00:50,770
OrderByValue to return
a limited set of results for

16
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:51,867
something like a leader board.
