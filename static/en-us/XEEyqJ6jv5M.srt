1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,440
So based on your suggestion, Charles,

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:06,410
I wrote down a couple different
something elses that might be tried and

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,680
I want you to see if you can figure out
if any of these are actually any good.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,880
So the idea of maximum likelihood
would be to say, okay,

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,320
well we should figure out which arm
has the highest expected pay off and

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,920
choose that but
keep revisiting the question.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,050
So after you've done the pull,

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,720
recalculate your expected
values again and again.

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,590
Choose which one has
the highest expected value.

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:28,720
And just keep repeating that.

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,380
That way, as new data comes in,
we're factoring it into our decision.

12
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,330
>> And so there'd be a similar
argument for maximum confidence?

13
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,730
>> No.
Well, first of all,

14
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,390
I wanted you to kind of say whether or
not you thought that was a good idea.

15
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,450
>> That's a bad idea.

16
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,790
>> That's not a bad idea,
but it's a bad idea.

17
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,620
>> No, it's a bad idea.

18
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,000
So in this case,
if I look at a and b, right?

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,770
Who has the maximum likelihood?

20
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:50,350
B.

21
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,090
>> Right.

22
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,120
Well, the max.

23
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:52,760
Let me say it this way.

24
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,700
It's the maximum maximum
likelihood estimate.

25
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,710
>> The maximum maximum likelihood?

26
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,720
>> Right.
So the maximum likelihood estimate

27
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,446
for this is 0.5.

28
00:00:58,446 --> 00:00:59,690
>> Mm-hm.
>> And the maximum likelihood

29
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,020
estimate for this is 0.

30
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:01,610
>> Right.
>> And so

31
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,950
this one has the maximum
maximum likelihood estimate.

32
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:04,510
>> Right.

33
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,170
Sure.
Right.

34
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,230
So but here's the thing.

35
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,150
Since a has 0 and b has 0.5.

36
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,110
I should choose b.

37
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,500
But, no matter what happens from now
on when I choose b, b's likelihood,

38
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,180
b's expectation will always
be greater than 0, right.

39
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,270
>> Yeah.
>> So,

40
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,510
I mean it will begin to approach 0
after an infinite amount of time.

41
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,640
But even if I never see a payoff again,

42
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,730
it'll still be something
greater than zero.

43
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,970
>> Right.
>> Which means I will never,

44
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:28,540
ever look at a.

45
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,350
>> So what does this strategy
actually turn into in this case?

46
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,094
>> Always b.
>> Yeah, so that works 70% of the time.

47
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,160
>> [LAUGH]
>> That's true.

48
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,480
>> But that means 30% of
the time you're failing.

49
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,930
>> Right.
>> And we can do better than that,

50
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,450
we truly can do better than that.

51
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,150
All right, so maximum confidence
says now the strategy is

52
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:49,860
whichever one you have
the best estimates for.

53
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,970
You should choose that one.

54
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,150
>> Well that's a bad idea too.

55
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:52,710
>> All right.

56
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,580
Why is that?

57
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,150
>> Because whichever one I start out
with having the most confidence in,

58
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,110
I'm going to pull that,
that means I'll get more data,

59
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,060
which means I'll have more confidence.

60
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,400
>> So what would it do in this case?

61
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,100
This would be equivalent
to what strategy?

62
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,120
>> Always b.

63
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,900
>> Yeah, all right.

64
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,540
So this is, we now have two
other ways of saying, always b.

65
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,380
All right,
what about minimum confidence?

66
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,450
>> So you'll alternate between a and b?

67
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,340
>> Yes.

68
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,110
>> Well, you may not.

69
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,940
You'll eventually
alternate between a and b.

70
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,440
I don't know.

71
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:24,950
I guess you do a, and

72
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,170
then you would immediately have
the same amount of confidence.

73
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,190
So we have to break ties.

74
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,850
>> Yes, so if multiple things
had the same minimum confidence,

75
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,500
it doesn't matter which one you choose.

76
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,360
>> Right.
Although, I guess I would choose

77
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,329
the thing with the maximum likelihood,
minimum confidence.

78
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,620
On minimum confidence of
the maximum likelihood.

79
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,056
>> Oh, if you break that tie,
it doesn't matter.

80
00:02:46,056 --> 00:02:46,900
because what's going to happen is,

81
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,460
these are all,
all the counts are going to be equal.

82
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,070
Then you're going to choose one.

83
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,820
And then that one's going to have
some additional confidence, and

84
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,500
the other ones are going to be lower.

85
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,000
So you choose one of
the ones that are left.

86
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,130
You're going to end up going
round robin through all of them.

87
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,350
So at the beginning of each round,

88
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,670
you might break the ties
in some interesting way.

89
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,150
But then the rest of the round
you're going to be going through and

90
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,260
getting everybody up to
the same denominator.

91
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:08,780
>> That's true, but

92
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:13,270
given that at any given time,
you might take the bandits away from me,

93
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,560
I should always pick the thing with
the maximum likelihood to break the tie.

94
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,390
>> Sure.

95
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,692
>> But, your point is well made,
Michael.

96
00:03:18,692 --> 00:03:21,200
>> All right, thanks, but the point in
this case is that you could do this

97
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,330
minimum competence thing and
you're going to over time get better and

98
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,700
better estimates of
the payoffs of the two arms.

99
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,610
But you're never really going
to use that information.

100
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,380
>> That's true.

101
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,370
>> Right, so if you're always
choosing minimum confidence you're

102
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,420
really just going to be uniformly going
through and choosing all the arms.

103
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:39,650
It's not a strategy that's going to beat
either of these always a or always b.

104
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,450
Well, it's not going to be
always b in particular.

105
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,590
>> It'll be half the time always a and
half the time always b, so to speak.

106
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,960
So, it'll be 50%
>> Something like that.

107
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,650
>> Actually, it'll just be uniform
over all the things that you got.

108
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,940
>> Yeah, yeah, so it will never
actually be picking the better arm.

109
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,730
Or half the time.

110
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,360
I guess half of the pulls in any
infinite run will be on the better arm.

111
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,580
>> Well, one out of K.

112
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,720
>> Sure, if there's K arms.

113
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,810
Right.
In this case there's two arms.

114
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,980
But that's right.

115
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:03,660
Good.
All right, so

116
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,860
these are something else and these are
not better than always a or always b.

117
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,490
So we needed something else,
even something or else.

118
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,320
>> Okay.

119
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,370
It's going to be some
combination of these things.

120
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,589
>> It does seem like that ought to help.

121
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:22,220
So in particular maximum
likelihood is not a bad idea.

122
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,820
Minimum confidence is
also not a terrible idea,

123
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,300
because it is at least
bringing you new data.

124
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,450
But you want to somehow
balance these two.

125
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:35,280
And what we usually refer to this is is
the exploration exploitation dilemma.

126
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,980
>> Oh, yes.
This sounds familiar.

127
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,920
>> So the minimum confidence arm is
going to get you better estimates,

128
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:46,270
but the maximum likelihood arm is going
to get you more reward, probably.

129
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,790
>> Right, in particular,
like we argued before, if I've only got

130
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:54,390
one more thing to do, I should pick the
thing with the highest expected value.

131
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,540
>> Yeah.

132
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,830
So okay, so.

133
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,490
To actually make up a strategy that
is going to do well in this game.

134
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:05,911
We kind of have to decide what
we think the right metric is.

135
00:05:05,911 --> 00:05:06,650
>> Oh.

136
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:10,070
>> So it's not so clear yet
that there's one obvious metric.

137
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,800
I kind of suggested using
these check boxes that

138
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,940
what you want to do is eventually
always pull the better arm.

139
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,960
>> Well yeah,
of course that's what you want to do.

140
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,800
Eventually.
>> Well, no.

141
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,410
>> Eventually.

142
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,190
>> No, no.

143
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,780
>> Okay, well look,
if you know what the better arm is,

144
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,990
you should always pull it.

145
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,790
>> Sure, but

146
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:31,740
the point is that there's a lot of fun
that happens on the way to that point.

147
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,870
And so in fact, I think all the fun
happens on the way to that point.

148
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:40,240
So I think we need to kind of talk about
what kind of metric makes sense before

149
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,870
we figure out which
strategy is the best.

150
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,760
>> Okay.
That seem reasonable.
