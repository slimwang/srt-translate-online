00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,536
>> We know that in order to graph these two curves, we simply set y equal to

2
00:00:04,536 --> 00:00:09,742
each side of the equation that we originally started with. So the two lines that

3
00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:14,812
we have are this orange one, whose equation is y equals 3x squared plus 7x minus

4
00:00:14,812 --> 00:00:19,943
10, and this black one whose equation is y equals 2x squared plus 5x plus 5. Now

5
00:00:19,943 --> 00:00:24,866
these points of intersection are points that lie on both of these curves. So

6
00:00:24,866 --> 00:00:29,229
that means the coordinates these points satisfy each of these equations. We

7
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:33,702
already know the x coordinates of each point so all we need to do now to figure

8
00:00:33,702 --> 00:00:38,246
out the corresponding y coordinates is to pick either of these equations and

9
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:42,717
plug in each x coordinate. So I'm kind of feeling this one right here. Doesn't

10
00:00:42,717 --> 00:00:46,892
matter which one you choose though. You'll get the same answer regardless of

11
00:00:46,892 --> 00:00:51,252
which equation you pick. So starting with this equation I'm going to plug in the

12
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:55,529
negative 5 to see what y value corresponds to that x value on both curves. When

13
00:00:55,529 --> 00:00:59,647
I plug in x equals negative 5 I end up with y equals 30. So that means that the

14
00:00:59,647 --> 00:01:04,336
coordinates of this point must be negative five comma 30. Now let's do the same

15
00:01:04,336 --> 00:01:09,653
thing with x equal three, for this point. Solving for y when x equal three gives

16
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:14,830
us 38, so we have the point three comma 38 as our other point of intersection.
