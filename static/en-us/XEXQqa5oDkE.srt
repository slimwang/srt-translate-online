00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,135
Now what do you think the study found? Do you think there was a positive

2
00:00:04,135 --> 00:00:11,259
correlation? Meaning as socioeconomic status increased, verbal ability also

3
00:00:11,259 --> 00:00:16,697
increased. Or, was there a negative correlation? As socioeconomic status

4
00:00:16,697 --> 00:00:21,028
decreased, verbal ability increased or was there no corelation between

5
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:27,121
socioeconomic status and verbability. So take a moment and think about it and

6
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:32,530
choose one response. It's okay if you don't know, just take a guess.
