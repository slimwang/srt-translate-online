1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,850
The first one,
hackers breaking into your system.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,160
This typically means that there
is attack traffic coming from

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,250
untrusted parts of the Internet or
even from a known malicious site.

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,390
So this can be stopped by the firewall.

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,540
The second one, Internet traffic that
appears to be from a legitimate source.

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,030
Firewall cannot stop this.

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,780
The reason is that
the firewall is designed

8
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:25,350
to allow traffic from a legitimate
source, such as another trusted network.

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,240
The third one, viruses and
worms that spread through the Internet.

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,640
This can be stopped by the firewalls.

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,550
There are several ways to identify and

12
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,910
block such traffic, such as the volume
of such traffic or that said traffic

13
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:42,270
has specially crafted packets that are
known to target vulnerable surfaces, or

14
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,100
the traffic is from some untrusted
networks on the Internet.

15
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,960
In short, the firewall can use such
knowledge to block such virus and

16
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,590
worm traffic.

17
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:53,950
The fourth one,
spyware being put on your system.

18
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,340
It would be hard for
a firewall to stop this because

19
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,410
spyware typically steals information and
sends it out to a site.

20
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,870
The external site can
appear to be legitimate, or

21
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,870
at least not known to be malicious.

22
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,850
And the volume of traffic
can be very small.

23
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,560
The fifth one, viruses and
worms that are spread through email.

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,400
A firewall typically
cannot stop this because,

25
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,405
while the firewall can track that,
an email is from a legitimate source.

26
00:01:19,405 --> 00:01:21,760
It cannot track the contents
of the email itself
