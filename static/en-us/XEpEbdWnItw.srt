1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,700
Actually, password is a pretty
popular password people use.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,306
It did make the top 10 list.

3
00:00:08,306 --> 00:00:12,380
123456 actually has also
made the top 10 list.

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,846
Again, maybe it's the ease remembering
it that's why people use it.

5
00:00:16,846 --> 00:00:20,381
123456789 is also on the list.

6
00:00:20,381 --> 00:00:22,755
Here someone is picking
a longer password.

7
00:00:22,755 --> 00:00:27,047
It's not weird if it's a stronger
password or better password, but

8
00:00:27,047 --> 00:00:28,720
it's commonly used.

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,080
Qwerty is faster to type,
well actually that made the list also.

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,960
Some of the other ones that we have
here actually are on the longer list but

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,630
not on the top ten.

12
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,730
What else could be on top ten?

13
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,046
A lot of sports fans, baseball,
football, made the list.

14
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:50,522
Actually 12345, 123456,

15
00:00:50,522 --> 00:00:55,530
12345678, 123456789.

16
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,783
All these are on that longer list.

17
00:00:57,783 --> 00:01:03,095
So, I think one takeaway here
is that people put their ability

18
00:01:03,095 --> 00:01:09,750
to remember their password, perhaps
ahead of how good those passwords are.

19
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,418
And they continue to pick
passwords that are pretty weak.

20
00:01:13,418 --> 00:01:17,980
And we're going to talk about why
common passwords are a bad idea.
