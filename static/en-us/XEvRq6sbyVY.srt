>> So with the ABCs with Callie, can you give us an example of how those were

2
00:00:03,251 --> 00:00:04,705
applied?

3
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:09,528
>> Yeah. So once the behavior has been trained, the antecedent is the cue or the

4
00:00:09,528 --> 00:00:14,942
SD, the stimulus descriptive. Then the behavior would be her putting her head

5
00:00:14,942 --> 00:00:19,952
back to her back. That's the behaviour, and then the consequence is the bridge

6
00:00:19,952 --> 00:00:24,270
and the reinforcement. The bridge is a form of reinforcement and then the fish

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,220
being the other, primary form of reinforcement.
