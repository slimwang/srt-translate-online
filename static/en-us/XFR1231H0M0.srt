00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Here are the answers. The first sentence is true half the time and false half the time.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It would have been true all the time if we had written fire or not smoke

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
rather than smoke or not fire on the right-hand side.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The second sentence is false when fire is true and smoke is false

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and otherwise true.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The third sentence is always true, and this is called the contrapositive.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Smoke implies fire is the same thing as not fire implies not smoke.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The fourth sentence is always true, and you can figure that out

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
by writing out the full truth tables or by reasoning about the variable big.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
When big is true, the whole sentence is true because big is one of the disjuncts,

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and when big is false, it's true because big implies dumb is true

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
whenever the antecedent is false.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And the final sentence is also always true,

14
00:01:00,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and this is known as de Morgan's law.
