1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,548
The goal of the first three units in this course is to build a Web crawler

2
00:00:03,548 --> 00:00:06,281
that will collect data from the Web for our search engine.

3
00:00:06,281 --> 00:00:08,831
And to learn about big ideas in Computing by doing that.

4
00:00:08,831 --> 00:00:13,697
In Unit 1, we'll get started by extracting the first link on a web page.

5
00:00:13,697 --> 00:00:16,748
A Web crawler finds web pages for our search engine

6
00:00:16,748 --> 00:00:21,997
by starting from a "seed" page and following links on that page to find other pages.

7
00:00:21,997 --> 00:00:27,431
Each of those links lead to some new web page, which itself could have links that lead to other pages.

8
00:00:27,431 --> 00:00:31,064
As we follow those links, we'll find more and more web pages

9
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:34,513
building a collection of data that we'll use for our search engine.

10
00:00:34,513 --> 00:00:38,698
A web page is really just a chunk of text that comes from the Internet into your Web browser.

11
00:00:38,698 --> 00:00:40,730
We'll talk more about how that works in Unit 4.

12
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,463
But for now, the important thing to understand is that

13
00:00:43,463 --> 00:00:47,564
a link is really just a special kind of text in that web page.

14
00:00:47,564 --> 00:00:50,881
When you click on a link in your browser it will direct you to a new page.

15
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:53,998
And you can keep following those links as a human.

16
00:00:53,998 --> 00:00:58,331
What we'll do in this Unit is write a program to extract that first link from the web page.

17
00:00:58,331 --> 00:01:18,213
In later units, we'll figure out how to extract all the links and build their collection for our search engine
