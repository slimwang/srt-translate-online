00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,540
>> Yeap, so now we can not only you know, chat

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,320
with other people in our company, like collaborate on a stage,

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,470
but we can follow the records. So if there are any

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,910
updates or post to it, it'll go straight to our feed.

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,310

>> Okay. Cool.

11
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,410
>> Well, why don't you try writing something on

12
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,870
it. And just you know, seeing what that looks like.

13
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,520
>> Alright.
