1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,130
Don't worry if you don't
know all of these by now.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,560
Take the best guess that you can and

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,360
by the time you finish this course, this
will hopefully be second nature to you.

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,340
So first of all, you'll create
a blank that uses your desired API.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,000
What do you think that would be?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,360
Secondly, you extend your activity
with the blank call backs.

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,420
Which call backs do you
think they would be?

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,400
Third, you also extend your
activity with the blank listener

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,310
in case the connection fails.

10
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,110
And then, finally, after connecting
the blank, you'll wait for

11
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,360
the blank callback.

12
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,200
What do you think these will
be I'll give you a clue.

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,450
The answer in one and
the beginning of four are the same.

14
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,640
And which callback do you
think you'll be waiting for

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,850
when you connect to the services?

16
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:42,955
Once you've done all of this,

17
00:00:42,955 --> 00:00:46,150
you'd then follow the requirements
of your specific API.

18
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,800
Fill out the blanks and then continue.
