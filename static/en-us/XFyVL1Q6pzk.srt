00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:07,032
Now, when we have a character followed by a star or a question mark, that's the hardest part, let's save that for last.

2
00:00:07,033 --> 00:00:12,599
Now let's consider the final case--and the final case is when we know that the pattern is not empty,

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:18,799
and we know that we've gone through all the special characters. So the first character is not a special character,

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,799
except maybe it's a dot, because we haven't dealt with dot yet.

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,132
And so we want to match the first character, and then we want to match the rest of the pattern,

6
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:30,299
whether that's empty or whether it's something more.

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:37,399
So what I'm going to do is invent a new function that I call match one, and that matches a single character,

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:45,299
and we want to return "true" if that single character which is the first character of the pattern matches against the text,

9
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,666
and if we can recursively match the rest of the pattern against the rest of the text.

10
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:56,532
So this is saying, "We don't have a special character here, except maybe a dot,"

11
00:00:56,533 --> 00:01:02,599
and so we have like b followed by a, we want to match the b against the text,

12
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,566
and then we want to match the A against something else.

13
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:15,500
So fill in for me here what I should be matching against to match the rest of the pattern against the rest of the text.
