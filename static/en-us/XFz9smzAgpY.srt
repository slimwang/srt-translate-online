00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,360
Now the only problem with this code is that

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,910
pointer events may be delivering multiple pointers with different

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,970
pointer ID's at the same time. For example, if

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,310
I'm using two fingers on my touch interface, you can

5
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,770
tell it's getting a little bit confused about where

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:19,170
to draw. So to fix this, I actually differentiate

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,860
by pointer ID and I keep an array of

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,550
points for each pointer ID. And then I use that

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,020
to mask where I'm adding points to. And this version you

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,640
can tell works much better with multiple pointers at the same time.
