00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,220
Throughout this lesson,

2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:05,020
we covered both paid and free customer
acquisition channels in order to help

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,180
you determine what's right for your
company at your stage in development.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,730
>> Remember to take a moment
to think about where your

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,130
touch points are with your customers.

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,660
Where do they hang out in real life and
in their online life?

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,710
You want to make sure
to meet them there.

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,670
>> And don't forget, you don't
have to chose just one channel.

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,380
You can combine multiple channels and
keep learning on the go.

10
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:30,440
As long as you make sure to
track your performance and

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,430
keep doing only the things that
show positive impact on your goals.

12
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,840
Which is exactly what we're
going to be covering next lesson.

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,770
Tracking and measurement.

14
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:38,810
So, we'll see you there.
