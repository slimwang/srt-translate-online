1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,730
Now let's consider the case where we have parallel image planes.

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,630
It's a little hard to see here in the picture, but

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,650
the idea is that I've got two image planes.

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,190
My centers of projection are sort of out here.

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:18,050
And any point defines a plane that intersects these image planes.

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,500
And it's kind of, it's what's called actually a pencil of planes.

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,560
These planes rotate around that base line.

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,900
But we have parallel image planes.

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,720
What do the epipolar lines look like?

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,400
Well, they look like this.

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,420
In this particular case,

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,500
because of how they're shift, they're these horizontal lines.

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,500
And can see that for

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,000
the corresponding three points located on that chapel, they land.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,120
Four points, sorry.

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,180
That they land somewhere on these epipolar lines.

17
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:47,040
So if the epipolar lines are all supposed to intersect at the epipoles.

18
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,270
And here, we've got these horizontal epipolar lines.

19
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,020
Where are the epipoles?

20
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,620
Well as somebody once explained to you somewhere in some metaphysical space,

21
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,530
sometimes various hallucinogens were involved it,

22
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,050
powerful lines intersected infinity.

23
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,070
Okay, so essentially he epipoles are out at infinity.

24
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,220
And if, if you're not sure about that travel to the Himalayas and

25
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,720
ask somebody high up on a mountain or just high up anywhere.

26
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,810
I don't know if I'm allowed to say that.

27
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,320
Just ask them about parallel lines.

28
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,170
And the idea is that parallel lines here are essentially at infinity.

29
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,910
One way of thinking about that is, as the two planes get closer and

30
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,630
closer to being parallel, the epipoles keep moving further and further.

31
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,980
And so when you take a limit, when they actually become parallel,

32
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,350
then the location of the epipole is at infinity.
