1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,489
So I've talked about
the possibility axioms and

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,280
the successor-state axioms that's
most of what's in situation calculus.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,330
And that's used to describe an entire
domain like the airport cargo domain.

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:15,080
And now we describe a particular
problem within that domain

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,160
by describing the initial state.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,486
And typically we call that S0,
the initial situation.

7
00:00:21,486 --> 00:00:27,736
And in S0 we can make
various types of assertions

8
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:32,615
of different types of predicates, so

9
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:39,481
we could say that plane P1
is at airport JFK, in S0.

10
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:41,643
So just a simple predicate.

11
00:00:41,643 --> 00:00:46,164
And we could also make larger sentences.

12
00:00:46,164 --> 00:00:51,871
So we could say, for
all c, if c is cargo,

13
00:00:51,871 --> 00:00:57,109
then that c is at JFK in situation S0.

14
00:00:57,109 --> 00:01:00,359
So we have much more flexibility
in situation calculus

15
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,060
to say almost anything we want.

16
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:06,695
Anything that's a valid sentence in
first-order logic can be asserted about

17
00:01:06,695 --> 00:01:08,329
the initial state.

18
00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:09,840
The goal state is similar.

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,079
We could have a goal of say, there
exists some goal state s, such that for

20
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:21,609
all c, if c is cargo, then we want

21
00:01:21,609 --> 00:01:28,090
that cargo to be at SFO in state s.

22
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:32,466
So this initial state and
this goal says, move all the cargo,

23
00:01:32,465 --> 00:01:35,925
I don't care how much there is,
from JFK to SFO.

24
00:01:35,926 --> 00:01:40,239
Now, the great thing about situation
calculus is that once we've described

25
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,980
this in the ordinary language
of first-order logic.

26
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,957
We don't need any special programs
to manipulate it and come up with

27
00:01:47,956 --> 00:01:52,658
the solution because we already have
theorem provers for first-order logic.

28
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:55,518
And we can just state this as a problem,

29
00:01:55,518 --> 00:02:00,457
apply the normal theorem prover
that we already had for other uses,

30
00:02:00,457 --> 00:02:05,439
and it can come up with an answer
of a path that satisfies this goal.

31
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,879
A situation which corresponds to a path,
which satisfies this

32
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:13,750
given the initial state and
given the descriptions of the actions.

33
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,495
So the advantage of situation calculus
is that we have the full power of

34
00:02:16,495 --> 00:02:19,210
first-order logic,
we can represent anything we want.

35
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:23,180
Much more flexibility than in problem
solving or classical planning.

36
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,370
So all together now we've seen
several ways of dealing with planning.

37
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,759
We started in deterministic,
fully observable environments.

38
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,781
And we moved into stochastic and
partially observable environments.

39
00:02:33,782 --> 00:02:37,157
We were able to distinguish
between plans that can or

40
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,775
cannot solve a problem.

41
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:42,754
But we had one weakness in all these
different approaches, is that we

42
00:02:42,753 --> 00:02:47,152
weren't able to distinguish between
probable and improbable solutions.

43
00:02:47,152 --> 00:02:49,429
And that will be the subject
of the next unit.
