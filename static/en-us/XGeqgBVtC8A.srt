1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,710
To build this layout,
I open up the activity_main.xml file.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,670
I know that I need a vertical linear
layout to put each of these views

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,340
in a vertical column.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,870
So, I'm going to first change the
relative layout into a linear layout.

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,110
Immediately, it shows an error saying
that the opening tag does not match

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,840
the closing tag, so I can just copy
this over and then paste it down here.

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,100
Now the tags match.

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,930
Next, I can add in the views.

9
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,720
First, I have a quantity text view.

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,880
So I'm going to take this text view and
then change the text inside to quantity.

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,960
Next, I have a text view that says zero.

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,460
So I can copy the first text view and
paste it below it.

13
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,430
I'm going to change it so the text says
zero to match the screenshot here.

14
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,500
The last child in this
linear layout is a button.

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,020
We haven't added a button before in our
layout, so let's Google Search that.

16
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,160
If you open up a browser you
can search for button android.

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,500
This first link looks good,
it's a developer.android.com site.

18
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:56,700
And here's the documentation for button,
we can ignore most of this text here.

19
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,250
We scroll down to read
the class overview.

20
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,000
It talks a little bit about some Java
code, which we haven't learned yet but

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,300
down here we have some xml for a button.

22
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,280
We can copy this and
see what it does in our code.

23
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,420
In our layout I'm going to add
a button below these two text views.

24
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,030
I'm going to paste the code
from the documentation here.

25
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,900
And now instead of the self destruct
string, I'm going to go for

26
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,280
something a little
friendlier like order.

27
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,900
This last line we can also
delete because we don't need it.

28
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,580
Cool, so now you have a quantity text
view, a text view that says zero, and

29
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,270
an order button.

30
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,220
Let's run it on our app,
to see what it looks like,

31
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,540
by hitting the green play button.

32
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,290
We can see down here
that it's still building.

33
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:38,660
Oh, this isn't what we wanted.

34
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:43,470
It appears that our linear layout is
actually horizontal instead of vertical.

35
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,586
So let's make sure that we add
the orientation attribute.

36
00:01:47,586 --> 00:01:52,020
We're going to change this to say
android;orientation="vertical".

37
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,570
That should fix the problem.

38
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,490
So let's hit run again.

39
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,010
Okay, that's better now.

40
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:00,270
The three children are showing
up in a vertical column.

41
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,810
Now we just need to
style these fields so

42
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,160
they look a little bit more like
the screenshot we were given.

43
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,460
From this screenshot we see that
the quantity text view is in all caps.

44
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,950
In lesson one we learned about
an attribute called android:textAllCaps,

45
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,230
and it's showing up here
in the auto-complete.

46
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,310
If it shows up like this,
you can just hit enter and

47
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,390
it automatically adds it
in the code here for you.

48
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,970
We set that value to be true
because we want it in all caps.

49
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,580
The reason why it's better to use
this attribute to capitalize the text

50
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,620
is because if we ever want to change the
UI so that quantity is in lower case,

51
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,650
like this, all we need to do
is just remove this attribute

52
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,020
instead of going and changing this text.

53
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,840
Next, for this text here that says zero,
we should use a text size of 16sp.

54
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,970
Let me add that now and it shows up
in the auto-complete suggestions so

55
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:50,000
I just hit enter and
then I choose 16sp for the value.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,450
We also want it to be
a black font color.

57
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,700
I'm going to use the Android
system color for

58
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,380
black, which is referred to like this.

59
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,558
Cool, that takes care of both
the quantity and the zero text views.

60
00:03:00,558 --> 00:03:05,011
The order button is fine as is, it will
automatically capitalize the text for

61
00:03:05,011 --> 00:03:08,820
you in a button and the height and
width are wrap content.

62
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,898
We do have a need to resolve
this vertical space here.

63
00:03:11,898 --> 00:03:15,810
We want 16dp of padding or
margin in between the quantity and

64
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,190
the zero text views.

65
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,027
We also want also want 16dp of
padding in between the zero and

66
00:03:20,027 --> 00:03:21,430
the order button.

67
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,960
You can implement this
in many different ways,

68
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,650
I'm just going to choose to add it as
layout top margin for this button.

69
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,490
And I'm going to add it as a bottom
margin for this quantity text view.

70
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,810
Feel free to do it a different
way as long as it looks the same.

71
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,000
The reason why I chose to do a bottom
margin and a top margin is because I

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,040
know that this middle area
here is going to change later.

73
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,670
We're going to change it to be
a quantity picker with a plus and

74
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:54,620
minus button, and I still want to have
16dp of space between the quantity

75
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,830
title and the picker.

76
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,560
Same for the button.

77
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,280
Okay, let's run it again
now on our device.

78
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,350
Cool, and it looks just like we wanted.

79
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:07,150
The quantity text view is in all caps,
the zero text view is in

80
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,710
black font color, size 16sp, and
we have the order button here.

81
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,540
We also have 16dp of space
between these views.

82
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,240
Good job.
Oh, and I almost forgot.

83
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,560
The quiz also asks for what happens
when you click on this button.

84
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,950
Well, actually it does nothing,
for now at least.

85
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,660
Keep watching to find
out what happens next.
