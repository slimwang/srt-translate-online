1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,830
As far as inputs are concerned, inputs acceptable to an abstract

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:10,370
specification must also be acceptable to the concrete implementation. However,

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:16,309
the refined operations, that is the implementation, can accept more.

4
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:22,100
This might happen if for example you use a particular library routine

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,670
that's very general to deal with satisfying some con,

6
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,790
some abstract need. Okay, you can accept more inputs, but

7
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:35,770
it has to accept at least as many as the abstract one requires of us.

8
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:41,340
In terms of our specification stated more precisely, refinements can weaken

9
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,630
operation preconditions. And in logic where every, concrete state T, if

10
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:53,610
the invariant is true an the, preconditions are true in the abstract state, then

11
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,100
it better be the case that the preconditions are true in the concrete state.
