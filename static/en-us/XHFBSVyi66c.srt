We just established that the volume of a sound, or its loudness, gets lower or

2
00:00:04,492 --> 00:00:10,444
decreases as the distance from the sound source increases. I've drawn four

00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:14,388
graphs for you here and I'd like you to tell me which ones show loudness

4
00:00:14,388 --> 00:00:20,604
decreasing as distance increases. Please note loudness is on the vertical axis

5
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:24,070
in all these graphs and distances on the horizontal axis.
