1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,543
This matrix has values in the first three positions in the last row, so it's a

2
00:00:03,543 --> 00:00:07,813
projection matrix of some sort. Of our choices, only the perspective matrix is

3
00:00:07,813 --> 00:00:12,238
a projection. Rotations affect the off-diagonal elements of the upper 3 by 3 of

4
00:00:12,238 --> 00:00:16,322
the matrix. The view matrix is the only one of the 3 choices with rotations in

5
00:00:16,322 --> 00:00:21,854
it. This leaves the third matrix to be the NDC to window matrix. This

6
00:00:21,854 --> 00:00:25,016
conversion is a scale and a translate, which is certainly what this matrix

7
00:00:25,016 --> 00:00:26,220
contains.
