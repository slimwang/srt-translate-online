00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,360
In the last quiz, Athena at first, had a two hour window of time in which she

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,332
knew the train would leave the mountain view station. Niko also told her it was

3
00:00:08,332 --> 00:00:12,686
sometime between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. That was a pretty big window. Then, with

4
00:00:12,686 --> 00:00:16,103
more information from the train schedule, she narrowed down that window to this

5
00:00:16,103 --> 00:00:22,390
tiny little yellow one, right here. Between just before 5 and just around 5:15.

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,740
The schedule then, is going to help her guess a lot better when the train's

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,335
going to leave. And we can imagine that if she had even more information about

8
00:00:29,335 --> 00:00:32,812
the trains travel from Sunnyvale to Palo Alto, she could narrow down this

9
00:00:32,812 --> 00:00:38,583
window even more. We can use this same method of starting zoomed out. And then,

10
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:42,985
zooming in, closer and closer, to help estimate the location of zeros that

11
00:00:42,985 --> 00:00:49,500
don't occur at fractional or rational values of x. These are irrational zeros.

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,848
So, here on the graph, for example, you can see that y is negative down here.

13
00:00:53,848 --> 00:00:57,703
But it's positive up here. We know that somewhere in this general region,

14
00:00:57,703 --> 00:01:02,290
there's a point where y equals 0. We can find that exact point by zooming in

15
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,760
closer and closer.
