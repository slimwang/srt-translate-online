00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,330
Okay, what I'd like you to do for

2
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:03,910
this quiz is, implement the hash_str function. Now,

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:08,400
remember, the previous version of this used hashlib

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,310
and MD5. Now, I want you to use HMAC

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,760
and our secret instead. We're not going to

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,820
have to change our make_secure_val and check_secure_val functions, it's

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,190
just going to get a little bit more secure.

8
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,050
So let's go ahead and give that a try.
