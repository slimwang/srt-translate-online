1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Well, let's go through it together--our parse tree

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
is just going to be a list of elements, and here there are three:

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
hello, the tag element, and yaga.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And hello is just a simple Word_element

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
so it fills in our first blank.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Then we've got this tag_element and the

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
trick to getting this question right is looking

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
at the order in which we store them up here--

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
more or less in order of appearance.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So since this is a <bold> tag,

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
when this next part here is a (b),

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
this empty list means there were no particular arguments to our <bold> tag.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Here, I'm seeing arguments: color = "red".

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
There's nothing like that down here.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And then inside, we've got the Word_element, baba--and then we're done.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Baba Yaga was a crone or a witch in Slavic folklore

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
who was known for--among other things--

18
00:00:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
riding around in a house supported on chickens' legs--fun stuff!
