1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,715
Development can be divided into six main stages on the timeline. Prenatal,

2
00:00:05,715 --> 00:00:11,892
infancy childhood, adolescence, adulthood and finally late adulthood. Within

3
00:00:11,892 --> 00:00:16,230
these stages there are domains or topics that psychologists are interested in.

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,920
This focuses in the changes in our neurological structures in the brain. Then

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,560
we have Sensory Development. This focuses on how our senses change as we

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,626
develop. For example, how our vision develops. We also look at our physical and

7
00:00:28,626 --> 00:00:32,183
motor development. This looks at the development of our physical movement and

8
00:00:32,183 --> 00:00:37,455
body control. For example, when you crawl or walk. We also look at our

9
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:41,396
cognitive development. This domain focuses on our ability to think, solve

10
00:00:41,396 --> 00:00:46,046
problems, learn new things and remember things. And finally, our social and

11
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:50,872
emotional development. This focuses on things like attachment and how infants

12
00:00:50,872 --> 00:00:55,910
form attachments. And how those attachments will affect future relationships.

13
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,657
These are just some of the aspects developmental psychologists are interested

14
00:00:58,657 --> 00:01:02,809
in. In this lesson, we'll go through each of the major stages of development,

15
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:06,980
and discuss the changes during them. Some psychological domains are going to be

16
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:11,540
more important in certain stages than in others. So, we might not go over all

17
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:16,260
six domains in each stage of life, but we'll definitely touch on each of them.

18
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,770
So, with that said, why don't we go on to see how these psychological processes

19
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,379
unfold from conception to death.
