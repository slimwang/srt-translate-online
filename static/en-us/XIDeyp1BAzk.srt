1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,610
If you have something almost,
but not quite working and

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,130
your getting frustrated with it.

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,110
It can be tempting to throw it away and
try again.

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,450
But sometimes your really
close on your first try and

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,420
the second try isn't as close.

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,120
Then you want to be able to
get back to the first version.

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,240
For short functions you can make
this easier by commenting out

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,360
the old version.

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,410
In Python just put a hash mark
before each line of the function.

10
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,510
Or you can turn it into a big string
by putting triple quotes around it.

11
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,330
Now text editors do have an undo
feature, but it doesn't usually let you

12
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:35,740
go back between multiple
different versions of your code.

13
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,660
So it's not really good enough to let
you compare different versions of code.

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,120
Undo is good for when you
accidentally mess something up and

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,410
immediately notice.

16
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,470
But, you can't rely on undo alone to
compare different versions of code or

17
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,670
to get back to an arbitrary
version you previously had.

18
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,380
You can copy code into a different file.

19
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,660
Files aren't exactly expensive,
after all.

20
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,120
Just make sure you save them
where you can find them.

21
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,910
Another reason to keep old versions
is that when you do ask for

22
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:04,430
help, you can show two or
three different things you've tried.

23
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:08,620
Software engineers use version control
systems like Git, which are pretty much

24
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:13,710
super powerful undo systems that let you
navigate to any version of the code that

25
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:18,040
have multiple modified versions and
share different versions and so on.

26
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,380
So keeping old versions isn't just for
beginners.

27
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,110
It's how software
engineering really works
