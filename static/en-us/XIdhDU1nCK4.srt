1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,306
Assume this application is strongly compute bound,

2
00:00:03,306 --> 00:00:07,143
whereas computation is the performance bottleneck for this problem.

3
00:00:07,143 --> 00:00:13,116
If we run the same application on a different GPU with twice the memory bandwidth,

4
00:00:13,116 --> 00:00:17,393
which curve best represents the performance that you might see?
