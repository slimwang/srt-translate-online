1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,830
Fans like to create content
based on your game.

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,700
And by encouraging
them to create content,

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,530
you can help promote your game and
make your players feel invested.

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,010
As a bonus, you also get to
see their creativity at work.

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,270
And invested players will
help your game make money.

6
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,360
Fan art is a great example of this.

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,070
And here's an example
from League of Legends.

8
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,950
Another example of player created
content are extended in game

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:30,110
experiences, which are generally ways
for players to personalize the game and

10
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,570
create scenarios that
are the most interesting to them.

11
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,090
A great example of this is Minecraft.

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,050
It gives users a simple set of tools and

13
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:43,040
resources that they can build off of to
create their own challenges and worlds.

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,360
They can create dungeons
filled with zombies or

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,940
lava, games that take place in the air
or places made entirely of gold.

16
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,840
Players can even recreate scenarios
from their favorite movies,

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,105
like with this superhero character and
stormtrooper.

18
00:00:56,105 --> 00:00:59,585
In all these scenarios, players
are taking the core of the game and

19
00:00:59,585 --> 00:01:02,495
customizing it based on
their own interests.

20
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:04,925
The more your game supports
content creators and

21
00:01:04,925 --> 00:01:09,345
is able to celebrate their creations,
the more invested your players will be

22
00:01:09,345 --> 00:01:12,485
and the more depth and variety you'll
have in your gaming experience.
