00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
For the first question, we're going to see that you understand procedures.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Your goal is to define a procedure--called "udacify"--that takes as input a string

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and outputs a string that is an uppercase "U" followed by the input string.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Here's an example.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If you print the result of calling the udacify procedure that you defined,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
passing in "dacians" as a string, the output should be the string "Udacians"

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
with a capital "U."

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
See if you can define the procedure "udacify."
