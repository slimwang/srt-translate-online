00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,370
I started here from within the afeat
because it already has the square target

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,450
which I want to add
an event listener to.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:12,384
I set an event listener on the square
target listening to touchend.

4
00:00:12,384 --> 00:00:14,953
And I also added
the callback showTouchEnd,

5
00:00:14,953 --> 00:00:19,175
which will get called whenever
touchend occurs on the square.

6
00:00:19,175 --> 00:00:21,135
And here's showTouchEnd.

7
00:00:21,135 --> 00:00:22,445
It's pretty straightforward, but

8
00:00:22,445 --> 00:00:26,075
I did add some logic to it to
make it disappear after a moment.

9
00:00:26,075 --> 00:00:28,265
But you didn't need to do that.

10
00:00:28,265 --> 00:00:32,960
All that's important here is that I
set the outputs innerHTML to touchend.

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,730
So when the touchend event gets called
on the square, showTouchEnd gets called.

12
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:42,696
And when showTouchEnd gets called, the
output.innerHTML gets set to touchend.

13
00:00:42,696 --> 00:00:44,690
Okay, that's pretty simple.

14
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:46,200
Let's see how it looks.

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,840
So here's the site.

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,760
With the mouse, nothing happens,
which is expected.

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,870
But when I switch to device emulation
mode and move around, look at that,

18
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,950
touchend appears right here.

19
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:59,494
Cool!

20
00:00:59,494 --> 00:01:02,090
All right,
that's a pretty good start for events.

21
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:02,590
Let's keep going.
