00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,760
Ember is an advanced
framework built by and

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,920
others who are pushing the boundaries
of the JavaScript language.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,830
So Ember makes use of JavaScript
language features that sometimes haven't

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:10,460
been standardized yet.

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,665
When building Ember apps it's important
to know how to use JavaScript promises

6
00:00:14,665 --> 00:00:18,130
which makes it easy to write and
manage asynchronous code.

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:22,595
ES6 modules, some files in an Ember app
are included into other files using

8
00:00:22,595 --> 00:00:24,735
modules and imports.

9
00:00:24,735 --> 00:00:25,893
And ES6 Syntax.

10
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:29,870
Features like arrow functions,
destructuring, and template strings.

11
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:30,800
But don't worry,

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,560
this isn't too important because we can
write everything using standard ES5.

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,150
We have a course on promises, so check
that out if you have any questions.

14
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,820
Links to these topics are in
the instructor notes.
