Xavier and his brother Benjamin always feel sleepy during the day. Xavier

00:00:05,303 --> 00:00:09,591
thinks he shouldn't feel so tire because he knows he sleeps during the night,

00:00:09,591 --> 00:00:15,464
unlike his brother Benjamin who never falls asleep or stays asleep. Xavier

00:00:15,464 --> 00:00:19,299
doesn't have trouble falling asleep but does, on occasion, feel that he comes

00:00:19,299 --> 00:00:24,140

00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:29,544
breathing sounded weird and inconsistent while he sleeps. What sleep disorders

00:00:36,593 --> 00:00:42,082
has what? Here are some options. Narcolepsy, sleep apnea, night terrors, and

00:00:42,082 --> 00:00:43,269
insomnia.
