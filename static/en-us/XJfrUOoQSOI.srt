At the end of Unit 4, we built a search index that could respond to queries

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and would do this by going through each entry one at a time,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
checking if the keyword matched the word we were looking for,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and then responding with a result for that.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I wanted to ask Gabriel Wienberg, the creater of DuckDuckGo, how well that approach will work

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
if we have a large index with lots of queries.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You'll find that with a large index with lots of queries, it will be too slow.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
A typical search engine should respond in under a second and often times much faster.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
But with that algorithm, having to go through each link like that one after the other,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
you could be on the order of seconds or even longer.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So what we're going to learn this unit is how to make this much faster.
