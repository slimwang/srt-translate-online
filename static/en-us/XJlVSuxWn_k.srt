1
00:00:00,742 --> 00:00:02,960
[APPLAUSE]
>> Hey, Hezekiah.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,860
Have you selected a winner yet?

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,670
>> Yes, I think so.

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,760
And after looking at
both of your sketches,

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,520
you both did a pretty good job.

6
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,125
However, there can only be one winner.

7
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:14,079
And the winner is Cameron.

8
00:00:14,079 --> 00:00:17,861
>> [APPLAUSE]
>> Sorry, dude, I cheated.

9
00:00:17,861 --> 00:00:18,922
>> [SOUND]
>> I told

10
00:00:18,922 --> 00:00:21,610
Hezekiah to give me a page
with semantic elements.

11
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,780
And you only got
something with the soup.

12
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:29,080
As it turns out, semantic elements
are just much, much easier to read.

13
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,090
>> What?

14
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,500
>> I had no part in this.

15
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,094
>> [LAUGH]
>> All right.

16
00:00:34,094 --> 00:00:35,427
You know what, let's just move on.

17
00:00:35,427 --> 00:00:37,125
[MUSIC]

18
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:40,950
>> [APPLAUSE]
