1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,900
The answer is ten to the minus five.

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:05,930
The standard assumption here is
that the throws are independent, so

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:09,600
the probability of getting five in a row
is just the product of the probabilities

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,992
of getting a bulls eye each time.
