Let's see what I did
to get this to work.

2
00:00:03,038 --> 00:00:07,689
In my app.js file I checked to see
if service workers are supported.

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:10,970
If they are, I register a service worker

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:15,150
served from the root directory of my
project to avoid any scoping issues.

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,670
Then, I added my service worker.

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,460
I added an install event,

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,720
that caches all of the files
needed by the app shell.

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,470
An activate event,
that will purge any of the old,

9
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:31,488
and outdated files and make sure that
we're always serving the latest.

10
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:35,990
And a fetch event handler that tries
to get the data from the cache, but

11
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,810
if not, goes and
gets it from the network.

12
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,310
