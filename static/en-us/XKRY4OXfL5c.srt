00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,280
So how would you use formal logic to
develop an agent that can solve Raven's

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,820
progressive matrices?

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,189
As with production systems, we can kind
of face this at two different levels.

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,060
One, you could use formal logic to
represent the overall algorithm

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,710
the agent uses to solve any new problem.

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,510
Or secondly, the agent could use formal
logic to develop its understanding of

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,500
a new problem that just came in.

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,640
It could then use those formal rules to
develop the transformations that occur

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,890
within the problem and transfer those
transformations into the new answer.

10
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:30,340
Alternatively, you could also use formal
logic to allow your agent to prove why

11
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,479
it's answer to a particular
problem is correct.

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,440
Then if the answer is
actually incorrect,

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,690
the agent may have the information
necessary to go back and

14
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,740
repair it's reasoning and
do better next time.
