1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,930
But the other way of doing 3D sensing is
what we refer to as active 3D sensing,

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:08,230
where somehow, you're projecting
something out into the environment,

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,590
or sending some energy
into the environment and

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,210
reading that energy back,
in order to recover depth.

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,450
So we actually talked just a little
bit about photometric stereo,

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,000
when we talked about photometry, and

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,820
the idea that you could recover shape
if you had known light sources.

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,840
So, even though these are thought
of as regular images, you're,

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,750
it's actually an active
sensing technique,

10
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,479
because you're lighting the system in
a controlled way that you know about.

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,120
But, when most people talk
about active sensing,

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,800
they talk about something that creates,
sort of, special signals or pictures.

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,801
So an obvious one is,
just bounce something off a surface,

14
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:48,167
and wait to see how long it
takes to get back, all right?

15
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:50,540
So there are different
methods of doing that.

16
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,560
This is a little guy.

17
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,500
He has these little ultrasonic sensors,
okay?

18
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,460
If you go way back in time, back in the,
way back machine, I don't know if

19
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,920
it was the 70s or 80s, the Polaroid
cameras started doing active sensing.

20
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,260
They actually had a little
acoustic sonar chip on them,

21
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,830
that would send out
what's called a chirp.

22
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,030
And then,
based upon how long the response got,

23
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,900
how long the response took,
it knew based upon the speed of sound,

24
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,960
how far away the thing was,
and it would focus the camera.

25
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,020
One of the interesting effects of that
is, because they made so many of those

26
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,750
cameras, it made those sonar things very
cheap, so people started putting them

27
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,930
all over robots and things like that,
and using sonar to detect depth.

28
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:34,870
Much more sophisticated is what's
called LIDAR, or a Laser Range finder.

29
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,740
There's two of them here.

30
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,120
One is on the side over here,
one is stuck in here.

31
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,280
These are on a PR2 robot.

32
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,620
These actually generate a slice and

33
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:50,180
they, they send a little beam out and
they wait to see how long it comes back.

34
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,890
Now of course, that's a lot
faster than with sound, okay, but

35
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,260
it, it's measurable, but
you only get a slice of depth.

36
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:01,190
So then what you actually do, is you put
it on a little device that goes up and

37
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:06,120
down like that, and so this little front
area actually sweeps that plane and

38
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,210
it produces a 3D depth image that way.

39
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,390
So that's these are referred
to as time of flight sensors.
