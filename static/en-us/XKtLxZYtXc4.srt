1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,620
The answer is Yes for both languages.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:06,620
We just count up the number of states in
the machine, and compare this to 100.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,770
And that gives us a decision both ways.

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,370
Note that this doesn't involve
actually running M at all.

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,400
And because both L and

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,490
its complement are recognizable,
this language is decidable.
