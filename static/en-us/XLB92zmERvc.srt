1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,370
All right, so let's now talk
about the different types of

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,660
ads that you can have in your ad,
and what they look like.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,330
In this lesson, we will focus on the
following types of ads, banner ads, and

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,229
interstitial ads.

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,970
Banner ads only covers a portion
of the visible screen, so

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,480
they can be shared with
content displayed by your app.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,550
And if the user clicks on the ad
the webpage will be opened

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,150
that has more information about the ad.

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,080
Banner ads can either be text or
an image, like the one you see here.

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,020
Interstitial ads on the other hand,
will cover the entire screen.

11
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,170
That makes it really important to decide
when to show an interstitial ad since

12
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,770
your app can not display anything while
the interstitial ad is being displayed.

13
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,770
Interstitial ads are perfect when
there's a natural break in your ad.

14
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,300
For example, between levels of a game.

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,410
In addition, to text an image ads,

16
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,790
interstitial ads can
also show video content.

17
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,980
These two types of ads,
banner ads and interstitial ads,

18
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,270
are the ones that we will
look at in this lesson.

19
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,640
And although this lesson will focus
on banner and interstitial ads,

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,270
there is one more ad
type called native ads.

21
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,080
And as of May, 2015,
native ads are still in beta.

22
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,950
Native ads give you much more freedom to
customize the look and feel of the ad.

23
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,040
This is accomplished using
two different templates.

24
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,315
App install native Ads which
can drive app installations by

25
00:01:25,315 --> 00:01:26,885
advertising the app.

26
00:01:26,885 --> 00:01:31,285
And content native ads which allows for
a more generic combination of text and

27
00:01:31,285 --> 00:01:33,165
images that covers a broader scope.

28
00:01:34,455 --> 00:01:38,525
But in this lesson we will focus on
banner ads and interstitial ads.

29
00:01:38,525 --> 00:01:40,065
So let's look into more details.
