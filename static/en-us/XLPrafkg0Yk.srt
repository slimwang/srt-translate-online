1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,710
Let's go back to
the calculate price method.

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:06,440
Once we call this method it's going
to return the total order price.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,300
And we can store this value inside
this variable called price.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,510
Then we can display it on the screen.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,670
To integrate the calculate
price method into our app

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,180
we're going to need
to use return values.

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,330
Let's look at the pseudocode first.

8
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:24,390
Within the submitOrder method we want
to call the calculatePrice method.

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,470
It's going to compute
the total price of the order.

10
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,530
And it's going to return
that as the output.

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,620
So we're going to store that output
into a integer variable called price.

12
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,800
Then we're going to take that price,
and then display it on the screen.

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,550
Let's look at the actual Java code for
that.

14
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,740
In the submitOrder method,
we would add this line of code.

15
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,660
Do you remember the assignment
operator from lesson 2?

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,300
Whenever I see this,
I evaluate the right hand side first.

17
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,260
The calculatePrice method returns
a single value which is the order price.

18
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:57,010
And that should get stored inside
this local variable called price.

19
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,040
Then we can call another method,
displayPrice.

20
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,530
And the input to that method is going
to be the price variable that we

21
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,970
just created.

22
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,440
This is the first time
we're seeing how a method

23
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,780
can be used as part of an expression.

24
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,360
For example,
we can call this method, and

25
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,330
the value that gets returned from that
can be added to other numbers or,

26
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,700
if it was a string,
we can concatenate it to other strings.

27
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,450
All that matters is that the whole thing
on the right hand side gets evaluated to

28
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,920
a single value and then gets stored
on the left hand side variable.

29
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,370
But for the Just Java app we're just
going to use calculate price directly

30
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,220
and show that on screen.

31
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:37,210
For this coding task you'll be making
sure that the calculate price method

32
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,910
is getting defined and
called properly in the Just Java app.

33
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,620
First focus on how
the method is defined.

34
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,980
Modify the calculatePrice method
to have the correct return data

35
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,770
type in the method signature.

36
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,960
Also assume that there's
0 input parameters.

37
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,930
The next step is to modify
the inside of that method.

38
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,210
Make sure that it's returning
the correct price of the total order,

39
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,910
which is the quantity of cups
ordered times the price per cup.

40
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,890
You can assume that each
cup of coffee costs $5 and

41
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,038
you can just hardcode that
directly into this method.

42
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,410
Once that is all done, then you can move
on to how the method is getting called.

43
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,360
Call calculatePrice from
the submitOrder method, and

44
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,000
you can use the code that
we talked about earlier.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,840
Then, go ahead and
display this price on the screen.

46
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,900
Now, you could use the displayPrice
method, but you did a lot of work at

47
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,640
the end of Lesson Two to show
some text on the screen as well.

48
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,600
It also said, thank you, so if you
could try to integrate this price value

49
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,140
with that text,
that would be most ideal.

50
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,820
It should look something like this.

51
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,000
So if you change the quantity and

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,830
then hit order, then the price
shows up here along with the text.

53
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,300
When you're done,
check these boxes to continue.
