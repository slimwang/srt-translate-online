1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:07,440
And your file system has features that extend the privilege levels provided by

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,690
the unique file system symantics. This

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,910
includes groups and sub groups and. Accesses

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,810
for files with both positive and

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,110
negative rights. Negative rights is especially useful

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:23,640
for quick revocation. Further, it also introduces

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,040
the notion of audit chain for system

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,320
administrators modifying the system. I urge you

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,159
to read this paper in its entirety.

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,730
To get a feel for the extensions proposed in the Android file system. The

11
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:41,320
main takeaway, however, in this lesson is

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,960
how, as operating system designers, we can

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,110
take the best solution that is out

14
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:51,310
there for information security and implement a

15
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:58,940
secure and usable distributed system. Further, once designed and implemented,

16
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:05,150
we should be able to bench mark our solution against the design principles laid

17
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:11,100
out by Salser on information security, and know the vulnerabilites that exist in

18
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,650
our solution. This last point is particularly important to safeguard our system

19
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,880
against attackers. As we mentioned at the outset of this course

20
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,940
module, the topic of information security is fascinating, and it is of

21
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:32,690
high relevance in this information age. Hopefully this course module has spurred

22
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:38,230
your interest. In information security, to seek, more, and future courses.
