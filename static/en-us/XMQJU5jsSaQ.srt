00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,330
Now we draw our image at location 192 by 192. Which as you can see placed the

2
00:00:05,342 --> 00:00:10,420
top left corner of the image, 192 by 192 pixels up from the top left corner of

3
00:00:10,432 --> 00:00:15,305
the canvas, which has been conveniently placed at location zero, zero on the page.

4
00:00:15,462 --> 00:00:20,159
That is to say that on the canvas, the origin of its coordinate system, i.e., the

5
00:00:20,171 --> 00:00:24,911
location of it's zero, zero, is in the top left hand corner. Any drawImage functions will

6
00:00:24,923 --> 00:00:29,774
follow this coordinate system and place the top left hand corner of the image at

7
00:00:29,786 --> 00:00:32,942
the location specified by the drawImage call.
