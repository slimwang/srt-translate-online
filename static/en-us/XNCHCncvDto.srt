1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In our own reserch, we also have applied eigenvector decomposition

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
to relatively challenging problems that don't look like a linear problem at the surface.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We scanned a good number of people with different physiques:

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Some thin, some not so thin, some tall, some short, some male, some female.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We also scanned them in 3-D in different body postures:

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The arms down, the arms up, walking, throwing a ball, and so on.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We applied eigenvector decomposition of the type I've just shown you

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
to understand whether there is a latent low-dimensional space

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
that is sufficient to represent the different physiques that people have,

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
like thin or thick, and the different postures people can assume, like standing and so on.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It turns out if you apply eigenvector decomposition

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
to the space of all the formations of your body,

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
you can find relatively low dimensional linear spaces,

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
in which you can express different physiques and different body postures.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
For the space of all different physiques it turns only 3-dimensions sufficed

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
to explain different heights, different thicknesses or body weights,

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and also different genders.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
That is, even though our surfaces themselves are representive

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
of tens of thousands of data points, the underlying dimensionality

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
when scanning people is really small.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'll let you watch the entire movie.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Please enjoy.

[SCAPE: Shape Completion and Animation of People]

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We present a method named SCAPE for simultaneously modeling

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
the space of all human shapes and poses.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Further, we demonstrate the method's usefulness

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
for both shape completion and animation.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The model is computed from an example set of surface meshes.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We require only a limited set of training data:

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Examples of posed variation from a single subject

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and examples of the shape variation between subjects.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The resulting model can represent both articulated motion

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and, importantly, the nonrigid muscle deformations

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
required for natural appearance in a wide variety of poses.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The model can also represent a wide variety of different body shapes,

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
spanning both men and women.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Because SCAPE incorporates both shape and pose

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
we can jointly vary both shape and pose to create people who never existed

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and poses that were never observed.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
We demonstrate the use of this model 1st for shape completion of scanned meshes.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Even when a subject has only been partially observed,

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
we can use the model to estimate a complete surface.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
In this case, the entire front half of the subject has been synthesized.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Note that the synthesized data both conforms to the individual subject's

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
specific shape and faithfully represents

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
the nonrigid muscle deformations associated with a specific pose.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Mesh completion is possible even when

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
neither the person or the pose exists in the original training set.

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
None of the women in our example set

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
look similar to the woman in this sequence.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Shape completion can also be used to synthesize complete

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
animated surface meshes.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Starting from a single scanned mesh of an actor

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and a timed series of motion capture markers

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
we can treat the markers themselves

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
as a very sparse sampling of surface geometry

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and complete the surface which best fits the available data at each point in time.

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Using this method, animated surface models

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
for a wide variety of motions can be created with relative ease.

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
In addition, the target identity of the surface model can easily be changed

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
simply by replacing the subject portion of our factorized model with a different vector.

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The new identity need not be present in our training set

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
or even correspond to a real person.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 99:59:59,999
An artist is free to alter the identity arbitrarily.
