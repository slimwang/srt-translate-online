00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,570
We've got a lot of code for the person class now. We probably want to put it in

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,113
BlueJ. And make sure that we haven't made any mistakes. So for BlueJ, I'll

3
00:00:07,113 --> 00:00:13,994
create a new project, and I'll call it Friends. I need to make a class for the

4
00:00:13,994 --> 00:00:26,560
person and then put my code into the class. I'll add the instance variables.

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:36,234
The add friend method. And let's just check that it's compiling so far. So far

6
00:00:36,234 --> 00:00:50,070
so good. We'll add the unfriend method. Check that it's still compiling. Now

7
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:59,998
I'll go back and put in the constructor. So far so good. Now I should be able

8
00:00:59,998 --> 00:01:23,130
to make a person object. And I should be able to add a friend. It's hard to

9
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,590
tell whether anything happened yet or not. Maybe we haven't finished yet.

10
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,863
Clearly, there's still more to do.
