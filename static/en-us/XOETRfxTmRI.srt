1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,105
>> Here's another equation, and this time it looks harder.

2
00:00:03,206 --> 00:00:06,555
>> We have this negative 4 sitting outside these parentheses.

3
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:10,578
>> Well, we only need to multiply this negative 4 to the terms inside the

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:11,307
parentheses.

5
00:00:11,408 --> 00:00:13,032
>> This is called distribution.

6
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:17,183
>> When distributing the negative 4, I do negative 4 times x, and negative 4

7
00:00:17,195 --> 00:00:18,154
times negative 4.

8
00:00:18,462 --> 00:00:22,213
>> You want to make sure that you carry this sign in front of the second term

9
00:00:22,225 --> 00:00:22,605
with it.

10
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:25,306
>> I've also been careful to write each statement out.

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,918
>> I don't want to make an error with negative signs.

12
00:00:28,012 --> 00:00:29,240
>> Finish this problem now.

13
00:00:29,334 --> 00:00:31,346
>> What's the solution? What does x equal?
