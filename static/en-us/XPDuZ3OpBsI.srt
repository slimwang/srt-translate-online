1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,520
Now the interesting question is, once I go to the

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,400
node that I think is going to give me the page

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,410
that I'm looking for, or at least information about the page

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,390
that I'm looking for. Whether it is, if it has it,

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,970
it's going to give it to me, or if it

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,790
doesn't have it, it's going to tell me that it is

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,090
on the disk. But, in either case, I'm going to get,

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,170
I'm hoping, I'll get exact information about this missing page from

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,250
this node which is supposed to have the

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,870
page foame directory, the PFD that corresponds with

11
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,980
this UID. Is that possible that I go to this guy, and he says no, I

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:44,845
don't have it. Yes, it is possible in two cases. One case is, let's say, while

13
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:48,490
this guy was sending this request over, this

14
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,390
guy has made a decision to evict that

15
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:57,630
page that corresponds to this UID because it had to make space for itself. In

16
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:03,550
that case, that UID may have been thrown away from the PFD. And if it has been

17
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:10,730
thrown away from the PFD, what he would have done is inform the guy who has

18
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:16,830
the ownership for this UID, this node is the owner for this UID. If he evicts

19
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,685
that page this guy has to tell this node that,

20
00:01:20,685 --> 00:01:22,730
hey, you know what, I used to back this UID

21
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:28,000
in my PFD but I got rid of it. And, and I got rid of it by sending it to some

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,050
other node, let's say, node D. So that is something

23
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,240
that I have to communicate to this GCD, but it's a

24
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,070
distributed system. Things are happening asynchronously. He may not have

25
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:42,540
communicated that yet, that information is not there in the GCD

26
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,830
of this node. This is the owner for this UID space. But the owner

27
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:53,260
doesn't yet know that the PFD that corresponds to a particular

28
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:58,030
UID has moved to some other node out here somewhere. And if

29
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,340
it has moved to some other node, he will

30
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,600
know about eventually, but he doesn't have it at this

31
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,760
point. That's why this request was routed here, and

32
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,660
this guy says I don't have it. It can have

33
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,850
a miss. That's one possibility. Second possibility

34
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,250
is the uncommon case that the POD information

35
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:20,460
that I had is stale. When can that happen? That is when the POD is being

36
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,850
recomputed for the local area network as a

37
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,550
whole, either because there are new additions or

38
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,310
new deletions of nodes. And therefore we are

39
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,940
recomputing the redistribution of the UID space and

40
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,980
deciding which node is responsible for which UID. That can

41
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,230
happen. And in that case also, it is possible that

42
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,823
the information that I started with was incorrect. Because I

43
00:02:43,823 --> 00:02:46,343
went here thinking that he has the GCD, he didn't

44
00:02:46,343 --> 00:02:48,821
have it at that point, but it is changing. And

45
00:02:48,821 --> 00:02:51,780
eventually I'm going to find out. So if there is a

46
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,329
mess, either case. The first case is, this guy replaced

47
00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:58,434
that page, or the second case is, my POD information

48
00:02:58,434 --> 00:03:02,020
misled me. Both cases, I'll have a miss. And I'll

49
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,000
say, oh, it was a miss. And I know that

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,284
is probably the uncommon case. I'm going to retry that,

51
00:03:08,284 --> 00:03:10,864
by looking up my POD again. And by that time, the

52
00:03:10,864 --> 00:03:13,904
POD may have been updated, I'll go to the right

53
00:03:13,904 --> 00:03:17,218
GCD this time. Or, the GCD would have been updated

54
00:03:17,218 --> 00:03:19,682
and so I'll go to the same GCD, but the

55
00:03:19,682 --> 00:03:23,455
GCD will have the more relevant information of which PFD is

56
00:03:23,455 --> 00:03:26,295
currently hosting it. So, I'll go to him in

57
00:03:26,295 --> 00:03:29,620
order to get the page that I'm looking for.

58
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,120
But the important point I want to leave you with

59
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,470
is that the common case is when both the POD

60
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,360
and GCD are coresident on the same node. And

61
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,560
in that case, you don't have a network communication to

62
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,760
look up the GCD, and also the miss happening

63
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,808
when you do reach the PFD. That is also uncommon.

64
00:03:48,808 --> 00:03:52,730
It can because happen because of replacement that has happened

65
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:56,110
on that node, or because the POD has changed. And this

66
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,130
is something that is going to happen relatively infrequently compared to

67
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,980
the activities that we're talking about in terms of page faults.
