00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,850
Before you continue to the next lesson, I'd like to encourage you to

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,250
take a minute to set up a Git workspace that will work well for you.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,660
If you take the time to configure a few things about Git,

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,540
it can be much easier and more pleasant to use.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,630
My configuration includes this custom prompt,

6
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:19,060
which shows my user name in purple and what directory I'm in in blue.

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,090
Having it more colorful like this just makes it stand out more from

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,650
the other commands.

9
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:29,150
Now, if I cd into a directory with a Git repository, I also have this in green,

10
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,250
which shows which commit I currently have checked out.

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,160
Right now, it's just showing the commit ID, but in lesson two,

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,110
you'll see how to give commits names and this will become more useful.

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:43,010
This prompt will also show a star if I've made any changes since committing.

14
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:48,220
So if I were to open up game.js and add another line, then you see a star here,

15
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,390
which indicates that I have changes that haven't been committed.

16
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,430
I'm just going to undo that, so now the star is gone.

17
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,287
I also have tab completion set up so

18
00:00:57,287 --> 00:01:01,386
I can type just the first few characters of a Git command, for example, git l

19
00:01:01,386 --> 00:01:05,572
and press Tab, and the rest of the command will be completed automatically.

20
00:01:05,572 --> 00:01:08,950
There are also some situations where Git will open up a text editor.

21
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,440
For example, as you'll see in the next lesson, when you make a submit,

22
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,398
Git opens an editor for you to write a commit message.

23
00:01:15,398 --> 00:01:18,280
You want to just set this editor to whatever you prefer to use.
