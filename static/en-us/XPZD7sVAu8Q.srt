>> I'm going to momentarily make these problems at the bottom small and just

2
00:00:03,794 --> 00:00:07,621
show you the answers to the first three. Then we'll move onto the last two

3
00:00:07,621 --> 00:00:11,750
later. So here's the work and the answers for the first three problems. We have

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,530
x is less than negative 3, x is greater than or equal to negative 2, and x is

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:19,361
greater than three. Of course with this last one, we started out with x on the

6
00:00:19,361 --> 00:00:23,015
right side of the equation, and some people prefer to put the variable on the

7
00:00:23,015 --> 00:00:26,732
left side in the answer. So if you want to follow that convention, then to get x

8
00:00:26,732 --> 00:00:30,437
onto the left side, you also need to flip the inequality so that it's facing the

9
00:00:30,437 --> 00:00:34,681
opposite direction. Saying that 3 is less than x is also the same as saying, x

10
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:39,552
is greater than 3. And now moving on to our last two problems. And after several

11
00:00:39,552 --> 00:00:45,143
steps we end up with x is greater than or equal to 4 and x is greater than 4.
