1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Of these four options, the third and the fourth ones are valid solutions.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The first one doesn't work because an eavesdropper could use Alice's public key

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
to decrypt the first part of this message and read the message.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The second one isn't possible because Alice doesn't have Bob's private key.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
For the third one, only Bob can decrypt the entire message with his private key

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and then he can use Alice's public key to get the message and verify that it came from Alice.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
For the fourth option, any eavesdropper can reverse the first encryption using Alice's public key,

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
but cannot decrypt the full message without Bob's private key.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So both of these will work.
