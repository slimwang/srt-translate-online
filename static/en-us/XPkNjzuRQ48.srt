1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now I want you to extend your routine to accommodate the landmark

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Specifically, I want you to use a function that I coded for you that is very useful

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
that is called "expand."

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You can run omega.expand, xi.expand to take a 3 x 3 matrix or vector

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and move it to a 4 x 4 vector that you actually need when you have to include

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
the landmark itself.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Give that a try and see if you can modify the code

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
to now have additional input parameters of measurement 0, 1, and 2.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
In particular, here is our new doit routine.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It now has as input parameters my 2 motion commands

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and the 3 measurement commands for the 3 different poses.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Here is the code that you produced before.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
That's my version of it where we have the initial 3 x 3 matrix.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Then using the expansion command

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
you can now increase those to a 4 x 4 matrix and a 4 x 1 vector.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
When you run it what comes out is this result over here-- -3, 2, 5, 7.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I want you to do this where -3 and 2 and 5 is the robot path,

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and 7, as before, is the landmark location.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Please code this and realize that I can modify the input to doit just fine,

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and your code should not just produce this one vector,

21
00:01:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but it should implement the right math.
