1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
As before, without it'd be 1, but with it'd be 2/3 or approximately 0.667.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The reason is without fake data, one out of one coins flips gave me heads,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
but with the fake data we had three experiments, of which two came up heads,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
so 2/3 is 0.667.
