1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I told you to use a mathematical formula, so I cheated a little bit.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I wrote a little piece of code to actually generate a complete graph

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and then return the number of edges in that graph.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
To make a complete graph, I just looped through all the pairs of nodes,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and if one node was smaller than the other, then I made a link between them.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That was mainly to just make sure I didn't make a link from nodes to themselves.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
There is no reason not to make a link the other way.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It would have not counted against the total, but this seemed nicer and cleaner.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Let's look at what happens if you loop on all the different values of n

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
from 1 to 9 and print n and the number of edges in the clique.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
A graph with one node has no edges.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
A graph with 2 nodes fully connected has one edge, 3 has three--that's a triangle,

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
4 has six, which is the square with the x through the middle of it,

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
5 is that pentagram-looking thing that we just showed a minute ago,

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and it continues growing up like that.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
With that as our insight, can we actually write down what the formula is

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
for a graph with n nodes?

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Essentially what happens is each node gets an edge to each other node,

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
which we can write as each node has an edge to each other node.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Notice what happens if we use that as our formula, we're going to count this edge,

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
as it goes from this node to this node.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We're also going to count it again, as it goes from this node to this node.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We've double counted everything, so that should be our formula,

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
which is Î(nÂ˛). Let's just double-check this.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
If we print n, clique (n), which I counted by actually creating the clique,

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
compared that to the formula n * (n -1)/2,

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
you can see that it matches up perfectly.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So, really the answer that you should have given is this--

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
shouldn't have bothered with any of this creating of stuff.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Now, in addition to all those graphs where the growth rate was linear, we now have one that's quadratic.
