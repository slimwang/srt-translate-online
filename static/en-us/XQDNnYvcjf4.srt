00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,230
Suppose you want to sort four values.

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,140
I claimed that the following
circuit will do it.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,750
Note that this is a minus comparator and
the rest are plusses.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,550
Can you see how it works?

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,400
I want you to show me.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,540
At each wire I put a box.

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,810
What I want you to do is fill in
the box with the value of the wire.
