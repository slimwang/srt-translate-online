00:00:00,068 --> 00:00:02,037
In the previous videos,

2
00:00:02,037 --> 00:00:07,460
we talked about the iso performance lines and then our c curve.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,740
We've also learned about accuracy.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,290
Now we could have a straight line or

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,460
an iso performance curve that gives the best accuracy.

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,180
Let's look at the following problems.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,540
We don't assign this as a quiz, but

8
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,090
rather as a discussion that you should participate in the forum.

9
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:33,980
Let the true positive rate of a classifier be p, where p is some value.

10
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:39,160
What should be the slope of the line that will give isometric accuracy?
