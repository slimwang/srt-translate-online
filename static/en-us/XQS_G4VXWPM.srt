1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,830
Next, we're going to travel
all the way to Baltimore to

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:07,211
the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School
of Public Health to speak with Dr.

3
00:00:07,211 --> 00:00:08,220
Gerard Anderso.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,030
A professor there and the first
author of the paper I site more than

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:18,570
any other during this course, The Rising
Tide of Chronic Disease in America.

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,760
Gerard, thank you so much for
being with us today.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,300
It's a thrill to meet you.

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,470
>> I'm glad to be here.

9
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,180
>> Great.
A decade ago, you and

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,974
your colleague Jane published
what I view as a seminal paper,

11
00:00:29,974 --> 00:00:33,400
A Growing Version of
Chronic Disease in America.

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,286
The students of the course,
if they've been paying attention,

13
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,814
are quite familiar with it by now.

14
00:00:37,814 --> 00:00:43,149
And, it opened my mind to
the aggregate problem of

15
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:50,272
chronic disease in a way that really,
no previous paper had done.

16
00:00:50,272 --> 00:00:52,511
Which is why I view it the way I do.

17
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:57,144
So we're ten years later,
have we made progress?

18
00:00:57,144 --> 00:00:58,098
Where are we?

19
00:00:58,098 --> 00:00:59,780
>> Well, we have made progress.

20
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,214
I think what you knew already is that,
you saw that patients

21
00:01:03,214 --> 00:01:07,687
of that chronic disease, but you didn't
know how many patients there were.

22
00:01:07,687 --> 00:01:11,855
And now, we know that there are 150
million Americans, almost one out of

23
00:01:11,855 --> 00:01:15,453
every two Americans, that have one or
more chronic conditions.

24
00:01:15,453 --> 00:01:19,933
And that is sort of the new information
that we were trying to bring ten

25
00:01:19,933 --> 00:01:20,713
years ago.

26
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:25,167
Now what we're trying to do, now that
we have the attention of policy makers,

27
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:27,749
is to start changing In
the delivery system.

28
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:32,006
That starts with prevention, but
it goes to care and cure for

29
00:01:32,006 --> 00:01:34,018
these chronic conditions.

30
00:01:34,018 --> 00:01:36,886
And there,
we're making a lot less progress.

31
00:01:36,886 --> 00:01:40,079
I was more optimistic ten
years ago than I am now.

32
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,960
Most everything that we've tried
recently has just not worked very well.

33
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,728
>> Well, here in the last few years,

34
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:52,793
we've tried to make the healthcare
industry adopt Health IT.

35
00:01:52,793 --> 00:01:57,260
And we've tried to create
health information exchanges.

36
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,170
We're still really early in that, but

37
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,366
are you optimistic that that will happen
and that it'll make a difference?

38
00:02:05,366 --> 00:02:09,441
>> Well, it is happening, so
I'm very optimistic that it will happen.

39
00:02:09,441 --> 00:02:12,424
What I don't think we've
solved very well so

40
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:15,258
far is that dashboard
problem of a doctor.

41
00:02:15,258 --> 00:02:18,778
I have ten minutes to take
care of a patient, and

42
00:02:18,778 --> 00:02:21,510
she has seven things wrong with her.

43
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,400
She's seeing nine other doctors,
and I have ten minutes.

44
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,710
If I spend most of that time
looking at her medical record,

45
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,400
I now have five minutes to talk to her.

46
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,210
And so the challenge is,
how can we get that information

47
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:40,940
out to the physician in a timely
fashion for that complex patient.

48
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,110
For the patient that only has diabetes,
it's pretty easy.

49
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,880
But for that patient who has diabetes,
and congestive heart failure,

50
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,980
and beginning Alzheimer's,
and arthritis Brightest.

51
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,510
And seeing all these different doctors,
and

52
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,550
taking lots of different medications,
that's the challenge.

53
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,480
>> I hope the students remember
that comment because that's

54
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,450
basically what we're going to talk
about in Lesson 6 of the course.

55
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:01,990
>> Great!

56
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,690
>> Well, you also mentioned incentives.

57
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,160
Clearly, the healthcare system
has never been incented.

58
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,220
Do you see that working?

59
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,470
Are you optimistic that that's
actually going to happen in this

60
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,310
endlessly complex adaptive
healthcare system?

61
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:22,880
>> So I was just amazed when I
started this work in the 1990s.

62
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,790
That Australia had tried care
coordination programs, and

63
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,360
they had all failed.

64
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,280
And then, I support the United States
can do it differently,

65
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,940
or the UK could do it differently.

66
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,820
And so,
I've been looking around the world for

67
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,780
those models and
I just don't see them yet.

68
00:03:42,045 --> 00:03:46,445
We know what we need to do which is
to get everybody on the same team,

69
00:03:46,445 --> 00:03:50,895
probably with a nurse practitioner,
talking to all the doctors.

70
00:03:50,895 --> 00:03:52,865
But we haven't been
able to figure it out.

71
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:57,025
So almost all of the demonstrations
that we've tried,

72
00:03:57,025 --> 00:04:00,925
both in the public sector and in the
private sector, just haven't been able

73
00:04:00,925 --> 00:04:07,070
to save money, improve outcomes,
and improve satisfaction.

74
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:10,780
We just don't have very many
of those things that hit

75
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,090
all three of them very well.

76
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,860
And we're still working.

77
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,350
And so,
I'm optimistic that we will find it.

78
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,980
But so far,
we just haven't been very successful.

79
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:24,010
>> Your paper actually ends
on an optimistic note.

80
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:28,070
You point to the re-engineering
of the healthcare system

81
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:32,020
a century ago around new
knowledge in public health.

82
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:37,230
Is it so fundamentally different now
that that optimism might be misplaced?

83
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,850
>> No, but I think if you read
it a little more carefully,

84
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:46,300
what you'll see is I said we move
in 50 years from a system oriented

85
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,720
around infectious disease to one that's
oriented around acute illnesses.

86
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,780
And then,
we got that done by about 2000.

87
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:58,210
And I said it's going to
take us 50 years to reorient

88
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,730
the healthcare system
around chronic disease.

89
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,322
We have to start with the evidence base.

90
00:05:02,322 --> 00:05:07,481
We have to know how to take care of
somebody who has seven things wrong with

91
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:13,060
her when the NIH and the FDA exclude
all those people from clinical trials.

92
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,170
We don't have the educational system
in the medical schools oriented

93
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,540
around that.

94
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,270
We don't have the financing.

95
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:25,280
And so right now,
there isn't a real strong incentive for

96
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,030
hospitals and doctors to really
go after these people to take

97
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,290
care of them in an effective way.

98
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,320
In fact,
because they dont know how to do it,

99
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,990
they want to run away
from them in most cases.

100
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,965
But this is where the money is.

101
00:05:37,965 --> 00:05:41,290
Two-thirds of Medicare spending
is by people with five or

102
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,930
more chronic conditions.

103
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,540
We've gotta get the system right for
these people.

104
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,730
We just don't know how to do it yet.

105
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,010
>> So I can't speak to 50 years ago.

106
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:56,040
But 40 years ago, I was a medical
student first getting into this.

107
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,920
And I remember going into meetings.

108
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,870
And they would say, well,
here's where we are.

109
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:04,130
And if these trends continue, and we
don't do anything, by right about now,

110
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:08,430
health care will be consuming 20%
of the gross domestic product,

111
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,390
a number that's absolutely
not sustainable.

112
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,730
>> Right.
>> Now, I've seen projections

113
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,940
from OMB and others that if we don't
do anything, it'll be 40% in 50 years.

114
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,000
Do we have 50 years?

115
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,830
>> Well, when I started working and

116
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:27,720
trying to control healthcare costs in
the 1970's, I said that we'll never

117
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,710
be able to sustain 10%
on GDP on healthcare.

118
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,540
Now, it's close to 20.

119
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,630
So, I've stopped making
projections as to whether or

120
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,130
not we can afford to do something.

121
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,220
What we know is that by
the time it gets to almost 30%,

122
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,550
which isn't that far along,
almost all the growth in the economy.

123
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,050
All the productivity growth
in the economy will, in fact,

124
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:55,560
go to support the growth in healthcare,
and that's probably not sustainable.

125
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,380
But, we don't know what's
going to turn this ship around.

126
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,170
Maybe it's IT.

127
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,430
Maybe it's changing
the financial incentives.

128
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,980
But since everybody's making so

129
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,710
much money in healthcare and
jobs are important and

130
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:14,470
financial security is important,
it's going to be a really tough change.

131
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:18,220
>> So, many of us speculate that

132
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,790
eventually with our
backs against the wall

133
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,750
we'll adopt a single payer system
like every other country on Earth.

134
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,470
You think that's going to
happen here in the US?

135
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:30,630
>> I was more optimistic
in the 90s than I am today.

136
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,230
Basically, Americans love choice.

137
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:39,190
All you have to do is go to the grocery
store and go down the cereal aisle.

138
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:43,610
>> And look at 40 to 100
different choices of cereal.

139
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,910
Whereas if you go to France,
you will see two or three in most cases.

140
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,760
Choice is what makes America, and

141
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:56,920
it's going to be really hard to get the
private insurance industry out of it.

142
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:01,810
We can't even get right now many
of the states to embrace Medicaid.

143
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,465
So, if they can't embrace Medicaid,
which is free money.

144
00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:09,965
To them, why would we think that
they would go to a single pair?

145
00:08:09,965 --> 00:08:11,575
I mean, I think it makes sense.

146
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:15,795
It means that we pay a lot more for
healthcare than other industrialized

147
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:21,270
countries because of this choice, but
America seems to really like choice.

148
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,640
Well, thank you very much.

149
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,820
It's been a pleasure.

150
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:24,950
>> Thank you.

151
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,370
>> And maybe we'll be able to get
together in ten more years and

152
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,790
see what's happened.

153
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,770
>> Hopefully,
it'll be more optimistic that time.
