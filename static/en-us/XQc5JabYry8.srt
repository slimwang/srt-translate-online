Mobile phones, are they really mobile? Let's

2
00:00:02,922 --> 00:00:05,542
conduct a quick experiment to determine that.

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,950
>> I's not doing anything. It's not going anywhere.

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,296
>> Really? Oh, correct. Well, it turns out mobile phones

6
00:00:15,296 --> 00:00:20,080
aren't mobile. What is mobile are people that use these phones.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,450
>> And the reason we love our smart phones so much

00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,830

mobile constraint called handedness. So let's jump right to a quiz.

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,980
>> So you have four screens here. Each one has

12
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,650
two actions that you can perform on it. Which one of these

13
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:42,070
screens best serves the user using this application with a single hand?
