1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,459
so our strategy to find lines and image

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:04,620
space will be to look for intersecting

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,410
lines in half space we do this by

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,330
dividing up our half space into a grid

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,000
and define intersecting lines as all

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,279
lines passing through a given grid cell

7
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:16,949
to do this I'll first run the canny edge

8
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:19,050
detection algorithm to find all points

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,050
associated with edges in my image i can

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,000
then consider every point in this edge

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,518
detected image as a line in half space

12
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:28,469
and where many lines and half space

13
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:30,599
intersect i declare i have found a

14
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,488
collection of points that described a

15
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:35,250
line in image space we have a problem

16
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,859
though vertical lines have infinite

17
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:41,520
slope in mb representation so we need a

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,549
new parameterization let's redefine our

19
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:47,280
line in polar coordinates now the

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,070
variable row describes the perpendicular

21
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,890
distance of the line from the origin and

22
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,469
theta is the angle of the line away from

23
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:58,229
horizontal now each point in image space

24
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:00,420
corresponds to a sine curve in half

25
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,299
space if we take a whole line of points

26
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:05,280
it translates into a whole bunch of sine

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,650
curves and half space and again the

28
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,810
intersection of those sine curves in

29
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,489
data row space gives the

30
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:18,109
parameterization of the line
