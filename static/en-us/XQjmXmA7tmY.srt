1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,378
No private addresses aren't private in
the sense of being secret or personal.

2
00:00:05,378 --> 00:00:08,779
They're private, because they're
only any good on the local network.

3
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:10,907
They can't be used to directly
on the public internet,

4
00:00:10,907 --> 00:00:12,460
because they're not actually unique.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,780
Thousands or maybe millions of people
in the world are using IP addresses in

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:23,529
the 192.168 range, but each one of
these is behind a different NAT router.

7
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,170
Once again, there are three different
blocks of IP addresses which

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,770
are reserved for this private use.

9
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,940
By design, these addresses should
never be used on the public internet.

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:40,193
They're used inside homes, offices, data
centers, on mobile networks and so on.

11
00:00:40,193 --> 00:00:42,533
If you're using a private
address on your computer,

12
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:45,861
there's still a public address being
used on the other side of your router or

13
00:00:45,861 --> 00:00:47,379
your mobile provider or the like.

14
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:51,321
Web servers and other internet services
don't see your private address.

15
00:00:51,321 --> 00:00:53,540
They see the public address,
whatever it is.

16
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,800
There are number of ways you can
find out your public address and

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,450
services that look at what address
they see on your request and

18
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,390
respond with what you say.

19
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:08,270
Search engines including, Google,
Bing and many others will all tell

20
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:13,290
you your public IP address if you
search for the term my ip address.

21
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,670
Now, let's try it out.

22
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,794
First, look in your
network configuration and

23
00:01:19,794 --> 00:01:22,779
find your computer's
assigned IPv4 address.

24
00:01:22,779 --> 00:01:24,416
Is that IP address a private one?

25
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:26,355
Yes or no.

26
00:01:26,355 --> 00:01:28,930
If it is, what's your public address?
