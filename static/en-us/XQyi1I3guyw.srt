00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,420
So let's see if we can now
figure out a RAID 4 array.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:08,280
Suppose we have a RAID
4 array with 5 disks.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,570
A single disk is just like
in previous RAID quizzes.

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:18,880
200 gigabytes, 10 megabytes per second,
throughput and an MTTF of 100,000 hours.

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,050
When a disk fails in this RAID 4 array,
we replace it and

6
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,990
it takes us 24 hours to do that.

7
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:31,740
So then our 5 disk RAID 4 array has
what data capacity in gigabytes?

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,390
What throughput in megabytes per second?

9
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,650
Again assuming that we do 50%
of our accesses are reads and

10
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,680
50% of our accesses are writes.

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,770
And finally,
what is the MTTF of the whole array?
