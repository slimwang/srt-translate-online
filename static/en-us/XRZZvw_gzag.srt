1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,900
So if you went searching through
these APIs, which I hope you did.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,870
You'll find that each one of them is
made for very special kinds of data.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,770
For Developer A, the Sunlight APIs
actually work really well.

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:13,020
They have all kinds of information
about legislators, districts,

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,290
and everything mentioned.

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,690
For Developer B, number five,
Riot Games API works the best,

7
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:18,490
and that makes sense.

8
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,190
Riot Games makes League of Legends,
so they have an API for it.

9
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,260
For Developer C, the OpenMenu API works.

10
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,950
It gives them the ability to display the
locations of restaurants that they want.

11
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,140
For Developer D,
the World Bank API works well.

12
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,880
This gives them
information about GDP and

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,440
other economic statistics for
countries around the world.

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,970
And then last, Developer E,
number four, the Gilt API.

15
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:43,040
So Gilt maintains all kinds of
information about top designer labels.

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,850
And that's what you'd want to use.

17
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,900
So, these five examples are really
only scratching the surface of

18
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,200
the kind of data that's out there.

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,398
You know, this is something as
a developer that you'll do a lot.

20
00:00:52,398 --> 00:00:55,330
If you want to build an app, and
you know what kind of data you need,

21
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,750
the first thing you do
is go search about it,

22
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,190
and see if there's an API available.

23
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,110
If there isn't one,
you can actually build one yourself.

24
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,980
And, I'm not going to cover
that in this class, but

25
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,700
I'll put some links in the instructor
notes if you're interested.

26
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,050
For now let's go ahead and move on and
start building our first app.
