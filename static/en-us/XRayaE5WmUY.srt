00:01:06,822 --> 00:01:11,130
As fun as that clip was to watch, it was ten times more fun to make.

3
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,340
We did a silent film because the Canvas is a visual-only medium that

4
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,020
doesn't provide sound.

5
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,850
When we were brainstorming this project, we had to figure out how to

6
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:23,060
do things typically done in video editing software, in the Canvas.

7
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,230
We accomplished this by using a combination of tutorials we found online,

8
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,700
source code, sometimes in other programming languages, that we converted to

9
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:35,420
JavaScript, and other times, a description of the thing that we wanted to do.

10
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,330
We don't have the time to teach you all of the effects we did, but

11
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,480
we'll give you some pointers in this lesson.
