00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:03,540
Intradomain routing protocols are responsible for

00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,850
routing within an autonomous system. Interdomain routing

00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,710
protocols, on the other hand, are

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,500
responsible for routing traffic between autonomous systems.
