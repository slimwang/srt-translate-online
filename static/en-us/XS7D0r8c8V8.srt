00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,072
>> Vertical and horizontal lines are somewhat tricky. They go against our

2
00:00:04,072 --> 00:00:08,705
intuition. When we think of vertical lines, we usually think about the variable

3
00:00:08,705 --> 00:00:13,226
y. But the equation is actually x equals. It's because the x-coordinate for

4
00:00:13,226 --> 00:00:17,589
every point on this line was 2. When we usually think about the horizontal

5
00:00:17,589 --> 00:00:22,222
direction, we think about the variable x. But horizontal lines are always in the

6
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:26,617
form, y equals. All the points on this line have a y-coordinate of negative 3,

7
00:00:26,617 --> 00:00:31,227
that's why it's y equals. When math goes against our intuition, it's helpful to

8
00:00:31,227 --> 00:00:35,947
stop and think, what's true for all the points? What is this line really saying?

9
00:00:35,948 --> 00:00:40,772
The coordinates of each point can be a lot of information, and they help us find

10
00:00:40,772 --> 00:00:42,463
the equations of the lines.
