1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,950
So security planning, of course,

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:06,750
has to address this question of what
sort of controls make the most sense

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,160
given our assets and
given our threat, posture, and so on.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,220
So what are some of these controls?

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,820
So first thing that you have to worry
about is identity and access management.

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,530
This should come as no surprise because
you've been talking with authentication.

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,440
That tells us who is making a request
for any kind of resource we have

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,100
in the system, and
then we have access management.

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,850
So Identity Access Management is
a buzzword you hear all the time.

10
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,550
Access management basically says if
somebody is making a request for

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,910
a resource, do they have permission
to access that resource?

12
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,430
So, credentialing is essentially
deciding that the person is,

13
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:48,450
we're not going to worry about what you
need to show where to show who you are.

14
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,950
And based on that they're going to
create an account for you.

15
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:55,500
And they're going to decide what kind
of access should be granted to you.

16
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,500
Using passwords, then, for example,
you may have password policies.

17
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,230
How long the password has to be.

18
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,260
How frequently it has to be changed.

19
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,060
We talked about the Georgia Tech
policy for example.

20
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,390
Some places may have a multi
factor authentication for example,

21
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,270
they may require that you have
a token in relation to a password and

22
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,220
things like that.

23
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,050
Then we have our assets we are talking
about, we have networks and

24
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,170
we have hosts, servers and
desktops and so on.

25
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,960
So we have to have defenses for
those as well.

26
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,070
So we may have firewalls who control
what comes into our network or

27
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,670
our that leaves our network.

28
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,450
We may have Intrusion Detection and
Prevention Systems to look

29
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,825
at the traffic with the network level
then look at network traffic or

30
00:01:37,825 --> 00:01:39,600
host activity, and so on, and

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,880
decide if there is something
suspicious that may be going on.

32
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,560
Another controller solution
we might acquire is that

33
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,450
people have anti-virus systems
running on their machines.

34
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:53,125
People talk about their effectiveness
and question how good they are,

35
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:57,465
but there's not going to be one solution
that takes care of everything or

36
00:01:57,465 --> 00:01:59,335
one control that takes
care of everything.

37
00:01:59,335 --> 00:02:04,115
They all help you increase
the level of assurance, as we said,

38
00:02:04,115 --> 00:02:05,855
that you are secure.

39
00:02:05,855 --> 00:02:08,175
So we may require this.

40
00:02:08,175 --> 00:02:12,780
If people access our system, the
network's from outside, we may require

41
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,710
that we have a VPN solution,
a Virtual Private Network solution.

42
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,920
If they bring your own devices,
that might necessitate something else.

43
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,870
We know that the software,
we are talking about systems and

44
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:28,455
controls, so
the software we run on our systems may,

45
00:02:28,455 --> 00:02:32,665
vulnerabilities may be discovered and
patches may become available.

46
00:02:32,665 --> 00:02:37,515
And when we talk about controls I think
we're talking technological controls.

47
00:02:37,515 --> 00:02:41,750
These examples of course, password
management or identity management,

48
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,980
firewalls and so on.

49
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,910
So it looked like those, but not a
control is how do we educate our users?

50
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,522
So this could be, for example,
some sort of periodic thing you run.

51
00:02:52,522 --> 00:02:56,930
We've seen many companies, for
example, to educate their employees so

52
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,367
they don't fall for phishing attacks.

53
00:02:59,367 --> 00:03:03,430
Monthly or they have these things
where they send you an email and

54
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,940
if you fall for it,
this is not a real attack.

55
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,790
This is sort of used to train and

56
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,830
educate you that you shouldn't be
falling for those kind of things.
