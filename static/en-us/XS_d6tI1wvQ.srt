00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,430
As you have seen in this lesson,
the distribution of daily returns for

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:07,830
stocks and the market look
very similar to a Gaussian.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,520
This property persists when we
look at weekly, monthly, and

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,610
annual returns as well.

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:18,410
If they were really Gaussian we'd say
the returns were normally distributed.

6
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,300
In many cases in financial
research we assume the returns

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,010
are normally distributed.

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,860
But this can be dangerous
because it ignores kurtosis or

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,870
the probability in the tails.

10
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:34,940
In the early 2000s investment banks
built bonds based on mortgages.

11
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,070
They assumed that
the distribution of returns for

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,910
these mortgages was
normally distributed.

13
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:42,500
On that basis they were able
to show that these bonds had

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,070
a very low probability of default.

15
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,110
But they made two mistakes.

16
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:51,760
First, they assumed that the return of
each of these mortgages was independent,

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,310
and two that this return would
be normally distributed.

18
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,680
Both of these assumptions
proved to be wrong,

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,310
as massive numbers of homeowners
defaulted on their mortgages.

20
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:05,419
It was these defaults that precipitated
the great recession of 2008.
