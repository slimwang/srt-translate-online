00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,629
Congratulations on making it this far.

2
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:04,879
You'll now get started
on your next project,

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:08,719
building a game-playing AI to
win at the game, Isolation.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,700
Game playing has long been one of
the cornerstones of AI advancements.

5
00:00:12,699 --> 00:00:16,530
One of the biggest advancements in
recent AI has been in this field

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,630
through Google's Go winning AlphaGo AI.

7
00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:23,279
Similarly, one of the seminal events
of the 20th century was seeing

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,670
IBM's Deep Blue defeat Gary Kasparov,

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,300
a world chess champion,
in a game of chess.

10
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:30,070
Through this project,

11
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,600
you will take a huge step toward
understanding how these agents work.

12
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:36,359
Let's get down to the specifics.

13
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:38,200
In this project, you will design and

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,580
implement a game-playing agent to
play a game using adversarial search.

15
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:44,390
The agent will play Isolation,

16
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,240
the game you've been seeing
throughout these lectures.

17
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,690
In the game,
whenever either player occupies a cell,

18
00:00:49,689 --> 00:00:52,579
that location is blocked off for
the rest of the game.

19
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:56,189
The first player with no legal
move loses, and her opponent wins.

20
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,620
Your goal will be to program a player
that beats its opponent consistently

21
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:02,159
at this game.

22
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:06,670
Additionally, you will design different
heuristics to perform the adversarial

23
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,710
search, and then you will analyze and
compare their performance.

24
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:13,759
Good luck, we're thrilled to see what
you'll build in this fun project.
