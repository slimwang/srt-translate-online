1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:05,576
So let's say we chose
the site www.udacity.com.

2
00:00:05,576 --> 00:00:12,476
And we do host www.udacity.com.

3
00:00:12,476 --> 00:00:14,452
We get back something
a little bit interesting and

4
00:00:14,452 --> 00:00:16,010
different from what we got for Google.

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,945
The first part says that this name,
www.udacity.com,

6
00:00:21,945 --> 00:00:25,920
is an alias for
this big long name hosted at Amazon AWS.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,928
And then the second part says
that that name has reps over

8
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:36,472
the end of the line, but
it's three different IP addresses,

9
00:00:36,472 --> 00:00:41,272
54.200.240.37, and 52.25.,

10
00:00:41,272 --> 00:00:45,660
to 84.3, and 52.88 to 72.242.

11
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,110
Now if we did host -t a,

12
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:53,690
we could actually do the same thing.
