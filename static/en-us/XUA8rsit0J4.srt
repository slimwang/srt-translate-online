1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,360
So now, let's say that this is a sampling distribution. Because of this, we know

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:12,835
that 95% of sample means fall within 1.96 standard deviations, or in this case

3
00:00:12,835 --> 00:00:19,360
standard errors, from the population mean. This is exactly the same concept you

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,886
learned before, except before we were estimating, about 95% or within two

5
00:00:23,886 --> 00:00:28,334
standard deviations of the mean. But now, we are just going to use exact values

6
00:00:28,334 --> 00:00:33,330
and we're going to do that from now on. So, exactly 95% of sample means fall

7
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:40,373
within 1.96 standard errors from the population mean in a sampling distribution.
