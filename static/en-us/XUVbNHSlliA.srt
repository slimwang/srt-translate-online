Here is a tricky quiz question.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Say we alpha, our data weight to zero, and better, our smoothing weight, to 0.1,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and we run this to completion. What do we get?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Your original path? The straight line connecting the initial the final location?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Or will everything collapse to a single point?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
