1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,200
We can see what might be relationships between price

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,420
and clarity and price and color, which we'll keep in

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,050
mind for later when start modelling our data. You might

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,200
remember this when you create the box plots in problem

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,080
set three. Be that as it may, the critical factor

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,590
driving price is the size, or the carat weight of

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,620
the diamond. As we saw at the start of the

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,980
lesson, the relationship between price and diamond size is nonlinear.

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,270
What might explain this pattern? On the supply side, larger

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:33,070
continuous chunks of diamonds without significant flaws are probably harder to

11
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,220
find than smaller ones. This might help explain the sort

12
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,090
of exponential looking curve, and I thought I noticed this when

13
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,860
I was shopping for a diamond for my soon to

14
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,780
be wife. Of course, this is related to the fact that

15
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,980
the weight of a diamond is a function of volume, and

16
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,980
volume is a function of the length times the width times

17
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,720
the height of a diamond, and this suggests that we might

18
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,400
be especially interested in the cube root of carat weight. It's often

19
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,420
the case, that leveraging substantive knowledge about your data like this can

20
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,050
lead to especially fruitful transformations, and we'll see that in a second.
