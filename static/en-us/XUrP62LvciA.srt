00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,175
A smaller bin size will allow us more detail. For example let's cut the bin size

2
00:00:05,175 --> 00:00:10,271
in half. The bin size is now 10 instead of 20 resulting in twice as many columns

3
00:00:10,271 --> 00:00:15,311
or intervals. So there are now twice as many numbers for which we know exactly

4
00:00:15,311 --> 00:00:18,972
the proportion less than or greater than those values.
