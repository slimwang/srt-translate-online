If you said 9, excellent work. I've copied this part of the fraction over here.

2
00:00:05,153 --> 00:00:09,429
Working with bases of 10, I can use my exponent rules to figure out what the

3
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:13,925
power should be. Here are multiplying bases, so we add the exponents. 5 plus

4
00:00:13,925 --> 00:00:18,432
negative 3 equals 2, and negative 4 plus negative 3 equals negative 7. Next I

5
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:22,816
can subtract my exponent since I'm doing division of the bases. So 10 to the 2

6
00:00:22,816 --> 00:00:26,973
minus negative 7, or 10 to the 9th. This also makes sense because we know

7
00:00:26,973 --> 00:00:31,433
negative exponents wind up in the opposite position. So 10 to the negative 7th

8
00:00:31,433 --> 00:00:35,811
would wind up being 10 to the positive 7th in the numerator. 10 to the 2nd and

9
00:00:35,811 --> 00:00:37,846
10 to the 7th would be 10 to the 9th.
