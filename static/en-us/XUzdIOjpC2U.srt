1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,400
The answer lies in understanding covariance.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,870
Covariance only examines linear relationships and

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,310
is at the heart of linear regression.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,640
A relationship which is not linear will have a very low covariance score.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,570
Let's look at an example.

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:21,240
Let's look at y equals x squared between negative 1 and 1.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,740
So y is totally determined by the value of x in this example.

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,850
Y and x have a very strong relationship.

9
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,250
Now, let's suppose that I were to sample points from

10
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,310
this curve totally uniformly at random.

11
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,820
So I'm going to collect points x and

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,130
y from points along this curve and just select them totally uniformly at random.

13
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:50,760
And now, given these points let's calculate covariance.

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,980
Well, the covariance between x and y is, if you recall

15
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,820
the expectation of x minus the mean of x times y minus the mean of y.

16
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:06,340
And if you evaluate this for the curve above you'll find that the answer is 0.

17
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:11,330
So you'll find that the covariance takes on a maximum value when the degree of

18
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,410
the polynomial is 1.

19
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,090
As they increase in degree, but

20
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:20,690
remain odd, the covariance gradually decreases slowly.

21
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:26,820
But for even degree polynomials the covariance always evaluates to 0.

22
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,600
Similarly, inter-tweet time and

23
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,120
mention distance are related, but they're not linearly related.

24
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,310
Now, this makes intuitive sense.

25
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:40,270
If someone you know calls out your name, you are likely to immediately respond.

26
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,920
In general, in addition, in real life relationships are not linear.
