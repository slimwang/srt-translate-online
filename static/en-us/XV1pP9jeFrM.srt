00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,083
We changed our equation to look like this now. Let's think about this new

00:00:04,083 --> 00:00:08,699
equation. We know x really represents some number so I have one number here

3
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:13,101
added to 2 and I have another number here added to 3. We really have a number

4
00:00:13,101 --> 00:00:17,887
times a number equals 0. Which of these statements must be true about the two
