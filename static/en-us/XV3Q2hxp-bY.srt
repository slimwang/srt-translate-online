00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,200
Congratulations on building your new,
robust Mad Libs generator.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,250
Now, if there are other words you want
to prompt our user to fill in the blanks

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,050
for, all we need to do is add the word
to our list parts of speech, and

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:14,080
our Mad Libs generator
will work as expected.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,312
However, there's one last step that
we need to take in order to build

6
00:00:17,312 --> 00:00:20,840
the Mad Libs generator you saw Andy and
I play in the beginning of stage two.

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,654
Which is to replace the words that are
found in parts of speech with user input

8
00:00:25,654 --> 00:00:27,500
rather than the word corgi.

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,500
Now, like I said, we'll just have
to add one line of code to do this,

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,610
which we'll do by using
a function called raw_input.

11
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,280
Here's an example of
the raw_input function.

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,772
If we were to run this line of code,

13
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:42,310
we would be prompted with the message,
Type in a word.

14
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,910
If I follow those directions by typing
in let's say Udacity and then press

15
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:50,810
Enter on my keyboard, user_input will
now be set to the string Udacity.

16
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,280
Simple enough.

17
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,190
So the string you put in parentheses
is the prompt the user or

18
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,890
player will receive.

19
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,280
And whatever they type on their
keyboard, followed by Enter,

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,490
will be the variable's value.

21
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,510
We use raw input in our Mad Libs
generator by prompting a user for

22
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,200
the part of speech we want
them to fill in the blank for.

23
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,260
And use that as a replacement
instead of corgi.

24
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,430
But where in our code do we use this?

25
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:18,190
So if this was the part of my code that
replaces the part of speech with corgi,

26
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:22,050
which you built in the last quiz,
my code will now look like this.

27
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,300
By adding this line of code and
by swapping the string corgi

28
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,530
with user input, we now have a fully
functioning Mad Libs generator.

29
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,740
In the download section there will be
a file that contains all the code you've

30
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,780
written up until now,
including this added line of raw input.

31
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,210
I've added a few strings near the top of
the file that you can play around with,

32
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,190
but I encourage you to write your
own Mad Libs sentences, add your

33
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:47,440
own words to the parts of speech list,
and run your Mad Libs generator on them.

34
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,880
The following videos will step you
through the process of running this

35
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,780
program locally so you can play
Mad Libs with your friends and family.
