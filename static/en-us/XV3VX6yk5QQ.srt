1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,960
So what did you get?

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,080
>> I wrote pile, tree,
node, and counter.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,970
>> Okay, so clearly there's
an important concept of pile.

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:17,190
And tree is important,
counter is important.

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,100
What did you do about leaf?

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,480
Leaf to me seems like it's
just a special kind of tree.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,780
It's just a distinction for a tree
that has no other children as a leaf.

8
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,120
>> Okay, a little while later in OOA,

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,580
we will look at the situation where
>> one

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,570
of the potential classes is a kind
of another one of the classes.

11
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,350
But for now let's include leaf
as a separate, separate class.

12
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:47,850
How about part?

13
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,078
>> So part is connected to,
I feel like I have a need to go back and

14
00:00:56,078 --> 00:00:58,670
see what concept that's connected to.

15
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,710
Is that part of the pile,
part of the tree?

16
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:07,170
So the parts of a tree
already I believe are nodes.

17
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,350
So to me, I guess I'm substituting
the word node for part.

18
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,250
>> Well a part of a tree could
be a subtree as well, right?

19
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,140
>> It's a collection of nodes.

20
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,770
>> So
the suggestion is at this early stage in

21
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,610
the process,
>> To err on the side of including extra

22
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,271
classes which we can then remove later.

23
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:30,530
>> Okay
>> So I would suggest having part

24
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,090
as a candidate class as this stage.

25
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,590
And then the other question I have
is you threw the word node in there,

26
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,400
which isn't in the original text.

27
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,060
Now there's nothing wrong with
>> using your judgement on adding

28
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,210
classes in there, but I was wondering
what you were thinking as you did that?

29
00:01:47,635 --> 00:01:52,750
>> Node I've seen use plenty of times
for tree to constitute a part of a tree,

30
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:57,480
a graph, a connected graph, and it seems
in my mind that using node here might be

31
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,610
a way to make it generic enough
that it could grow later.

32
00:02:01,615 --> 00:02:05,550
>> It's a concept that's general
enough to trees and grass.

33
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,690
I think that's my premise.

34
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,350
>> So we'll leave it in for
now and we'll see what happens.

35
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:17,200
In general, as analysts you're going
to have to use that kind of judgement.

36
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,980
To add in concepts that
the original description may

37
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,430
have either assumed or
didn't think through at all.

38
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:31,030
And one of the values of doing
an approach like this is that it will

39
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,920
point out problems, and inconsistencies
and incompleteness in the documents.

40
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,380
So I would say go with your
intuition at this stage.

41
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:44,940
One other noun that you didn't say
something about is zero, okay?

42
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,720
So what was your thinking about not
including zero as a potential classer?

43
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,790
>> Zero to me sounds like
a description of a tree or

44
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:59,390
an attribute to a tree,
>> it doesn't seem to represent its own,

45
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,630
in a sense, an object.

46
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,520
It's just a state of an object,
for instance.

47
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,416
>> Okay.
Can you pick one of the classes here

48
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:13,210
which zero might gravitate toward?

49
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,430
Counter.

50
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,190
>> Sure.
So

51
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,780
the counter's going to count something,
and

52
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,920
one of the possible things it's going to
count, is it going to have values, and

53
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,300
one of the values it might have is zero.

54
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,070
So I think you're right at
this stage of saying let's not

55
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,480
worry about zero as being a class.

56
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,150
Okay.

57
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,210
But we can't forget about it either.

58
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,220
Okay?
It's going to be part of our

59
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:36,990
model eventually.
