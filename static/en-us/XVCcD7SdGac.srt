Based on the table we made in the last quiz, we can determine intervals in

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:10,151
which the two x-intercepts we can see in this part of the graph lie. So, we

3
00:00:10,151 --> 00:00:12,461
have one x-intercept on the left, right around here, and one x-intercept to the

4
00:00:12,461 --> 00:00:16,320
right, right around here. Please use the values of x from the table to tell me

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,550
the intervals in which you know that these x-intercepts have to lay. Don't

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,370
forget the intermediate value theorem. Think about how we have to use that in

7
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,763
this problem.
