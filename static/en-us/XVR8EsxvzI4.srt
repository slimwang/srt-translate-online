1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,480
These are some ways that you can use the
technology we discussed in this course.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,580
And what I love about
each of these examples,

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,440
is that you can hardly
see the technology.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,110
Some people think that the future of
computing is keeping you immersed, and

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,910
keeping you away from you life.

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,750
But as it turns out,
with ubiquitous computing, less is more.

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,960
It's where we,
as developers and designers,

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,410
put the user before the technology.

9
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,200
As we remove the abstract barriers,

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,100
such as what functionality
resides on what device.

11
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,920
Our users can focus more
on what they're doing, and

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,170
less on how to start doing it.

13
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,420
Now, this simple core philosophy
to ubiquitous computing

14
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,810
is what you see over and
over again in terms like seamless,

15
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:46,060
simple, microinteraction,
and glanceable.

16
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,560
And it's not new.

17
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,680
It's the idea that success isn't
measured by how long the user is engaged

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,100
with the interface, but how quickly
we can get them to what they need.

19
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:59,090
Now there's a website that's been
around for just over 15 years,

20
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,890
that was built with that
philosophy in mind.

21
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:02,650
Google.

22
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:06,010
This kind of user
interaction is in our DNA.

23
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:09,380
Back at a time when the search engine
philosophy was to keep the user

24
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:14,340
on the page as long as possible,
Google went the other direction.

25
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,890
And as it turns out,
that's exactly what users wanted.

26
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,780
And that's why it made sense for
us to recognize that as a core

27
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,340
philosophy across all
these new form factors.
