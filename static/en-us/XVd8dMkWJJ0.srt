00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,249
We've discussed two of the components so far. First, we had the affective

2
00:00:04,249 --> 00:00:09,350
component, which was our feelings and emotions. And as we just saw with my

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:13,580
example of the red wings, we had the behavioral component. And this is a

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,250
tendency to act in a certain way toward something. Clearly, you could see how I

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,404
act towards the red wings. And the third component, of our attitudes, is the

6
00:00:22,404 --> 00:00:27,469
cognitive component. And this is our thoughts, beliefs, and ideas about

7
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:31,975
something. Our attitudes can vary in terms of how heavily each component is

8
00:00:31,975 --> 00:00:37,327
weighed. That is, you may have a more cognitive component for some attitudes,

9
00:00:37,327 --> 00:00:42,836
for example, maybe the best way to make cheese fondue. It may be more heavily

10
00:00:42,836 --> 00:00:46,427
weighted from the cognitive component as opposed to something such as your

11
00:00:46,427 --> 00:00:52,588
attitude towards abortion, which may have a more affective component. Although

12
00:00:52,588 --> 00:00:56,004
most of our basic attitudes may be instinctive, we do know that some of our

13
00:00:56,004 --> 00:00:58,140
attitudes are learned.
