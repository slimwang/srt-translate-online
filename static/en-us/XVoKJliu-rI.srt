>> Well I, for one, have a pretty tough time trying to think about an infinite

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:07,096
number of numbers. It would be great if we had a straightforward way to

3
00:00:07,096 --> 00:00:11,068
visualize this. Luckily, someone had the awesome idea to invent the number line,

4
00:00:11,068 --> 00:00:14,931
which is this wonderful visual device right here. A number line is basically a

5
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:19,062
way of displaying all of the real numbers. We can represent whatever number or

6
00:00:19,062 --> 00:00:22,897
range of numbers we want to on the number line just by shading in certain

7
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:27,130
positions on it. For example, since this dot is at the hash mark for negative 4,

8
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:31,249
I have just plotted negative 4 on this number line. Even though I've shown the

9
00:00:31,249 --> 00:00:35,077
integers on this number line, we can also plot any point in between two

10
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:39,234
integers, which is why all the real numbers can be shown on the number line.

11
00:00:39,234 --> 00:00:43,660
Notice that just like on the x-axis of a coordinate plane, numbers increase as

12
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,890
we move to the right and decrease as we move to the left. I've labeled three

13
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,046
points on this number line, A, B, and C. And I'd like you now to tell me what

14
00:00:52,046 --> 00:00:56,333
you think that each of these are equal to. What do you think the values at all

15
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:57,368
three points are?
