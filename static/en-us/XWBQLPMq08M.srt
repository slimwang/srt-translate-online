00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,969
The editor is quite powerful. 
Without using any code,

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:07,380
one can create relatively 
sophisticated layouts.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,020
Make sure to use 
the built-in styled text widgets

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,550
for large and medium text. 
All of the text is just placeholder text,

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,180
so you easily enter it 
using the visual editor.

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,256
If you're proud of your creation,
take a screenshot and post it

7
00:00:20,256 --> 00:00:22,962
along with the XML into the forums.

8
00:00:22,962 --> 00:00:26,700
Now that you have some background 
on the basic tools in Android studio,

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,650
and a few of the basic android 
user interface views,

10
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,850
Katherine will show you 
how to start making some sunshine.
