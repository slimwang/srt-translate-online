1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,910
Now it's your turn to write the code to

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:05,050
query for all conferences. You're going to need to add

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,810
the query conferences method, in the conference API class. You're

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,310
going to need to identify the function as an endpoint

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,800
method that uses HTTP post. And, now, if you

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,550
can't remember how to do that, just look at some

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,520
of the other functions in the file. An implement queryConferences

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,950
to return all conferences sorted by name. And when you've

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,070
written your function, go ahead and test it on

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:34,260
localhost. And that is important. It's really important that

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,980
you test it on localhost first. Don't cheat. Don't

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,560
deploy direct to appspot. You'll find, if you do

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,440
that, it probably won't work. After you run it

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,210
on localhost, go ahead and try out the query,

15
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,500
you can either do that in the API Explorer,

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,780
or you can go to the show conferences page.

17
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,570
Doesn't matter which way you do it, but make sure

18
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,900
that you run it on localhost first. And then, after you

19
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,490
test it on the localhost, I do want you to

20
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,400
deploy it to appspot. Now we're going to check that your application

21
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,410
actually works, and that it does create conferences and queries

22
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,510
conferences. I want you to go ahead and create a conference

23
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:14,240
called Udacity that's going to take place in London. It's important

24
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,390
that you get these right, that the name is actually Udacity,

25
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,160
spelled right, and that the city is in London.

26
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,580
Otherwise, our testing script might not work. And then go

27
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,780
ahead and enter your app ID here. This needs to

28
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,775
be the app ID, the app that's running on appspot.
