00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,660
Just one more question, and then you'll have a few more practice questions to

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,327
have some fun with. What if we have 12 is less than 4 x? I'd like you, however,

3
00:00:07,327 --> 00:00:10,975
to put the x on the left side of the solution, and then fill-in what inequality

4
00:00:10,975 --> 00:00:14,844
symbol belongs here. Input answer belongs on this side. You might want to check

5
00:00:14,844 --> 00:00:19,004
on either side of the endpoint of the inequality or the dividing mark between

6
00:00:19,004 --> 00:00:23,229
the solutions and the non-solutions to see if you have the inequality sign the

7
00:00:23,229 --> 00:00:24,310
right way around.
