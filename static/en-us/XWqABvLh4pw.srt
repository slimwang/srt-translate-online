00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,740
So far, whenever we make a search, we'll
retrieve all the objects of that type.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,610
For example, when we search for
notebooks we'll want all of them.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,560
However, if we want to display
the notes within a notebook,

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,520
we must filter out all the notes
that belong to other notebooks.

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,640
How can we do this filter trick?

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,190
With one of the crown jewels of cocoa,
NSPredicate.

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:28,450
NSPredicate is a class from back in
the old Objective-C days when blocks,

8
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:32,785
which are Objective-C's version
of closures, were not available.

9
00:00:32,785 --> 00:00:35,790
NSPredicate's still have their place,
notably in core data.

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,260
Predicates allows us to define filters
to select specific elements of an array

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,450
using a very simple language
called predicate language.

12
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,320
Let's see an example.
