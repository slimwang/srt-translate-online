1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,600
All right, I'll take that as an action
item and let's wrap this up.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,870
>> It's really cool that your fixed
the battery issues on this phone.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,160
I finally can find all my friends.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,130
>> Oh yeah, I mean you know with
the right tools and the right process

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,000
it turns out turning your code from
battery issues is really easy.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,390
>> There, there's still one bug left.

7
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,390
You know this right?

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,470
>> Oh really?
>> It says that code has been stuck in

9
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:21,580
there for 16 hours.

10
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,560
>> Oh you caught that.

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,100
Yeah.
The truth is that's not really a bug.

12
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,580
>> No?
>> Yesterday we overheard these guys

13
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,110
talking about managed
memory environments.

14
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,310
Like, they come for
free in terms of performance.

15
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,605
He completely flipped out so
we had to lock him in the elevator.

16
00:00:33,605 --> 00:00:37,517
[SOUND].

17
00:00:37,517 --> 00:00:38,890
>> Now this place ain't so bad.

18
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,230
Put some curtains in.

19
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,120
Maybe a window over there.

20
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,110
That would.
Be bad.

21
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:49,706
Some air.
[NOISE] I just want to make apps faster.

22
00:00:49,706 --> 00:00:51,182
Is that so bad?

23
00:00:51,182 --> 00:00:59,541
[NOISE]
We can do this.

24
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:01,328
We can do this.

25
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:02,850
I'll get you, Chris.

26
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:03,800
Mark my words.
