00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,952
In the last lesson we learned that linear factors of polynomials tell us about

2
00:00:04,952 --> 00:00:09,907
x-intercepts of the graphs that go along with those polynomials. So if we have

3
00:00:09,907 --> 00:00:14,032
an equation like y equals x minus 3 times x plus 1 It's going to have x

4
00:00:14,032 --> 00:00:18,655
intercepts of three, zero, and negative one zero. So this is a big part of our

5
00:00:18,655 --> 00:00:23,168
motivation for talking about factoring so much. If we can factor a polynomial

6
00:00:23,168 --> 00:00:27,392
then we already know all of the places where it hits the x axis. We learned

7
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:31,872
before the linear factors of a polynomial tell us about where the polynomial

8
00:00:31,872 --> 00:00:36,057
hits the x axis. On the last quiz, we learned that x squared plus one is not

9
00:00:36,057 --> 00:00:40,613
factorable, however, I'm going to expand our statement about x squared plus one

10
00:00:40,613 --> 00:00:44,761
and tell you that it is not only not factorable, but it actually has no real

11
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:49,221
linear factors. I know that we're not totally clear on what this means yet, and

12
00:00:49,221 --> 00:00:53,488
you'll learn in a few lessons. But let's just explore this briefly for now,

13
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:57,915
touch on it a bit. Considering this, how many places do you think on the graph

14
00:00:57,915 --> 00:01:00,769
of y equals x squared plus one touches the x axis?
