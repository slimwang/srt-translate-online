00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,250
Now if we check our code, you'll see that we have an error.

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,280
You can find the error at the bottom of the page.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,070
What it says is that element head is missing a required instance of

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,950
child element title.

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,820
What this means is that the head elements needs to

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,820
have a child element called title.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,150
So if we go back to our code.

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,700
So within our head elements, if we add a child element called title,

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,842
we can then say something like favorite app,

10
00:00:28,842 --> 00:00:32,406
and then re-verify the code, and we're now okay.
