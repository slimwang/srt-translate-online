Just about anything can be changed with texture mapping. Beyond color and

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,730
alpha, here's an example of changing the shininess for different locations on

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,790
the body. The face is fairly shiny. The back of the head and shoulders less so.

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:14,680
Here are the color and specular textures for the face. In 3.js, the specular

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,770
map uses the red channel of the texture as the strength of the specular

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:22,530
contribution. A level of 255 means the specular component is scaled to one. In

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,550
other words, full strength dropping off as this value falls. Your task is to

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,290
apply a texture as a specular map. See the exercises code for the path to the

9
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:33,870
texture. Look at the online documentation for how to set the specular map for

10
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,550
mesh fong material. On the left is the teapot without the specular map. Once

11
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,330
you're done, you'll see a teapot like the one on the right. As you change the

12
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,890
view, you'll see that just the specular highlights are textured.
