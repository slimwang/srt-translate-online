1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's start here--palace minus walk.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This is a lot like 5 minus 3 if "palace" and "walk" are identifiers.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Here the parentheses are balanced. We like this utterance.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Here we start a bold tag and right "naguib," but we never close off the bold tag.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This is not balanced.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Here we start an italics tag and write "mahfouz," and then we close off the italics tag.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This is well-balanced.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Here we write open "pulitzer" plus open "prize" close close--

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
open parenthesis, open parenthesis, close, close.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This one matches there. This one matches there. These are well-balanced.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You might think there's no reason to put "prize" in parentheses,

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and you might not if you were writing, but the grammar--the language--

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
allows it as long as the parentheses are balanced.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Over here this one is particularly tricky.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We have a close parenthesis followed by "1956" followed by an open parenthesis.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Now, the number of open and close parentheses is the same,

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
so you might think it's balanced, but they're in the wrong order.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We need to do the opening before the closing. This does not match.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
"Naguib Mahfouz" is a relatively famous Egyptian writer.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
He wrote Palace Walk. It's set in about 1917 around the end of World War I in Egypt in Cairo.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It details what goes on with Al-Sayyid Ahmad Abd al-Jawad and his family.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
My best attempt at doodling Egypt or Cairo is someone next to a pyramid.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You can tell it's a pyramid because it's clearly labeled.
