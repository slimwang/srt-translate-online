00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,650
It turns out that TCP is not a good fit for congestion control for streaming

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:10,710
video, or streaming audio. TCP retransmits lost packets,

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,930
but retransmissions may not always be useful. TCP

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,280
also slows down its sending rate after

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,860
packet loss, which may cause starvation of the

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,240
client. There's also a fair amount of overhead

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,275
in the protocol. A TCP header of 20

8
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:28,530
bytes for every packet is large for audio

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,310
samples. And sending acknowledgements for every other packet

10
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,100
may be more feedback than is needed. Instead,

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,050
one might consider using UDP. UDP does not retransmit

12
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,500
lost packets and it does not automatically adapt

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,330
the sending rate. It also has a smaller header.

14
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,400
Because UDP does not automatically retransmit packets or

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,890
adjust the sending rate, many things are left to

16
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,580
higher layers. Potentially the application, such as when

17
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,510
to transmit the data, how to encapsulate it, whether

18
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,470
to retransmit, and whether to adapt the sending

19
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,080
rate, or to adapt the quality of the video

20
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,619
or audio encoding. So higher layers must solve

21
00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:09,860
these problems. In particular, the sending rate still needs

22
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,610
to be friendly or fair to other TCP senders,

23
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,130
which may be sharing the link. There are a

24
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:20,400
variety of video streaming and audio streaming transport

25
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,590
protocols that are built on top of UDP, that

26
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,665
allows senders to figure out when and how to

27
00:01:26,665 --> 00:01:29,956
retransmit lost packets and how to adjust sending rates.
