1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,290
The answer is that it does not.

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,880
You can see that it doesn't
satisfy that last clause here.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:12,660
A is false, B bar is false,
and C bar is false.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,770
Therefore this clause is false.

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:18,490
And because it's anded with the rest,
the whole expression is false.
