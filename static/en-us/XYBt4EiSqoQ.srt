1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,390
>> Alright, Michael. So, let's write that

2
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:03,670
down in math, okay? You like math, right?

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:04,360
>> I do.

4
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,810
>> Okay. So here's the math version of it. I'm going to

5
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,980
just say that the utility that we receive for visiting a

6
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:15,440
sequence of states, S0, S1, S2 ellipsis, is simply the sum

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,600
of all the rewards that we will receive for visiting those states.

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,850
>> Sure.

9
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,480
>> Does that make sense?

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,110
>> Yeah.

11
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,000
>> Is that consistent with what you were

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,500
doing when you were thinking about the grid world?

13
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,610
>> Yeah, exactly. But I thought we were going to make that not

14
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,360
definitional, we were going to derive that it had to be that way.

15
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,290
>> No, we're not. They can read about it. It'd

16
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,910
take me, like, an hour and a half to do it.

17
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:37,550
>> Alright.

18
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,970
>> And I'm already losing my voice. But. What I do want

19
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:44,750
people, I want you to believe is that the utility of the sequence

20
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,430
of states, thinking of it as the sum of all the rewards, makes

21
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,830
sense, right? And then if nothing else, at least it makes, it's consistent

22
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,540
with what you've been doing as we've been talking about this grid work.

23
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,490
>> Yeah, absolutely. I mean it, it also kind of makes me think about money.

24
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,780
>> Go on.

25
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,780
>> Well, so, so, I mean, that's sort of how money works. If we get some kind

26
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,830
of payoff each day, those payoffs get added

27
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,700
to each other. They don't get, you know, subtracted

28
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,810
or multiplied or square rooted or whatever. They

29
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,520
just, you know, they go into your bank account,

30
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,800
and things add. So this feels like, kind

31
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,610
of like that. It's like money in my pocket.

32
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,130
>> Sure, if you have a big enough pocket.

33
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,750
Okay, I'm with you on that. Alright, so I'm going to

34
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,330
say that this all makes sense. It, it's really awesome

35
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:27,450
and it sort of doesn't work. And to illustrate why

36
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,800
this doesn't work, I'm going to give you a quiz.

37
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,300
>> Yay.

38
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,870
>> because you like quizzes.

39
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,030
>> So I've been told.
