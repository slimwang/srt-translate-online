If you said these two, excellent work. For monomials, we said that the exponent

2
00:00:04,433 --> 00:00:08,736
needs to be non-negative, so that means the exponent must be positive or zero.

3
00:00:08,736 --> 00:00:13,032
Here are two examples where the exponent in the monomial is negative, so these

4
00:00:13,032 --> 00:00:18,133
aren't monomials. This term is negative, but the variable, or n, appears in the

5
00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:22,200
denominator. Any expression or term with a variable in the denominator isn't a

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,310
monomial. These two examples are the same, the b appears in the denominator, and

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,193
the x appears in the denominator, so these can't be monomials. You might not

8
00:00:30,193 --> 00:00:34,219
have gotten this reason right, which is totally okay, it turns out that a square

9
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:37,940
root can be written as x to the one half, we haven't even covered this topic

10
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,904
yet, so if you got that right, that's amazing. We'll see this fractional

11
00:00:41,904 --> 00:00:46,181
exponent, later but I just wanted to preview it now. We do know that monomials

12
00:00:46,181 --> 00:00:50,405
can be the product of two variables and that they can be positive or negative,

13
00:00:50,405 --> 00:00:54,710
these are the real reasons, why all of these weren't examples of monomials.
