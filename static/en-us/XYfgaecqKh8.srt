00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,380
One of the fundamental features of
a prototype is that it acts vaguely like

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:07,330
the final app when it's interacted
with but is much simpler to make.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,220
This means that when
we build a prototype,

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,900
we need to think about
interaction points.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:16,666
An interaction point is anywhere that
a user might might press, scroll, or

6
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:19,640
type in order to interact with your app.

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,590
By identifying
the interaction points for

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,190
your app, you will identify where you
need to link screens together and

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,870
what work you need to do
to build a prototype.

10
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,540
For a low fidelity prototype,

11
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:33,070
we only need to deal with interaction
points that will move the user between

12
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,540
the screens, not interaction points
that will allow them to input content.

13
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,399
For example, let's take a look at
our calendar and to do list app.

14
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:46,100
This app had a floating action button,
or FAB, which we can expect users to

15
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:51,600
touch and on the screen that opens,
it has a number of other options.

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,670
We can expect users to try to interact
with each of them in the final app but

17
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,610
since they don't add another screen,

18
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:00,300
we don't need to deal with that
functionality here just yet.

19
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,930
On our menu screen,
each item leads to a new screen.

20
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:11,380
Fewer menu items means fewer screens to
build but also a reduced functionality.

21
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,860
Finding a balance there is vital,
we don't want to remove an core

22
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,720
functionality in order to have fewer
interaction points but you can probably

23
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,447
go without a terms and condition
option in your lo-fi prototype.
