Hi. This is the Python glossary.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
There's going to be a lot of new and potentially confusing functions and techniques

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
that we use in CS212.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
When that happens, I'm going to try to record something to help you all out.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This is the place where I'm going to post that.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I might not be able to get to every single function that's covered in the course,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
but if there are any that are particularly confusing to you, you should let me know in the forums.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Remember, if there is anything that I don't cover,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
you should check out the Python or just do a search.
