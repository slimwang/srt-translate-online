00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,808
Today, we are going to talk about revenue

2
00:00:01,808 --> 00:00:03,830
models. Very simply is, how does your

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,870
company make money. So in our last lectures

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,791
we talked about value proposition, customer

5
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:12,361
segments, distribution channels, customer

6
00:00:12,361 --> 00:00:14,709
relationships; get, keeping and growing

7
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:16,874
customers. But today were going to be talking

8
00:00:16,874 --> 00:00:19,927
about revenue streams. How is it that you make

9
00:00:19,927 --> 00:00:21,111
money?

10
00:00:21,111 --> 00:00:24,006
Now revenue models seems incredibly simple,

11
00:00:24,006 --> 00:00:26,258
it answers the question, how does the company

12
00:00:26,258 --> 00:00:29,581
make money from each customer segment.

13
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:32,095
But one of the things that we always tend to

14
00:00:32,095 --> 00:00:34,985
confuse is the difference between a revenue

15
00:00:34,985 --> 00:00:38,783
model and pricing. That is the amount of dollars

16
00:00:38,783 --> 00:00:41,301
that we might actually charge for the product.

17
00:00:41,301 --> 00:00:43,317
And this is a common mistake. What were

18
00:00:43,317 --> 00:00:46,784
really trying to understand first is what value is

19
00:00:46,784 --> 00:00:49,368
the customer paying for. And the first thing we

20
00:00:49,368 --> 00:00:51,712
need to figure out is, what is our revenue model.

21
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:54,718
Whats the revenue stream. Thats our strategy.

22
00:00:54,718 --> 00:00:57,718
But what follows is then pricing. What is our

23
00:00:57,718 --> 00:01:00,539
tactics? So again, what were going to try to

24
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,081
figure out is whats our strategy? Revenue

25
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:07,557
streams. And whats our tactics? Pricing.

26
00:01:07,557 --> 00:01:10,925
And together that means, how does a company

27
00:01:10,925 --> 00:01:13,807
make money from each customer segment.
