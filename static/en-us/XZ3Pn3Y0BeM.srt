Over the past few minutes, we've talked about how the sum of two cubes and the

2
00:00:04,107 --> 00:00:08,388
difference of two cubes can be factored. And we learned earlier about how the

3
00:00:08,388 --> 00:00:12,945
difference of two squares can be factored. Seems logically then like we should

4
00:00:12,945 --> 00:00:17,355
also be able to factor the sum of two squares, something in the form a squared

5
00:00:17,355 --> 00:00:22,008
plus b squared. What is the factored form of that though? Let's talk about this.

6
00:00:22,008 --> 00:00:26,323
Earlier we saw a difference of two squares that was x squared minus 1. So let's

7
00:00:26,323 --> 00:00:30,477
turn this into the sum of two squares instead, to see if that is something we

8
00:00:30,477 --> 00:00:35,080
can factor. So let's consider x squared plus 1 instead of x squared minus 1. So

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,706
I'd like you to think through how we might factor x squared plus 1. And if you

10
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:44,324
can find a way to do it, check yes and write in the factors. And if you can't

11
00:00:44,324 --> 00:00:46,379
find a way to do it, then check no.
