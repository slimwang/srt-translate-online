1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,000
And the key thing to know for

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,060
bag of words is that the word order does not matter.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,720
It's clearly a no, because we are counting words we have no preference to where in

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,160
the phrase a word occurs,

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,050
which kind of make it somewhat limited compared to really understanding a text.

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,100
It's kind of taking all the words and resorting them in random order.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,860
That's why it's called bag of words.

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,265
Because you toss them into a bag.

9
00:00:23,265 --> 00:00:24,861
And gone they are.

10
00:00:24,861 --> 00:00:26,750
Long phrases do give different vectors.

11
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,660
So suppose we take the same email and duplicate it.

12
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,540
All the counts go up by a factor of two, and

13
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,810
it's going to be a different input vector.

14
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:37,870
So to some extent you're biasing yourself to also encode the length of your text

15
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:41,780
not just the frequency of the words, so the answer would be clearly yes.

16
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,500
And I would say, can we handle complex phrases.

17
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,050
Right now we can't, unless we make extra buckets for

18
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,820
those, which makes it a bit more difficult to preprocess.

19
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,430
Chicago Bulls would count one for Chicago and one for Bulls.

20
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,760
And here's a funny little insight,

21
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,480
when Google first came out as a search engine and you typed in Chicago Bulls.

22
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:04,989
You saw lots of, of, of references to cities and lots of references to animals.

23
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:09,480
And so a, a bunch of smart Google engineers to change the dictionary to also

24
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,760
included combined phrases like Chicago Bulls.

25
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,490
So go to Google, try it out.

26
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,730
I promise you you see very few animals and very few cities.
