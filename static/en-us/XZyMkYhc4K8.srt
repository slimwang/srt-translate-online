1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,470
So agile development practices are
generally a good idea, provided that you

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,640
involve all the stakeholders and
not just the development team.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,850
Running the production servers
using the devs' desktop OS,

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,840
probably not such a great idea.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,390
Desktop OS and production
are completely different environments.

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,850
Involving the ops team
earlier in development

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,290
sounds like a pretty good idea.

8
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,750
We can make sure that everybody
knows what the expected technologies

9
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:24,380
are going to be.

10
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,770
Not have any nasty surprises
when we go to deploy.

11
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,550
Implementing performance tests,
that sounds like a great idea.

12
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,670
If the devs are regularly running
performance tests as part of their

13
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:35,814
development process,

14
00:00:35,814 --> 00:00:39,670
then we won't have any bad surprises
about performance later on.

15
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,456
Buying faster server hardware
to make the app faster,

16
00:00:43,456 --> 00:00:46,013
well that might work or it might not.

17
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:49,166
It may just be that the performance
problems are algorithmic, and

18
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,935
adding more server hardware
might not help for very long.

19
00:00:51,935 --> 00:00:55,031
Making small incremental
launches instead of big ones,

20
00:00:55,031 --> 00:00:57,230
this seems like a pretty
good idea to me.

21
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,650
Although, in some business environments
that might not be a possibility.

22
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,610
Still, it's something
very good to consider.

23
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,730
And requiring devs to only use
technology as vetted at the start of

24
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:06,420
the project.

25
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,204
This sounds like a recipe for
being very inflexible, and

26
00:01:09,204 --> 00:01:12,960
probably would get in the way of
the developers making a good product.

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,200
So let's not do that last one.
