00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,770
And the answer is it would be line 15. The reason for that is in

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,600
this column we actually have a value that includes a comma as part of the

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,010
data. What that would mean is that when we're processing this file, we would end

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,690
up having one extra field for this

5
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,350
particular row because of this comma right here.
