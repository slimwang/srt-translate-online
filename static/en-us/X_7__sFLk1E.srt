1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
You have learned quite a lot in the last six units.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,060
You have learned about how to recognize that a problem is difficult to solve.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,340
You have learned about the theory of NP completeness surrounding those problems,

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,200
and you have also learned some powerful techniques to deal with NP complete problems

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,460
so that they might even be solvable in practice despite their general hardness.

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,960
Now, there's one question we haven't yet looked at and that is kind of the ultimate question.

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,410
Are there any problems that no computer, no matter how powerful,

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:36,020
no matter with how much time is able to solve, and the answer surprisingly turns out to be yes.

9
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,960
In this unit, I will show you that there are some deceptively simple problems

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,850
for which we can prove that no computer,

11
00:00:43,850 --> 99:59:59,999
no matter how powerful will ever be able to solve them.
