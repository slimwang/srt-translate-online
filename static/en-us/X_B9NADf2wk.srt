1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,440
This course has four parts.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:06,260
Just now, you're going to lay
the foundations by training your first

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,110
simple model entirely end-to-end.

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,930
For that, we'll need to talk
about logistic classification,

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:18,130
stochastic optimization and
general data practices to train models.

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,950
In the next session,
we're going to go deeper.

7
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,860
You'll train your first deep network and
you'll also learn to

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,660
apply regularization techniques
to train even bigger models.

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,390
The third session will be a deep dive
into images and convolutional models.

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,350
The fourth session, all about text and
sequences in general.

11
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,650
We'll train embeddings and
recurrent models.

12
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,180
This is going to be
a very hands-on course.

13
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:48,260
The assignments are IPython notebooks
that you can read and modify easily.

14
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,820
Play with them and try things out.

15
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,800
We will use them alongside the lectures

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,260
to make everything you will
hear about very concrete.

17
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,280
All the code will be
written in TensorFlow,

18
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,390
a very simple Python-based
deep learning toolkit.

19
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,540
By the time you are done
with these lectures,

20
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,050
you'll be able to apply all
this knowledge to new problems

21
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,100
entirely by yourself with
a handful of lines of code.
