00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,050
So maybe it updating was
the wrong thing here.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:07,980
We got rid of the spam, but
now we have way too much cheese.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,610
Let's find out how to get rid
of the cheesy posts entirely.

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,790
Remember how bobby tables
deleted all of our posts once?

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,260
It was with the delete statement,
but delete can be used for

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,920
good as well as for evil.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,590
We just need to be a little
selective with it.

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,990
Just like select and update, the delete
statement can take a where restriction.

9
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,430
And just as with update, you can task
that where restriction by using it in

10
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,370
the select,
before you go deleting anything.

11
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,330
And now you can probably clean all of
the cheese out of your database with

12
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:36,960
a single command.

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,580
When you're done, reload the forum and
see that all the cheese posts have gone.
