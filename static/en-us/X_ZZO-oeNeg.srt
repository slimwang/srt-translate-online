1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,689
The National Institute of Standards and
Technology, which adapted a definition

2
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:10,200
for cloud computing in 2011 also
defined different types of clouds.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,930
The first dimension how
clouds are classified

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,400
is based on the deployment models.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,260
Clouds can be public like
Amazon's EC2 cloud is a public cloud.

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,890
And this is a cloud where
the infrastructure belongs to the cloud

7
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,050
provider.

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,370
However, third party customers or
tenants,

9
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:32,549
anyone with a credit card really,
can come in and run their services,

10
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,350
their infrastructure,
on top of Amazon's own hardware.

11
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,780
Clouds can be private.

12
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,770
I said earlier that Amazon
used the same type of

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,140
technology that they opened
up as Amazon Web Services.

14
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:49,060
They used it originally
internally to enable elastic and

15
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:53,260
dynamic provisioning of the physical
infrastructure across the different

16
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:57,630
types of applications and services
that Amazon internally executes.

17
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,630
In the case of a private cloud,

18
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,540
it is the infrastructure
as well as the tenants,

19
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,590
the services, the applications, that
are run on top of that infrastructure.

20
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,260
Everything is owned by
the same entity and

21
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:14,460
it's just cloud computing technology is
used to enable some of the provisioning

22
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,470
and the elasticity that cloud
computing offers to applications.

23
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,380
Then there is a hybrid cloud as
a possible deployment model.

24
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:28,330
This is a scenario where a private
cloud is interfaced with some public

25
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:32,730
cloud where these public resources
are used either for failover for

26
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,930
some additional redundancy,
for dealing with spikes.

27
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,580
I know of certain companies who
choose these public resources

28
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,830
to run simulated workloads
that would then generate

29
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:49,110
supposed request patterns on top of
their, privately run core services.

30
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,020
Finally the definition also

31
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,330
references that there is a community
cloud as a type of cloud.

32
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:01,890
This is really just a public cloud
where the third party customers or

33
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,400
the third party users of the services or
the information that's provided by this

34
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,530
community cloud, isn't really just
used by arbitrary customers but

35
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,060
by a certain type of users.
