00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,989
This orthographic projection isn't normally how we directly perceive the world,

2
00:00:02,989 --> 00:00:06,943
but it's a form we commonly use nonetheless. For example, assembly instructions

3
00:00:06,943 --> 00:00:10,772
usually show an orthographic view. Architectural plans showing a front, side or

4
00:00:10,772 --> 00:00:14,652
top view of a building use this sort of projection. You can take measurements

5
00:00:14,652 --> 00:00:17,568
off of these types of views. Having the distortion caused by perspective

6
00:00:17,568 --> 00:00:21,580
projection would most likely hinder our understanding of what we're seeing. An

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,060
orthographic camera can be used to examine objects from angles other than

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,680
directly along an axis, such as these views. A demo using an orthographic

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,540
camera follows. I find that I'm so used to seeing with a perspective view that

10
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:35,233
I perceive an optical illusion here. If I zoom out using the slider and look at

11
00:00:35,233 --> 00:00:37,775
the whole scene, my visual system tells me that the front edge of the grid is

12
00:00:37,775 --> 00:00:42,178
definitely shorter than the back edge. Try it yourself, and let me know in the

13
00:00:42,178 --> 00:00:43,409
forums what you think.
