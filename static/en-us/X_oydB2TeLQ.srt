1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,719
Just because our server can
listen on every single port, for

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:06,700
any type of request,
that doesn't mean we should.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,440
The rule of least privilege, which we've
discussed throughout this entire lesson,

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,100
tells us we should only listen
on the ports required for

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,630
our application to function correctly.

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,820
We can configure which ports we
want our server to listen to

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,160
using an application called a firewall.

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,280
Let's imagine this wall is
our firewall application.

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,700
And each of these slots is a port.

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,310
We currently have all the slots filled,
which means I can't

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,550
pass data from one side, the Internet,
to the other, my server.

12
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,930
You could say I'm denying
all incoming requests, but

13
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,000
if I open one of these boxes,
we'll choose port 80 here.

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,490
I can now pass information through.

15
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:47,070
The server on the other side can
now fully function as a web server

16
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,280
with the added benefit of
completely ignoring these requests

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,460
that we know we're not interested in.

18
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,650
Let's go back to our terminal and start
configuring our server's firewall now.
