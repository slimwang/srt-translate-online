1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,160
It is considered a little bit more realistic problem. Imagine that you were to

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,200
hire a robot, and a task of the robot was to paint the ceiling in your room, and

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,020
also paint the ladder. So, two goals here,

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,840
paint the ladder paint the ceiling and note that the two goals are in conflict.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,952
Because if the robot paints the ladder first, the ladder will become wet.

6
00:00:20,952 --> 00:00:25,130
And this robot cannot climb on it, in order to paint the ceiling. So, the robot

7
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:29,400
must really first paint the ceiling, then climb down, then paint the ladder and

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,740
everything is okay. You would expect a human to get this almost immediately,

9
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,550
you probably got it almost immediately. You have to paint the ceiling first,

10
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,650
before you paint the ladder. Of course, every time I've hired construction

11
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:45,300
workers, they always paint the ladder first. Then they go and take a break, and

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,200
so that I had to pay them anyway. We'll accept that kind of behavior from human

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,140
construction workers, we would not accept that from robot construction workers.

14
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:57,310
The robots must be intelligent, they must know how to prioritize the goals.

15
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,980
Well, in order to reason about these goals, the robot first must be able to

16
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,690
represent them. So, how can we present the goal of painted ceiling? Now that we

17
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,360
have learned about propositional logic, here is a preposition that can

18
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,730
represent painted ceiling. This is the object, this is the predicate on that.
