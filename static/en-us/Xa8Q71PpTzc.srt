1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,100
So the correct answer is the third one. So you might have been

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,820
tempted to chose the first one here, because it's the shortest. Because you're

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,450
trying to respect the fact that Debbie is on the go, and she's

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,340
busy, and doesn't have a lot of time to engage with your application. But

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,350
actually she'll have to spend more time if you use a notification like

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,560
this. She actually has to press the notification, and go into the app to

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,460
see what book is overdue and for how long. It actually doesn't really

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,060
tell her anything. So in the end this is actually a really bad choice.

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,483
The second one might look tempting because it does give her some

10
00:00:28,483 --> 00:00:31,340
more information. But she still has to either launch a navigation app,

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,038
if she doesn't know where the library is. She might be really

12
00:00:34,038 --> 00:00:36,813
far away. Or if she wants to extend the books, let's say that

13
00:00:36,813 --> 00:00:39,336
your application allows her to do that, she still has to go

14
00:00:39,336 --> 00:00:43,570
into the app. And that's not really respecting her limited time and

15
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,600
her split attention in with the real world. So the best one,

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,430
is the third option. Because in

17
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,200
one glanceable notification, she can completely engage

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,530
with your application, and not actually have to enter it. And she has these nice

19
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,020
contextual actions where she can extend the book

20
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,760
or navigate there with just one button press.

21
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,370
>> That was awesome. I did notice one thing,

22
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,200
Debbie is holding her phone with a single hand.

23
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,400
>> yes, that brings us into our next mobile constraint, which is handedness.
