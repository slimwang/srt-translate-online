1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,400
Let's step through this just a little bit.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,490
So when we talk about building a panorama, what do we have to do?

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,030
Well, we're going to have to sort of align our pictures in order to be able to

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:10,910
paste them together.

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,710
That's what we just, just saw.

6
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,050
So to do that, here's the basic process.

7
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,910
The first thing we do is we're going to detect some features, okay?

8
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,770
And here features just means some interesting points.

9
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,240
In fact, we're going to define something called an interest point

10
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,810
operator that'll find some points that we define to be interesting.

11
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,530
Don't you wish you had an interesting person operator.

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,960
You could just scan it around a room, and

13
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,960
it would just tell you who's interesting?

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,500
It wouldn't go off a lot in my house.

15
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,140
Anyway, no, sorry, sorry hon.

16
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,400
So, here we've detected a bunch of points in in both images, and

17
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,920
these are going to be our feature points.

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,960
The next thing we have to do,

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,960
and, you know, just looking at this, it looks a little bit like a mess.

20
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,760
We need to find the corresponding pairs.

21
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,750
That tells us how we need to transform one image to the next, and

22
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,100
then we can use those pair to align the images.

23
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,500
And, if we do them in this particular example.

24
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,850
You get something that looks like this.

25
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,530
By the way the seam has been left in here just to

26
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,140
make it clear how that image is being moved.

27
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,250
If you were actually splicing these images together you would do

28
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:14,760
something you know sexy in order to make sure that those seams became invisible.

29
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,870
Now to do this detection and matching and

30
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,060
alignment, there are a couple of things that we have to worry about.

31
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,670
The first problem is well,

32
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:28,430
I can't possibly match points if I don't find them in both images.

33
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,200
And remember I'm going to detect interest points here, and

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,660
interesting points there, and look for a match.

35
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,590
So it better be the case that a point that's been found here to

36
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,830
be interesting is also found over there.

37
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:42,490
In this particular case there would be no chance to match.

38
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,240
Because I found some set of four points on the left, and

39
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,250
a different set of four points on the right.

40
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,390
So what we need is what is referred to as a repeatable detector.

41
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,770
If I run on this image, most of the points that I find over here

42
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:58,340
as being interesting, I will also find over here, over there and vice versa.

43
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,400
So that's the first problem, reliable finding them at all.

44
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,170
The second problem is let's assume that these points on

45
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,430
the left are somewhere in the right.

46
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,322
So I found here it's four points on the left, and

47
00:02:10,322 --> 00:02:12,670
then there's four points on the right.

48
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,270
Which point is which?

49
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,060
Okay, I have to do the match.

50
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,510
The way we do that is what's referred to as using a descriptor.

51
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,830
A descriptor is just what it sounds like,

52
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:27,300
it's a description of this of a point, or of a feature to be precise.

53
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:32,350
What I want are distinctive descriptors, that is, you know,

54
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,490
if I write down the description of each of these.

55
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,660
So you can think of the description as being the name, right?

56
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:42,380
So I want this one to be Bob, Ted, Alice and George.

57
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,580
That's mixing some metaphors from the sixties, by the way.

58
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,540
because if they all said George, George, George, and this one says George, then

59
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,450
I've got a French movie, and I don't know whether, what's going anywhere, okay.

60
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:59,780
But if this one says Edward, it better be that one of these things says Edward.

61
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,900
Maybe if it just says Ed I'll be okay, but

62
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:08,170
my descriptor can't change that much of the same point in, in the two images.

63
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,990
So that's what we talk about it being distinctive.

64
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,860
You know, Bob, Carol, Ted and Alice.

65
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,160
That's who it was from the movie, right?

66
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,490
They have different names, but they also have to be reliable.

67
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:21,140
So Ed might become Edward, but Ed doesn't become Francesca.

68
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,030
All right?

69
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,566
So Feature points are used for all sorts of operations in computer vision.

70
00:03:27,566 --> 00:03:31,116
Image alignment we talked a lot about, 3D reconstruction, Motion, Motion

71
00:03:31,116 --> 00:03:35,400
tracking, I'm trying to figure out how either the object's moving or the camera.

72
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,310
Object recognition in fact, in a couple lectures from now we're going to

73
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:43,460
take some features on, from a bunch of different objects.

74
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,180
Take the features in our image, and

75
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,420
figure out up, it's this object that's in that image.

76
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,320
All right.

77
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,600
Database indexing, Robot, features are used for all sorts of things.

78
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,070
And that's one of the reasons why we have to talk about them in the class.
