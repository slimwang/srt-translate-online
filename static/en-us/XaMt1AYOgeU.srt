00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
All right, so let's say we want to try Alice's vertex cover a little bit smarter.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,320
So let's look at Alice's vertex cover.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,150
The main thing that happens, the key idea is that we're just going to try

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:18,250
every single possible assignment of a cover to the underlying graph.

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:26,390
So, let's say that graph, we might try this, this, and this

6
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:38,570
or we might try this, this, and this, or just this, or maybe all of the vertices.

7
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:43,370
The point is that we're not specifying an order to check the vertices in.

8
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,500
We're just saying check every single one.

9
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:53,080
What if we did though, what if we decided to check the vertices in order of size?

10
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,110
That is we're checking the covers with increase in size.

11
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:01,500
So first, we check a cover with zero vertices in it,

12
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,830
that is no cover at all then we check every cover with one vertex in it.

13
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:15,510
So let's say this one, then we check this one, then this one, and so on.

14
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:21,300
And after we're done with that, then we do every vertex cover with two vertices in it.

15
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:29,510
So this and this and this and so on, and we keep going checking all of the covers in increasing order.

16
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:33,030
That way, once we found a possible cover,

17
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,690
we know that that is the minimum possible cover and we can simply stop it.

18
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:45,470
Now, my question then is does this change how the underlying algorithm performs?

19
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,050
So let's go down the questions.

20
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:51,800
First, does the new algorithm on average checks fewer assignments than the original?

21
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,070
Second, does the original algorithm sometimes look through fewer assignments?

22
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,330
And by that, I mean, does it look through fewer assignments

23
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,750
than the original algorithm at least once?

24
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:10,050
Next, is the worst case behavior of the new algorithm in O-notation better than the original?

25
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,930
And similarly for the best case and the average case of the new algorithm

26
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,180
in O-notation, are they better than the original?

27
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,600
Please check all either true or false.
