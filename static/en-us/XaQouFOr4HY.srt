00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,400
After you have a good idea of what the system looks like, from the outside, and

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,990
how it is expected to behave, you can begin the architectural design process.

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,380
This involves decomposing the system in to it's components, and allocating

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,300
responsibilities to them. Now we did this before, when we did this exercise, but

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,850
that was an analysis model. Here, when we're talking about act, act,

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:24,200
architectural design we're actually going into the solution phase of things.

7
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,750
Now, one of the features of object oriented development is that it's often

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:34,030
the case that the particular elements that we come out of the analysis with,

9
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:38,250
our pieces there, translate into pieces into the architecture and

10
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,050
ultimately into the implementation. In addition to decomposing the system into

11
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:46,190
it's components, we have to allocate responsibilities to the components, for

12
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:51,152
handling those direct and indirect effects of the events, okay? And

13
00:00:51,152 --> 00:00:55,102
we're going to express that using OCL invariants and pre and

14
00:00:55,102 --> 00:01:01,570
post conditions. To indicate how those responsibilities are being satisfied
