00:00:10,239 --> 00:00:14,592
Ugh, son of a SQL,
this milk is older than I am.

00:00:19,154 --> 00:00:23,438
>> [SOUND] Hello?

5
00:00:23,438 --> 00:00:24,170
>> Hey, Kagure.

6
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:28,778
So I'm making a cake for the V3
launch party, and we're out of milk.

7
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:30,892
>> Milk?

8
00:00:30,892 --> 00:00:32,180
Yeah, you can use mine.

9
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,080
>> Yeah, it's a bit old.

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,000
Any chance you're at the store?

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,210
>> No.

12
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,229
No, I'm not.
I have a debt to settle.

14
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:46,022

16
00:00:52,024 --> 00:00:53,985
Man, where am I going to get some milk?

17
00:00:53,985 --> 00:00:56,869
[SOUND].

18
00:00:56,869 --> 00:01:00,038
Hey J.P.
>> Hey Lila, how are preparations for

19
00:01:00,038 --> 00:01:01,090
the V3 launch party going?

20
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,580
Do you need anything from
the store while I'm here?

21
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,590
>> Actually really great you called,
I could use milk.

22
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,130
>> Sure thing.

23
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,210
>> That makes me think.

24
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,420
Now that we're actually
storing user data,

25
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,090
we could do a lot of interesting
things with that information.

26
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,090
Like, I don't know,
show who's bought what.

27
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,100
>> Or
you could also show them who's shopping.

28
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,130
>> That all makes sense,
a lot of sense actually.

29
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,150
All right,
version 0.3 launch party canceled.

30
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:25,800
Back to coding.
