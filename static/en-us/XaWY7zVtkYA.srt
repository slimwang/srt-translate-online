1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,680
So that's Android design in a nutshell.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,190
We hope you've learned a lot.

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:05,890
We started with lesson one.

4
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,940
A crash course in Android
design fundamentals.

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,060
>> In lesson two,
we learned about tangible surfaces.

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,630
How they establish a clear
visual hierarchy and

7
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,230
make your UIs immediately
comprehensible.

8
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,100
In lesson three, we learned how to
apply the principles of space, color,

9
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,660
typography and imagery to let
your brand shine through and

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,870
make your app's content look beautiful.

11
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:31,050
>> In lesson four, we discussed how
deliberate meaningful motion helps to

12
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,160
tell your app's story and
make it feel alive.

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,310
>> And in this lesson, we learned how
to adapt our designs to the different

14
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,620
screens your users have in their lives.

15
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,020
Now go and
design the next great app for Android.

16
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,980
Using the techniques in this course,

17
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,510
you're sure to build something
delightful and awesome.

18
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,140
We can't wait to see
what you come up with.
