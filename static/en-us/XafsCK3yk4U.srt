00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'm here with Brielin Brown, who works on quantum computing.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So Brielin, what does quantum physics have to do with computing?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Quantum physics actually has a lot to do with computing.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
If you think about the algorithms that you've been learning about in your course

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
for searching the Web and doing things like this, everything that you program

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
is built on a fundamental model of computing that manipulates a registry of 0s and 1s.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Everything is transformed into machine instructions to manipulate these bits.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
But in quantum computing, you actually get to replace these bits

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
with something called qubits, which give you a lot more power.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What can you do with a qubit that you can't do with a regular bit?

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
With regular bits they're either 0 or 1 and there's no middle ground,

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
but with a quantum bit you can actually exist in a superposition of 0 and 1.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So right now I have this coffee cup

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
which the viewer doesn't know whether or not it has any coffee in it.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So right now it exists in a superposition of being filled and unfilled until I measure,

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
a.k.a. take a sip.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And so you can see that there is coffee in this cup.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The cool thing about quantum information is that it takes a lot more classical information

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
to describe the same system.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
But at the end of a quantum algorithm, to get the access for this information

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
you have to take a measurement which actually destroys the system.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So if you're really clever with how you devise your algorithm,

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
you can sort of access this exponential amount of information

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
in a way that allows you to solve a problem faster

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
by making a correct measurement at the end.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And so this allows you to do things like factor integers faster

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
or simulate quantum systems, which gives you a lot of progress in physics

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
that we haven't been able to see recently.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Wow. All this talk about physics is making me thirsty.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I think it's time to go get a coffee. >>[laughs] Absolutely.
