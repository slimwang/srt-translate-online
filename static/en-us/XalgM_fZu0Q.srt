1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,900
Now in fact, every time we have a polynomial function that has rational zeros,

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:09,288
we can be sure that whatever those zeros are, they'll be in this form. They'll

3
00:00:09,288 --> 00:00:13,000
be the ratio of a factor of a constant term at the end of the expression,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,476
divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. The coefficient of the highest

5
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:21,747
degree term. This looks like a super useful fact, and it's so useful that it

6
00:00:21,747 --> 00:00:26,868
has a special name. It's called the rational zero theorem. Now, we're going to

7
00:00:26,868 --> 00:00:30,790
have to add one little addendum to this rule in a second. But, first, let's

8
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,522
just look at it as it is. This is an incredibly powerful tool. It's going to

9
00:00:34,522 --> 00:00:37,850
help us narrow down the zeros that we think a polynomial function could have,

10
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:42,836
from an infinite number of possible numbers. All the rational numbers, to only

11
00:00:42,836 --> 00:00:47,259
numbers that fit this form. It's going to make our lives a ton easier.
