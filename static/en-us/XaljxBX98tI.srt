00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,468
With spawning and updating entities taken care of, the last piece of the puzzle

2
00:00:03,468 --> 00:00:07,675
is figuring out how to remove entities that might be dead. For instance, if a

3
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:11,996
rocket will hit a wall it should be removed from processing. To accomplish

4
00:00:11,996 --> 00:00:15,335
this, we add a flag to the entity class that defines whether or not it has been

5
00:00:15,335 --> 00:00:19,717
killed. Dead objects will not update or render while this flag is set, well of

6
00:00:19,717 --> 00:00:24,195
course unless their zombies. As an exercise, let's update the game engine

7
00:00:24,195 --> 00:00:27,660
update function to check for this flag, and not call the update of any entity

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,529
that's been marked as killed.
