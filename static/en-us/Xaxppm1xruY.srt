1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,180
As we saw in the last video
in order to bake our scene,

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,938
we needed to open up
the lighting window.

3
00:00:05,938 --> 00:00:09,480
This window allows us to control a lot
of settings that will make our scene

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,050
optimized and really come to life.

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:18,010
To start with, it's divided into three
tabs, object, scene, and light maps.

6
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,140
Let's start with object.

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,510
In a similar fashion to the inspector,

8
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:28,040
this tab allows us to look at specific
properties of a selected game object.

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,380
For convenience, at the top of this tab,

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:35,140
we can filter out our scene by lights,
renderers and terrains.

11
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,760
Let's filter by lights.

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,070
If we now look at the inspector,

13
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,050
we'll see that all of the lights
have been filtered out.

14
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,260
Let's click on our directional light.

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,020
As you can see that brings
up our lighting component.

16
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,060
So, nothing really new,
just another way to look at our light.

17
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,720
Let's now filter by renderers.

18
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,420
In the inspector we can now see a list
of all of our geometry in our scene.

19
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,170
If we click on Any, the mesh
render component gets listed, but

20
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,640
this time there's a lot more
specific lighting properties listed.

21
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,000
As you can see, we can make sure
that our model is set to static

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,740
as well as tune parameters that
will effect how our model bakes.

23
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,530
For more information
on these properties,

24
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,940
check the additional reading.

25
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,850
The last filter is terrains, but

26
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:19,340
we actually don't have any
terrains in our scene.

27
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,300
If you want to learn more about them,
again, check the additional reading.

28
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,650
Moving on to the next tab,
we have the scene tab.

29
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:30,350
This tab lets us control the settings
of the light in our scene.

30
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,320
It's broken into six tabs.

31
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,265
Environment lighting,
pre-computed real-time GI,

32
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:43,790
baked GI, general GI,
fog and other settings.

33
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:47,360
We'll take a closer look at this
tab over the next few videos.

34
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,940
Last, we have the Lightmaps tab.

35
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,170
Once we bake a scene
like we did last video,

36
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,920
we can come to this tab to check out
how our lightmaps actually look.

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,410
Here, you can see the files and
textures that were actually created.

38
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:03,020
It's pretty hard to glean information
from the image, but this tab is useful

39
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,020
for seeing how much data is being
stored and if you need to tune

40
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:10,639
your parameters to optimize the number
of textures or how big textures are.

41
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,380
And that covers all three tabs.

42
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,670
Now let's start diving
deeper into the scene tab.
