1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here is the answer--a 6, 0, and a 6.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The way the 6 is calculated is by a product.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We are in this position the 2 is the true answer with 1/3 chance.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
When 2 is the correct answer, he'll never pick 2,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
because he'll just show me that my guess is correct, so he'll pick 1 or 3.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Each of those he picks with half chance.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
As a result, for the joint of these two things to occur,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
you multiple 1/3 by 1/2 and get 1/6, and the same over here.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This is the truth table for any combination of the true location and what Monty shows me,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
provided that I pick door number 2.
