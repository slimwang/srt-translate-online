1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,320
And the correct answer is any
element with a class of style one.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,600
If an element is set to display
none that means that the element is

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,410
not going to be rendered whatsoever.

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,810
For the other three options,
though they may not take up any space

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,480
on the page that you're seeing
they're still a part of the page.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,360
Which means that the browser will
still put style three, style four, and

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,420
style two before on the render tree.
