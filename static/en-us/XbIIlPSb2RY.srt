00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,340
Now, let's talk about scales for categorical data. A

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:07,910
categorical scale provides visual separation for different groups. And it

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,750
often works in tandem with a numerical scale, as

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,495
we'll see here when we plot home runs on the

5
00:00:12,495 --> 00:00:16,050
y-axis. A bar plot, for example, can use a

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,982
categorical scale on the x-axis, and a numerical scale on

7
00:00:19,982 --> 00:00:22,690
the y-axis. So let's say that we were measuring home

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,070
runs by position. The positions we've used here are unordered,

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,940
but you can imagine that if we have ordinal

10
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,410
data, we'd want these categories represented in the order that

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,380
the ordinal data suggests. That will make it easier to

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,360
compare and contrast your bars, or whatever encoding that you've

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,010
chosen to represent your data. Finally, let's talk about

14
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,060
time series data. The thing is, we can measure time

15
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,910
with various different granularities. So we could use months or

16
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,230
days or years on this x-axis, which will let us

17
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,670
visualize our data in a discreet way. Depending

18
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,100
on what you're trying to communicate with your data

19
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,200
You might use a different time scale here.

20
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,390
So, if you're looking at fluctuations that happen on

21
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,780
a very short time scale, days are more

22
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,910
appropriate, but if we're looking at long term trends,

23
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,190
we may want to look at data on a month to month or year to year basis.
