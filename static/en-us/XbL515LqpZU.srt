1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,580
The first ideas that eventually became
the Efficient Markets Hypothesis

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,460
were postulated by
Jules Regnault in 1863.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,510
Eugene Fama carried those
ideas further in the 1960's,

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,330
and it became his PhD thesis.

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,350
Fama recently received a Nobel Prize,
so we know those ideas were good.

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,675
So what's the efficient
market hypothesis about?

7
00:00:22,675 --> 00:00:25,750
We'll start by looking at some of
the assumptions that it makes.

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,790
Probably the most important assumption
is it that there are a large

9
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:36,030
numbers of investors interacting
in the market for profit.

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,010
So they have an incentive
to find opportunities

11
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,140
where the price of a stock is out of
line with what its true value is.

12
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,320
Because there are so many of these
investors operating simultaneously, any

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,280
time a little bit of information comes
out there, the price is going to move.

14
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:58,430
The next assumption is that new
information arrives randomly.

15
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:02,700
So it arrives at random times,
it arrives at random rates for

16
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,310
different stocks, but
it's constantly arriving and

17
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,805
investors are paying attention
to that information and

18
00:01:10,805 --> 00:01:14,290
therefore the prices
are adjusting quickly.

19
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:18,410
Finally, the efficient
market hypothesis assumes

20
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:22,330
that the current price reflects
all available information.

21
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:26,000
In other words, all this information
that's trickling in is acted upon by

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,010
the investors, the price adjusts
quickly to that information, and

23
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,590
the current price reflects all of
the information about that stock.
