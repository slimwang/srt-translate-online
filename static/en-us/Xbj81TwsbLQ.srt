1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,800
The instance variable, form the long term memory of an object. The kind of

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,700
thing that an object wants to remember for a very long time. The local

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:14,150
variables, on the other hand, are the equivalent of the short term memory. You

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,030
may remember that you had pizza today but you won't remember it for very long.

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,060
Whereas you'll always remember your cat. Technically speaking the local

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,980
variables go away when you reach the end of the method. The instance variables

7
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:32,430
never go away. They stay alive as long as the object is alive. So when do you

8
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:38,050
want to make a variable an instance variable? You want to do that for those

9
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:43,060
values that an object needs to remember throughout multiple methods. You want

10
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:47,870
to make something a local variable when you can forget about it after exiting

11
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:53,270
the method. In this case here we compute the gas consumed for driving this

12
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,870
particular distance, update the gasInTank. And then we no longer care that this

13
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,090
was the particular amount of gas consumed. We can safely forget it when we exit

14
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:06,100
the method. That's why we put this variable inside the method and made it into

15
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,170
a local variable.
