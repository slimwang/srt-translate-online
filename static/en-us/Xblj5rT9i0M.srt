1
00:00:00,385 --> 00:00:04,030
At this point, since their were only
three remaining problematic enrollments,

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,100
I printed out all of them.

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,880
However, this time when
I looked at the records,

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,410
I wasn't really sure
what the problem was.

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,030
I ended up asking a Udacity
data scientist if he knew what

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,380
was going wrong.

7
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,970
He pointed out that these students
were all Udacity test accounts.

8
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,620
Which he could tell because they
had is Udaucity equal to true.

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,430
These test accounts aren't guaranteed
to be present in the daily

10
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,860
engagement table.

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,800
This is really good to know.

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,030
I should also probably be excluding any
test accounts from my analysis anyway.

13
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,220
At this point, there weren't any
more surprising data points.

14
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,130
I did go ahead and move all of
the Udacity test accounts from the data

15
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:43,470
right away since I didn't plan to
include them in any future analysis.

16
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,640
First, I created a set of all the
Udacity test accounts by looping over

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,070
the enrollment data, and I found that
there were six of them in this data set.

18
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,149
Then I wrote a function to remove any
data associated with those accounts.

19
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,580
Finally, I called my function
on all three of my tables and

20
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,310
checked how many records
were left in each.

21
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:05,160
Most of the data is still included,
which is what I expected.

22
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,730
I did create new variables for

23
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,500
the updated data, just in case I ever
want to look at the original data again.
