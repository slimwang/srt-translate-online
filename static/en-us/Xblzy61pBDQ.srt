1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Thrun] So we just learned a number of things.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
One is about complementary probability.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
If an event has a certain probability, p,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
the complementary event has the probability 1-p.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We also learned about independence.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If 2 random variables, X and Y, are independent,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
which you're going to write like this,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
that means the probability of the joint that any 2 variables can assume

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
is the product of the marginals.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So rather than asking the question, "What is the probability

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
"for any combination that these 2 coins or maybe 5 coins could have taken?"

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
we can now look at the probability of each coin individually,

13
00:00:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
look at its probability and just multiply them up.
