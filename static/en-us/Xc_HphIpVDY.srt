00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,670
Now that we have seen how LRU works,
let's do a quiz about it.

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:09,299
Let's say that this is a single set in a
cache that is eight way set associative,

3
00:00:09,299 --> 00:00:11,384
so there are eight lines in the set.

4
00:00:11,384 --> 00:00:16,239
Let's say that the blocks we have are A,
B, C, D, E, F, G, and H.

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,590
And let's say that this LRU
counters that correspond to these

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,520
are like this where 0 is
the least recently used.

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,980
What is the new content of the cache,
after we perform axises to A,

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:35,815
then B, then A again, then D, then K?

9
00:00:35,815 --> 00:00:40,585
You only need to say which blocks
are in each line in the cache,

10
00:00:40,585 --> 00:00:42,865
not what their LRU counters are.

11
00:00:42,865 --> 00:00:45,455
But you do need to track
the LRU counters in order to

12
00:00:45,455 --> 00:00:46,805
arrive at the correct answer.
