1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,510
Now there's just one last thing we need
to take care of in our data model,

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,170
deletion rules.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:07,410
What are deletion rules?

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,710
Well, let me ask you this,

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:14,910
what happens to all the notes in a
notebook when this notebook is deleted?

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:20,090
And what happens to the notebook
when a note inside it is deleted?

7
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,430
These questions can be resolved
setting deletion rules.

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,120
Let's start with the Notes property.

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,790
The deletion rules are over here,
and we have several options.

10
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:34,382
No Action, which is usually not
something that you want to use,

11
00:00:34,382 --> 00:00:36,688
Nullify, Cascade, and Deny.

12
00:00:36,688 --> 00:00:40,065
Deny is also something that
you usually don't use.

13
00:00:40,065 --> 00:00:44,350
So, our common options are Nullify and
Cascade.

14
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,210
When we delete a notebook,
what should we do to the notes?

15
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,440
They should be deleted also.

16
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,260
That's what cascade means.

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,370
When notebook is deleted,
all the linked notes will go away.

18
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,720
So this should be Cascade.

19
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,495
And we need to do the same thing for
the inverse relationship.

20
00:01:03,495 --> 00:01:08,335
What happens to the notebook
when one note is deleted?

21
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:10,383
Should we delete the notebook?

22
00:01:10,383 --> 00:01:11,855
Obviously not.

23
00:01:11,855 --> 00:01:16,833
What we should do is remove
the reference that that notebook had to

24
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:17,748
this note.

25
00:01:17,748 --> 00:01:20,188
That is what Nullify does.

26
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:23,100
One last warning before we move on.

27
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,250
Getting your deletion rules wrong is one
of the most common beginner mistakes.

28
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,970
If you set Cascade on both
relationships your app will crash.

29
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,570
We'll talk about that later.

30
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:38,080
So pause this video now, and
set up your deletion rules now as well.

31
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,940
And that's it,
we're done setting up the model.

32
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,590
And from now on it's going to
be pretty smooth sailing.
