1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,820
To get t by itself we first need to add 2 to both sides. Then we just need to

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:11,086
divide both sides by 3. So now we have t equals 1 third times log base 2 of 3

3
00:00:11,086 --> 00:00:15,370
plus 2. Well what do we do with this? We know that we want to find out what

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:20,130
number this is equal to. But our calculator doesn't have a button for log base

5
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,450
two. That means that we need to convert this log base two of three into

6
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:31,250
something that's either a natural log or a log base 10. I'm feeling in a

7
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,690
natural log mood. So let's do that. Know that log base two of three will be

8
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:40,730
equal to the natural log of three. Over the natural log of 2. So, let's

9
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:46,500
substitute this into this spot. OK, so now we have t equals 1 third times the

10
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,370
natural log of 3 over the natural log of 2, plus 2. This is calculator

11
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,040
appropriate, so let's pull out the calculator. I am just going to enter all of

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,540
this in. I have 1 third times the natural log of 3 divided by the natural log

13
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:05,239
of 2. Plus 2. And here's what that equals. T is about equal to 1.195. Awesome,

14
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:11,770
we went through a ton of steps to get to our answer, but we did arrive there

15
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:15,080
eventually. And along the way you got to practice a ton of different techniques

16
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,269
that you've learned throughout the entire course. Awesome job.
