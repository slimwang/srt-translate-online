1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,750
So you might have noticed that
computers that are on the same network,

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,800
like an individual home, or business, or

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,880
school, usually have IP addresses
that are similar to each other.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,286
To be more specific about it,

5
00:00:12,286 --> 00:00:18,375
all of the addresses on a specific
network block share a particular prefix.

6
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:22,965
They all start the same and only differ
after some particular bit position.

7
00:00:22,965 --> 00:00:25,935
And computers that are on the same
network block can communicate with each

8
00:00:25,935 --> 00:00:28,280
other without going through a router.

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,950
But not all networks are the same size.

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,020
So when we talk about a particular
network, we have to talk not only

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,615
about its network prefix but
the length of that prefix.

12
00:00:36,615 --> 00:00:39,930
A network with a longer prefix

13
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,020
has less of the 32-bit address left
over to distinguish particular hosts.

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,950
And a network with a shorter prefix
has more addresses for hosts, so

15
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:48,809
it's a larger network.

16
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,750
The network prefix length is
something that has to be chosen when

17
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,450
the network is set up.

18
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,610
And it's usually configured
by whatever process assigns

19
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:57,820
addresses to the computers.

20
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,660
For instance, if you have
a network with a 24-bit prefix,

21
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,420
that means there's 8 bits left over for
the host part of addresses.

22
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,809
We would conventionally
write this is as /24.

23
00:01:08,809 --> 00:01:16,262
For instance,
198.51.100.0/24 network block.

24
00:01:16,262 --> 00:01:19,040
But if the network prefix is shorter,
say 22 bits,

25
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,840
then there will be 10 bits left over for
host addressing.

26
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,580
This would be a /22 network.

27
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:30,010
And you can't tell how long the prefix
is just by looking at the addresses.

28
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:34,890
For these addresses either a 22 or
a 24 network would be a possibility.

29
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,090
So how many hosts can fit
on one of these networks?

30
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:44,400
Well, 10 bits of host address means
2 to the tenth power addresses,

31
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,470
which would be a 1,024 except that
the top and the bottom addresses of

32
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,630
a network block are reserved and
the first address is usually the router.

33
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,660
So 1021 addresses are available for
hosts.

34
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:04,850
Similarly in a /24 network, there would
be 256 addresses but minus those 3.

35
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,288
There are usually about 253
addresses that remain for hosts.

36
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:11,710
Now why does this matter?

37
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,650
Subnet misconfiguration can
cause some pretty weird problems

38
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,530
on a server network especially.

39
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,220
Things like one machine thinks that it
can talk to another machine directly,

40
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,710
but the other thinks that it has
to talk back through a router, and

41
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,180
that can cause very strange
communications problems.

42
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,230
Getting a good grasp of how the stuff
works can save you a lot of trouble if

43
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,620
you're ever setting up a server network.
