1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,860
So I would to consider with you one example of

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,760
what Rice's Theorem might mean in practice

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,640
and might not mean in practice,

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,370
and the example I find very illustrative for this is

5
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,230
malware detection,

6
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,620
so determining if a program does something bad on your computer

7
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,670
or if it is a harmless program that you want to run.

8
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,540
So first of all, we have to think of it about

9
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,300
what actually classifies a piece of software as malware?

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,490
So a good classification of malware be that

11
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,100
it's a piece of software that does something the user doesn't want it to do?

12
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,740
Would it be a good classification if it deletes files?

13
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,820
If it gathers information from your computer?

14
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,480
If it disrupts or interrupts other programs?

15
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,680
If it installs itself or something else without asking you as a user?

16
00:00:44,680 --> 99:59:59,999
Or some combination of the above.
