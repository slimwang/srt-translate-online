1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,480
Now let's have our method actually
switch to an island scene.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,980
First up, let's do some prep work.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,790
So Unity only recognizes the scenes
in your build that you tell it about.

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,880
So we need to add both our starting
scene and our main scene to the build.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,400
So let's do this by going up
to File &gt; Build Settings.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,070
Okay, so you see the space here for
scenes and build.

7
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,494
We want to drag, both our island scene,
and the take of a vacation scene,

8
00:00:30,494 --> 00:00:32,145
into this space.

9
00:00:32,145 --> 00:00:35,975
So we want to make sure that
take a vacation is on top.

10
00:00:35,975 --> 00:00:40,635
As Unity will automatically load the
first seen in the Build Settings list.

11
00:00:40,635 --> 00:00:45,950
So let's do that now,
so take a vacation and

12
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,770
falling coconut,
which is our island scene.

13
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,290
Go ahead and close this window
now that you set it up.

14
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,630
All right, now go back to
the Change Scene script and

15
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,920
load it up in model development.

16
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,400
Since when we click the vacation block,
we want to go to the island,

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,210
we need to change the GoToScene method
to change the scene to the island.

18
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,730
Let's go ahead and
type some code to do that now.

19
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,510
The code for
that is SceneManager.LoadScene and

20
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,260
then the name of the scene to load.

21
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,090
So name of scene 2 load.

22
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,310
Okay, but we have some problems here.

23
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:31,678
If we hover over Scene Manager, it says
it doesn't exist in the current context.

24
00:01:31,678 --> 00:01:35,184
That just means that it has no
idea what to do with this code.

25
00:01:35,184 --> 00:01:40,392
And that's because we don't have
access to Scene Management yet.

26
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:43,980
There are a couple different
ways to solve this problem.

27
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,786
The easiest one is to just right
click on this, go to Resolve &gt;

28
00:01:48,786 --> 00:01:53,210
using UnityEngine SceneManagement.

29
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,558
That's because MonoDevelop is smart
enough to guess what you actually

30
00:01:56,558 --> 00:01:57,570
want to do here.

31
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,800
So if you click that you'll
see it creates a line up here

32
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,400
called usingUnityEngine.SceneManagement.

33
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,120
But I'm going to Ctrl+Z and
undo that, and

34
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,460
manually type that up here at the top.

35
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:19,675
So I'm going to type,
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement.

36
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,163
And this gives us access to
the Scene Management name space,

37
00:02:25,163 --> 00:02:29,800
which you might remember from the Unity
documentation lesson earlier.

38
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,030
So that lets talk to the Scene Manager,

39
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,910
which gives us access to
the Load Scene Method.

40
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,000
Then inside of the Load Scene Method,

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,870
you have a string that is
the name of the scene to load.

42
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,960
This actually needs
be the islands scene.

43
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:55,740
So let's go back to Unity, go find our
island scene which was falling coconut.

44
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,650
I'm going to click once and it's
going to select the name of the scene.

45
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,740
I'm going to press Ctrl+C to copy, and

46
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,440
then I'm going to go
back to Monitor Develop.

47
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,280
And then I'm going to replace that
string with the name of the scene,

48
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,352
which is 00 FallingCoconut.

49
00:03:15,352 --> 00:03:19,750
Okay great, instead of typing the name
of the scene here I could also

50
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,370
use whats called an Index.

51
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:28,082
Which is the name or the number of
the scene, so scene 0, scene 1, scene 2.

52
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,730
That's a different way of doing it, but

53
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,800
for right now let's do it
with the name of the scene.

54
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,990
Go ahead and save the script,
go back to Unity, and hit play.

55
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:42,068
All right, and
now try clicking on your vacation block.

56
00:03:42,068 --> 00:03:44,103
[SOUND] All right!

57
00:03:44,103 --> 00:03:45,598
We just went on vacation.

58
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:46,787
So nice.

59
00:03:46,787 --> 00:03:53,769
