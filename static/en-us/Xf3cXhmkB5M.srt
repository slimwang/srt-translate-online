00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[D. Evans] We're going to have many quizzes throughout each unit.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The point of a quiz is to check that you understand what we've covered.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Some of the quizzes will be fairly straightforward

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
just to see if you've followed what we said.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Other quizzes will be more challenging

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and require you to put together several ideas that we've covered.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The quizzes don't count towards your grade.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You'll be able to try them as many times as you want until you hopefully get the answer right.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It certainly will be valuable to try to get the answer right the first time.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
But they shouldn't be stressful.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
They're meant to keep you engaged in the lecture, make sure you're understanding things.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
After each quiz there will be an explanation of the answer

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
that will often go in more depth than just answering the quiz correctly.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So for the first quiz and to get started practicing doing quizzes,

15
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:46,000
our question is: "What is the goal of Unit 1?"

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,815
There are 4 choices.

17
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:50,677
You can check all the choices that you think are good answers.

18
00:00:50,677 --> 00:00:53,631
So the goal is to get started programming,

19
00:00:53,631 --> 00:00:57,769
the second choice is to learn some important computer science concepts,

20
00:00:57,769 --> 00:01:02,538
the third choice is to write some code that extracts a link from a web page,

21
00:01:02,538 --> 00:01:07,754
and the fourth choice is to write code to rank web pages.

22
00:01:07,754 --> 00:01:10,000
So that's the first quiz.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,446
Check as many answers as you think are correct.
