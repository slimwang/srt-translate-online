1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,460
So this sounds great. Partner sound wonderful but what could go wrong with this?

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,460
Let's look at partnership risks.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,520
Now everybody talks about all the great things they have in partnerships

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,040
and large companies partner all the time.

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,390
Let me start with the large company partnership risks.

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:20,390
One of the greatest partnership disasters probably ever.

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:26,410
Now, I am in the 21st Century probably including the 20th was when Boeing was building the 787,

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:32,580
the new jet airplane made out of carbon fiber and not only was it a unique technology advanced

9
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,080
but at the same time, they've decided to do something

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,120
that no other airline manufacture had ever were done.

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,660
What they decide to do was instead of Boeing now building all the parts,

12
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:48,820
they were going to outsource all the manufacturing risks to a series of partners,

13
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:54,750
spread around the world, and while Boeing's unions and machinists argued,

14
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,690
no they missed 50 years expertise on how to build these components.

15
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,910
Boeing because of other pressures, both financial and union

16
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,980
decided that it would be a much smarter strategic move to have people building

17
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:12,170
the center fuselage in Italy and the tail fin somewhere else,

18
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:17,040
and the stabilizers somewhere else, and the forward fuselage by another vendor

19
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,140
until all of a sudden, their supply chain was scattered around the world

20
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:26,230
and at least half these parts being made by people who've never made airplane components.

21
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:32,090
It will look great on paper. It was going to save them enormous manufacturing cost.

22
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:36,040
It turns out to be the worse business decision of the 21st Century,

23
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,930
because it was made by accountants and not by engineers.

24
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,890
It turns out their partners delayed the program by about three or four years,

25
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,510
because there was a tremendous amount of rework--

26
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:50,790
parts didn't fit, parts didn't work, and this wasn't your living room furniture.

27
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,940
These weren't devices that we're going to carry hundreds of people on the earth

28
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,850
and there was no margin for error.

29
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,950
It turns out Boeing actually had to go buy back a good number of these manufacturers

30
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:05,080
and bring back their expertise and oversight, which they assume wouldn't be necessary.

31
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,300
So, I just used this as an example not to bash Boeing,

32
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,810
but to understand that even the smartest companies

33
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,220
sometimes made partnership decisions that look good on a spreadsheet,

34
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,420
but at the end of the day, partnerships are not driven by spreadsheets.

35
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,570
They are drive by technical competence customer needs,

36
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:26,880
and the ability to let her final finished quality product.
