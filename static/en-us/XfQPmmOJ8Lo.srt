1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now I'd like you to take a short quiz.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm going to describe a kind of testing that somebody is doing,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and you're going to tell me which of the kinds of testing that we've discussed

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
that it's most like.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We have a piece of software under test,

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and this is some sort of a really critical embedded system,

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
maybe, for example, it's controlling airbags on a vehicle.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And this vehicle is going to be out in the field for many years,

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and so cars get subjected to fairly extreme conditions.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
They have a lot of heating and cooling cycles.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
They get exposed to salt and mud and water,

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and so the cars are in a fairly harsh environment.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And one of the things we're going to want to know

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
is how the software responds to defects that get introduced

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
into the automobile's wiring

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
as this vehicle ages in the field, that is to say as people are driving it around

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
the salty roads in Michigan or whatever.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And so what we're going to do is using maybe a simulator or something

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
we're going to make it look like a wire that's used

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
for this processor that's used for software running on this processor

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
to talk with other modules, so cause a really big distributed system,

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
so the software under test here is just one of many pieces of software

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
running on the car.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We're going to use some sort of a simulation module

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
to simulate a noisy wire, and that basically means, for example,

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
a wire whose insulation has rubbed off and that is not perfectly

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
conducting signals anymore.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's getting junk injected into it because it's banging against the car's frame or something.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The question is what kind of testing are we doing?

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And your choices are regression testing,

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
unit testing, stress testing, or white box testing.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please right now click the box that best describes what we're doing.
