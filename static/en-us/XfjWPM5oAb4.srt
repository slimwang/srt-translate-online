A root of a polynomial is the x coordinate of one of its x-intercepts. We've

2
00:00:04,447 --> 00:00:09,133
been looking at equations for parabolas that can be written in the form y equals

3
00:00:09,133 --> 00:00:13,743
ax squared plus bx plus c. And then we want to find the x intercepts, we replace

4
00:00:13,743 --> 00:00:17,973
y with 0. And come up with a quadratic equation. Any numbers that satisfy this

5
00:00:17,973 --> 00:00:21,914
equation, are roots. Well we've been solving for x using factoring, or the

6
00:00:21,914 --> 00:00:26,284
quadratic formula, or finding the roots of these quadratics. It's convenient to

7
00:00:26,284 --> 00:00:30,444
have the word root, because I've been asking you for x intercept over, and over

8
00:00:30,444 --> 00:00:34,772
again. But for every x intercept, the y value is 0. So just keep in mind that a

9
00:00:34,772 --> 00:00:39,276
Y value that goes along with the root to create the coordinates of a point is 0.

10
00:00:39,276 --> 00:00:40,957
Just like we plugged in here.
