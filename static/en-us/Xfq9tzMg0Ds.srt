1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
So, is showing the NP completeness of a problem always so involved with playing around

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,900
with strange constructions such as weird networks?

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,340
Well, the answer is in a way yes.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,620
Showing NP completeness can often involve playing around a lot

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,020
and some gory details in the proofs.

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,690
So, even today, there are still scientific papers being published that

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,930
basically just show the NP completeness of a certain problem or set of problems.

8
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,310
So, it is not an easy task, but luckily,

9
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,980
there is a whole arsenal of known NP complete problems

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,970
out there which I'm now going to show you.

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,950
If you go on Wikipedia, for example,

12
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,480
there is a whole list of NP complete problems

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:43,080
from graph theory, network design, sets and partitions, and so on and so on.

14
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,010
So, for most practical problems that you will encounter

15
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,410
either they have already been shown to be NP complete

16
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,980
or although likely be very similar to one or more of these problems

17
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,050
for which we already know that they are NP complete.

18
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,310
In this case, similarity is a good thing because similarity means that a reduction will,

19
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:02,980
in most cases, be either much easier than what we have just seen with shortest tour or,

20
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:08,180
at least, if you then look at the NP completeness proofs for those problems,

21
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,150
then I give you techniques and ideas for performing the reduction that you are looking for.

22
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,500
The foundation for this library was laid by a computer scientist called Richard Karp who,

23
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,250
in 1972, showed 21 different problems to be NP complete,

24
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,510
and that was basically the starting point for this huge list of thousands of NP complete problems.

25
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:31,010
Now, let's see if you already have an intuition which NP complete problems

26
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,460
would be most useful to show the NP completeness of other problems.

27
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,380
So, let's say you encounter a number of problems.

28
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:43,110
One problem will deal with clustering or finding large groups of related objects

29
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:49,530
or you would encounter a problem that deals with covering a set of object as efficiently as possible.

30
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,170
So, you have to select a few objects that is some way observed or--

31
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,480
no, covering is a good term other objects in the set

32
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,310
or you could encounter problem that in some way deals with optimizing pathways.

33
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,240
So, getting from one point to another point

34
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,370
but there are few constraints up here that you have to meet.

35
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,810
Here, you are trying to find clustered groups of related objects.

36
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:17,440
Finally, you could deal with a problem that is about diversification.

37
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,300
So, large groups of independent objects don't have anything to do with each other.

38
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,250
And finally, something else.

39
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,490
Now, you already know the five NP complete problems.

40
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:31,730
You know the shortest tour, you know vertex cover, you know SAT,

41
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,840
independent set, and clique.

42
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,560
Now, what I would like to know from you is if you encounter a problem

43
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,730
that basically arises in one of these five situations here

44
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,920
which of these problems here for which we know that they are NP complete

45
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,670
would be your best bet for proving

46
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,650
a problem that falls into one of these categories here is NP complete.

47
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,540
So, basically using this as a basis for a reduction.

48
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,820
So, these are numbered and you can enter your numbers

49
00:02:58,820 --> 99:59:59,999
for the ones that you think match best in these circles here.
