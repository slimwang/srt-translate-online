00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,280
Magic moments happen when
your app does something so

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,140
that your user won't have to, like
figuring out their location for them, so

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,080
they don't have to type on
that tiny little keyboard.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,850
In Sunshine we ask the user for
their location, but

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,820
the Google Maps platform provides
location services that could

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,450
allow us to get
a location automatically.

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,540
The Places API was released
earlier this year and

8
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,210
includes a variety of
helpful location services.

9
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,970
For example,
the auto complete API offers your

10
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,380
users the power of
predictive auto complete for

11
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,330
places with a user experience
similar to the Google search box.

12
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:35,250
You can also get the user's current
location, get a place by ID and

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,750
even add a place to
the Google Places database.

14
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,710
But for Sunshine, we're going to use the
Place Picker because it provides a UI

15
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,540
dialogue that displays an interactive
map, and a list of nearby places,

16
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,620
from geographical addresses
to local businesses.

17
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,560
Users can then choose a place
that is passed back to your app.

18
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,920
You could always develop your
own location widget, but

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,320
there are several advantages
to using the Place Picker.

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,800
First and foremost, the user experience
will be consistent with other apps using

21
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,300
the Place Picker, including both
Google apps and third-party ones.

22
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,270
This means your users will likely
already know how to interact

23
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,560
with this widget.

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,120
Second, accessibility is built in, and

25
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,390
you should already know
how important that is.

26
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,670
But finally,
it saves you development time so

27
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,000
that you can focus your efforts on
the features you care the most about.
