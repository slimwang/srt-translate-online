1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:03,542
>> So Andy, when you were talking to Susan, you mentioned nearsightedness. Now,

2
00:00:03,542 --> 00:00:04,721
what did you mean by that?

3
00:00:04,721 --> 00:00:08,748
>> So, people who are nearsighted have a hard time seeing things that are far

4
00:00:08,748 --> 00:00:12,782
away. They can only see things that are close, or near to them.

5
00:00:12,782 --> 00:00:15,888
>> So, Andy, are you nearsighted? You have the.

6
00:00:15,888 --> 00:00:19,160
>> Yes. When I take my glasses off I really can't see a thing.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,060
>> So, why does that happen?

8
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,745
>> Before we get into that why don't we learn a little bit more about the eye.

9
00:00:24,745 --> 00:00:27,196
>> So, just take a look at this diagram.

10
00:00:27,196 --> 00:00:30,058
>> Okay. Well, I've definitely seen this before. Can you tell the viewers at home

11
00:00:30,058 --> 00:00:31,090
what's going on?

12
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,760
>> Okay. So, this is our eye, and the job of the eye is basically to take light

13
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,288
which enters here and focus it onto the back of the eye, back here.

14
00:00:39,288 --> 00:00:42,348
>> Is it kind of how a magnifying glass focuses light?

15
00:00:42,348 --> 00:00:47,074
>> Yeah, sort of. Now, a properly functioning eye with good vision will take light

16
00:00:47,074 --> 00:00:50,434
that enters, and bend that later or focus it on to the back of the eye here,

17
00:00:50,434 --> 00:00:53,526
which is called the retina.

18
00:00:53,526 --> 00:00:56,302
>> And what about an eye that's not functioning so well. Well in that case the

19
00:00:56,302 --> 00:00:59,292
lense, this part here that actually bent the light and focused it, isn't doing

20
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:03,829
it's job right. And people who are what's called nearsighted, the light

21
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:08,643
actually gets bent too much by the lense. So, maybe the focusing point would be

22
00:01:08,643 --> 00:01:12,716
somewhere here, which is not where the retina is. So, this results in blurry

23
00:01:12,716 --> 00:01:13,299
vision.
