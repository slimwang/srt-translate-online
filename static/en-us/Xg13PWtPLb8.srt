00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It looks like Crazy definitely has the most power here. Crazy publishes the final votes.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Crazy could decide not to include votes that aren't for the rate selection.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Crazy could tamper with the votes.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The one validation we have is the voters can check that their vote is in that list.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So Crazy can't add extra votes if the number of votes in the beginning is known.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Crazy could replace some votes and change those votes.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And there's no way with this scheme yet for a voter to prove that Crazy cheated.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
If the voter can prove that Crazy cheated, well then maybe it's not such an advantage to be Crazy.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So is there a way for the voter to prove that their vote was not included?
