>> The x-intercepts are the points where the graph of our parabola, whose

00:00:04,614 --> 00:00:09,450
equation is y equals negative x squared over 8 plus 4x minus 14, or of course

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,801
written in this other form is perfectly acceptable. So where that line meets the

00:00:14,801 --> 00:00:17,510
line y equals 0, which is just the x-axis.
