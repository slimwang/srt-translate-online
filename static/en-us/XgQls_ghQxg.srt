Bandora found that children in the experimental group who saw the adults'

00:00:03,373 --> 00:00:07,842
aggressive behavior, acted more aggressively themselves. And the children in

00:00:07,842 --> 00:00:10,850
the controlled group, were not as aggressive with the bobo doll because they

00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,439
didn't see the adult being aggressive.
