00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,847
We've helped Grant a ton throughout his journey building up his glasses wiper

2
00:00:03,847 --> 00:00:07,766
and nozzle enterprise. He's doing algebra all the time now to solve problems he

3
00:00:07,766 --> 00:00:11,579
encounters in his business and he knows how to do all of it because of us. He's

4
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:15,178
been so successful that he was able to afford new office and he's trying to

5
00:00:15,178 --> 00:00:19,008
decorate his new place with art that reflects his products. Although he has

6
00:00:19,008 --> 00:00:23,208
different sculptures and paintings and other masterpieces strewn throughout his

7
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:26,868
new space, one of the things he is most excited about is this fountain that

8
00:00:26,868 --> 00:00:30,932
looks like a giant wiper nozzle. He thinks he's worked out an equation for the

9
00:00:30,932 --> 00:00:35,028
trajectory of the water coming out of the fountain and then going up, falling

10
00:00:35,028 --> 00:00:39,189
down on the ground. However, he wants us to check that equation for him. Let's

11
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:43,003
help him see if it's right. Just like we had with Grant's slingshot a few

12
00:00:43,003 --> 00:00:47,227
lessons ago, let's set up a coordinate plane so that the fountain is positioned

13
00:00:47,227 --> 00:00:51,214
at the origin, just like this. Now, I realized that the fountain is not as small

14
00:00:51,214 --> 00:00:54,695
as its single point on the coordinate plane but for the purposes of this

15
00:00:54,695 --> 00:00:58,471
question, let's just pretend like the entire thing is located exactly at the

16
00:00:58,471 --> 00:01:02,536
origin. From this position of the origin, the water is going to shoot up out of

17
00:01:02,536 --> 00:01:06,518
the fountain and then fall and end up slightly over to the right. Here's the

18
00:01:06,518 --> 00:01:11,310
equation that Grant came up with. Y equals negative 7x squared plus 14x minus

19
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,874
10. In this equation, x stands for the horizontal position of the water, at a

20
00:01:15,874 --> 00:01:20,626
given moment, and y stands for a corresponding vertical position for that same

21
00:01:20,626 --> 00:01:25,986
drop of water. So, every drop of water of this fountain should follow about this

22
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:30,400
equation. Remember, this is just an approximation. We're sort of idealizing the

23
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,476
situation, so just go with it. Now, if Grant is right, then one of the roots of

24
00:01:34,476 --> 00:01:38,454
this equation should be where the fountain is located, at 0. And the other

25
00:01:38,454 --> 00:01:42,536
should tell us where the water lands, over here. In other words, if we saw the

26
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:46,826
quadratic equation that goes along with this equation for a parabola, then we

27
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:51,262
should get those two solutions, those two roots. Let's use the quadratic formula

28
00:01:51,262 --> 00:01:55,062
to see if Grant is right. For now, I'd just like you to simplify the parts of

29
00:01:55,062 --> 00:01:59,138
the formula that belong in each of these boxes. Just put a number in each spot.
