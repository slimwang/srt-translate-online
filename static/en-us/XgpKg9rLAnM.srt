00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,281
Back in the world of glasses wipers, Grant just found out that the situation

2
00:00:04,293 --> 00:00:08,736
with manufacturing cost is not quite as simple as he thought. He not only has to

3
00:00:08,748 --> 00:00:12,955
pay for materials to build his wipers, which remember, we figured out that one

4
00:00:12,967 --> 00:00:17,249
wiper set cost $6.50 to buy. He not only has to pay for materials to build his

5
00:00:17,261 --> 00:00:21,381
wipers, which you'll recall, we figured out that materials for one wiper set

6
00:00:21,393 --> 00:00:25,848
costs $6.50, he also has to pay for the factory space that he's using. This is

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,910
just a fixed amount, per month, of $1200. Taking this information into account,

8
00:00:30,005 --> 00:00:34,171
which one of these expressions do you think should replace the question mark to

9
00:00:34,183 --> 00:00:37,404
create an equation for the money that Grant spends each month?
