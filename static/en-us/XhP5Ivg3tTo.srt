00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,730
Yippee, it's quiz time.

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,730
I think this one will be fun.

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,710
Recall that,
given an input sequence that's bitonic,

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,960
a bitonic merge produces
a sorted output.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,560
Your assignment is to create
a Bitonic Merge Network.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,000
That is to start with this
empty comparator network, and

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,600
then do the following.

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,990
In each column,
I want you to insert one or

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,980
more non-overlapping plus comparators.

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,030
You can do that by selecting an even
number of boxes in each column.

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,430
For example,
suppose you checked these two boxes.

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,930
That implies a plus comparator
between those two inputs.

13
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,850
Now, if you were to
evaluate this network,

14
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,220
leaving all these other boxes blank,
then here's the output you would get.

15
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,390
Now, clearly, these intermediate
outputs don't match the final outputs.

16
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,920
So this can't be the full network.

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,050
Let me show you one more example.

18
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:56,470
Suppose instead that you
chose these four boxes.

19
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:00,370
Recall that comparators within
a column cannot overlap.

20
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:04,819
Therefore, those four boxes
correspond to these two comparators.

21
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:06,400
Were you to evaluate this network,

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,060
you'd get these values as outputs
from the two comparators.

23
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,130
As you can see,
they still don't match the outputs.

24
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,070
So if you start your network this way,

25
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,150
you'll need to keep adding
comparators in the other columns.

26
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,110
Of course, you can chain the output of
one comparator to the input of another.

27
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,070
Oh, and one more thing,
your network needs to be able to sort

28
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,650
any length a bitonic sequence,
not just the example I've shown here.

29
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:31,820
Have fun and good luck.
