00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,406
Let's do this in the spread sheet. Remember that there are 500 values. So, here

2
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:13,825
anywhere in the blank white cells, we'll write equals average A2:A501. We get

3
00:00:13,825 --> 00:00:23,353
that the average is about 6.47. And here we'll calculate each of the squared

4
00:00:23,353 --> 00:00:27,959
deviations equals A2 minus D2 squared.

5
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:28,893
[SOUND].

6
00:00:28,893 --> 00:00:38,815
Copy that. Paste it in column B. We'll take the sum of squared deviations. And

7
00:00:38,815 --> 00:00:45,144
then we'll divide that by n minus 1. That gives us the variance. And then we'll

8
00:00:45,144 --> 00:00:51,644
take the square root. And then we get our sample SD is about 0.4.
