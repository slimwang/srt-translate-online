00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,599
The other Python feature I want to introduce now is default parameters. Default

2
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:09,088
parameters allow us to have parameters that don't necessarily need to be passed

3
00:00:09,088 --> 00:00:12,963
in. This is very handy. So, here's an example to illustrate the value of default

4
00:00:12,963 --> 00:00:17,224
parameters. Remember that we defined the dish class and it's initializer takes

5
00:00:17,224 --> 00:00:20,550
three parameters in addition to the self object. A name, a price and

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,465
description. But there's some dishes that are so famous that they don't need a

7
00:00:23,465 --> 00:00:27,666
description. Either that or they defy description. So, suppose that applies to

8
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:31,535
our Bodacious Burger. We could pass in None or some empty string or some other

9
00:00:31,535 --> 00:00:34,856
value, but really, we don't want to pass in anything. We don't want to have a

10
00:00:34,856 --> 00:00:39,010
description. That's okay if we have just one parameter that we don't care about.

11
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,287
But suppose we have lots of them. Then, we might end up needing to do something

12
00:00:42,287 --> 00:00:46,430
like this. We've got 1, 2, 3, 4 parameters we don't care about, we've got to

13
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:50,144
remember to have those. And then, we've got one that we do care about, say that

14
00:00:50,144 --> 00:00:53,640
is the number of side dishes that comes with the Bodacious Burger. And we want

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,810
that to have a value 3. And then, we've got to remember another one that we

16
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,410
don't care about. This gets to be pretty unwieldy, the way we're going to avoid

17
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,770
this is to give default values for the parameters. And then, we only have to

18
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,864
pass in the ones that are different from the default values. The way to do this

19
00:01:06,864 --> 00:01:10,420
is quite simple. For each parameter that we want to have a default value, like

20
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:14,105
the description parameter, we just add an assignment giving it the value that we

21
00:01:14,105 --> 00:01:17,830
want it to have. So, the description parameter will have a default value None.

22
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,900
If we don't pass in a description, it will have the value None. If we pass it

23
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,575
in, it will have the value that we pass it. Then, we can use a note like this,

24
00:01:24,575 --> 00:01:29,718
creating new instances of the Dish class. Only passing in parameters whose value

25
00:01:29,718 --> 00:01:33,670
differs from the default value. We always have to pass in the name and price

26
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,072
because they have no default value, and those are the first two in both calls

27
00:01:37,072 --> 00:01:40,403
here. But otherwise, we don't have to pass in anything else unless we want a

28
00:01:40,403 --> 00:01:43,636
value different from the default value, like we do here with the Broccoli

29
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:47,005
Burger, which is vegetarian, the default value is False. For the Bodacious

30
00:01:47,005 --> 00:01:50,580
Burger, we didn't pass in any value for vegetarian, that means it will have the

31
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,989
default value which is False. And it's highly non-recommended for vegetarians.
