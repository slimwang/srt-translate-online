00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,945
Okay, let's work through this together. We want to add 25 to the redness, but

2
00:00:03,945 --> 00:00:09,514
we don't want it to get larger than 255. So, do we want to take the max, or the

3
00:00:09,514 --> 00:00:15,254
min? Do we want the larger of 255 plus 25, or do we want the smaller? We want

4
00:00:15,254 --> 00:00:20,316
the smaller because we never want it to get larger than 255. And that's the

5
00:00:20,316 --> 00:00:24,556
answer. Let's run this program. Here's the original image, which I took around

6
00:00:24,556 --> 00:00:30,280
noon. And here it is transformed into a beautiful sunset. And thanks to our

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:35,538
friend mass dot min, none of the colors overflowed. Like I said, these math

8
00:00:35,538 --> 00:00:37,440
functions can be pretty useful.
