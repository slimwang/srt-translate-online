Here's another example where we can use out techniques from solving linear

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,700
equations. Again, I'd like you to start out by thinking of e to the x as our

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,404
variable. Once you get it by itself on one side of the equation, you can use

4
00:00:12,404 --> 00:00:18,688
logs to solve for x. Once you find an answer for x, please round to two decimal

5
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,951
places.
