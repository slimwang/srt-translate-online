00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,050
As an overview, three aspects of, of OCL to be aware of,

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:09,100
is first of all it's declarative. It's not a procedural language, it's not

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:14,840
a programming language, it's a way of specifying properties. In programming

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:20,130
language terms it's a pure expression language, that is, it describes values,

5
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,720
it doesn't, describe activities. It doesn't have any assignment statements,

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:31,570
instead it, it specifies assertions or constraints or properties,

7
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:37,170
usually with equal signs. The language is strongly typed and

8
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,040
it comes with some primitive types that you might expect in terms of reals and

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,010
integers and so on. And the neat thing about OCL is it only

10
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:49,280
has one key concept involved with it. And that's the concept of a constraint.

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,610
A constraint is some formal assertion of system properties.
