00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,328
Let's take a couple [of] minutes to look at the solutions.

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:11,288
When we're looking at the slope of line 'uc,' you can see that our slope works out to be 3/5.

3
00:00:11,288 --> 00:00:15,073
Finding the perpendicular slope is then relatively easy.

4
00:00:15,073 --> 00:00:20,788
We find the inverse of the slope, which is negative 5/3.

5
00:00:20,788 --> 00:00:23,700
Now it's time to find the equation of this line.

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:31,367
Let's first recall our midpoint, 3/2 and 9/2, and our perpendicular slope, which is negative 5/3.

7
00:00:31,367 --> 00:00:36,489
Please insert those values into the point-slope form and solve.

8
00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:43,647
And our equation in slope intercept form is y = -5/3 x + 7.
