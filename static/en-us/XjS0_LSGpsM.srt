1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So the answer is to increase the amount of work required.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Normally, we want to use computation to reduce work,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
but here the goal is to make this amount of work to find a bitcoin

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
to be stable, to be fairly predictable, and to be about 10 minutes long.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And so, we could do that with just one hash function

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
by reducing the value of the target.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That would require changing the target more frequently

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and using more zero bits in the target.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The alternative is to make it harder to compute each value of x,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and that's what the two hash functions do.
