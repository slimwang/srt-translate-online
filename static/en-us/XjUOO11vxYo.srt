1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I won't bore you with the arithmetic again.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's the same as it was the last two times,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and we wind up with the same answers we had the first time.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:20,000
B is equal to 4.5, and r is equal to 0.982.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What I hope you've noticed is that r doesn't change when we scale x or y.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
B doesn't change as long as we scale x and y by the same amount.
