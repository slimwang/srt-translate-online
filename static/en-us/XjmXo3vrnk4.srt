00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,160
The connection between common-sense reasoning and human cognition is both very

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,880
strong and not yet fully understood. Let us suppose that I were to

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,800
ask you to go find the weather outside. You would not jump out of the window.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,450
Why not? You would use common sense reasoning to know that jumping out of

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:22,610
the window to find the weather is not a good idea. But what is it

6
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:27,620
that tells you not to jump out of the window? You use the notion of goals.

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,170
The notion of context to decide what not to do and what to do.

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,800
We use similar notion of context in order to do natural language understanding.

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,749
We could use context to disambiguate between various meanings of take.

10
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,370
Can we context also to decide on what would be a good source of plan. So

11
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,310
far we have been talking about common sense inferences about physical actions,

12
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:56,010
what about the social world? You and I also make common sense inferences about

13
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,700
the social world around us. One possibility is that you and

14
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:07,340
I have a flurry of mind, this is actually called the flurry of mind theory.

15
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,450
You and I as cognitive agents, ascribe goals, beliefs, desires to each other.

16
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:17,010
And it's the theory of mind that allows us to make inferences about each other,

17
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,540
including common sensical inferences.
