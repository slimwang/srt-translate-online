00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,820
Worst-case running time gives us guarantees and also it sounds like it's a very big simplification,

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:13,460
but the thing is as long as we're still counting the number of time steps of the algorithm exactly

3
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:18,380
even worst-case running time can get pretty tricky and I'll give you one example for this.

4
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:24,190
Again, we're going to consider an algorithm that takes as input a string of length n.

5
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:30,080
What this algorithm does is given the string of length n, it counts the number of times

6
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,010
that the sequence ab appears in that string.

7
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:41,920
So it will iterate over the length of the string and if it finds an a, it will look if the next character is a b

8
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,530
and if that is the case, it will increase the counter here.

9
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:52,780
What I would like you to consider for our next quiz is what a worst case and a bust case input

10
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,840
for that algorithm would look like.

11
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,430
Here we have the number of potential inputs and it doesn't really matter how long those inputs are.

12
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,590
It's more about their structure and if the structure would cause the algorithm to behave

13
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:08,510
as it would in the worst case or in the best case or something else,

14
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:14,830
and what I would like you to do is for each of those strings, tell me if that string will cause the algorithm

15
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:20,820
to go into a worst-case running time, a best-case running time, or something else.

16
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,830
For each of those four strings, I would like you to tell me if those strings caused the algorithm

17
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:33,260
to have the best possible running time or the worst possible running time or something in between,

18
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,740
and it doesn't really matter how long those strings are.

19
00:01:35,740 --> 99:59:59,999
It's the structure that I want you to look at.
