1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,664
So I'm here with Jessica Uelmen
who's the program manager for

2
00:00:02,664 --> 00:00:04,140
mobile nano-degrees here at Udacity.

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:04,960
Thank you so much for
talking to us today.

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:05,640
>> Yeah, happy to be here.

5
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,550
My pleasure.

6
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,330
>> So the first thing I wanted to
ask you was, that there's this trend

7
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,650
in technology that the technology
industry tends to be very male-oriented.

8
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,970
And there's this
perception that therefore,

9
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,100
any educational technology that
comes out of the technology industry

10
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,650
will also be oriented more towards
male style ways of learning.

11
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,490
So what can we do when we're designing
educational technology to make sure that

12
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,740
we're not preserving this trend
of it being by men for men?

13
00:00:29,816 --> 00:00:33,850
>> Yeah, it's a really tough question
and a tough thing to address, but

14
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,450
I think it really starts with awareness,
which is great to be here and

15
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,580
talking about it already.

16
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:44,730
But, really scrutinizing and
looking at what's being designed,

17
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,480
looking at things
through a neutral lens.

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,415
Even getting feedback from women,
or from other teachers.

19
00:00:54,415 --> 00:00:57,890
Education as a field,
is primarily dominated by women.

20
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,925
So it's kind of interesting that ed
tech then becomes more male skewed.

21
00:01:01,925 --> 00:01:07,093
So I think if there's a way to sort
of start blending those worlds,

22
00:01:07,093 --> 00:01:10,335
we'll get to a little more diverse pool.

23
00:01:10,335 --> 00:01:12,953
>> Yeah, that makes a lot of sense,
I actually hadn't thought about

24
00:01:12,953 --> 00:01:16,275
that before, but you're right that with
technology it's very male oriented, but

25
00:01:16,275 --> 00:01:18,146
teaching tends to be very
female oriented And so

26
00:01:18,146 --> 00:01:20,436
there's a lot of great overlap there and
a lot of chance for

27
00:01:20,436 --> 00:01:22,780
collaboration as long as we
actually go out and do it.

28
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,280
>> Absolutely.

29
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,900
>> And talking to teachers I think
is something that anyone is on

30
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,020
the educational technology
needs to do more of anyway.

31
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:28,620
>> Yes.
>> And so

32
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,530
now we kind of kill two
birds with one stone.

33
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,100
>> Yep.
>> So, but

34
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,250
given that we're probably not going to
change the entire industry in the next

35
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:34,970
four months.

36
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,374
Of the students currently in the class,
what are some considerations they should

37
00:01:38,374 --> 00:01:41,435
make when they're developing their
tools besides possibly going out and

38
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:42,390
talking to teachers?

39
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,480
Are there any things
they can keep in mind?

40
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,710
>> I think maybe just even
surveying the landscape.

41
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,620
I mean, there's also,
people do a lot of efforts for

42
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,240
putting educational technology
solutions towards women, and

43
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,520
a lot of times unfortunately,
that's like making it pink.

44
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,220
So, let's not make it pink, okay?

45
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:04,770
But, looking at those solutions,
maybe seeing what they're doing and

46
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,008
seeing how it might be able to
adapt to what they're building.

47
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:11,400
>> And so I think that the other thing
that comes up here is that if our

48
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,650
ultimate goal is to make the technology
industry itself a little bit less

49
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,870
male dominated, the people in this class
will go on to careers in technology.

50
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,650
What can they do when they're
in their future workplaces or

51
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,870
their current workplaces?

52
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,120
They can kind of try and
combat this trend a little bit.

53
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,428
>> Yeah, I mean, I think the main thing
and something that I always push for

54
00:02:30,428 --> 00:02:33,920
is not necessarily making
a woman a commodity.

55
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,565
It's not a hire because she's a woman,
or it's not collaborating because she's

56
00:02:38,565 --> 00:02:41,300
a woman, and
it's a very difficult thing to do.

57
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,184
Because if you look at,
the percentages, and

58
00:02:43,184 --> 00:02:45,720
it's like wow,
there's not a whole lot of women here.

59
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,210
We need to hire women, but
that's not always the best solution.

60
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:55,780
And then when there are women in
the workplace in maybe leadership roles

61
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:01,550
making their impact more visible
externally and internally,

62
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:05,610
will sort of help fill that role model
role that we are always talking about.

63
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,316
We need more women in tech role models,
but doing so

64
00:03:09,316 --> 00:03:14,390
will then hopefully inspire more
people to pursue that as a field.

65
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,540
>> Yeah, and I think there's a very
interesting alignment there between what

66
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,530
we deal with in industry, and

67
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,690
what we actually deal with
here in the OMS program.

68
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,765
That as I'm recording this, hopefully
it will change in future semesters.

69
00:03:23,765 --> 00:03:26,075
The OMS program is 90% male, and

70
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:30,515
there's a tendency to think if it's 90%
male we just need to admit more women.

71
00:03:30,515 --> 00:03:31,675
>> Right.
>> But that's kind of,

72
00:03:31,675 --> 00:03:34,485
treating the symptom as the thing
to be treated as opposed to,

73
00:03:34,485 --> 00:03:36,735
it's a symptom of some underlying issue.

74
00:03:36,735 --> 00:03:40,612
And here the issue is appeal to women,
or if there are any obstacles that we're

75
00:03:40,612 --> 00:03:43,515
not really considering that
apply more to women than men.

76
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:45,732
Resolving those obstacles as
opposed to just, you know,

77
00:03:45,732 --> 00:03:47,915
changing admission criteria,
or something like that.

78
00:03:47,915 --> 00:03:48,895
>> Right.

79
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,915
And I think then, also, making things
a little bit more welcoming, or

80
00:03:52,915 --> 00:03:56,070
breaking down those like
a girl stereotypes.

81
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,650
One of the things that
always pops into my head is

82
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,930
I majored in electrical engineering, and
so we had to take physics classes, and

83
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,610
it was my sophomore year, and
we were in a physics study group.

84
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:10,760
It was me and a bunch of guys, because
that's the way it goes, and I was

85
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,200
helping them solve each of the problems,
and I was doing a lot of the teaching.

86
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,060
And one of the guys piped up and
said hey,

87
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,735
are we going to let the girl
teach us how it's done.

88
00:04:19,735 --> 00:04:22,570
>> [LAUGH]
>> And comments like that doesn't really

89
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:27,550
make for a welcoming environment, and
it's a very benign comment, right.

90
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:32,200
It's not meant to be hurtful,
but it is uncomfortable.

91
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,650
So just try to be aware of
those types of comments.

92
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,660
>> Yeah, it plays some kind of
assumption that the assumptions really

93
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,460
need to be addressed.

94
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,320
>> Right.
>> Comment might be harmless but

95
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,770
what it's perpetuating is not.

96
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:44,960
>> Yes, absolutely.

97
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,100
>> Well, great.
Well, thank you much for

98
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,930
talking to us today.

99
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:47,570
>> Yeah, my pleasure.

100
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,865
Always happy to talk.

101
00:04:48,865 --> 00:04:49,444
>> [LAUGH]
