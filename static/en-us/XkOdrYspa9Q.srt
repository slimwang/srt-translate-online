1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,350
And Android has a very
expressive intents system.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,500
Explain to me some of the differences
between implicit and explicit intents.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,833
>> So, I'm actually not familiar
with implicit and explicit intents.

4
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:16,198
Intents, in terms of launching another
application or something like that I'm

5
00:00:16,198 --> 00:00:20,318
familiar with or even starting a new
activity within your app using intent.

6
00:00:20,318 --> 00:00:24,110
But in terms of the difference between
explicit and implicit, I'm unfamiliar.

7
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:24,830
>> Yeah, that's fine.

8
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,396
And so, for explicit intents,

9
00:00:26,396 --> 00:00:29,740
you're very specific about
the activity you want to launch.

10
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:33,380
So that's probably what you
use most often is, I'm saying,

11
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,220
I need to launch my login activity or
some other activity in my application.

12
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,700
And that's usually done with explicit.

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,888
Can you have an idea of what
implicit intents would look like?

14
00:00:42,888 --> 00:00:46,234
>> I would think that if
the explicit is to start an activity

15
00:00:46,234 --> 00:00:47,588
in your application,

16
00:00:47,588 --> 00:00:52,309
implicit could be if your application
uses something like a bar code scanner.

17
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:56,250
Maybe you launch an intent for
a bar code scanner on your phone.

18
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,700
Or maybe if you don't have a bar
code scanner, it checks for that and

19
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,788
then launches the Play Store
where you can download one.

20
00:01:01,788 --> 00:01:02,739
>> Yeah, and that's perfect.

21
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:06,241
And so, yeah, with implicit intents,
you can kind of say,

22
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:09,409
I need to be able to send an email and
here's a message.

23
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:12,290
I don't know about the client
that's going to receive it.

24
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,640
You can also build them within
your own application, so

25
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,880
if you care about switching
out that implementation later.

26
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,099
You could do that using
implicit intents.

27
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:24,667
So if you wanted to throw
your login activity up,

28
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:27,748
you don't necessarily have
to specify the explicit one.

29
00:01:27,748 --> 00:01:31,148
You could instead specify an implicit
intent to launch that activity.

30
00:01:31,148 --> 00:01:35,978
>> So that would be, if I had
an application that was an image editor.

31
00:01:35,978 --> 00:01:39,078
And someone opens an image, it could
launch an intent to my app if I enabled

32
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:40,633
that, is that what you're saying?

33
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,295
>> Yeah, it's perfect.
