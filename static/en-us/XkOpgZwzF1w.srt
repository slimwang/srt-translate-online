1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:06,320
Active networks was way ahead of its time, and there was not a killer app to

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,960
justify this particular line of thought. Further, active networks focused more

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,470
on safety and less on performance, so in the 90s it seemed more like

4
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,570
a solution looking for a problem. But

5
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,840
difficulties with network management, rise of virtualization,

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,590
the right hardware support and data center and cloud computing have all

7
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:37,400
given active networks a new lease of life in the form of Software Defined

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,840
Networking or SDN for short. Specifically,

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,680
cloud computing promotes a model of utility

10
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,430
computing where multiple tenants, by that I

11
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:52,100
mean businesses, can host their respective corporate

12
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,930
networks simultaneously on the same computational

13
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,070
resources of a data center. Not that

14
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,390
this is going to ever happen but

15
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:06,040
imagine Coke and Pepsi, corporate networks running

16
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,630
on the same data center resources. What this means is there is a need

17
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:17,290
for perfect isolation, of the network traffic of one business from another,

18
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,930
even though each of the network traffic is flowing on the same

19
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:25,190
physical infrastructure. This calls for virtualization

20
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,750
of the physical network itself, and hence

21
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:33,070
the term, software defined networking. You will learn more about SDN if you

22
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:37,210
take a companion course on networking that is offered in this same program.
