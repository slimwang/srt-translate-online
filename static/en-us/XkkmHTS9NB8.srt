Here's a little quiz for you that deals with detail design.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:09,300
Imagine that you were writing a program to predict the weather. The way that

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,050
these programs normally work is by taking some geographical area and carving it

4
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:20,820
up into a rectangular grid or mesh. That is, there are numerous cells and

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,080
each cell contains some data such as temperature, wind pressure, humidity, and

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,880
so on. And then running an algorithm which diffuses the information

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,520
from cells to their neighbors in order to come to some conclusion about what

8
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,810
the future weather will be. If you had to develop a weather prediction program

9
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:47,191
you might have the choice between using arrays or objects.
