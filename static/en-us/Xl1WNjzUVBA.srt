00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,874
We can perform this because we were dealing with factors here. We were

2
00:00:03,874 --> 00:00:08,232
multiplying between these two numbers. So we removed a common factor of x plus

3
00:00:08,232 --> 00:00:12,215
y. And notice we still have multiplication here. Again if I think about

4
00:00:12,215 --> 00:00:15,955
distributing this a to x plus y, I would get this first term, and if I

5
00:00:15,955 --> 00:00:20,546
distributed this positive 2 to this x plus y, I would get my second term. This

6
00:00:20,546 --> 00:00:25,033
factoring is the opposite, or the inverse, of the distributive property. So you

7
00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:29,276
try one out. What would be the factored form for this expression? Write your

8
00:00:29,276 --> 00:00:33,017
answer here. Be sure you use parentheses, and there's no need to put a

9
00:00:33,017 --> 00:00:35,162
multiplication sign in between them.
