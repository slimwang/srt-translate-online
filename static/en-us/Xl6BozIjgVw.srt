00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,258
As you factor more and more problems you want to look back at your work. Loot

2
00:00:04,258 --> 00:00:08,757
for patterns. If the product of the first coefficient and the constant term is

3
00:00:08,757 --> 00:00:12,651
positive, then both of the factors will have to be positive or they'll both have

4
00:00:12,651 --> 00:00:16,632
to be negative. If the product of the first coefficient and the last coefficient

5
00:00:16,632 --> 00:00:20,298
is negative, then we know one of these factors must be negative. We also see

6
00:00:20,298 --> 00:00:25,190
this in our factored form. Both of these are positive, where as here, one of

7
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,563
them is negative.
