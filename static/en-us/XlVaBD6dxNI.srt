1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,540
Somebody is trying to compromise
the security of your system,

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:09,068
somebody who is not authorized is
trying to access your sensitive data.

3
00:00:09,068 --> 00:00:12,800
How can they attack,
if what's they're asked to attack or

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,079
what they're allowed to
attack is the authentication

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,130
part of whatever security
you have in your system.

6
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,660
So authentication is how you start.

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,290
So the target of the attacker here
is going to be how you authenticate.

8
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,000
In particular,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,260
what they're going to try to do is
defeat the authentication system.

10
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:36,880
So Eve is going to try to be successful
in authenticating herself as Alice.

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,520
In that case,

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,098
you would have successfully
compromised the authentication method.

13
00:00:41,098 --> 00:00:44,410
So we're going to do this threat
modeling saying well what can they do.

14
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,760
What can the bad guy or that hacker do.

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,890
Well, let's just sort of talk
about the password method.

16
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,120
So remember the password
method is something you know.

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,510
And we all know what passwords are.

18
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:01,910
So let's say passwords are being
used by users to login to a system.

19
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,720
What kind of threats do we
need to be concerned about?

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,590
Well, it's a secret that's
shared between you and

21
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,530
the system, well,
someone can try to guess that secret.

22
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,090
So one threat is the not
having good passwords

23
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,770
that can be easily guessed by attackers.

24
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,210
That's one threat we have
to be concerned about,

25
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,650
authentication that is
based on passwords.

26
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,040
So this is kind of interesting.

27
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,860
It really is not talking about, how can
you be a user, guess their password, or

28
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,380
steal their token.

29
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,080
But it's talking about
impersonating a real login program.

30
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,580
So think about you come in,

31
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:40,720
and we're talking with passwords,
you provide your password to the system.

32
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,860
How do you know you're really
talking to the system?

33
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,850
How do you know it's not a program
that is impersonating the system?

34
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:52,630
All it has to do depending on which
system you have, it has to display

35
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:56,760
login, call in, or something like that
for you to provide your login ID.

36
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,720
Or login name and
then it has to display password colon so

37
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,210
you can type your password, or
whatever the interface that you have.

38
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,120
The is a Trojan horse,

39
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,270
this a program that is impersonating
the system at the other end.

40
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,677
Then what this program is able to do is,
as you type your password,

41
00:02:16,677 --> 00:02:18,500
it'll be able to steal it.

42
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,040
So what's the last one?

43
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,980
We're talking about someone trying
to steal your password, isn't it?

44
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,300
If your computer is infected,

45
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:31,240
in particular if it is infected with
malicious software called keyloggers.

46
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,811
They are able to capture
the keys that you press,

47
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:37,335
you are going to provide your
password by pressing a bunch of keys.

48
00:02:37,335 --> 00:02:42,583
And so keylogger grabs your password,
okay, so if your are doing a password

49
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:47,425
method, bad guy has to get hold of
your password, so they become you.

50
00:02:47,425 --> 00:02:49,495
They can guess it, they can steal it,

51
00:02:49,495 --> 00:02:53,574
either using a piece of software that
fools you into believing that you're

52
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:56,760
giving your password to
the operating system.

53
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:02,280
Or it could run as the real login
program is running and steal these keys

54
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,180
that you press or the characters that
you press that make up your password.
