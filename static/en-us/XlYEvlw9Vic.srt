00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,460
Congratulations, you've finished lesson three.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,619
In this lesson, you used remotes to push changes up to GitHub and

3
00:00:05,619 --> 00:00:07,738
pulled down changes made by other people.

4
00:00:07,738 --> 00:00:10,850
You also got practice using pull request to collaborate with other people.

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,380
This is also the end of the course.

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,380
We hope you enjoyed it.

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,880
We certainly had fun making it.

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,230
What was your favorite part about making the course, Sarah?

9
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,380
>> Oh, I really enjoyed thinking about how all the concepts fit together, so

10
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,566
we could draw the concept map.

11
00:00:22,566 --> 00:00:23,854
What about you?

12
00:00:23,854 --> 00:00:25,053
>> Hm.

13
00:00:25,053 --> 00:00:26,320
It's a tough question.

14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,740
But I really enjoyed adding color to the Asteroids game.

15
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,310
I was so excited when I got that working.

16
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,810
>> What about you guys?

17
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:33,920
What did you like about the course?

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,980
Or what do you wish that we had done differently?

19
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,360
Go to the forums to tell us what you think.

20
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,670
>> Thanks again for joining us.

21
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,300
And remember to use Git on your next project.
