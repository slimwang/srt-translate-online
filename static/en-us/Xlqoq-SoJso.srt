1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,439
Before you submit your cover letter,

2
00:00:02,439 --> 00:00:04,910
remember to make sure
the formatting looks nice.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,240
Your goal here is to make your
letter as easy as possible for

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,560
a recruiter to read.

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,160
We recommend using clear,
professional fonts.

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,030
And do not cram a bunch of
words into a small space.

7
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:17,750
When you have a lot to say,
I understand the urge to

8
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,660
decrease the size of your margins or
font size to fit in more words.

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,589
Doing this may not help you.

10
00:00:23,589 --> 00:00:27,670
Your letter may look like a long essay
that the recruiter may not want to read.

11
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,010
Use standard or 1 inch margins.

12
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,130
I also recommend you align all
paragraphs to the left of the page, or

13
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,480
justify them to show structure.

14
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:36,359
Beyond the font and

15
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:40,219
spacing of your cover letter, you also
want include the following elements.

16
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:44,649
Include the date, month day and year,
in the upper right or left hand corner.

17
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:46,969
Include a formal address in your letter.

18
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:49,750
This should be to the recruiter
if the name is available.

19
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,770
If the name is not available,
writing dear engineering team,

20
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,570
depending on the team
you'd be working on.

21
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,890
Or dear recruiting team works too.

22
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,329
Be sure to include a formal
closing salutation,

23
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:02,195
such as regards Sebastian Thrun.

24
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,680
Lastly, I also recommend using
the same header you have for

25
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,900
your resume to be a header
in your cover letter.

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,010
This shows consistency and
looks really nice.
