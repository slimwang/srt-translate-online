1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,560
Wow, I really gave you a piece
of lousy code there, didn't I?

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,050
But you cleaned that code up.

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,230
You learned about sanitizing user data,
and

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,125
you picked up a couple more SQL
statements on the way, awesome.

5
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:11,540
In the next lesson,

6
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,250
we'll talk about something that
we've kind of skipped over so

7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,600
far, creating tables, and declaring the
data types and relationships in them.

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,980
So you can build your
own tables from scratch.

9
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,480
See you then.
