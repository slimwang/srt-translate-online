Here's another chance to practice your loop skills. Imagine you have a friend

2
00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:06,696
who's collecting data on climate change, and he has a data set of how much the

3
00:00:06,696 --> 00:00:11,395
water in a reservoir rises and falls each year. If the water level rises, he

4
00:00:11,395 --> 00:00:16,430
records a positive number, and if it falls, he records a negative number.

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,875
Starting from here, write a program that prompts the user for a value until the

6
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:24,961
user enters queue, and counts how many times the user enters a negative number.

7
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:28,377
If you're not sure how to start, we've linked another fact sheet with some

8
00:00:28,377 --> 00:00:33,770
pseudo-code for loops with different purposes. You can use it as a guide.
