00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,434
We've seen what a negative exponent does to something in the numerator, it moves

2
00:00:04,434 --> 00:00:08,546
the base to the denominator. So if a negative exponent moves something in the

3
00:00:08,546 --> 00:00:12,633
numerator to the denominator, then a negative exponent in the denominator must

4
00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:16,792
move that to the numerator. When we first saw negative exponents, we learned

5
00:00:16,792 --> 00:00:21,082
that a base raised to a negative exponent, would be the reciprocal of that base

6
00:00:21,082 --> 00:00:25,611
raised to its positive exponent. This can also work in the opposite way, like if

7
00:00:25,611 --> 00:00:30,353
we have a negative exponent in the denominator. A negative exponent indicates to

8
00:00:30,353 --> 00:00:34,769
write the reciprocal of the base to the positive power, so I have 1 divided by 1

9
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:39,173
4th, the reciprocal of 4, squared, I change the negative to positive. I know

10
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:43,382
dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by a reciprocal, so I can

11
00:00:43,382 --> 00:00:47,610
rewrite this expression as 1 times 4 squared. And again, notice a negative

12
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,702
exponent in the denominator, moves the base to the numerator with its positive

13
00:00:51,702 --> 00:00:55,783
exponent. We can use the same reasoning with variables. I see a negative

14
00:00:55,783 --> 00:01:00,135
exponent in the denominator, so I know that this base is going to wind up with a

15
00:01:00,135 --> 00:01:04,535
positive power in the numerator, y to the 5th. For this last one we want to be

16
00:01:04,535 --> 00:01:08,866
careful, 5 has an exponent of 1, and x has an exponent of negative 4, so only

17
00:01:08,866 --> 00:01:13,301
the x term is moved to the numerator. When we handle this negative exponent, we

18
00:01:13,301 --> 00:01:17,656
rewrite our expression as x to the 4th divided by 5. In general here's the rule

19
00:01:17,656 --> 00:01:21,890
we can write for base raised to a negative exponent that appears in the

20
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:26,815
denominator, we simply write it in the numerator, with its positive exponent.
