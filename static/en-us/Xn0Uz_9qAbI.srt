1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,930
We're going to be building this app
in stages across four lessons in

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:04,170
this course.

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,710
And we'll come back to this course map
periodically to track our progress.

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:08,370
In lesson one we're

5
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,432
going to learn about how to show
multiple screens in your app.

6
00:00:10,432 --> 00:00:14,720
We're going to leave the other screens
blank temporarily and dive into

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,440
the fundamentals of how Android
handles user touch events in your app.

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,050
So in lesson two, we're going to
display a list of words in the app.

9
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,310
We'll show the English and
Miwok translations for each word.

10
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,130
And this involves
learning about arrays and

11
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,360
lists, which are Java data
structures to store data in our app.

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,200
Then in lesson three,
we're going to improve upon the list, so

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,730
we can show images in
the lists alongside each word.

14
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,790
Once this functionality works,
we're going to make visual changes.

15
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,580
Color, font style, spacing so

16
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,708
that the app looks more like
the design marks we are given.

17
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:49,420
In Lesson four, we're going to add
the play icon to each list item and

18
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,760
learn about the media player in Android.

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,910
So we had Andrew record audio files
on how to pronounce each MiWok word.

20
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,780
So we'll play each MP3 file when
the user clicks on a list item.

21
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,980
And at this point,
we have a fully functioning app.

22
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:03,730
As we mentioned earlier,

23
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,240
there are many ways to build this MiWok
language app, so we want to show you

24
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,070
another way to modify the app to
have a different navigation flow.

25
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,380
In lesson five, we'll integrate all four
lists of vocabulary words into a single

26
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,380
activity, made of four different
fragments that you can swipe through.

27
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,300
There are also tabs across the top, and

28
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,120
this is a common pattern in Android apps
that we thought you might find useful.

29
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,620
For example,
the Google Play store uses this design

30
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,080
when allowing users to
browse through apps.

31
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,710
So while the focus of this course is
on building a MiWok language app,

32
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,750
the skills you learn here can easily
be transferred to any other app.

33
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,782
By the end of this course, you'll know
how to create a app with multiple

34
00:01:40,782 --> 00:01:45,010
screens, display lists of data,
play audio files, and

35
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:48,050
you'll become more comfortable with
Java oriented programming concepts.

36
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,340
These fundamentals will help you
build more complex Android apps

37
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,990
with even better user experiences.
