1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,100
So that's everything you need to know
to get started with playing audio on

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,290
Android Auto.

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,750
The Android Media Framework is
used not just in Android Auto, but

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,340
in Android in general,
as well as Android Wear.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,590
So by investing your time into this,
you get other platforms for free.

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:19,820
By exposing the media in your app to
Android Auto, the user is able search

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,970
and browse through the available content
using their voice or the touch screen.

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,710
Android Auto takes care of all the work
of presenting the interface to the user,

9
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,980
saving you time in building
user interface for cars.

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,390
So I'm looking forward to seeing what
kinds of cool music apps you build for

11
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,410
Android Auto.

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,094
I'll see you on the road.
