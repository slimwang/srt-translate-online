00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay. Now one thing to note here is we have our radio buttons

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and how is the user to know which is which?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
They're just 3 anonymous radio buttons.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Well, that is what the element is for,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and I'll show you how to use that in our Editor.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So to give the user a sense of what they're clicking on,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
rather than just clicking on random dots,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
we're going to use the element--and it looks something like this.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'll add the element to each of these inputs.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So I've added one element.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The elements stay the same for this first one.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I wrapped it in a element that also has the text, "One" in it.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This will cause the word "One" to appear next to the radio button.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'll go ahead and add it on these other two as well.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Okay. So I surrounded our other two s with a element.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I added some line breaks in here

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
so it's a little bit easier to read,

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
but all that's really changed is I've added

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
opening , a closing , and then some text to each one of these.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Let's see how this looks in the browser.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
When I load this in the browser, now we can see

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
the labels before our radio buttons.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And so when I select one of them--"One", "Two", "Three"--

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
that makes it easier so the user can see what they're actually doing.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You know--you give the radio buttons a label.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And when I click Submit, as we expected:

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
q-three in the URL.

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Now, of course, the label doesn't have to match the value of the radio button

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
but, generally, they're closely related.
