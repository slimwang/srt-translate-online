Here's a different system of equations. The coefficients to the x are different,

2
00:00:04,709 --> 00:00:09,285
and the coefficients for y are different. Hm, so what could we do? Well, we can

3
00:00:09,285 --> 00:00:13,908
actually use the properties of equality to change one of these equations or both

4
00:00:13,908 --> 00:00:18,385
of them. Here's what I mean. I can think about changing the second equation by

5
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:23,232
multiplying it by a positive 2. When I do that I distribute this 2 to each of

6
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:28,234
the terms, 2 times 3x is 6x, 2 times negative 4y is negative 8y and 2 times 10

7
00:00:28,234 --> 00:00:33,245
is 20. Make sure that you distribute this number to each term. So I know this

8
00:00:33,245 --> 00:00:38,500
green equation is the same as this equation, it's been multiplied by 2. So I've

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,700
rewritten my system of equation here, and notice the y variables have the same

10
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:49,080
coefficient and opposite signs. This is great. Now using our elimination method,

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,819
I want you to solve this system. You can put your answer here.
