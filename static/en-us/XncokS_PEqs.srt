Now we should take a little break for some self-promotion. Always a good idea.

00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,592
Now what I mean self-promotion is that name of the first input to a method, the

3
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:13,900
one that's bound to an object that is created, should always be called self.

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,404
There's nothing magic about self. It's just a name, and it's just a convention

5
00:00:17,404 --> 00:00:22,034
to use that name. And in this case, it's a good idea to follow that convention.

6
00:00:22,035 --> 00:00:28,112
Save your creativity for, new code in other ways. So I'll change the name, here

7
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:29,093
to be self.
