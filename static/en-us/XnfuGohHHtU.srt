00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,735
Now that we have our observed and expected values, let's calculate the

2
00:00:03,735 --> 00:00:09,910
chi-squared statistic. Remember that this is the sum of each observed frequency

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:16,720
minus each expected frequency squared divided by the expected frequency. Since

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,120
we're squaring this, it doesn't really matter which order we do the

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,170
subtraction. We could subtract the observed frequency from the expected

6
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:29,600
frequency instead. Anyway, go ahead and calculate this. You have 6 observed

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,740
frequencies, and 6 corresponding expected frequencies.
