00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,920
Take a look at this code and

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,720
tell me which text would print first,
tic or tac?

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,080
Let's take a look at it first.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,568
In the first line, we create a queue
of the highest priority possible.

5
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:19,650
Then, with dispatch_async we add
a block which prints tic to this queue,

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,310
and then we call print("tac").

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,900
Which one do you think
it will run first?
