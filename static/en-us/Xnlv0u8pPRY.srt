00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,801
The next question, actually, is about
why databases are so attractive,

2
00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:07,887
or why they are attractive targets for
hackers.

3
00:00:07,887 --> 00:00:09,960
There are a couple of different options.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,230
And you should think about each and
mark if you think that is a good reason

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:20,390
that would explain what makes a database
highly attractive to malicious hackers.
