1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,350
We're going to take a little break from
the lesson to become a bit more familiar

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:04,670
with Alteryx.

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:08,280
Since we'll be using Alteryx for a good
part of this course to demonstrate how

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,270
to build an analytic data set,
let's explore some basic capabilities so

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:17,190
that when you go to use it, you're
a little more comfortable with the tool.

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,860
We're first going to get familiar
with how to bring data into Alteryx.

7
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,320
To start, I'm going to simply
click on the Input Data tool, and

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,280
drop it onto the canvas.

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,470
Next I'll click over to
the Configuration window, and

10
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,170
then to the drop-down arrow,
and choose File Browse.

11
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,840
From here you can see the various file
types supported by the Alteryx software.

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,185
Next I'm going to navigate to where
the sample data is located for

13
00:00:41,185 --> 00:00:44,580
Alteryx, choose a file,
click on Open, and

14
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:49,670
then choose the sheet that
says Output$ and then OK.

15
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,520
We can see the data on the left
in the preview window, and

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,030
the file is now opened in Alteryx.

17
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,050
Now that we know how to open a file in
Alterxy, let's look at a few additional

18
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:03,410
functionalities that will allow us
to explore the data file further.

19
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,050
Let's practice building
a work flow in Alteryx.

20
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:10,000
Let's say your boss asks you to tell her
how many customers are in the Denver

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,390
market.

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,000
As a start, it'd be interesting to know
how many records total are in the file.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,740
This can be done really easily
by simply running the work flow.

24
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,350
We do this by clicking
on the Play button, or

25
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,800
hitting Ctrl+R on the keyboard.

26
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,640
Once the workflow is run,
we can navigate to the Results window,

27
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:36,010
click on the Messages icon, and see that
2669 records were read in from the file.

28
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:41,990
By clicking on the Output icon, we can
see the data and the fields in the file.

29
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,160
But our boss is only interested
in analyzing the customers

30
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,730
who are in Denver.

31
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:50,910
We can use the Filter tool to isolate
these customers out of the larger data

32
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,010
set.

33
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,690
We pull the Filter tool
onto the canvas and

34
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,000
select the City field
in the Basic Filter.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,870
In the box to the right of equals,
we enter Denver.

36
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:07,500
The Filter tool has two outputs, a T,
or true, side and an F, or false, side.

37
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,900
The true side outputs the records where
the expression evaluated to true.

38
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,690
So these are the records
where the city is Denver.

39
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,099
There are 1166 records in that list.

40
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:22,724
If you click on the false side,
you can see the rest of the records for

41
00:02:22,724 --> 00:02:23,750
the other cities.
