1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,770
>> So let's look at a concrete example, where

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,579
the hypothesis space is the set of intervals. So the

3
00:00:05,579 --> 00:00:08,160
inputs that we are trying to learn about are

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,560
just single numbers on the real line. And the hypothesis

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,120
space is this set of functions that return true

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,510
for all the things that are between a and b,

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,270
and this is parameterized by a and b. So

8
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,920
how many different hypotheses are there in our class here?

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,370
>> At least 2.

10
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,790
>> Sure. How about how many are there in the class?

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,750
>> There's an infinite number of them.

12
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,110
>> That's right. So, so this is one of these situations

13
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,270
where it's going to be really helpful to apply the notion

14
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,220
of VC dimension if we think we'd like to be able

15
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,390
to learn from a finite set of data. Which, you know, generally

16
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,250
we like that. So how do we figure out what the

17
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,530
VC dimension is? We want to know, what is the largest set

18
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,580
of inputs that we can label in all possible ways, using

19
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,720
hypotheses from H. Alright, so, I want you to figure that out.

20
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,040
Figure out the, the largest, the size of the

21
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,730
largest set that we can shatter, that we can label

22
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,020
in all possible ways using these hypotheses. And then just,

23
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,380
you know, write it as an integer in this box.

24
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,050
>> Cool.
