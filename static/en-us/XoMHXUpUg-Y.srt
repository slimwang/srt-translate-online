1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,034
Now since i is just another number, like all other numbers i to the 0 power is

2
00:00:05,034 --> 00:00:10,033
just equal to 1. This may seem a little bit funny, because 1 is a real number.

3
00:00:10,033 --> 00:00:14,827
But I think this is more a testament to the fact that i and all other imaginary

4
00:00:14,827 --> 00:00:19,311
numbers are in fact numbers, i to the first power is just i, i squared is i

5
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:24,301
times itself. Which means we're multiplying the square root of negative 1 times

6
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:28,992
the square root of negative 1, that should just give us negative 1. Now i cubed

7
00:00:28,992 --> 00:00:32,902
is going to be i squared times i. So we have negative 1 times i which is

8
00:00:32,902 --> 00:00:37,421
negative i. Interesting. So we only have ones and i's, the positive and negative

9
00:00:37,421 --> 00:00:41,749
versions over here. Let's see what happens in this column, i to the fourth

10
00:00:41,749 --> 00:00:46,448
should be i to the third times i again. That means we're multiplying the square

11
00:00:46,448 --> 00:00:50,909
root of negative 1 by itself and then taking the negative of that number. So

12
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:55,815
this is negative, negative 1, which is just equal to 1. But that's funny, that's

13
00:00:55,815 --> 00:01:00,205
the same as i to the 0, i to the 5th is i to the 4th times i. So 1 times i which

14
00:01:00,205 --> 00:01:04,313
is i again. That's the same as i to the first. And we can see the pattern

15
00:01:04,313 --> 00:01:08,786
continues for i to the sixth and i to the seventh, so it seems like when we take

16
00:01:08,786 --> 00:01:13,279
powers of i, the numbers that they're equal to alternate in a cyclic way. We go

17
00:01:13,279 --> 00:01:16,418
from 1 to i to negative 1 to negative i back to 1 and so on. I think this

18
00:01:16,418 --> 00:01:20,696
pattern is really interesting, and keeping this in mind is going to help us

19
00:01:20,696 --> 00:01:24,928
remember the relationship between real numbers and imaginary numbers.
