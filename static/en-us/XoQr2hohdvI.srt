00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,769
You've seen how important it is to visualize data sets with histograms, in order

2
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:08,930
to analyze the shape. We want to analyze the shape so that we can think

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:13,731
critically about the mean, median and mode to describe the data set. In a skewed

4
00:00:13,731 --> 00:00:18,517
distribution, the mean, median and mode differ from each other. And the median

5
00:00:18,517 --> 00:00:22,967
might be more useful than the mean in a lot of ways. In a normal distribution

6
00:00:22,967 --> 00:00:27,575
The mean, median, and mode are approximately equal. What else is important about

7
00:00:27,575 --> 00:00:31,975
knowing the shape of a distribution? Let's explore this question with a story.

8
00:00:31,975 --> 00:00:35,880
I've played chess my whole life. I learned when I was four, and started

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,410
competing in tournaments when I was seven. There are three things I could tell

10
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,747
you about my chess abilities. The first is my rating in chess, which all

11
00:00:44,747 --> 00:00:49,516
competitive players have, my ratings 1800. Another thing I could tell you, is

12
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:54,407
that among competitive American chess players, I come in 8,110th place, this is

13
00:00:54,407 --> 00:00:58,678
base on rating. And the third, is that I rank higher than 88% of American

14
00:00:58,678 --> 00:01:03,450
competitive chess players. Which one of these gives you the best sense, of how

15
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:08,034
good I am at chess? For most of you, you won't know what a rating is, but if you

16
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:12,743
do, pretend like you don't and you're hearing this term for the first time. So

17
00:01:12,743 --> 00:01:17,488
for the purposes of the quiz, if you knew nothing about chess, What would be the

18
00:01:17,488 --> 00:01:19,736
best metric to tell you how good I am?
