1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,115
The final answer we get when multiplying these complex numbers together is

2
00:00:05,115 --> 00:00:10,116
negative 7 plus 22i. So how do we get this? Well, as before, we need to make

3
00:00:10,116 --> 00:00:15,446
sure each term in the first set of parenthesis is multiplied by each term in the

4
00:00:15,446 --> 00:00:20,706
second set of parenthesis. So we start with 4 and multiply it by 2. And then

5
00:00:20,706 --> 00:00:24,931
also by 3i. And then we take 5i and multiply it by 2 and then by 3i as well.

6
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:29,417
Then we just need to simplify it within each of these terms over here, combine

7
00:00:29,417 --> 00:00:33,914
like terms and come up with our final answer. I think the trickiest thing here

8
00:00:33,914 --> 00:00:38,489
is thinking about these middle terms and thinking about the final term. We can

9
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:43,782
see here that multiplication involving imaginary numbers Works in pretty much

10
00:00:43,782 --> 00:00:49,147
the same that working with real numbers and variables does. We have 4 times 3i,

11
00:00:49,147 --> 00:00:54,314
the 4 multiplies the 3 to make 12. And then the i is still a factor,so it's

12
00:00:54,314 --> 00:00:59,819
multiplied in as well. 5i times 3i is just 5 times 3 times i times i or 15 times

13
00:00:59,819 --> 00:01:02,180
i squared, which is negative 1.
