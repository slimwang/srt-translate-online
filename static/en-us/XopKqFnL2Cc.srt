1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,680
All right, so to finish up the lesson.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,950
Besides prospective projection, there are other types of projection operators

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:11,970
which in fact are sort of special cases and they're used sometimes.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,860
So they're, they're worth mentioning here.

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,270
One interesting form of

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,770
special case of perspective projection is called orthographic.

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:25,110
And as it's drawn here, basically orthographic is when I take my world and

8
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,340
I just smash it right into my image plane.

9
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,530
And what's interesting about that is that it actually can be thought of

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,900
as a special case of perspective projection.

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,100
But where the distance from the center of projection to the image

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,790
plane is infinite.

13
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,810
And my object is infinite, right?

14
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:45,905
If those both were sort of infinite then basically what I end up doing is the z

15
00:00:45,905 --> 00:00:49,035
value doesn't matter because those rays are parallel.

16
00:00:49,035 --> 00:00:53,088
So that's why this is also called parallel projection and so

17
00:00:53,088 --> 00:00:55,820
xyz just gets moved to xy.

18
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,270
This is actually some times used as a model for telephoto lens.

19
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,580
Because telephoto lenses are looking at things very, very far away.

20
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,640
So all of your rays are almost exactly parallel.

21
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,020
Now of course, it has to be scaled so you end up scaling the x and

22
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,360
scaling the y.

23
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,490
But it's the same scale value for your whole world.

24
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,720
I mention that, because we're going to

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,710
talk about something called weak perspective, in a minute.

26
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,380
So basically, when you throw away the z value and then you just scale the x and

27
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,810
y by some number, that's this parallel projection.

28
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,750
And since it can be, since I said it was a special case of

29
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:34,560
perspective projection, there must be a matrix operation that would recover it.

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,150
And here it is.

31
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,320
And you'll notice, now, that this value is zero, okay?

32
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,230
And this value is one.

33
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,070
So x, y, z one, the matrix just equals x, y one.

34
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,620
And when you divide out by the one, you just get the x, y.

35
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:54,760
So even this orthographic projection can be represented as the same matrix,

36
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,900
as a matrix multiplication when we use homogenous coordinates.

37
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,840
Another model is called weak perspective.

38
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,570
Sometimes called scaled orthographic but I, that's a bad choice.

39
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,840
There's also something called power perspective but

40
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,550
what we're going to call weak perspective is following.

41
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:14,000
The idea is that we know that when things get further away,

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,820
they're going to get smaller.

43
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:20,250
But what we're going to do is, we're going to say that all the points on

44
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,780
a given object, we're going to assume they're all at, at some constant depth.

45
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,180
We'll say z0 as it's written here.

46
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:26,810
Okay?

47
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:31,507
So for all the points on that object, xyz will get mapped to,

48
00:02:31,507 --> 00:02:33,550
fx over z0, fy over z0.

49
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,250
So that object will get scaled.

50
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,380
But some other object,

51
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:42,450
might be a significantly closer object, it will get scaled by a different value.

52
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:47,370
So basically in weak perspective, what we're saying is that the difference of

53
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,730
depth over an object or over the range of an object, is very small compared

54
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:56,330
to the difference in depth from the object to the center of projection.

55
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,230
And if that's true,

56
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,300
then you can basically say that each object has its own scale factor.

57
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,190
Of course, as a special case of perspective projection,

58
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:07,510
we can do this in a matrix form also.

59
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,790
So, here we have the equation or, or

60
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:15,350
the transformation we said before, x, y, z goes to fx over z0, fy over z0.

61
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:21,060
So basically, f over z0 is acting like a scale factor, okay?

62
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,730
So here we have our projection matrix, which now,

63
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:28,390
instead of having a one over here, has a one over s.

64
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,830
And then when I multiply that through on the homogenous coordinates and

65
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:35,250
then divide, I'm dividing by the 1 over s, which gives me sx, sy.

66
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:40,280
So weak perspective gives you this scaled effect of each collection of

67
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,120
points that sit on a given object.

68
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,630
So those are the three camera projections that we'll talk about.

69
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,090
The one that we'll use all the time is perspective,

70
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,750
which ends up giving you fx over z, fy over z.

71
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,340
And we showed you how to do it in matrix coordinates using

72
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,210
homogeneous coordinate system.

73
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,540
And then we also talked about weak perspective where you have a scale factor,

74
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,150
sort of, per object.

75
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,350
Or orthographic, where you basically just throw away the z value.
