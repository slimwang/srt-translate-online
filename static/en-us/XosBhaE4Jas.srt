00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,785
This is actually pretty easy when you get down to it. First off we check

2
00:00:02,785 --> 00:00:06,120
whether or not physics body exists for this object. If it does, we continue

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,242
forward by calling GetPosition object. And then caching it so that we can

4
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:13,190
render with it later. Note that the position object has an x and y parameters

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:17,132
to it. Which identically matches the x and y parameters in the vector given to

6
00:00:17,132 --> 00:00:21,216
us from the collision system. Having these two match up, allows us to pass

7
00:00:21,216 --> 00:00:24,480
positions and vectors back and forth between the physics engine and our game

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,530
code quite easily.
