1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,750
We did also look before about how the
cones are not evenly distributed, right?

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,445
There are many, many more red and
green ones than there are blue ones,

3
00:00:08,445 --> 00:00:09,917
remember we were talking about that?

4
00:00:09,917 --> 00:00:13,290
And we see that most of your color
vision is based just upon the ratio

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,664
between the red and the green, and
the blue is just there to give you

6
00:00:16,664 --> 00:00:19,434
a little bit of,
sort of sensitivity to blue, but

7
00:00:19,434 --> 00:00:23,160
you don't really have high
resolution in the blue channel.

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,340
If you were to take a look in your eye,
well,

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,110
not your eye because this
has to be a dead eye.

10
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,030
So, some other eye, or
your eye after you're dead.

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,860
If you want to donate your eye when
you're done just send Megan a postcard.

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,540
If you peal the retina out and
you stick it under electron micrograph,

13
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,000
if you take a look at that,
you'd see two,

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,320
you'd see that as you moved along
the eye it was not the same everywhere.

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,690
In the middle, which is the area
referred to as a 'fovea', about one and

16
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,650
a half, degrees,

17
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,360
you see this magnificent hexagonal
packing of photo receptors, okay?

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,260
So, hexagonal pack, so i, if you will,

19
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,140
the pixels in the human eye are not on
square grid, but they are on a grid.

20
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,239
They're on a hexagonally packed grid,
and

21
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,550
the regularity of this is
pretty remarkable, right?

22
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,520
I mean, it, it, it gives you a very
good sampling, a ve, very dense and

23
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,140
regular sampling of
the underlying visual field.

24
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,990
Which is one of the reasons that you
have such good high resolution up here

25
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,960
and really lousy resolution out here.

26
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,090
You see, so
I'm looking straight at Megan, wake up.

27
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:24,920
Okay, good.

28
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,790
So I'm looking at, I can't really
tell how many fingers I'm holding up.

29
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,390
I mean, I happen to know, of course,
because they're my fingers.

30
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,620
So I can tell there's seven of them,
but or, whatever.

31
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,260
But I can't, if you do that
yourself just do it this way.

32
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,100
If you want to have a partner, look,
look them straight in the eye and

33
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,130
have them bring their, their fingers in.

34
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,490
You'll see their fingers are there.

35
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,980
You can have them wiggle them, but
if you, if they ask you how many fingers

36
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,340
are they holding up, you cant really
tell until it gets pretty close.

37
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,130
And yet, you feel like you got all
this high resolution vision out here.

38
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,240
That's an illusion that your
brain is creating for you,

39
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,260
out here in your periphery you just have
good sensitivity in motion, in fact,

40
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,190
wiggle your fingers you'll,
you'll see them right away.

41
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,220
Why might you want to do that?

42
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,820
Well, maybe you want to
saccade your eyes over there.

43
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,740
So, the system is very good at
detecting motion in the periphery, and

44
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,950
controlling the eye to look at it and
foveating on what's there.

45
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,630
But you actually only have high
resolution in this very small area.

46
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:26,150
In the periphery, as shown here,
you have a few large cones.

47
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,850
So, the cones are actually big.

48
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,790
And they're giving you
overall color information.

49
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,670
And then you have this high density,
again, of rods so,

50
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,940
with low levels of illumination,
you can still see out really well.

51
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,350
There, let's take
a look at this picture.

52
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:42,130
So this picture is degrees from center,
so

53
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:45,550
temporal is off to the side,
nasal is towards the nose.

54
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:49,800
And the first thing you'll see is
that you've got all these cones

55
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,480
that are mostly in the middle,
in the fovea.

56
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,660
That's exactly what we said.

57
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,450
Notice, the same way we have
rods out here in the periphery,

58
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,900
notice you don't have
any rods in your fovea.

59
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,050
Over here's your blind spot, right?

60
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,000
You don't have anything there.

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,030
That's why it's blind.

62
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,990
So, what would one of the implications
be of having no cone,

63
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,210
no rods in your fovea?

64
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:13,360
It would mean that you don't have very
good low light perception in your fovea.

65
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,270
And here's another
experiment you can do.

66
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,290
Some night, go outside when
there's a bunch of stars,

67
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:21,050
some that are really bright,
some that are less bright.

68
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,560
See if you can find a star that's less
bright that stays there 'til you look at

69
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,440
it, and when you look at it directly,
it disappears.

70
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,820
And that's because your fovea can't
see the low light that your rods do.
