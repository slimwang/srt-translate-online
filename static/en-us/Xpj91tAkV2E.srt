00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,906
>> As much as we've talked about Grant, we haven't talked about his actual

2
00:00:03,906 --> 00:00:08,365
product that much. I think it's time that we discuss some of the specifics of

3
00:00:08,365 --> 00:00:13,050
wiper blade engineering. Now in general, Grant aims to have his wiper blades be

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,506
exactly 2.5 centimeters long. Please note that this drawing is not to scale.

5
00:00:17,506 --> 00:00:22,076
However, in the manufacturing process things aren't perfect. To acknowledge

6
00:00:22,076 --> 00:00:26,613
that, Grant has created a tolerance range that wiper length is allowed to meet.

7
00:00:26,613 --> 00:00:31,133
As long as the wiper is within 3 millimeters of this total length, either 3

8
00:00:31,133 --> 00:00:36,165
millimeters longer or 3 millimeters shorter, then it's acceptable and can be put

9
00:00:36,165 --> 00:00:40,743
on the market. Let's call the blade length in centimeters of a given wiper x.

10
00:00:40,743 --> 00:00:45,532
What we're really concerned with then, is the difference between x, the blade

11
00:00:45,532 --> 00:00:50,217
length, and 2.5 centimeters, the target blade length. If x is longer than 2.5

12
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:54,832
centimeters, then you want the difference between x and 2.5 centimeters to be

13
00:00:54,832 --> 00:00:59,255
less than or equal to 0.3 centimeters, which is the same as 3 millimeters.

14
00:00:59,255 --> 00:01:04,096
However if x is shorter than 2.5 centimeters, then you want the difference

15
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:09,049
between x and 2.5 to be greater than or equal to negative 0.3. Since x could be

16
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:13,933
something like 2.4, if it's shorter, and 2.4 minus 2.5 is negative 0.1, which is

17
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:18,579
greater than or equal to negative point 3. Taking into account all the possible

18
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:22,986
values of x, we want both of these things to be true. So, we need to insert an

19
00:01:22,986 --> 00:01:28,252
and between these two values. If we were to show this range of values for x

20
00:01:28,252 --> 00:01:34,140
minus 2.5 on a number line, you would get this. The region is, just like shown

21
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,758
in our inequalities, symmetric about zero.
