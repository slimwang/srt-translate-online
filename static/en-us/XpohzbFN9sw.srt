1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,430
Now here's a safe parallelization
of the matrix vector multiply,

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:08,590
that essentially just replaces for
I with a parfor.

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,130
We'll leave the inner most loop alone.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,630
Now the work is n squared.

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,540
My question to you is, What is the span?

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,570
Your choices are constant time, log
time, linear time, and long n time, or

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,440
n squared time.
