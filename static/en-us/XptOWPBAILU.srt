1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,200
What do you think about this David?

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,180
>> So starting with Roomba,
I would put Roomba in the bottom left.

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,939
It definitely acts in the world.

4
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:08,540
But it definitely doesn't act like I do.

5
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,680
It crisscrosses across the floor
until it vacuums everything up.

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,535
So we're going to say
that's acting optimally.

7
00:00:13,535 --> 00:00:17,720
C-3PO is fluent in over 6
million forms of communication.

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,790
And that means that it interacts with
human and other species very often.

9
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,870
In order to do that, it has to
understand natural sentences and

10
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,330
put its own knowledge back
into natural sentences.

11
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,120
So, it has to act like humans.

12
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,090
Apple's virtual assistant,
Siri, doesn't act in the world.

13
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,530
So she is more on the thinking
end of the spectrum but,

14
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,270
like C-3PO,
she has to interact with humans.

15
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,720
She has to read human sentences and

16
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,230
she has to put her own responses
back into normal vernacular.

17
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,480
So we're going to say that
she thinks like humans.

18
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,140
Google Maps plots your route from
your origin to your destination.

19
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,510
So it's definitely doing thinking,
it's not doing any acting in the world.

20
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,340
But we don't really care if it does
the route planning like we would do it.

21
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,520
So we would say it does its
route planning optimally.

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,480
It takes into consideration traffic.

23
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,584
Current construction,
different things like that,

24
00:01:03,584 --> 00:01:06,920
where we would probably think of
the routes we have taken in the past.

25
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,650
So Google Maps thinks optimally.

26
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,880
>> That is a good answer David,
I agree with you, but not here that

27
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,120
some aspects of Siri, may well belong
in some of the other quadrants.

28
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,080
So, putting under 3 sounds plausible.

29
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,100
But Siri might also be viewed as,

30
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,400
perhaps, acting when it
gives you a response.

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,550
Siri, some aspects of Siri might also be
optimal, not necessarily like humans.

32
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,970
>> So if you'd like to discuss where
these technologies belong on these

33
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:38,190
spectrums or, perhaps, discuss where
some other AI technologies that you're

34
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:41,780
familiar with belong on these spectrums,
feel free to head on over to our forums

35
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,780
where you can bring up your own
technologies and discuss the different ways

36
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,280
in which they fit into
the broader school of AI.
