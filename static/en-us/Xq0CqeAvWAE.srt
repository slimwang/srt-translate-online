00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:00,980
Hello.

2
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,760
My name is Kunal, and in this course,

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,439
we will answer one big question Android
developers answer all the time, and

4
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:11,600
that question is,
how do you use blank in Android?

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,350
For instance, how do you use
radio buttons, or grids, or maps?

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:16,600
And a whole bunch of different

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,780
components that
are available in Android.

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,880
Now if you think about it, developers
encountered this question all the time.

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,830
And in response what they will do,
is that they will conduct a search on

10
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,100
the internet,
read something like a blog or

11
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,290
some stack overflow page on how
you do something in Android.

12
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,600
And then they will try
that in their app.

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,800
We will follow a similar
approach in this course.

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,730
To be successful, you will need
the basics of Android programming.

15
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,558
We took those in the Android for
beginners course.

16
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:47,590
This is where, among other things,
we made the happy birthday app and

17
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,150
the Just Java app.

18
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,370
You may also recall
that in the Android For

19
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,660
Beginners course, we learned
about buttons and check boxes.

20
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,310
In this course, we will work with toggle
buttons, radio buttons, spinners, and

21
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,580
much more.

22
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,480
Here is how this course
is going to work.

23
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,060
For each of these interface elements
that you see on the screen here,

24
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,380
we found the best resource on
the Internet that teaches you

25
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,150
how to use them in your app.

26
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,930
So for toggle buttons,
we will link you to a tutorial.

27
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,500
For radio buttons,
we'll do the same thing.

28
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,280
And trust us, these links are good.

29
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,330
We know that because we've
used them ourselves.

30
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,460
Here's what we want you to do.

31
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,020
At the end of this video,

32
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,720
you will see a tutorial on how to
use toggle buttons in Android.

33
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,810
Follow the instructions
in that tutorial, and

34
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,100
learn how to implement toggle buttons
in an app that you build from scratch.

35
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,640
Once you're done with that, move on to
the tutorial for radio buttons and so

36
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,910
on so forth.

37
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,750
Also, each one of these links that
you're about to see will take you about

38
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,100
30 to 60 minutes to learn.

39
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,980
Once you do a few of these,
you will have mastered the process

40
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,590
experienced Android developers
follow every single day.

41
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,090
Let's begin.
