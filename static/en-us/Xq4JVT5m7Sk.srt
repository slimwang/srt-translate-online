1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,300
You can extend intent service to create
your own recommendation service.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,050
When you need to refresh
your recommendations,

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,640
invoke the service by sending an intent.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,070
Inside this method, we find items to
recommend from our Media Library.

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,210
This is just dummy code.

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,705
And of course you replace
it with something smarter.

7
00:00:14,705 --> 00:00:16,875
Once we have items to recommend,
here's where we'll

8
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:20,365
use our RecommendationBuilder
to construct the notifications.

9
00:00:20,365 --> 00:00:23,235
After they're constructed,
we'll post the notifications by calling

10
00:00:23,235 --> 00:00:25,880
the notification manager's
notifying method.

11
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,230
This part is important.

12
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,930
The first parameter is
the notification ID,

13
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,340
and you'll need to keep track of this.

14
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,470
It's required when we'd like to update
or dismiss an existing recommendation.

15
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,920
Later on, if you'd like to remove a
recommendation, you can do so by calling

16
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,270
the cancel method on the notification
manager with a notifications ID.

17
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,600
Here's a gotcha.

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,060
If you want to update a recommendation,
don't cancel and resend it.

19
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,110
This could cause the position
of your recommendation to

20
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:53,590
change on the recommendations row and
that could annoy users.

21
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,930
Instead update your recommendation.

22
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,340
To do so,
simply create a new notification and

23
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,160
issue it by calling the notification
manager, dot notify method,

24
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,789
with the same notification ID as the
recommendation you'd like to replace.

25
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,960
Earlier, we said we'd add a pending
intent to our notifications to take

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,470
the user directly to our content.

27
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:15,120
We construct that intent using
this build pending intent method.

28
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,020
This is pretty standard.

29
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,900
The most important part is to
keep track of the movie and

30
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,830
the notification id by
putting them in the bundle.

31
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,620
There's one last thing to do here.

32
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,290
Our Movie Details fragment is
the fragment that's actually going to

33
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,100
receive this intent.

34
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,780
We need to insure that it responds
properly when it receives the pending

35
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,800
intent as opposed to being started
up directly from the Android TV

36
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,210
home screen, or from a search activity.

37
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,150
To do so, we check for the pending
intent inside the onCreate method.

38
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,770
Now we have our intent service ready
to go, but how can we start it up?

39
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,460
One option is just to update
your recommendations when users

40
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,800
are using your app.

41
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,450
Alternatively, you can use
an AlarmManager to always update them in

42
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,760
the background.

43
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,800
That's our approach here and

44
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,900
we'll kick off that AlarmManager
when the TV boots up.

45
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,370
Let's head to the BootupActivity
to see how this is accomplished.

46
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,460
And by the way, this class really
should have been named BootupReceiver.

47
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,590
This is a typo and, hopefully,

48
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,479
we'll have it fixed by
the time you take this class.

49
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,880
To start it when an Android TV boots up,
we'll declared this intent filter.

50
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,480
Inside boot up activity we created an
alarm manager with a pending intent to

51
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,650
update our recommendations.

52
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,180
And here's a performance tip.

53
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,090
When you set alarms,

54
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,450
it's important to use set in exact
repeating instead of set repeating.

55
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,110
The former lets Android adjust
your delivery time slightly

56
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,549
to keep the device in sleep mode for
as long as possible.

57
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,520
This saves power and is especially
important on mobile devices.

58
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,960
Although it's still
counts on Android TV.

59
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,640
If you're like to learn more about
Android Performance Patterns, check out

60
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,040
the Android Performance Patterns
course linked in the instructor notes.

61
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,750
And that's all there is to it.

62
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,780
Remember that high quality
recommendations will

63
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,910
lead to more clicks.

64
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,760
And those will in turn lead to your
recommendations being featured more

65
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,110
prominently.

66
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,510
Also, please keep your
recommendations family safe.
