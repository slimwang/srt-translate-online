1
00:00:00,508 --> 00:00:04,120
So the Gaussian we just talked about is what's referred to as isotropic,

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,580
a fancy word for circularly symmetric.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,640
And so it basically had one parameter, just sigma, right?

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,860
Bigger sigma is, the more the blur.

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,510
But we have to implement these in digital computers.

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,520
We actually have to have a matrix, and so

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,430
then we have to worry about two things.

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,460
The size of the matrix, is the matrix three by three,

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,340
five by five, eleven by eleven?

10
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,550
And then the sigma that's represented within that.

11
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,260
So let me show you that first.

12
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,500
In Gaussian filters we talk about the variance, sigma squared of

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,400
the standard deviation of sigma, and that's the amount of smoothing.

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,043
So these two filters are the same size, they’re both 30 by 30s,

15
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:47,253
but the sigma inside one of them is two,

16
00:00:47,253 --> 00:00:53,020
the sigma inside the other one is five, so the five has a larger sigma.

17
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,180
Now sometimes we’ll make a mistake and say it’s a larger kernel.

18
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:57,780
When we say larger,

19
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,290
what we actually are talking about is the size of the sigma inside.

20
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,750
And we can distinguish that.

21
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,450
So here's an example of the size of the kernel.

22
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,600
So both of these kernels have a sigma of five, but one of them is

23
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,520
represented within a 10 by 10, and the other is represented within a 30 by 30.

24
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,420
Which one do you think is going to work better?

25
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,400
The bigger one, it's smoother, it's going to work better, okay.

26
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,710
And by the way, if somebody says, oh I, I smooth that with a bigger kernel.

27
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,910
They actually mean a bigger sigma.

28
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:35,530
That's what you care about, is the size of the sigma, not the actual kernel.

29
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,220
The kernel has to be big enough and then the sigma is, is within that.
