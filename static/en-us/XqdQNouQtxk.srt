00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,870
The app.route / line takes you
to the same page as visiting

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,670
the app.route /hello.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,880
If this is not present, we get a file
not found error in our browser.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,310
If we just visit the root of the site,
at localhost port 5000,

5
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:15,940
making it appear to the user that
a site does not exist at this address.

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:20,360
Decorators in python can be stacked one
on top of the other, so the app.route/,

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,650
will call the app./hello which
will call the HelloWorld function.

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,970
This is useful for having different
URLs all route to the same place.

9
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:32,759
Try visiting amazon.com and
amazon.com/index to see how their server

10
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,500
also handles routing different
URLs to the same home page.
