1
00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:04,109
You choose to implement this with a 32 x 32 block,

2
00:00:04,109 --> 00:00:06,380
and your boss comes running into your office

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:11,225
excitedly one day, saying NVIDIA is shipping a new GPU,

4
00:00:11,225 --> 00:00:17,887
and it has 4 times the storage per SM, 4 times the registers, and 4 times the shared memory.

5
00:00:17,887 --> 00:00:23,226
You know that your blur kernel is completely bound by global memory bandwidth,

6
00:00:23,226 --> 00:00:27,876
but now you know that you can run a kernel that's twice as big in both directions.

7
00:00:27,876 --> 00:00:33,684
So instead of 32 x 32, now it's 64 x 64.

8
00:00:33,684 --> 00:00:39,384
Express as a decimal what is the speed up of your program on this new GPU.

9
00:00:39,384 --> 00:00:43,647
Speed up reflects my program will run n times faster.

10
00:00:43,647 --> 00:00:47,647
Again ignore the bandwidth required for the blur kernel in the right back of v_new.
