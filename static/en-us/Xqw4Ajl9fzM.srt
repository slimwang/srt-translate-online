00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,730
We've just provided super user
access to the user student, but

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,630
if you remember, that user has
an extremely simple password.

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,990
The user themselves could reset their
password using the passwd command, but

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,220
you can't rely on that user to do so
all the time.

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:19,510
As a super user, you can foresee
users password to expire.

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:24,240
Use the man page and read through the
documentation for the passwd command.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,760
Enter the command that
you would use to force

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,730
the student user's password to expire.
