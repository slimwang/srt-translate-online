The answer is $900. Great work if you figured that one out. We know in our first

2
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:11,090
case we work 35 hours and we earn $630. For the second case we're going to work

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:15,108
50 hours but we don't know how much money we're going to get. So we'll use x for

4
00:00:15,108 --> 00:00:20,128
that income two. Next we want to multiply both sides of our equation by the

5
00:00:20,128 --> 00:00:25,680
lowest common denominator or 50 times x. So we'll be left with 35 times x on the

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,340
left and 630 times 50 on the right. Essentially when we do this we cross

7
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:36,710
multiply. We'll have x time 35 here, and 50 times 630 here. Finally, we divide

8
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:41,408
both sides by 35, and we get x is equal to 900. When you're problem solving, you

9
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:45,676
want to make sense of this number in the end. What were we solving for? Well we

10
00:00:45,676 --> 00:00:50,686
were wondering how much we could make, so that means we made $900. I know I

11
00:00:50,686 --> 00:00:54,158
included the unit here for you, but make sure you do that in your own problem

12
00:00:54,158 --> 00:00:56,323
solving and throughout the rest of your work.
