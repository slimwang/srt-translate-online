00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,960
Here is something to keep
in mind about the Softmax.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,370
Say you take all the scores and
multiply them by 10, what happens?

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:11,599
Do the probabilities get
close to either 0.0 or 1.0?

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,470
Or do the probabilities goes close
to the uniform distribution?
