1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The answer is 0.4. The way to think about this is thinking about how to choose the votes.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We have a hundred votes to begin with.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,000
There are four that the mixer cheats on, and the auditor is sampling 20 votes in this space.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
As long as the auditor picks one of the votes that was cheated on

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
then the mixer would be detected.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We can compute this by dividing the number of ways to choose without picking

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
any of the cheated votes--that's choosing out of the 96 noncheating votes--

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
divided by the total number of ways of choosing the votes.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
To solve this, we just need to compute 96 choose 20 divided by 100 choose 20.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Since the orders were cancelled out, they're 20 elements each time

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:57,000
this the same as computing 96 times 95 down to 77 divided by 100 down to 81.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We had cancelled things out and compute this by hand. We could just compute it all in Python.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Here's a procedure to compute the product of the list remembering to multiply by 1 point

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
to turn this into a floating point, so we get accurate division.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
When we run that, we get the result 0.4 with some more.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We might like a higher probability of catching cheaters

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
if we think cheating on four votes is enough to change the election.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We'd like to audit more votes. We could do that.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That will increase the probability of catching a cheating mixer but will also increase the probability

20
00:01:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that privacy is lost--that a vote can be traced through the mix net.
