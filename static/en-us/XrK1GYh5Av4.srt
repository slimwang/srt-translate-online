00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,504
To start solving this inequality, let's clear our groupings by distributing. I

2
00:00:04,516 --> 00:00:08,363
want to distribute this negative 2 and this positive 2. I'm showing my

3
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:12,768
distribution in this step here, being really careful with my negative 3. It's

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,074
negative 3 times negative 1. I'm going to combine like terms on each side of the

5
00:00:17,086 --> 00:00:22,269
inequality. I have 5 plus 3, which gives me 8, and 6 plus 1, which gives me 7. I

6
00:00:22,281 --> 00:00:27,475
bring down the negative 3m, and the 2m. I add 3m to both sides to keep my

7
00:00:27,487 --> 00:00:33,345
variable positive. A positive 5m and no more M's on the left. Next, I subtract 7

8
00:00:33,357 --> 00:00:39,240
from both sides to isolate the 5m. Finally, I divide by 5 on both sides to get 1

9
00:00:38,978 --> 00:00:44,903
5th is less than or equal to M. That's the same thing as M being greater than or

10
00:00:44,915 --> 00:00:49,893
equal to 1 5th M is greater than or equal to 1 5th, so that must be answer

11
00:00:49,905 --> 00:00:50,524
choice A.
