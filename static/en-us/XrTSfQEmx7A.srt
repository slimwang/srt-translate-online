00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,330
Now that we have a number of ways to
quantify how accurate our models are,

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,580
how do we choose the best model?

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,203
Well, that may not always be easy.

4
00:00:09,203 --> 00:00:12,728
The most commonly used method would be
to use the model with the lowest AIC.

5
00:00:12,728 --> 00:00:17,490
What happens if two models
have a very close AIC, or

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,070
what if we have used two
different model types?

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,130
That's when we can use our
Calculated Errors to take a deeper dive

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,940
into the available data presented
to us through our analysis.
