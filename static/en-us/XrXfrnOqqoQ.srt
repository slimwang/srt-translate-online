00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Here comes one idea about how to test the implementation of a differential equation solver.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We provide the solver that we've never covered before that looks pretty complex.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The question is what's the order of that solver. Enter that order here.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The problem that we're using is again the satellite the takes 24 hours to orbit the earth

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and we are comparing its final position to its start position and plot the arrow.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
From that graph, determine the order of that solver.
