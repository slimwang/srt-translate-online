00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:06,320
There are many, many, many different
ways to do 6-DOF positional tracking.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,370
Let's take a look at how two of
the major VR headsets do it.

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,260
First up, the Oculus Rift.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,145
The Oculus Rift uses a tracking
system called Constellation.

5
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:19,015
Behind the exterior fabric,

6
00:00:19,015 --> 00:00:23,045
the Rift has a large number of
infrared LEDs and it looks like this.

7
00:00:24,585 --> 00:00:28,590
Each LED is blinking really,
really fast in a specific pattern.

8
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,360
There's also a separate camera
that is placed on your desk or

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,220
somewhere else nearby.

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:35,960
It looks like this.

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,690
The camera captures
these light patterns.

12
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,800
And a computer program builds up
a model of the light positions.

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,690
The model looks something like this.

14
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,230
That program then tries to
fit a 3D model of the Rift

15
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,350
onto the 2D model it
sees from the camera.

16
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,710
Based on this 3D model,

17
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,310
the measurements from an internal IMU,
it calculates your head position.

18
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,410
Needless to say, it tries to do this
extremely quickly and accurately.

19
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,270
But as you might guess,
it isn't perfect.

20
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,890
In fact, none of these tracking
systems are completely perfect.

21
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,640
But Constellation is really good and
it's pretty cheap.

22
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,010
And that's why Oculus chose it.

23
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,460
Next, let's talk about the HTC Vive.

24
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:23,020
The Vive uses a tracking
system called Lighthouse.

25
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,420
It also uses infrared light.

26
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,673
But unlike the Rift,
it uses infrared lasers.

27
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,765
[BLANK_AUDIO]

28
00:01:31,765 --> 00:01:36,070
It works by measuring the time it takes
for a laser to sweep horizontally and

29
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,405
vertically across a fast photosensor.

30
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,915
It's actually a similar
principle to how ships navigate

31
00:01:42,915 --> 00:01:46,295
by using time measurements
between lighthouse flashes.

32
00:01:46,295 --> 00:01:47,415
That's why it's called Lighthouse.

33
00:01:48,885 --> 00:01:52,465
If you look closely,
both the Vive headset and controllers

34
00:01:52,465 --> 00:01:55,279
are covered with little circular
indentions for the photosensors.

35
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:01,453
A Vive base station is constantly
sweeping the room with a laser that hits

36
00:02:01,453 --> 00:02:03,220
the photosensors.

37
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,130
The sweep times are used to
determine their positions in space.

38
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,360
It uses this data and combines it
with readings from an embedded IMU to

39
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,360
determine where your head and
hands are located.

40
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,997
So there you go, that's how some of
the major players do 6-DOF tracking.

41
00:02:18,997 --> 00:02:20,104
If you look deeper,

42
00:02:20,104 --> 00:02:23,460
you'll find that there are tons
of other ways to do it, too.

43
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,469
In the future, you'll probably own VR
devices that can detect the geometry

44
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:28,729
of the room you're in.

45
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:31,914
And they'll likely be able to
determine your full body and

46
00:02:31,914 --> 00:02:34,340
finger positions as well.

47
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,480
We've got so much to look forward to for
the future of VR tracking technology.
