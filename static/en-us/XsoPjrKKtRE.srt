00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:17,780
>> Okay, very good. Here is C and I've just chosen one of the choices out

2
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,450
of the six choices, five here. And so we're going to try to build

3
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:26,380
a semantic network for C and five, just the way we built it for A and B. So for

4
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,930
C and five, I have already shown all the objects. Now, your task is to

5
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,340
come up with the labels with the links that are between these objects here,

6
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,959
as well as labels for the link in the, between the object for five.
