1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,600
So we just asked you what your favorite application

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,170
is. So, Isabelle, let me ask you. What is yours?

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,210
>> My favorite application would have to be Google Now.

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,040
>> That's a good choice because I just so, it just so happens I have a

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,250
screen shot of it right here. So what do you like about it? What is it?

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,840
>> Well, I really love Google Now. It's basically an application that

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,880
combines all these different data sources or signals about me and kind of

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,430
anticipates the information that I might need. First of all, the visual

9
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,500
design is really amazing. I think they really got that right. If you

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,630
look at the agency meeting card they just took a lot of information, and put

11
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,140
it in a nice, glanceable way. And it's just really clean and easy to see.

12
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:33,580
>> Cool.

13
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,020
>> I really like the engineering aspect of

14
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,620
this. So they took so many data sources and

15
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,590
put them into one card. And they, and

16
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,660
the information is really accurate. Another thing that I

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,040
really like is the interaction design. Really in

18
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,960
two ways when I first started using Google Now

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,270
I didn't have to fill out a lot of

20
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,910
forms or tell a ton of information about myself

21
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,330
to get it set up, it just started kind of learning

22
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,720
from the way I used it. And also the calls to

23
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,970
action or, or the contentional actions off the cars are really

24
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,470
awesome. There's just a few of them and they're really useful.

25
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,966
>> That's awesome, so how would this have gone wrong for you? Like, for

26
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:07,773
example, in the user interface or engineering

27
00:01:07,773 --> 00:01:09,590
interaction, can, can you give me examples.

28
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:09,790
>> Yeah.

29
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,210
>> of what happens if you get UI wrong, for example?

30
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,410
>> If you were to get the UI

31
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,840
wrong, the cards would no longer be glanceable. Basically,

32
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,830
you have to stop and really study and read them. They

33
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,370
would no longer be easy to glance at and get information from.

34
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,890
>> Oh, so if I'm on the go, which is the whole

35
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,400
point of this app, that would pretty much make it useless for me.

36
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,110
>> Yeah. Right. So what if they got the engineering wrong?

37
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,970
>> If they got the engineering wrong, basically it would kind of erode your

38
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,630
trust in the application. Like if it told me that my flight was at a

39
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,660
certain time tomorrow, it really wasn't then, or if that wasn't even my terminal

40
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,400
or gate number. You would kind of never

41
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,560
trust the app, and probably stop using it.

42
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,030
>> That's true.

43
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,780
Or if it gave you walking directions to work, that would be really awful.

44
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,790
>> Yeah, that'd be a very long walk. What about this

45
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,560
interaction design thing you talked about? What if they got that wrong?

46
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,780
>> I think it's really crucial how the setup

47
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,100
of Google Now works. It just starts presenting cards

48
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,030
based on your usage, and asking you whether or

49
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,310
not that's useful information for you. So if it had

50
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,260
asked me to fill out, you know, ten pages

51
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,970
of forms, like, like when you're going to a new

52
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:04,770
doctor's appointment and tell it everything about me I

53
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,760
would have never set it up in the first place.

54
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,610
>> That's true. So it sounds like design is everyone's responsibility.

55
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,020
>> Yeah.

56
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,490
>> And if everyone does their

57
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,970
job, in UI engineering, interaction assignments, and

58
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,890
so on, then the user ends up having an awesome experience with their app.

59
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:17,800
>> Yup.

60
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,130
>> So let me ask you this again. Like, whose responsibility is design?
