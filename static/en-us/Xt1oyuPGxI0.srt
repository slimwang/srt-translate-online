1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,292
The answer is activity B enter.

2
00:00:03,292 --> 00:00:07,732
Now we can see that content of activity
B is animated both on the way in and

3
00:00:07,732 --> 00:00:08,700
on the way out.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,574
While the content of activity A,
the grid, remains static, so

5
00:00:12,574 --> 00:00:16,473
the transition must be on activity B,
one of these two options.

6
00:00:16,473 --> 00:00:19,418
Now as the content slides
from the right on the way in,

7
00:00:19,418 --> 00:00:22,180
then it must be the enter transition,
this option
