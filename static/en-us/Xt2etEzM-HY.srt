00:00:00,669 --> 00:00:03,908
The last feature of the app is
shaking the bugs off the web.

2
00:00:03,908 --> 00:00:07,398
Before I show this feature to you,
I want you to download the app,

3
00:00:07,398 --> 00:00:09,504
and then get acquainted with the code.

4
00:00:09,504 --> 00:00:12,568
There's a download link posted
in the instructor notes.

5
00:00:12,568 --> 00:00:15,905
Make sure to reference the final
bug view controller and

6
00:00:15,905 --> 00:00:18,465
final settings view controller classes.

7
00:00:18,465 --> 00:00:21,426
Those are the classes that are used
in the working version of the app.

8
00:00:21,426 --> 00:00:25,061
After you've looked them over, I want
you to answer the following questions.

9
00:00:25,061 --> 00:00:28,602
First, which method shakes
the bugs off the screen?

10
00:00:28,602 --> 00:00:34,800
And second, which UIEventSubtype member
value is being used to shake the bugs?

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,324
UIEventSubtype, if you haven't seen
it is an enumeration value declared

12
00:00:39,324 --> 00:00:43,342
by the UIEvent class, and the member
value is just another word for

13
00:00:43,342 --> 00:00:45,234
the value of the enumeration.

14
00:00:45,234 --> 00:00:48,801
I've posted a link to the relevant
documentation in the instructor notes,

15
00:00:48,801 --> 00:00:50,539
and you can use them if you get stuck.

16
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:53,990
Once you've found the answers, write
them in the appropriate text boxes.
