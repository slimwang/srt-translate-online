1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,952
Well, since the sample had average engagement ratio of 0.13 we would guess that

2
00:00:05,952 --> 00:00:11,698
the population will have an engagement ratio of 0.13. This means that on average

3
00:00:11,698 --> 00:00:16,582
out of every hour of content available students would watch almost 8 minutes if

4
00:00:16,582 --> 00:00:21,770
we introduced this new lesson with a song. Remember that since the distribution

5
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:26,984
is skewed the number of minutes students would watch is heavily pulled towards

6
00:00:26,984 --> 00:00:31,961
the left, towards zero, because there are probably a lot of students who are

7
00:00:31,961 --> 00:00:37,216
enrolled but aren't watching any of the lessons. Of the students that are taking

8
00:00:37,216 --> 00:00:42,280
the course and progressing through it this number would be a lot higher. But on

9
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,900
average it's about eight minutes.
