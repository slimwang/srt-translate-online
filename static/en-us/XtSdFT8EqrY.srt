00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What I want you to do next is look at a more complex data set.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In this data set, we study the height of people in inches from a data set I got from the web.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Here is the data set of people and their individual heights--all ranging between

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
about 65 and 72 inches, and I want you to do a histogram plot

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
following the example I've given you.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Remember histplot is the command for histogram plot, and I didn't call the data "data."

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I actually called it height--so try to assemble the right command

8
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to plot the data and look at it because I'll ask you a question about it.
