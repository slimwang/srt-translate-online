00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,080
Okay. Before we get in too much further into this, we should actually

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,615
talk about what we're doing so this class is going to have two lessons.

3
00:00:05,615 --> 00:00:06,590
>> Mm-hm.

4
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,880
>> Lesson one is on HTML and CSS, which are basically, how

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,050
does this webpage work or how does it look, I should say.

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,910
>> Yeah and then, lesson two will be on

7
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,780
the JavaScript, which is sort of more how, how

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,520
it works, how, the elements on the page are

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,170
controlled, how, things change when you interact with the page.

10
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:25,660
>> Right and

11
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,840
so if you're an experienced programmer with a

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,920
decent amount of experience who doesn't wan to

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,500
learn the basics of HTML and CSS, you can go ahead and skip to, lesson two.

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,770
>> But it would still be super valuable to have you in

15
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,140
the forums, since the new programmers

16
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,050
will definitely benefit from your knowledge.

17
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,280
>> Yeah. Nothing like having some experienced help

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,790
around, like Sarah, to help you in programming.
