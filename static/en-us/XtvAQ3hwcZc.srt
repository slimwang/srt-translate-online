1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,960
You should have changed the TextView
into a ListView element.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,180
Then you can remove this text attribute
because you don't need it anymore.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,790
Now from the UX Mocks, you'll remember
that the list takes up the whole screen,

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,480
so we want to set the width and height
to be match_parent.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,378
That will make the ListView
match the dimensions of its parent,

6
00:00:18,378 --> 00:00:20,316
which is this RelativeLayout.

7
00:00:20,316 --> 00:00:22,875
And to find out the parent
of this RelativeLayout,

8
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:25,526
it's actually in this activity_main XML file

9
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:29,477
because the fragment
is contained within the activity.

10
00:00:29,477 --> 00:00:34,560
Within this file, we see that this view
is also match_parent for height and width.

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,440
So now we can confirm that the ListView
actually will take up the full screen.

12
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,626
Going back to the fragment_main file,
we can add the id,

13
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:45,270
listview_forecast, onto the ListView.

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,085
And then, since this layout
only contains one child,

15
00:00:48,093 --> 00:00:52,093
we can simplify the layout
by changing this into a FrameLayout.
