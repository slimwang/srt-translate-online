00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,270
Congratulations, you made your
first step towards a path

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,820
in front end programming.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,650
Front end developers use
the Javascript programming language

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,380
to create interactive
experiences on the web.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,280
In this course,

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,410
you will learn the basics of Javascript
by creating an interactive resume.

7
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,620
As you dive into the new
programming language,

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,160
there may be times you
reach your strain zone.

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,690
I encourage you to use
the Udacity forums for support.

10
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,270
By the end of this course you
should have a better idea

11
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,560
of whether front end programming
is a right fit for you.
