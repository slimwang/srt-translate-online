1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,239
All we need to do is get of this term of negative 1 5th on the left-hand side.

2
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:10,435
To do that you just need to add 1 5th to both sides. 7 and 1 5th is equivalent

3
00:00:10,435 --> 00:00:13,571
to 36 5ths. So we have 3 over x equals 36 5ths.
