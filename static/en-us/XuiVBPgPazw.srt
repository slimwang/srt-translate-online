>> Did you get y equals negative 4 for the first answer, and x equals 3 for the

2
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:10,133
second answer? If so, way to go! Let's see how we got those answers. Similar to

3
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:15,031
the last practice problems that we did, for the first problem we know that a

4
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:20,140
slope of 0 means a horizontal line, and a horizontal line looks like this. And

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,585
we know the equation is going to be y equals sum constant. If I put a point on

6
00:00:24,585 --> 00:00:29,188
the line, 3 negative 4. I know that, no matter what x equals, y is always going

7
00:00:29,188 --> 00:00:34,077
to equal negative 4. Which is why we get the equation, y equals negative 4. For

8
00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:38,967
the second problem, the key here is the undefined slope. We know that undefined

9
00:00:38,967 --> 00:00:44,286
slope means its a vertical line. And we know a vertical line looks like that,

10
00:00:44,286 --> 00:00:49,906
and I also know the equation of a vertical line is x equals a constant. When I

11
00:00:49,906 --> 00:00:55,639
plot the point on my vertical line, 3 negative 4, I can see that no matter what

12
00:00:55,639 --> 00:01:01,194
the value of y is, the x value always stays at 3. So, the equation is x equals

13
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:02,101
negative 3.
