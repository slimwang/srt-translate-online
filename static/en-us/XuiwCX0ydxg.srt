00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,115
Just like we've been doing with the z test and t test, we want to compare the

2
00:00:04,115 --> 00:00:10,044
F-statistic to the critical value that marks a low probability. Usually 5% of

3
00:00:10,044 --> 00:00:14,650
obtaining a particular F-statistic. We do this using the F table. There's a

4
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:18,666
different F table for different alpha levels. If you already clicked the F

5
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:23,016
table link, you'll see that we need two degrees of freedom. Those are the

6
00:00:23,016 --> 00:00:27,960
degrees of freedom for between group variability and within group variability.

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,730
Try to use the F table now to find the critical value.
