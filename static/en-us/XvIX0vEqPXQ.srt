00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,918
First, let's take a minute to look at the component life cycle.

2
00:00:02,918 --> 00:00:05,668
Components are produced by external developers.

3
00:00:05,668 --> 00:00:09,342
Hence, instead of the normal breakdown between development time and

4
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:12,216
runtime, there are really three phases to consider.

5
00:00:12,216 --> 00:00:15,618
Design time, deployment time and runtime.

6
00:00:15,618 --> 00:00:18,561
At design time, components are specified and built.

7
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:21,109
During deployment, binaries are configured and

8
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:24,430
deployed into target execution environment.

9
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:28,340
At runtime, components are instat, instantiated and executed.

10
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,250
As we shall see, major differences exist between

11
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,590
component technologies depending on when composition takes place and

12
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,080
whether a repository for the components exists.
