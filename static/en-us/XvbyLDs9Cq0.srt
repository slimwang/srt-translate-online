The fully factored form of this rational function is T equals 1.932 x squared

2
00:00:05,836 --> 00:00:11,265
times x plus 10 for the numerator and in the denominator, 2 x times 11 x plus

3
00:00:11,265 --> 00:00:18,254
50. From the denominator, we can see that the values of x where the function

4
00:00:18,254 --> 00:00:24,056
will be undefined are x equals 0, and x equals negative 50 over 11. So x is not

5
00:00:24,056 --> 00:00:26,370
allowed to equal either of these values.
