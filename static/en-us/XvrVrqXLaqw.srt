1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,150
Okay, let's see what
my daily special is.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,560
Iceberg lettuce with lollipops.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:13,050
I'm going to go ahead and change it to
gingerbread noodles with coconut sauce.

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:13,590
Save.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,280
Don't forget to publish.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,750
Easy enough to forget that,
but if you don't publish,

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,960
the changes won't go through.

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:22,750
All done.

9
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,235
Now let's see what happens if
I show my daily special again.

10
00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:30,717
It's still the same thing, and
that's because I need to restart my app,

11
00:00:30,717 --> 00:00:34,709
because the code to get
the container is in onCreate.

12
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:36,200
So, I will close this app.

13
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,010
Start it up.

14
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,310
Show Daily Special, and there it is.

15
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,610
It's got the new value
of the daily special.

16
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,610
Now let's have a look at the code.

17
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,500
So, here we are in the show
daily special activity class.

18
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,610
We've imported the container holder.

19
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:56,650
And then, in onCreate, I just make
a call to updateDailySpecial().

20
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,010
And then, in updateDailySpecial,

21
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,240
I get the container holder
from the application.

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,560
I get the daily-special out of it by
calling getString on the container.

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,770
I find the relevant text view.

24
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,860
I set the value of the text view,
and that's all there is to it.
