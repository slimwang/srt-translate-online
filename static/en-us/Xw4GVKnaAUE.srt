1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,949
So now that we've defined out type, we want to create some objects of that type.

2
00:00:03,949 --> 00:00:07,590
And the way to that is to use the class name followed by a parameter list. This

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,130
could be empty, but you still need the parens. This is just like when we call a

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,574
function. So, for the restaurant type, we don't need any parameters. So, we'll

5
00:00:14,574 --> 00:00:18,642
create a restaurant object, just like this. This is just like any other object

6
00:00:18,642 --> 00:00:22,322
in Python, we can assign it to a variable. If we're doing this outside the

7
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:26,487
restaurant module, we need to import. So, what we'll do on our code is use the

8
00:00:26,487 --> 00:00:30,627
from to import from the restaurant module, and we only need to import one

9
00:00:30,627 --> 00:00:34,852
definition, it's the definition of the class restaurant. So, let's try a few

10
00:00:34,852 --> 00:00:37,890
things in the Python interpretor. So, we'll create a new instance of the

11
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:45,806
restaurant type. And we can see that it has a type. It's type is a class named

12
00:00:45,806 --> 00:00:50,662
Restaurant, that's the type we just defined. Suppose we create another one, so

13
00:00:50,662 --> 00:00:55,108
now have two instances of the restaurant type. They both have the same type, but

14
00:00:55,108 --> 00:00:59,332
are they the same object? If you guessed before I showed you the result. And the

15
00:00:59,332 --> 00:01:02,960
result is False, they're not the same object. They're two different objects.

16
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,578
Another way to see this is to look at their hash. Hash is a built in operator in

17
00:01:07,578 --> 00:01:12,876
Python that maps each object to unique identity. Here, McDowell's has this

18
00:01:12,876 --> 00:01:18,842
fairly minimalist number, you'll get a different number if you try yourself. And

19
00:01:18,842 --> 00:01:21,710
the hash of Chez Bananas is different.
