Now that we've had a lot of practice dealing with complex numbers, let's go back

2
00:00:04,764 --> 00:00:09,084
to that original problem we were trying to solve or at least a problem of a

3
00:00:09,084 --> 00:00:13,572
similar form. I want you to find the roots of this equation for a parabola Y

4
00:00:13,572 --> 00:00:18,158
equals X squared plus 4. Remember that a root is an X value when Y equals 0. If

5
00:00:18,158 --> 00:00:22,838
you get more than one answer, I'd like you to note that you should separate them

6
00:00:22,838 --> 00:00:23,543
by commas.
