00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:02,965
Key mapping is a technique that game developers use, to allow players to

2
00:00:02,965 --> 00:00:07,360
customize their experience in playing the game. So for instance, if they don't

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,888
like moving around using WASD, they can shift over their controls to use the

4
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:15,102
arrow keys instead. Now looking at the grids controls, we can see a number of

5
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:19,359
different potential input methods that we need to keep track of. For example,

6
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,495
we can move around with WASD, but we allow two different variations for how to

7
00:00:22,495 --> 00:00:26,297
shoot. So at some point in the future, we may have a need to change how our

8
00:00:26,297 --> 00:00:30,998
keys are laid out. This means, that somewhere in our code we need to have the

9
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:35,800
ability to variably modify what key corresponds to what action.
