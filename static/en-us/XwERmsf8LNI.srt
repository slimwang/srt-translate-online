1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,480
The last property we'll
talk about is alignment.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,699
It controls how views expand
perpendicularly to the axis.

3
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:14,140
In a horizontal stack view, it means how
the views will take up vertical space.

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,179
And you have free options,
top, middle, and bottom.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,010
With vertical stack views, it's a bit
like text can align to the left,

6
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,429
center or to the right.

7
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,250
For text based views such as labels or
text fields,

8
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:38,769
there's a specific way of aligning,
and that's by the baseline.

9
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:43,740
The baseline is the line where
most of the text will be lying on.
