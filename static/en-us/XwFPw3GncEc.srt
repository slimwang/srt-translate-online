1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,650
The answer is that different form factors typically

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,600
need to be taken advantage of differently. An ideal

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,630
interface for a phone scenario, will really be pretty

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,800
different than an ideal desktop presentation that's designed for

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,760
a large screen. You need designs that adapt to

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,100
the general scenario of device, like phone or tablet

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,970
or desktop. And then use re flow and fluid

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,470
layout techniques to adjust for smaller differences between devices

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,720
in those scenarios like, different models

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,950
of tablets with slightly different screens.
