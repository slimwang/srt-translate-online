00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,428
Maybe there is hope for these functions, though. Perhaps some domain

2
00:00:03,428 --> 00:00:07,680
restrictions could help us out. After all, if we only look at part of these

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,810
graphs, it might be that the part we leave passes the horizontal line test.

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,696
That will mean that, that part at least, would have an inverse. Let's just

5
00:00:15,696 --> 00:00:19,705
focus in on one of these two for the moment. If we look at this function, only

6
00:00:19,705 --> 00:00:22,895
in the part of the domain where x is greater than or equal to 0, does that

7
00:00:22,895 --> 00:00:28,006
function have an inverse? And then secondly, if we look at the function only

8
00:00:28,006 --> 00:00:32,927
where x is less than or equal to 0, does that function have an inverse? Think

9
00:00:32,927 --> 00:00:36,455
about which parts of this graph each of these are looking at, and then decide

10
00:00:36,455 --> 00:00:40,550
whether or not they each pass the horizontal line test.
