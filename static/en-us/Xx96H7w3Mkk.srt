00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,925
I need to replace x with x minus 5 and y with y plus 2. Remember, that the

2
00:00:04,925 --> 00:00:09,954
vertex of y equals 3x squared is at 0,0. So, if we want to move the graph down

3
00:00:09,954 --> 00:00:15,240
to and to the right 5, then the new vertex will be at 5, negative 2. Let's take

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,703
a look at that new graph. Here, I've plugged in those transformations you talked

5
00:00:20,703 --> 00:00:25,083
about in the last quiz, replacing y with y plus 2 and x with x minus 5 to make

6
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:29,562
the vertex be at 5, negative 2, like we just figured out. So remember, the 3

7
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:34,319
here, this coefficient in front of the leading term, squish the parabola down to

8
00:00:34,319 --> 00:00:38,953
be skinnier than the parent function. And then, the addition of these constant

9
00:00:38,953 --> 00:00:40,690
terms shifted the graph over.
