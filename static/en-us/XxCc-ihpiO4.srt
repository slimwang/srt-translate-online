00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,900
It's all very nice to use
the standard map panes, but

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,600
did you know you can customize these
to match your app and its branding?

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,210
One way to do this is
to use a custom icon

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,160
instead of the Google supplied ones.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,740
It's very easy to do this, so

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,440
let's adapt that previous
example to use a custom icon.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,670
The custom icon can be provided
in a number of different ways but

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:25,750
they all boil down to using a bitmap
descriptor factory to generate it.

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,790
This can take actual bitmaps provided
in the assets directory or resources.

10
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,765
Let's take a look at using
a resource to define a custom pane.
