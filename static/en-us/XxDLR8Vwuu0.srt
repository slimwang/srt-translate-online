1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,830
So, I started small with
dev tools open, so

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,770
I'd get the resolution,
and I pulled the page out.

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,189
All right, that's about 680 pixels, and

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,460
I think this still looks good, so
let's make it a little bit larger.

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,280
Here I am at about 815 pixels.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,260
Still, I think that looks good.

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,470
I think I can go larger.

8
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:18,720
Okay, now I'm at 1130.

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,960
Okay, this is definitely
way too large for here.

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,840
Let's pull it back in a little bit.

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,920
Around 850 pixels or so, I think
I'm about at my limit for how wide,

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,102
I want this image to be, and for how
far apart I want these elements to be.

13
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:37,982
So, for my answer I put 850 pixels, but

14
00:00:37,982 --> 00:00:41,108
really like I said this
is an art not a science.

15
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:44,680
So if you didn't get the same
answer as me that's totally fine.

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,590
This isn't the right answer but,
you know, it's what I think.
