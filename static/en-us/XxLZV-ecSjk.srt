1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,738
Now we don't know who the faster or the slower person is. But we know the

2
00:00:03,738 --> 00:00:08,615
slower person takes 12 hours, and the faster person takes only 6 hours. Great

3
00:00:08,615 --> 00:00:13,794
algebra skills for getting that one correct. We'll start solving this equation

4
00:00:13,794 --> 00:00:17,988
by multiplying through by the lowest common denominator. Which is 4x times x

5
00:00:17,988 --> 00:00:23,898
minus 6, the product of these denominators. If we multiply through by the LCD,

6
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:27,558
we'll find that he x cancels in the first term, the x minus 6 cancels in the

7
00:00:27,558 --> 00:00:33,155
second term. And then, on the right hand side of the equation, the 4s' simplify

8
00:00:33,155 --> 00:00:39,011
to 1. This leaves us with 4 times x minus 6, here. 4x for a second term and an

9
00:00:39,011 --> 00:00:44,628
x times x minus 6 on the right hand side. Next, we'll distribute this positive

10
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:49,504
4 and this x to get our next equation. We'll combine the 4x on the left and the

11
00:00:49,504 --> 00:00:54,945
right, to get 8x minus 24 equals x squared minus 6x. Now we're almost to a

12
00:00:54,945 --> 00:00:59,310
quadratic expression that we can factor. We just need to subtract 8x and add 24

13
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:05,272
to both sides of the equation. This gives us 0 on the left side, x squared

14
00:01:05,272 --> 00:01:11,535
minus 14x, plus 24 on the right side. Now we want to find factors of positive

15
00:01:11,535 --> 00:01:17,820
24 that sum to negative 14. Those factors are negative 2, and negative 12. We

16
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,400
set each of these factors equal to 0, and then we solve for x. So, we find the

17
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,619
values of x equals 2 or x equals 12. And this might be confusing. Which answer

18
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:31,953
should we take? Before we've always had at least one of the answers be

19
00:01:31,953 --> 00:01:37,047
negative. So we could eliminate it since a negative time didn't make sense. The

20
00:01:37,047 --> 00:01:41,360
key is that one person is 6 hours slower than the other. So if someone was 6

21
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,328
hours slower than someone who could work 2 hours, we'd wind up with a negative

22
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:50,544
time. So this one would be out. This means that the slower person must take 12

23
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:53,500
hours, and the faster person could do it in 6.
