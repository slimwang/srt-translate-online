00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,666
Now that you've practiced with ANOVA with the same sample sizes, and you've

2
00:00:03,666 --> 00:00:07,378
seen the F test output using software, we're going to do one more example with

3
00:00:07,378 --> 00:00:14,021
different sample sizes. In a study to reduce tumor sizes in breast cancer,

4
00:00:14,021 --> 00:00:20,310
researchers analyzed the effects of a placebo pill, and three types of drugs.

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,410
After each treatment was administered, the researchers observed the reduction

6
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:31,499
of tumor diameter in centimeters. For 20 people who had tumors, first calculate

7
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:33,820
the mean of each group.
