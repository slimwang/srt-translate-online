00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,719
Just to help us start it, let's go back
to some an image that we've seen many

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:07,060
times in this class and
the whole concept of panoramas.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,880
That is of course,
given many images like this,

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,110
we can generate a panorama by doing all
the stuff that now you know how to do.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,840
Finding the features in images,
stitching them together,

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,950
blending images, cutting images, and
basically getting a smooth transition

7
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:27,320
between all of them spatially, and of
course these seven pictures with limited

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,630
field of view let me generate a much
larger field of view, image of panorama.

9
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,070
Of course, if you notice in this case,
everything is static.
