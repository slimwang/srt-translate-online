1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,896
The more common deployment strategy for

2
00:00:02,896 --> 00:00:06,620
network IDS is to deploy
them as passive sensors.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,230
A passive sensor only takes
a copy of the traffic.

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,270
That is, the traffic continues
to reach it's destination

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,590
without passing through the device.

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,690
Therefore, from the point of
view of network performance,

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:23,960
a passive sensor does not add
any overhead to network traffic.

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,900
This illustrates a typical
passive sensor configuration.

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,040
The sensor connects to
the network transmission medium,

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,330
such as a ethernet cable,
through a direct physical tap.

11
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,290
The tap provides the sensor with
a copy of all network traffic

12
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,450
being carried by the medium.

13
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,890
The network interface card for

14
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,550
this tab usually does not have
an IP address configured for it.

15
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,310
Therefore, all traffic into
this network interface card

16
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:55,360
is simply collected with no protocol
interaction with the network.

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,060
The sensor has a second
network interface card

18
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,530
that connects to the network
with an IP address so

19
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,580
that it can communicate with
a backhand management server.
