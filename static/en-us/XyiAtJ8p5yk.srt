1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,330
So when we say that something deviates from

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:05,689
specified behavior, we really are talking about three different

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:08,610
things. One is faults, another is errors, and

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,230
another is failure. So let's now define each one

5
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,980
of these three to see where the difference

6
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:17,490
is. A fault is when something in the system

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,237
deviates from specified behavior. An error is when

8
00:00:21,237 --> 00:00:25,345
the actual behavior somewhere within the system differs from

9
00:00:25,345 --> 00:00:27,957
the specified behavior. The behavior that

10
00:00:27,957 --> 00:00:31,230
should be happening within the system. And

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,240
the failure occurs when the system

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,670
deviates from specified behavior for that system.
