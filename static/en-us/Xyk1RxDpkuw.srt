00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,260
Congratulations!

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,680
You did it.

3
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,320
You made an app completely
from scratch and

4
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,670
it was a little frustrating and
you wanted to give up at times,

5
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,420
but I'm sure you're really
proud of what you did, right?

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,600
And you should be, because it's awesome.

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,360
So go, show your app to the world,
let your brilliance shine and

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,305
when you're ready come back we'll
reflect on what you just did.

9
00:00:22,305 --> 00:00:26,570
[NOISE]
It doesn't make a noise, but

10
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:27,780
we're still really excited for you!
