Here is my next quiz for you. Suppose we have a coin with probability p.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
For example, p might be 0.5.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You flip the coin twice and I want to compute the probability that this coin

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
comes up head and heads in these 2 flips--obviously that's 0.5 times 0.5.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But I want to do in a way that I can use any arbitrary value for p

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
using the same style of code as before.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So all you're going to modify is the 1-p into something that if I give a probability p

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,492
returns to me the probability of seeing heads twice in this coin--that is the probability of heads.
