1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,670
Before the model is created,

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:04,830
we can use a config method to
configure how it gets set up.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,060
The config method takes a function.

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,210
UI router includes
a lot of functionality.

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,492
Two components will be using our
state provider and URL provider.

6
00:00:12,492 --> 00:00:15,905
We'll inject both of these
into the config function.

7
00:00:15,905 --> 00:00:19,135
Providers are like services, but
only providers can be used for

8
00:00:19,135 --> 00:00:20,635
a module configuration.

9
00:00:20,635 --> 00:00:24,105
We can now use state provider to set
up the different states of our app.

10
00:00:24,105 --> 00:00:26,755
Let's start out with the default
state and call it home.

11
00:00:26,755 --> 00:00:31,340
To add a state to our app,
we call .state, give the state a name.

12
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,660
Again we're gonnause home, and
give it a configuration object.

13
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,850
With the URL for the state.

14
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,300
The template to use our app is
already using the default template.

15
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,530
So we'll link to that.

16
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,560
And the controller to load for
that template.

17
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,280
Review state provider to
set up a state for the app.

18
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,110
We need to use URL router provider
to load the home state by default.

19
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,340
So the app state
management is all set up.

20
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,490
But there's one last thing,

21
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,630
we need to tell UIRouter where
to insert this template.

22
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,380
We can do that with a directive UIView.

23
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,920
We have access to this directive because
we've included the UIRouter module

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,690
into our project.

25
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,380
UI router is now handling
our app's state.

26
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,760
Let's add a new state for
an individual menu item.

27
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,060
Let's create an item state.

28
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,200
We also need to create the template and
controller for this item.

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,410
Pay attention to this right here,
the colon id.

30
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,650
We can use dynamic
content in our routing.

31
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,808
Let's quickly generate a template and
a controller for an item.

32
00:01:26,058 --> 00:01:30,920
I've also created a few JSON files with
more details about the menu items.

33
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,150
When the URL is item slash some menu ID.

34
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,365
The ID will be accessible in the either
controller by using the state

35
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:38,750
param service.

36
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,558
We'll also add in a food finder service,
so that we can retrieve the item.

37
00:01:42,558 --> 00:01:46,806
We'll use the get item function and
lookup the item by its ID.

38
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:48,523
Then when it's returned the JSON file,

39
00:01:48,523 --> 00:01:51,245
we'll set it to
the item's data property.

40
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:53,850
The get items function is
very similar to get menu.

41
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,440
Except that it gets a single
item specified by the ID.

42
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,260
Let's make the name a link
to that item's detail page.

43
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:10,038
UI Router gives us the ui-sref
directive to switch between states.

44
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:12,560
We want to switch to the item state and
pass along a value.

45
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:17,350
The state expects an ID which
we'll set to the items ID.

46
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,300
Now it's just filling out
the template for the item.

47
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,910
Let's have it show the item's name,
the image of the menu item, and

48
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,930
its rating and description.

49
00:02:24,938 --> 00:02:28,070
And now our app can be in the default
state with the menu showing, or

50
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,750
it can be in an item state.

51
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,620
How awesome is that?
