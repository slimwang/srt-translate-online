00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,400
Some of the promised benefits of

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:05,120
Network Virtualization are more rapid innovation since

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,560
innovation can proceed at the rate at

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,980
which software evolves. Rather on hardware development

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,240
cycles, allowing for new forms of network

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,880
control, and potentially simplifying programming. It is

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,400
important to make a distinction between Network

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,390
Virtualization and Software-Defined Networking. Network Virtualization is

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,160
arguably one of the first killer applications for

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,820
SDN. And in some sense, SDN is a

11
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,920
tool for implementing Network virtualization. But the two

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,790
are not one in the same. Remember the

13
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,930
defining tenant of SDN is the separation of

14
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,940
the data and control plant, whereas the defining

15
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,660
tenant of Network virtualization. Is to separate the

16
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,520
underlying physical network from the logical networks that

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,580
lie on top of it. So SDN can be used to simplify many aspects of

18
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,180
Network virtualization. But it does not inherently

19
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:03,020
obstruct the details of the underlying physical network.
