1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,600
So the answer is none of the above and we'll

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,460
see why in a minute. First I want to mention

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,790
that all of these are sort of real words. It's

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,920
not that well defined what it means for something to be

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,010
a word. The first one is the longest word used

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,800
by Shakespeare. This is 27 letters long and it means

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,280
roughly, with honor. The second one is one letter longer.

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,970
It means the movement against the division of church and state.

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,240
The third one, which is 35 letters long,

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,300
means fear of long words. You can see it's

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,390
made up of phobia, which is fear and a

12
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,740
really big sort of made up root about things

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,250
being big and words. So it's fear of long

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,370
words. The fourth one is the longest word in

15
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:47,570
most large dictionaries. It's a kind of lung disease

16
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,730
that you get from having contact with volcanic particles.

17
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,320
So, the reason the answer is none of the above

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,520
is that I'm very confident whatever you claim is the longest

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,550
word, I can alwauys make a bigger one. There is

20
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,519
no such thing as the longest word in the English language.
