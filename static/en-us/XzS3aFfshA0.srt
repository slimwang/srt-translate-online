00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,351
So now let's write the code. You've gotta put up with my coding handwriting here.

2
00:00:04,351 --> 00:00:09,128
What we're going to do is initialize k to our global thread index.

3
00:00:09,128 --> 00:00:13,116
We're going to initialize chum to our next pointer, and then we're going to loop.

4
00:00:13,116 --> 00:00:16,357
We're going to run this routine until we run into the end.

5
00:00:16,357 --> 00:00:21,852
And the question is, what do we do at each stage? What do we set the new chum of k to?
