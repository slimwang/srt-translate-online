1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,200
We already have an app that can send and
receive messages, but

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,769
right now all the messages
are sent anonymously.

3
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:11,429
So anyone who has a copy free app,
can read every message and

4
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:12,330
write whatever they want.

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,239
So anyone could now delete
the entire database.

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,420
We wouldn't even have any
way to know who did it.

7
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:22,019
To learn how to secure your apps,

8
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:25,660
we will talk about firebase
database security rules.

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,429
We'll explore a few examples of how
to configure the database rules.

10
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,899
And then we'll finish out the data by
exploring authentication with firebase.

11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,730
You might remember that we
changed the database rules

12
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:38,989
to allow anyone to read and write.

13
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:42,950
It was very useful when we wanted to
test out how the app was working.

14
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,730
But it's not a good idea to
deploy an app to your users

15
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:48,319
where anyone can read and write data.

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,480
So let's look at some ways that you can
protect your database with security

17
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:51,809
rules.
