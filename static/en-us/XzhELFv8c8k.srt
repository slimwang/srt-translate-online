00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,370
Xcode is a very powerful integrated
development environment and

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,740
it may feel a bit overwhelming at first.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,810
That's okay.

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,735
Let me show you one of the features of
the interface builder part of Xcode.

5
00:00:10,735 --> 00:00:12,850
That'll make your life a little easier.

6
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,380
It's called the document outline.

7
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,030
Here, I'm looking at
the completed pitch perfect.

8
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,870
Just so you can see
the document outline in full.

9
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:24,280
Your pitch perfect cap won't have
any of these UI elements just yet.

10
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,280
Here, I have Xcode open to
the main.story board file.

11
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,090
And the document outline is not visible.

12
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,439
See this little button here?

13
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,610
This is what shows or
hides the document outline.

14
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,950
Clicking on it causes
a document outline to open.

15
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,240
In this document outline, we can see
our record sounds view controller.

16
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,030
The view and
all of the UI elements inside that view.

17
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,250
Sometimes you may need to click
on this disclosure triangle

18
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,280
to see the items inside of it.

19
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,520
If you're looking for
an easy way to find and

20
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,620
work with your ui elements,
the document outline is the place to go.

21
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,400
This is especially true once your
app starts to have more than

22
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,920
just a few buttons and labels.
