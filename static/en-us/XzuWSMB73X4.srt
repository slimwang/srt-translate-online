00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,750
Okay, it's quiz time.

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:05,930
Consider the computation of
the gain function, given a and b.

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:11,150
Assume the following, first, every
vertex is labeled by it's partition.

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,020
You can access this
label in constant time.

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:18,350
Secondly, the maximum degree
of any vertex is given.

6
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,590
It's a constant, which we'll call d.

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:21,850
Here's my question.

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:26,270
How long does it take to compute the
gain, given a pair of vertices a and b?

9
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,406
Write your answer,
in terms of, little d, n1, and

10
00:00:29,406 --> 00:00:32,630
n2, which are the sizes of v1 and
v2, here.

11
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,540
For your analysis, I'm interested in
the asymptotic, or the big O sense.
