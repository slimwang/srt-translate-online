1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,091
Now let's get some practice
in first order logic.

2
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:06,249
I'm going to give you some sentences and
for each one,

3
00:00:06,248 --> 00:00:08,869
I want you to tell me if it is valid.

4
00:00:08,869 --> 00:00:13,279
That is O is true,
satisfiable but not valid.

5
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:18,179
That is there's some models for
which it is true or

6
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:22,329
unsatisfiable, meaning there are no
models for which it is true.

7
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:26,500
And the first instance is,
there exist an x and

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,929
a y such that x equals y.

9
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:36,271
Second sentence, there exist an x

10
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:41,063
such that x equals x implies for

11
00:00:41,063 --> 00:00:46,600
all y there exist A z such that y = z.

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:53,480
Third sentence, for
all x, P(x) or not P(x).

13
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:57,623
And fourth, there exists an x P(x).
