00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,550
To help you visualize this a bit better,

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:07,320
I've created a small app to show
you how you can manipulate images.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,240
Here we have an image inside a card view
with a label composed of a couple of

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,560
text views.

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,590
Below the card view
are a series of radio buttons

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,850
with different transformations and scale
types you can apply to the above image.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,130
The default scale type for
an image Is FIT_CENTER.

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,770
It scales the images to fit inside
the view will keeping the aspect ratio.

9
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,230
If the axes don't match,
the empty space is distributed

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,766
on both sides of the image, either the
top and bottom or the left and right.

11
00:00:38,766 --> 00:00:45,130
FIT_START and FIT_END also scale
the image to fit inside the view but

12
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:50,960
they align the image so that the unused
space appears before or after the image.

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,710
FIT_XY scales the image to use
all the space in the view,

14
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,690
even if the aspect ratio changes.

15
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:04,180
In other words, unless your image has an
aspect ratio that closely matches your

16
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:08,060
view, using FIT_XY might be a bad idea.

17
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:14,260
We have three center options, center,
center crop, and center inside.

18
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:19,320
Center displays the image centered
in the view with no scaling at all.

19
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,990
In this case,
the image is larger than our view so

20
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,730
we only see a small portion of it.

21
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:28,340
Center inside attempts to center
the image in the view and

22
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,090
will scale it down to fit.

23
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,270
If the image is smaller than the view,
it won't scale it up and

24
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:38,320
the extra space will be evenly
distributed around the image.

25
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,660
If the image is larger than the view,

26
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:45,770
center inside will look similar
to the results of fit center.

27
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:49,740
Center crop scales the image so
that both the width and

28
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,415
the height exceed
the dimensions of the view.

29
00:01:53,415 --> 00:01:57,835
It centers the image and then crops
everything that was left around it but

30
00:01:57,835 --> 00:01:59,045
not in view.

31
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:02,855
It can make an already
great image more impactful.

32
00:02:02,855 --> 00:02:07,510
If none of those options fit your needs,
you can select matrix and

33
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:11,525
a matrix composed of translations,
scaling, and rotation.

34
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,930
For this matrix, I scaled the x and

35
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:21,730
the y axes in half and translated
a 100 pixels in each direction.

36
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,530
Last but not least,
there's this radial button here.

37
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,270
There isn't a no scale type.

38
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:34,010
This is my not so vague way of saying
don't use ill sized images for

39
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,630
your views or add large paddings.

40
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,000
It makes your images look lower quality.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,310
Whatever you choose, play around
with images of similar quality and

42
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:47,200
size to what you'll use in your
production app to see what works best.
