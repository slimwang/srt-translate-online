Consider the following
general case of a mapping.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,500
The logical network is a 2-D Taurus.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,990
The physical network is a 1-D ring.

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,540
The numbering of mapping is as shown.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,140
Here's my question.

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,310
What is the congestion of this mapping?

7
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,860
I want you to type your
symbolic answer here.

8
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:24,524
If you need to put in the symbol
square root of x, just type sqrt (x).
