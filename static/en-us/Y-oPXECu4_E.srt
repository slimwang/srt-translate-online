1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,195
So if you say that hue goes
around between 0 and 360,

2
00:00:04,195 --> 00:00:09,015
then the question is what's
the difference in hue between two,

3
00:00:09,015 --> 00:00:11,708
two of the following pairs of hues.

4
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:15,350
225 and 75.

5
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:16,079
And 45 and 315.

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,510
So what falls in between those?
