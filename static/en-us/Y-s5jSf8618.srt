1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,580
And I think that the last three options could be valid responses.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:08,060
I think the first one is actually not. And the reason for that are two things:

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:13,600
One is that I think it kind of does seem a bit suspicious but even if you don't think it's suspicious

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,730
you don't really understand what's going on here.

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,770
So on the last throws, it has all turned out very, very, very well.

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,490
So no 6 was thrown. Always 30% payout.

7
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:29,040
Now the reason could be pure chance and maybe the person offering the game at that point

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,250
just had bad luck but the thing is you don't really know.

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,570
So if you decide to play, I think you should only play a little

10
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,890
and it certainly depends on your risk affinity if you even want to get into the game

11
00:00:38,890 --> 99:59:59,999
because I do think the whole thing seems a bit suspicious.
