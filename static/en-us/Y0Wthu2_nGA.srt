1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,029
So that was pretty cool, right?

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:06,510
You basically take this great big long
feature, based upon these HOG features,

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,080
Histograms of Oriented Gradients.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,880
You take a whole bunch
of positive examples,

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,380
whole bunch of negative examples,
you throw it into this training machine.

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,140
You go get a latte.

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,550
And then another latte because it
takes a while and it comes back and

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,030
it says here are your support vectors.

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,430
Here are the alphas.

10
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:25,800
At testing time,

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,455
just build yourself a feature vector,
just take the dot product.

12
00:00:29,455 --> 00:00:32,241
[SOUND] Multiply it by the alphas.

13
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:33,262
Need some other sound effect.

14
00:00:33,262 --> 00:00:35,282
[SOUND] And sum them up.

15
00:00:35,282 --> 00:00:36,618
[SOUND] I don't know.

16
00:00:36,618 --> 00:00:37,910
Anyway.

17
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,100
And then if it's greater than zero,
call it a, a person.

18
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:40,980
If it's less than 0, not.

19
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,820
What if the data are not
linearly separable?

20
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,850
What if I can't just draw a line, okay?

21
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,290
So let's explore this, all right?

22
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,380
So some data sets, you know?

23
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,660
Linear, linearly separable,
to start out with.

24
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,370
So, here, I have them along the line.

25
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,200
So I got my pink points on one side.

26
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,400
My, my blue points along another.

27
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,500
And yes, I could draw a boundary.

28
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,730
And I would have a support.

29
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,870
I, I would have a margin between them.

30
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:12,150
But what about something
that looks like this, okay?

31
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,770
So here again, I've got 1D, all right?

32
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,870
And I've got my pink points here,
but I have some pink points there.

33
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:21,920
And clearly, there's no single
place that I could draw a line and

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,600
say all the points to
the right are pink, and

35
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,040
all the points to the left
are going to be blue.

36
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,000
So what do I do?

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,070
I'm going to map to
a higher dimensional space.

38
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,720
Doesn't it sound cool when you say that?

39
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,840
Map to a higher dimensional space.

40
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,930
Well, here's a very simple example.

41
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:38,750
All right?

42
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:43,520
So here I just have the pink points
along the single dimension x.

43
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,230
What if I plot them in 2D.

44
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,330
You might say, where does 2D come from.

45
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,050
>> Where does 2D come from?

46
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,050
>> She's on the ball now.

47
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,770
Well how about I just take x and
x squared, okay.

48
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,940
So I just take x and x squared.

49
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,500
So these points are the same points,
right.

50
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,860
In other words, well actually,
this shifted over a little bit,

51
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,960
this point should be right there.

52
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,120
Yeah, these are pretty much, right?

53
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,370
These points are the same points, but
I just took whatever their x-value was,

54
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,880
and just drew it on the x squared line.

55
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,100
Okay?

56
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,820
Well, that looks nice.

57
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,690
Let's erase that.

58
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,340
Now, is there a line here
that separates the points?

59
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,240
You know,
a line that looks something like that?

60
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,640
Well, if I push my magic button,
There it is, okay?

61
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,510
And there's only three
little support vectors.

62
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,680
One here, one here, and one there.

63
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,800
And all of a sudden,
it's magically delicious.

64
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,070
No, magically separable, okay?

65
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,160
So, that's a pretty cool trick.

66
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,060
It's about to get even
cooler in a minute.

67
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,260
Here's another example.

68
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,580
Here we have a bunch of points.

69
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,680
This comes from Andrew Moore.

70
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,160
Pink points in the middle.

71
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,460
Blue points on the outside.

72
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,900
And in the 2D space here,
is there a line that separates them?

73
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,889
No, of course not, but
there would be this curve here, right?

74
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:02,939
As drawn there and

75
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:07,470
that has something to do with sort of
how far away it is from the center.

76
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:14,120
Well suppose I map, using some function
cap phi, the points x to phi of x.

77
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,733
And suppose that puts it into a space
where along here is the distance to

78
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:19,920
the origin.

79
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,520
Now, and it's a little hard to see
the idea is that this plane in here

80
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,860
is separating that.

81
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:31,090
And the key to making this work
was this mapping function, right.

82
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,440
So we map phi of x, so

83
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,750
it takes x from its, its original
space into some higher space.

84
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,250
That's actually called
the lifting space but it just,

85
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,900
it's to a higher dimensional space.
