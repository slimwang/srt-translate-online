00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,682
I implemented the solution by creating an object in which to put my cylinder and

2
00:00:03,682 --> 00:00:07,076
two spheres. At the top there's a little logic here to determine whether any

3
00:00:07,076 --> 00:00:11,139
sphere is needed at all. If so, I create the sphere's geometry. Then, each end

4
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:14,566
is checked to see if it's used. If it is, a sphere object is created with the

5
00:00:14,566 --> 00:00:18,332
geometry, positioned and added to the capsule, which is then returned. That's

6
00:00:18,332 --> 00:00:18,509
it.
