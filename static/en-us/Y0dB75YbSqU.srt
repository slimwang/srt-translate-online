1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,395
In order to illustrate
correlated equilibrium and

2
00:00:03,395 --> 00:00:07,181
why you would care about it,
I want to first introduce a game.

3
00:00:07,181 --> 00:00:10,536
This is game theory after all and
this is the game of chicken.

4
00:00:10,536 --> 00:00:11,847
Are you familiar with
the game of chicken?

5
00:00:11,847 --> 00:00:17,354
>> I have seen the game of chicken
on movies from the 40s and

6
00:00:17,354 --> 00:00:20,680
stuff or 50s or 60s.

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,350
The General Tso part doesn't make
sense to me, but the chicken part.

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:29,570
It's like cars rushing at each other and
teenage, I'm going to say boys,

9
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,770
deciding whether or not they're going to
be chickens and swerve off the road or

10
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,000
whether they're going to be,
tough guys and risk dying.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,330
>> Right, that's exactly right.

12
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:41,370
So the two versions are two cars going
towards one another, vroom vroom vroom.

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,290
Voom voom voom.

14
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,970
And who's going to swerve first?

15
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,006
What happens if they swerve
in the same direction?

16
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:47,806
I've never even thought of.

17
00:00:47,806 --> 00:00:52,211
The other one is where they're both
driving towards a cliff as fast as they

18
00:00:52,211 --> 00:00:56,687
can and who's going to either dive out
of the car at the last minute were turn

19
00:00:56,687 --> 00:00:58,280
their car away.

20
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,120
And the chicken is the one who loses
the girl because this is in the 1950s.

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,769
>> The girl's in the car
going over the cliff?

22
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,110
>> No, the girl's usually
the one that starts the race.

23
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,435
>> It's the 50's,
it was a different time Michael.

24
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:09,900
>> Understand.
>> And what does that have to do with

25
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,170
General Tso's, well I'm-
>> Or game theory, for that matter.

26
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,230
>> Well, it's a game right?

27
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,390
In fact, we can turn it into a game.

28
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,940
And how do we know it's a game?

29
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,208
Because I can draw a matrix.

30
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:18,844
So I'm going to say that
there are two actions here.

31
00:01:18,844 --> 00:01:19,830
You can either chicken out.

32
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,630
>> Okay.

33
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,709
>> Or you can dare.

34
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:22,928
>> Okay.

35
00:01:22,928 --> 00:01:25,400
>> So let's just draw a matrix
that captures that idea.

36
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,410
So I'll just put it right here.

37
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,503
Okay.
So there's a matrix you can either

38
00:01:28,503 --> 00:01:29,983
dare or you can be a chicken.

39
00:01:29,983 --> 00:01:32,529
>> Okay, uh-huh.
>> Okay now, if both of you dare then

40
00:01:32,529 --> 00:01:38,500
you both get zero because that's what
death is equal to in this world zero.

41
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,226
>> I see nothing good
ever happens again.

42
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:43,540
>> Right nothing good ever
happens again you just you dare.

43
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,802
So you both got the girl, but
you both died so it didn't really help.

44
00:01:46,802 --> 00:01:47,921
>> You don't get
the girl if you're dead.

45
00:01:47,921 --> 00:01:49,685
>> That's probably true.

46
00:01:49,685 --> 00:01:53,240
Okay, so, on the other hand you
could there and the other guy could

47
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,425
chicken out in which case you get
seven and the chicken gets to why two?

48
00:01:57,425 --> 00:01:59,930
Because you get to live another day he.

49
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,370
>> Live but
you get to live in constant shame.

50
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,500
>> That's exactly right
which is worth two.

51
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,260
>> Cool.
>> Apparently.

52
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:05,770
>> All right.
>> Or

53
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,180
of course the this is a symmetric game,
so

54
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,130
if I chicken out and
you dare it works the other way.

55
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,270
And the other option is
both chicken out and

56
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,960
that's a whole lot
better than being dead.

57
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,310
And it's actually better
than living in shame alone

58
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,880
because you're sharing the shame.

59
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,620
But it's not as good as having
dared while the other chickened.

60
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,221
Chickened out.

61
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:23,496
>> Okay.
>> Okay, so that sounds good?

62
00:02:23,496 --> 00:02:25,922
>> Yeah, 6 seems kind of high but
I can live with that.

63
00:02:25,922 --> 00:02:27,837
>> Yeah it's math, Michael.

64
00:02:27,837 --> 00:02:28,870
It doesn't really matter.

65
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,480
[LAUGH] So it's a general sum game and
it's a matrix and

66
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,162
all this other stuff about cars and

67
00:02:33,162 --> 00:02:36,590
everything don't matter anymore
because everything is the matrix.
