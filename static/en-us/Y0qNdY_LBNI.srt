1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,017
The slope of our equation, because this is in slope-intercept form is just the

2
00:00:05,017 --> 00:00:09,973
coefficient in front of the x, so that's the cost to make each nozzle. We know

3
00:00:09,973 --> 00:00:14,693
that each nozzle costs $2 to make, so m is just 2. This is the thing that's

4
00:00:14,693 --> 00:00:19,814
going to determine how much the total amount of money spent or y will change as

5
00:00:19,814 --> 00:00:24,390
the number of nozzles or x changes. Now that we know that m is equal to 2, we

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,711
can replace cost to make each nozzle with 2. Well, that looks even better. I am

7
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:31,698
so excited about where we're going with this equation.
