00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,850
So now you understand
the basics of ARIA,

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,590
how it plays with native HTML semantics,
and

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:09,390
how it can be used to perform fairly
major surgery on the accessibility tree

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,310
as well as changing the semantics
of a single element.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,020
To wrap up our whirlwind tour of ARIA,
we're going to take a look at how we

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,710
can use it to convey
time-sensitive information and

7
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,650
a deeper look at exactly what it means
to add an ARIA role to an element.
