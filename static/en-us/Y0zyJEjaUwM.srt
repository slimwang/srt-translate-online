00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,390
Okay, so that's cool. It actually worked, and we put the picture in, but.

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,660
>> Right, and so, in the future, when people come back

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,600
to this, they'll see what you posted and when, but also,

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,160
if you go to your Home tab, anyone that is following

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,890
this record would see that post come up in their feed.

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:16,010
>> Oh, cool.

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,420
>> So, you can see, right here. Yeah.

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,450
>> So any information that I've decided was relavant to

9
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,250
me will basically just always show up in this feed.

10
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,420
>> Right. One other thing,

11
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,810
remember we added that thing earlier to do feed tracking on specific fields.

12
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,520
>> Mm-hm. Why don't you just, you know, just

13
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,050
to see what that look like, try it out.

14
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:33,470
>> Okay.

15
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,159
>> So change maybe the crowd capacity to take a thousand more people.

16
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,396
Andy Brown changed Crowd Capacity from 5,000 to 6,000.

17
00:00:41,396 --> 00:00:42,400
>> Really useful, right?

18
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:42,900
>> That is pretty cool.

19
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,810
>> And anyone following this, again, would see that too.
