1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,630
So I have the DevTools
timeline open here and

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:06,380
I had it record what happened
during the load of this page.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,440
Let's take a look at the records
in a little more detail.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,600
The first thing to notice is
that they're color coded.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,070
Blue records are HTML being parsed.

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,570
Now, normally this is really fast and

7
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,440
I haven't personally seen a performance
issue where this was the bottleneck,

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,560
certainly not past
the initial page load anyway.

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,180
Moving along a little bit, and zooming
in with the W key, just drag that

10
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,000
along a little bit, you can see that
we actually have two purple records.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,100
One is Recalculate Style, and
then there's Layout as well.

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,650
Let's zoom in a little bit more.

13
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,690
And you can see I've got a green
one here which is Paint, and

14
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,000
a green one which is Composite.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,550
Okay, there are actually two ways you
can view the timeline information,

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,380
and it's really up to you as to
which one you find more useful.

17
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,260
Firstly, I'm going to record again,
and scroll the page.

18
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,480
Up here are the two
options that we have.

19
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,400
We can switch on and off the frames,

20
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,320
although I don't know why you'd
ever do that, so leave that on.

21
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,300
But your options here are to
use a Flame Chart view or not.

22
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,880
Let's switch it off for
a second by tapping here.

23
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,020
Now, we have a slightly different view,
which looks more like a waterfall.

24
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:21,530
I can scroll up and down, and can also
tap on records on the left hand side.

25
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:26,600
The wider bar is in this view, the
longer it took for the task to complete.

26
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,269
The second view, which also happens to
be the default, is the Flame Chart view.

27
00:01:31,269 --> 00:01:35,410
The chart grows down from the top, and
if one part of the pipeline triggers

28
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:39,130
something else, it's shown as
a child record beneath its parent.

29
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,040
I'm going to zoom in a little bit,
maybe a little bit more,

30
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,230
going to use the W key again.

31
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,100
And I'm going to scroll
across by click dragging.

32
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,180
You can see here,

33
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,150
this function call in Parallax.js
was a child of this scroll event.

34
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,410
Let's take a quick look
at another example,

35
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:59,030
this time the Chrome Dev Summit site.

36
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:01,890
I'm going to record the timeline,
and I'm going to expand the card.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,770
Let's take a look in
this little bit here.

38
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,930
When we zoom in on the area of interest
you see that there's an animation frame

39
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,660
that's fired,
which called some other JavaScript,

40
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,020
which caused some Recalculate Style,
which caused some Layout.

41
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,570
So you can start to build up
a picture of what caused what.

42
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,710
Take a look at both of these views.

43
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:28,670
The old one with the waterfall,
and the new one, the Flame Chart.

44
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:33,390
It's the same information, just
packaged in a slightly different way.

45
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,580
It's really down to you
which one you prefer.

46
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,180
I often find that this view helps me
understand the relationship between

47
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,310
different parts of the pipeline.

48
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,390
But give it a go on your own projects
and find out which one works for you.
