1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
One more quick game tree to evaluate.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Here we have terminal values.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We have chance nodes where the two options are equiprobable.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We have a max node. The two actions A and B.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I want you to fill in the values for all the nodes

6
00:00:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and click on which action, A or B, is the rational action for Max.
