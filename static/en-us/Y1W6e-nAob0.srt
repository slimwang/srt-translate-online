00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,860
Let's use our new configuration skills
to create a custom configuration, and

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,500
add some dependencies to it.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,630
Check out the exercise in repository,

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,280
then see if you can figure
out the following question.

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,130
What would be the name of
the archive generated by

6
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,118
a zip task with
the following configuration?

7
00:00:14,118 --> 00:00:20,040
Version equals 4.2, base name= "Foo" and
classifier= "SNAPSHOT".

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,480
You could solve this either by just
trying it, which is what I recommend, or

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,850
by checking up the documentation
on the zip task.

10
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,000
Write your answer in this box.
