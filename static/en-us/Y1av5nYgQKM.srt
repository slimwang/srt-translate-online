00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay, so let's jump right in. Databases.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The first question we want to answer is what is a database?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
There's a number of ways of answering this question,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
but probably the simplest definition is a program that stores and retrieves data,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
particularly large amounts of data, or even more particular,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
large amounts of structured data, and we'll talk about what that means in a sec.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's go to the picture we've been working on quite a bit in this class.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We've got our user and his computer and the internet and our servers.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Now, up until now, we've been referring to these servers as basically

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
these are web servers running our web applications.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
But in many cases, these servers are actually database servers as well,

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and so we might have a special server just for databases.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
A database can refer to a program that's storing and retrieving the data,

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
or it can refer to the machine running this program,

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
or it can refer to a system of machines running this program operating together.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And just like a web server it may refer to just a program with a web server

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
or the physical machine or the group of machines all working together

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
to host your web application.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
A request may come in from a user via the internet through our servers,

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and then we may need to retrieve some data for that user.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Let's say this is Reddit, and we need to draw the front page,

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
so we need to get the list of links that we're going to draw,

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and we get that from the database,

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and then database responds with the data to the web application,

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
which may manipulate the data and somehow get it ready for display

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and then send it back to the user.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But anytime you're storing large amounts of data,

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
you're probably going to be using a database,

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,554
and that is what we're going to spend most of our time in this lecture talking about.
