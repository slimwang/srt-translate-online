1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,940
So that was the original
condensation paper.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:03,790
Like I said, it was in 98.

3
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:08,270
There have been many versions subsequent
things that have to do with importance

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,804
sampling, that look at the particles and
stuff.

5
00:00:10,804 --> 00:00:15,076
Here's another example of
doing head tracking, 2002.

6
00:00:15,076 --> 00:00:18,342
And you can see,
it's still a hard white right there,

7
00:00:18,342 --> 00:00:20,270
tracking the head there, kay?

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,370
There's an interesting
example right here.

9
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:28,070
You see the head here is fully visible,
but then it goes behind the cabinet.

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,040
In fact, the only part of the head
that's visible I just outlined,

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,130
in fact,
only the top half is visible there.

12
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,260
So the question is,
how did they move through occlusion?

13
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,440
Okay?
because part of the head is missing.

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,940
Well, maybe they used velocity in
their state or maybe they didn't.

15
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:47,770
What do you think?

16
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,170
You think they did or
you think they didn't?

17
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,800
Personally, I would have thought they
did because, I mean, I know all about

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,940
common filter and I know if you
track velocity it's real easy, but

19
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:03,490
then if I think about particle filters,
I say I probably didn't need

20
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:09,890
to track velocity for
the following reason.

21
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:15,460
It's not the case that it has to be
a great example of a head contour.

22
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:21,380
It has to be the case that the example
of the head contour that's here

23
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:26,280
is a better example than if I
put the head somewhere else.

24
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,810
And in fact, indeed, this paper,
they track the head through the,

25
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,860
the partial occlusion without velocity.

26
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,510
Now, would it have worked if the head
was totally occluded behind the cabinet?

27
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,380
No.

28
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,930
Because then the thing would
just stay there in fact they,

29
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,970
they call it a velocity zero model.

30
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,170
The particles just
stay where they are and

31
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,620
they just defuse out
from the uncertainty.

32
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,334
And so if you showed up on
the other side of the cabinet,

33
00:01:52,334 --> 00:01:54,810
you'd be out of the frame
of view altogether.

34
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,438
Yes, Megan, I'm back, okay.

35
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:02,436
Where as, if you did velocity, you would
follow me, follow me, there you go,

36
00:02:02,436 --> 00:02:04,240
follow, very, very good.

37
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,540
So now you get the, you get the point.
