1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,694
Now let's discuss the first
major Internet worm,

2
00:00:03,694 --> 00:00:07,930
also called the Morris worm
after its creator Robert Morris.

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,708
Here's how the worm worked.

4
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:12,192
When the worm runs on a system,
it looks for

5
00:00:12,192 --> 00:00:15,241
other systems on the Internet
that it can spread to.

6
00:00:15,241 --> 00:00:19,137
For example, these systems have
some security vulnerabilities

7
00:00:19,137 --> 00:00:20,778
that the worm can exploit.

8
00:00:20,778 --> 00:00:24,187
And then by exploiting
these vulnerabilities,

9
00:00:24,187 --> 00:00:26,688
the worm can infect these systems.

10
00:00:26,688 --> 00:00:31,470
In other words, it can lure itself to
these systems and that's how it spread.

11
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,221
Once the worm got on a system,

12
00:00:33,221 --> 00:00:37,787
it also employed a number of tricks in
order to keep himself from detectable.

13
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:41,534
According to each creator,
the Internet worm was made as part

14
00:00:41,534 --> 00:00:44,788
of an experiment to measure
the size of the internet.

15
00:00:44,788 --> 00:00:48,966
For example, by measuring how many
computers are connected together.

16
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:52,754
However, there was a programming
error in the code.

17
00:00:52,754 --> 00:00:56,230
That is the worm would infect
a computer regardless,

18
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:00,877
whether the computer had been infected
already one out of seven times.

19
00:01:00,877 --> 00:01:03,419
This proved to be too aggressive.

20
00:01:03,419 --> 00:01:07,239
And as a result,
many computers get infected repeatedly.

21
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:11,849
That is on these computers, there
are many instances of the same worm

22
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:14,959
running resulting in
resource exhaustions.

23
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,201
And that's really how
the Internet worm was discovered,

24
00:01:18,201 --> 00:01:22,251
because the system admins find out
that their servers were overloaded.

25
00:01:22,251 --> 00:01:26,130
As a response, many system admins
disconnect their servers from

26
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,806
the internet in order to stop
the spread of the Internet worm.

27
00:01:29,806 --> 00:01:32,515
But since many servers
were disconnected,

28
00:01:32,515 --> 00:01:35,430
the Internet was disrupted as well.

29
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,790
When the Internet worm identified
the next target to infect, it looked for

30
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:43,540
several security flaws that
it knew how to exploit.

31
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:47,170
These include systems
with guessable passwords,

32
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:52,650
systems running the fingerd program that
had a buffer overflow vulnerability.

33
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:57,393
Systems running a sendmail program that
has a trapdoor, which means that by

34
00:01:57,393 --> 00:02:02,375
supplying some special input commands,
one can gain access to these systems.

35
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:05,079
When the security flaws were exploited,

36
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:08,562
the Internet worm can gain
access to a target system.

37
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:13,031
It then will load a small piece of
code called the bootstrap loader on to

38
00:02:13,031 --> 00:02:18,510
a target machine and this loader will
then fetch the rest of the worm code.

39
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,730
It even used password based
authentication to make sure that only

40
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:27,850
the bootstrap loader of the worm can
load the rest of the code of the worm.

41
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:32,311
The Internet worm also employed
a number of tricks to hide itself.

42
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:35,550
For example,
the worm code is loaded into the memory.

43
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,494
It is encrypted and
decrypted when necessary and

44
00:02:38,494 --> 00:02:41,651
the original file is removed
from the hard drive, so

45
00:02:41,651 --> 00:02:44,908
that the user will not be
able to see the worm program.

46
00:02:44,908 --> 00:02:49,260
The worm even periodically change
its process name and process ID, so

47
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:54,128
that even when a system admin looks at
what programs are running on the server,

48
00:02:54,128 --> 00:02:57,028
he cannot easily discover
the Internet worm.

49
00:02:57,028 --> 00:03:01,617
The Internet worm resulted in major
deception to the Internet, because many

50
00:03:01,617 --> 00:03:05,725
servers were infected and had to
be disconnected from the Internet.

51
00:03:05,725 --> 00:03:08,300
So what lessons did we learn?

52
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,530
The first lesson we learned
was that we need to perform

53
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,080
security scanning and patching.

54
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,891
The Internet worm was able to infect so
many servers,

55
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:21,034
because these servers
had security flaws.

56
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:25,411
Further, most of these flaws
were not only well-known, but

57
00:03:25,411 --> 00:03:28,788
also had security patches or
fixes available.

58
00:03:28,788 --> 00:03:30,285
Therefore, if we scan and

59
00:03:30,285 --> 00:03:33,688
patch computers on the Internet
that have security flaws,

60
00:03:33,688 --> 00:03:38,290
then we can reduce the chances that
they will be infected by malware.

61
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,710
The second lesson is that
we need to have a fast and

62
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:47,020
coordinated response to a major security
incident such as the Internet worm.

63
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:51,610
And because of the Internet worm, the US
government established the computer

64
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:55,340
emergency response team or
CERT for short.

65
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,840
Nowadays, CERT is
usually responsible for

66
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,980
issuing alerts about security for
flaws and recommendations about patches.
