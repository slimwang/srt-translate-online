00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here's how this works in the blind signatures protocol.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Alice will generate not one message now but a hundred messages.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Each one of this form but with a different value for r1.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Alice will also pick a hundred k values. Send all of those to the bank.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The bank picks some random value x between 1 and 100 and unblinds all the other messages

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
so that means that the bank will send x to Alice.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Alice needs to send something back to the bank that the bank can use to verify

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
that all these messages, other than message x, contain something like this.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So, what should Alice send back to the bank?

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Te set of all the ri values except for the one corresponding to message x.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The set of all the ki values except for the one not matching x.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Both of these or none of these work?
