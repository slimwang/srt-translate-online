00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,670
In response to any approximation result,
it's natural to ask,

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,490
is the analysis tight, or does
the algorithm actually perform better,

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,420
even in the worst case
than the theorem says.

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,080
Let's address that question for
our metric TSP algorithm.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,379
Here's an example graph.

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:21,570
Let the blue edges have cost 1,
and the red ones have cost 2.

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,550
Enter a minimum cause
