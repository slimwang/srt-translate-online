1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We've created a list using the square brackets

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
that contains 5 strings.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Each one is a 1-letter string spelling out the word "Hello."

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And we've stored that in the variable p.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We could do the same thing we did with strings.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We could reassign p to a new value.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And if we did that, that would create a new list

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
containing the letters Y-E-L-L-O

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and assign that to the variable p.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What we're going to do instead is mutate the list that we already created,

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and we can do that by modifying the value of its elements.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Here we have an assignment where on the left side of the assignment

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
we have p[0].

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This means select from the list that p refers to.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Find position 0.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Instead of getting the value at that position, though,

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
since it's on the left side of an assignment now,

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
we're going to replace that value with what's on the right side of the assignment,

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
in this case, the string containing the single letter y.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let's see what that looks like.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
When we created the list initially,

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
we had a list like this, and I'm going to draw the list showing boxes.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This is a list.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Each box is 1 element of the list,

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and after the initial assignment, the value p refers to is this list.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Now when we do the assignment where p[0] is on the left side,

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
well, p[0] will find this position.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The assignment will replace what's there.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So, replace the H with the Y.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Note that we did not create a new list.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
P still refers to the same list. We didn't have to change the arrow.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But we've changed the value of that list.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Let's try this in the Python interpreter.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I've created a list with the elements being 5 strings

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
spelling out the word "Hello."

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And I can see that that's the value of p.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Now I'm going to use the assignment expression

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
to replace the value in the first element

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and print p again.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Now when we run, we see that for the first print

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
the value of p is Hello.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
For the second print, the value of p is Yellow.

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We can change other values the same way,

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
so now we've changed the value in position 4

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
to an exclamation point, and we can see

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
the third line printed out.

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We have "Yell!"
