1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,990
I choose to modify the list
rather than create a new list.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,850
I looped over the daily
engagement table.

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:10,300
And for each row I first created
a new key, account key, and

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,420
set it equal to the existing
values stored under the key ACCT.

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,110
Then once the value had been copied,

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,440
I deleted the ACCT key
from the dictionary.

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,720
And I'll go ahead and run this code,
it doesn't have any output.

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,150
Now if you chose to create
a new list that's fine.

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,250
But if you gave it a new name, you'll
need to update the rest of the starter

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,730
code to use your name
instead of daily_engagement.

11
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,590
Now that I've changed this field
it will be easier to write

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,880
a function to get the unique
students from each table.

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,490
So I'll go ahead and do that.

14
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,790
First, I'll move this change up
above the previous investigation.

15
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:46,620
Since I'd already run this cell, it
actually wasn't necessary to move it up,

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,940
but this will make it so
that if I close the notebook and

17
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,700
reopen in, the code will still
work if I run all cells in order.

18
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,720
Then I'll insert a new cell below this
point and write my function there.

19
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,590
I'll name the function,
get unique students, and

20
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,960
it will take one argument, the data.

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,620
My code here looks very similar
to the code I wrote before.

22
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,800
I'm first creating an empty set,
then looping over the data and

23
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,060
adding each account key to the set.

24
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,750
And finally,
I'll return the set of unique students.

25
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,580
I could also have gone
one step further and

26
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,640
returned the number of unique students.

27
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,180
But I happen to know that later I'll
want to have access to these sets, so

28
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,210
I'm going to return them and
store them in a variable.

29
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,230
If I hadn't known in advance that
I would want the sets later,

30
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,720
then that wouldn't be a problem,
I could just change this function.

31
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,840
Then I'll update the later
cells to call this function.

32
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,290
And I'll rerun the cells to make
sure I get the same results.

33
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,090
Finally, I'll run this command I
told you to run to double check

34
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,270
that renaming the column worked.

35
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,080
And sure enough,

36
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,110
the account_key field is now present
in the daily_engagement table.
