1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,600
So the two specific types of sensory memory are iconic memory and echoic

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,195
memory. As I'm sure you're able to deduce from the names, iconic memory has to

3
00:00:09,195 --> 00:00:14,305
do with visual stimuli, whereas echoic memory has to do with auditory stimuli.

4
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:19,260
Iconic memory is presented for only a very short amount of time. For example,

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,545
the picture we just saw. Echoic memory is a sensory memory for sounds. Echoic

6
00:00:23,545 --> 00:00:27,385
memory is important for our ability to comprehend and understand language,

7
00:00:27,385 --> 00:00:30,985
because we need to keep sounds in our memory long enough to be able to make

8
00:00:30,985 --> 00:00:37,765
sense of them as words. So sensory memory is preserved for a very short period

9
00:00:37,765 --> 00:00:41,742
of time. So if sensory memory is so brief in duration, how is it that we can

10
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:45,090
remember for example, someone's phone number or the directions to the gas

11
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,109
station?
