00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,290
Now that you've learned the difference between objective and subjective

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,510
measures, let's see if you can identify some examples. Participants reported

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:11,740
how often they watched television per week. Researchers measured the number of

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,910
hours children watched television per week. College students reported the

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:20,050
number of hours they studied per week. Researchers measured the heart rate of

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:24,280
students watching a horror movie. Researches measured the number of pounds

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,479
students lost after running three times a week for one month. For each of the

8
00:00:28,479 --> 00:00:32,780
examples given, check whether you think it is an objective measure or a

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:33,610
subjective measure.
