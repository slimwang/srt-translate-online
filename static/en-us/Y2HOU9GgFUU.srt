1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:06,850
So, the exercise we did in on basically let us take different f values and

2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,060
add them together.

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,620
These were the four f values that we looked at.

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,050
So, now lets look at how we can start adding some of these together.

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:19,470
Here was my f1, another f2, f3, f4.

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,520
I've just showed them on top of each other.

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,890
If we start adding them what happens?

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,320
Well, then basically what we have to come up with is an equation like this.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,700
Which basically says that f target here is a summation from 1 to n,

10
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,230
where n is how many of them we want to add.

11
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,970
At the amplitude and, again, the same function we looked at.

12
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,850
So, now, let's actually start adding them one by one.

13
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,940
If I just add the first two, f1 and f2, this is the signal profile I get.

14
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:53,958
If I add 3, and again, here I'm keeping the amplitude bounces between 0 and

15
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:58,180
1, I would basically start seeing this pattern, f4, this pattern.

16
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,190
You saw that in the exercise we just did.

17
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,690
What happens if I now start going for a lot more.

18
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,740
So if N goes from not just 4.

19
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,620
So initially we basically looked at N was equal to 4, but

20
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,590
we really want to go a lot more, right?

21
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,725
So what happens if I now go for N is equal to 10.

22
00:01:14,855 --> 00:01:16,330
N is equal to 50.

23
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,540
Now, you would actually kind of see that,

24
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,058
in some instances, this signal and this signal are approximately similar.

25
00:01:23,058 --> 00:01:27,955
They have a peak, add 1, 2, 3, 4, 0.

26
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:29,723
But, it's kind of flat between.

27
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:32,140
Of course, it still has a lot of signal here.

28
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,370
But overall it's actually trying to mimic the signal.

29
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,820
So, in the limit, of N was a much, much larger number.

30
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,200
You would actually see this to be true, that this would

31
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,120
actually become a signal that repeats and has the same characteristics as that.

32
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,820
That's what we want to learn about how to do.

33
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:53,170
In essence, by just taking sines and cosines, and by mixing them up

34
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:58,350
together correctly we can actually recreate a signal that we're interested in.

35
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,695
And again, in this case I showed a very simple signal,

36
00:02:00,695 --> 00:02:03,790
but we want to be able to do this for more complicated ones too.

37
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,940
But more importantly, it gives us another way of looking at a signal.
