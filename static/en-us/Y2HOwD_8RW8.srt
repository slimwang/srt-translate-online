1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,190
Of course it's false!

2
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:05,814
Look, if the thing needs to be multiplied by, 2.5 to make everything sum to 1,

3
00:00:05,814 --> 00:00:11,180
then that 2.5 can be applied to the filter or it can be applied to the image.

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,580
Not 2.5 squared, or something like that.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,090
because remember, linear scaling,

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,440
linear multiplication, just passes right through these linear operations.
