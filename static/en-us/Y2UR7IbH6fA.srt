Pq of x is a parabola. Thinking about the graphs of p and q, this makes sense.

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,702
Since they are both linear functions, if we multiply two linear expressions

3
00:00:09,702 --> 00:00:14,700
together, we get a quadratic one, which produces a parabola. We can also see

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,795
this in the table, the curve starts down low at negative 5, comes up, and then

5
00:00:18,795 --> 00:00:22,949
drops back down again. Let's look at its actual graph.
