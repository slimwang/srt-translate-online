1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,090
All right, Sam, we've got the beginnings of a festival app.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:03,610
>> Yes.

3
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,170
>> And so far, we're keeping track of the festivals.

4
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:06,800
>> Mm-mm.

5
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,340
>> the attendees, and the stages.

6
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:08,630
>> Stages.

7
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,340
>> Yeah. So this is good.

8
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:10,665
>> Mm-hm.

9
00:00:10,665 --> 00:00:11,306
>> But I want more.

10
00:00:11,306 --> 00:00:11,580
[LAUGH]

11
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,150
What do we do next?

12
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,860
>> Yeah, so let's add some complexity into the

13
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,660
app by going into SalesForce but, I mean, as we're

14
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,460
adding in more objects and relationships, it might become

15
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,360
a little bit hazy as to how they're actually related.

16
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:23,950
>> Uh-huh.

17
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,850
>> And so let's use this new tool called Schema Builder,

18
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,180
which is an easy way for you to not only build

19
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,170
your data model, but also visual see it, and how everything's

20
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,940
related together. kind of similar to what we saw earlier on the tablet

21
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,100
>> Sounds good.

22
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,530
Just click on the Setup link, and then go on

23
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,660
the left-hand side, down the Setup Tree to find Schema Builder.

24
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,800
>> 'Kay, well, there's a lot going on. What are

25
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,020
these, like Content, Activity, what are all these other objects?

26
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,080
>> All of these are, all of the objects

27
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,960
that you have within your Schema. And so these

28
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,800
are the standard objects that we're not even using

29
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,120
in addition to the Festival stuff we've already built.

30
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,480
>> Okay.

31
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,430
>> You can see on the left-hand

32
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,500
side, under the Objects, that you can individually

33
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,750
select which objects you want to see. And the reason you'd want to

34
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,330
see them is you can view all of the different fields, the

35
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:12,180
relationships between these tables, everything that you might want to see around

36
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,660
your schema, this is kind of like the blueprint of your account.

37
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,290
>> Okay, so I just hit Clear All, and all I

38
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:23,150
really care about is attendee, like stage and festival for now. Right?

39
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:23,240
>> Yeah.

40
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,600
>> That's the stuff we've built, and let me zoom in. So, now that this is

41
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,610
a little less of a disaster, and I just have these

42
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,410
three things selected. This is pretty awesome. So, we have festival

43
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,090
here and I can move it around if I want. and

44
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,910
then these little, little line

45
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,610
things that are apparently Master-Detail relationships.

46
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,330
>> Yeah. So you can see that festivals

47
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,570
are related to attendees and stages. And looking

48
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,010
at that little fork you can see that

49
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,144
a festival can have many attendees for many stages

50
00:01:49,144 --> 00:01:49,293
[CROSSTALK].

51
00:01:49,293 --> 00:01:49,293
>>

52
00:01:49,293 --> 00:01:49,550
[CROSSTALK]

53
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,970
Being this little like three, these three things on the side here?

54
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:55,120
>> Yeah, that little triangle thing at the end.

55
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,060
>> Cool. Okay, so this has, this is great.

56
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,030
This is a visual way to understand my schema.

57
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,420
>> Yeah. And, as you data model get's more

58
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,790
complicated, it will allow you to visualize it really easily.

59
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,310
But, in addition to that, you can add fields

60
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,500
in yourself or create more relationships straight from Schema builder.

61
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,810
>> Okay, so I can just, like I could add a band object

62
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:15,070
right now?

63
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:18,120
>> You could. You know, why don't you try that out; see if you can do it.
