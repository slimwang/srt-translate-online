Hi, and
welcome to Artificial Intelligence.

2
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:04,139
I'm David Joyner.

3
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:05,830
>> And I'm Arpan.

4
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,650
We're here to get you started
on this exciting subject.

5
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,050
AI has been a cornerstone
in my research,

6
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,760
from cognitive modelling
to robotics challenges.

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,143
In my PhD,
I focused on computer vision, and

8
00:00:16,143 --> 00:00:20,179
how it is used by intelligent
agents to accomplish visual tasks.

9
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:22,899
>> On the other hand, my work in
artificial intelligence has been more

10
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:24,939
about using AI as a means to an end.

11
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,840
I'm interested in creating scalable
personalized educational experiences and

12
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:34,240
one great way to do that is to build
AI agents that work as tutors.

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,390
They build a model of student ability
and use it to inform the guidance and

14
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,505
the feedback and
that they give over time.

15
00:00:39,505 --> 00:00:43,975
While Arpan is interested in studying AI
itself, I'm interested in AI as a tool.

16
00:00:43,975 --> 00:00:48,564
>> In this nano degree program, you will
learn to apply the core concepts and

17
00:00:48,564 --> 00:00:51,879
techniques used in artificial
intelligence from problem solving

18
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,240
using search, to logic,
planning, and probability.

19
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,219
>> Along the way,
you'll be given challenging,

20
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:00,219
yet fun AI problems to
solve in each domain.

21
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:03,429
Once you've demonstrated mastery of
these fundamental topics, you'll be able

22
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:06,930
to choose an area of concentration
to study in further detail, and

23
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,770
use as the basis for
your Capstone project.

24
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:12,719
>> Yeah, the skills you will learn
with us can help you build a career in

25
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,310
artificial intelligence or a related
field such as machine learning or

26
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,609
data science.

27
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:18,700
Numerous companies and

28
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,870
research labs are trying to solve real
world problems using intelligence.

29
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,150
>> Yeah, AI is becoming more and
more common in products and

30
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,162
services we use every day,
just take a look around.

31
00:01:28,162 --> 00:01:31,530
>From self-driving cars,
to intelligent thermostats,

32
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,079
to autonomous robots,
artificial intelligence is everywhere.
