1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,663
The center is at negative 2,3, since we take the opposite signs in the

2
00:00:03,663 --> 00:00:08,680
parentheses. The opposite of positive 2 is negative 2, and the opposite of

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:14,696
negative 3 is positive 3. This is our h and our k. The value of a is the square

4
00:00:14,696 --> 00:00:18,844
root of 25, which equals 5, and the value of b is the square root of 36, which

5
00:00:18,844 --> 00:00:25,012
equals 6. Great work if you got these three correct. Now, what's even more

6
00:00:25,012 --> 00:00:29,638
important is your graph. Let's see if yours will match mine. We'll start with

7
00:00:29,638 --> 00:00:33,851
an ellipse, as usual and it will be centered at negative 2, 3. Negative 2 in

8
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:38,966
the x direction, positive 3 in the y direction. We move 5 units left and right

9
00:00:38,966 --> 00:00:45,310
from the center, and 6 units up and down from that center to form our ellipse.

10
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:49,030
Now, we draw in our dashed rectangle around our ellipse, and then we draw in

11
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:54,900
the two diagonals. Now we're ready to create our hyperbola. The x squared term

12
00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:00,403
comes first. So we know our hyperbola will open left and right. We'll split our

13
00:01:00,403 --> 00:01:04,123
ellipse in half and we'll flip the two ends out, so that way we get the graph

14
00:01:04,123 --> 00:01:08,610
of our hyperbola. Nice work if you got this graph.
