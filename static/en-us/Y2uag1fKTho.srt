>> Should we use a longer key?

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,210
The answer is yes.

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,180
Because a longer key
length means more keys,

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,010
which means the attacker has
to search a lot more keys.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,700
Should we use a shorter key length?

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,250
Obviously not.

7
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,210
Should we use a more complex algorithm?

8
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,452
The answer is no.

9
00:00:16,452 --> 00:00:20,679
Because the attacker is to use
brute-force to blindly try

10
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:22,740
the keys one by one.

11
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,060
So, his search is independent of the
complicity of the encryption algorithm.

12
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,340
Should we use a harder to guess key?

13
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,425
The answers no.

14
00:00:31,425 --> 00:00:36,370
Because the attackers is going to use
brute-force again to search blindly.

15
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:41,240
That is, he's going to try to key one by
one, he's not going to guess the keys.

16
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,030
So, the correct answer is
to use a longer key length.

17
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,970
Again, this would mean that there
are more keys for attacker to try.
