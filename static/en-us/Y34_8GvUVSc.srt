In Material Design,

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:06,730
there are two primary forms of visual
feedback in response to touch.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:12,000
The first is a subtle ripple effect
that radiates outward from your finger,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,070
extending to the bounds of
the surface that it's drawn on.

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,990
For borderless elements,

6
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:22,370
the ripple extends out just enough to
give you a sense of the element's size.

7
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,990
We sometimes call this an ink ripple.

8
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:30,080
Because we liken to a wave of
digital ink spreading on a surface.

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,860
Almost like a droplet of ink falling and
spreading on a piece of paper.

10
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:38,080
This idea of radial motion emanating
from your fingertip is a key

11
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,820
theme in material design that we'll
touch on more in lesson three.

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,330
User initiated radial response not only
puts the user in control of the UI, but

13
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:50,350
it will make the UI really
satisfying to use as well.

14
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,270
Now, let's look at the second
form of visual feedback.

15
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,730
For smaller interactive
surfaces like buttons,

16
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,380
the surface itself can
lift to meet your finger.

17
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,940
Almost like your finger is
magnetically attracting that surface.

18
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,250
So you see here that the fab rises to
meet my finger as I'm pressing it.
