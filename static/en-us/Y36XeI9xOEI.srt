The primary contribution of ACME is that it defines a vocabulary for

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:09,260
talking about architectures. Other features include an extension mechanism

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:14,130
enabling tool specific sub languages to be imbedded in it. For example,

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,490
a simulator might wish to deal with timing information. ACME features generics,

5
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,160
families and types for defining architectural styles. Further,

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,150
ACME is defined in such a way that ACME descriptions can be converted into first

7
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:33,250
order logic suitable for use by automatic reasoning tools such as type checkers.
