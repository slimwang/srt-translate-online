1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now let's take a step back and see what you have learned so far.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And the way we're going to organize this is

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
that we're going to draw pictures of so-called complexity classes.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And a complexity class is basically a collection of problems

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
that can be solved under given constraints or resources.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So you take a bunch of problems,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
you introduce a constraint

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
such as the one we have seen with NP

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
where we said must be solvable in non-deterministic polynomial time,

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and then you sort problems.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Some problems will fall into the complexity class,

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
other problems will basically just fall outside of the complexity class.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And of course you already know some complexity classes very well.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So let's do a little warm-up quiz here.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So you already know the class P from the previous units.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And I just want you to quickly fill in if the complexity class P

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
is the class of all problems that can be solved in

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
polynomial or exponential time

19
00:00:50,000 --> 99:59:59,999
on a deterministic or non-deterministic RAM.
