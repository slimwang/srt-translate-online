00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,280
Okay, let's get back to our
question of what is intelligence?

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:08,740
Given these building blocks, agent,
environment, perception, action, and

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,310
cognition, is there a more practical
definition that we can come up with?

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,570
>> Well here's one formulation that's
actually quite widely accepted.

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:21,690
An intelligent agent is one that takes
actions to maximize its expected utility

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,720
given a desired goal.

7
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:27,059
This is commonly referred
to as rational behavior and

8
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:30,640
it let's us compare agents regardless
of what cognitive mechanisms they use.

9
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:34,399
>> There is one problem with
this definition though.

10
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,579
It requires agents to behave optimally.

11
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:41,549
However as we have seen, it's extremely
hard to find the optimal solution

12
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:44,309
to many of the problems
we are concerned with.

13
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,490
We need to consider the constraints
the agent is faced with.

14
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,190
For example,
a partially observable environment,

15
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:54,179
limited computational resources such
as memory and processing speed.

16
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:57,820
Rules imposed by the task at hand
such as having to respond by a given

17
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,549
deadline, etc.

18
00:00:58,549 --> 00:01:00,390
>> That's a good point.

19
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,549
Given these constraints,

20
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:05,319
we can not expect an agent
to always behave optimally.

21
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,780
Be we can come up with
a level of performance or

22
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,349
bound that we desire the agent to meet.

23
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:13,239
So for example we might want
a chess playing program to win

24
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:16,119
at least 60% of the time
against human chess masters.

25
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,859
Or a route finding algorithm
to always find a route.

26
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:22,579
It is no more than two miles
longer than the optimal route.

27
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:26,469
This is known as bounded optimality and
it serves as a practical and

28
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:28,730
feasible way of
quantifying intelligence.
