00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,116
In this exercise, you'll start with a program that gives a model like this. Note

2
00:00:04,116 --> 00:00:07,656
that the x, y, and z axis are shown given as the colors red, green and blue

3
00:00:07,656 --> 00:00:12,002
respectively. Think of this as a clock hand sort of, it points to 12 and 6

4
00:00:12,002 --> 00:00:16,660
o'clock currently, we'll fix that later. Your task is to rotate the hand of the

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,500
clock so that it points at 2 and 8 o'clock as shown here.
