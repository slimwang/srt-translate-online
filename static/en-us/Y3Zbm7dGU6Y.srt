00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:04,390
All right, you're done. Let me show you my solution.

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:11,320
We start by creating an empty uri matcher. I don't want the root node to match

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,720
anything. This is typical behavior. To make the

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,490
code easier to read, I'm making a shortcut

5
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:23,000
to the weather contract content authority. Technically, date

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,700
will always be numeric, but I'm matching the

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,770
paths with star, because they are stored in

8
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,200
our database as strings, just to be consistent.

9
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:36,930
Finally, we have the location URIs. Since the ID in the database is

10
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,670
always a long integer, it makes perfect sense to use the pound sign pattern.

11
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,474
Now we can add our class variable. [BLANK_AUDIO}
