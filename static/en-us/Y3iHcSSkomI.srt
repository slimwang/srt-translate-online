1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,050
Typing in addresses can be a pain, and

2
00:00:03,049 --> 00:00:05,480
most of the time I don't
know the zip codes.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,839
Let's do a quick exercise to see if
you'd benefit from Places autocomplete.

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:12,849
Open the form linked in
the instructor notes below.

5
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:15,619
First, fill out the form
using conventional methods-

6
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:19,759
skip the box in the top row, and
type into the address fields.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,030
Type fast, and use tabbing.

8
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,690
Then, refresh the page and
fill out the form again,

9
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,600
by typing into the autocomplete
box in the top row.

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,618
Did you fill out the form the second
time more quickly than the first?
