00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,119
Right now, when we have the equation y equals x squared minus 3. The part of the

2
00:00:04,119 --> 00:00:08,215
equation showing the shift in the graph, compared to y equals x squared, is on

3
00:00:08,215 --> 00:00:12,195
the right hand side of the equation, next to the x term. But what if I wanted

4
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:16,325
the shift to be shown on the left side of the equation, where the y is. After

5
00:00:16,325 --> 00:00:20,632
all, that's the direction we're moving things in, the vertical one. So what I'd

6
00:00:20,632 --> 00:00:24,724
like you to is rewrite this equation so the constant term is on the left hand

7
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:27,661
side, next to the y, instead of on the right hand side.
