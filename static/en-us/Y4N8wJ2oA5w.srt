>> That's good, David. Note that David started on the top left corner, this is

2
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,170
a random selection. He could have started at any other corner, for example,

3
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,050
this one or that one. And found the same answer and that is because we have

4
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,020
simplified these constraints. But now that we know that this line is a fold,

5
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,720
by the definition of fold, we know that two surfaces must be meeting at this

6
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:13,190
line. It follows then, that this must be a surface and this must be a surface.

7
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,280
Similarly, because we know this is a fold and by definition of a fold,

8
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,280
two surfaces must be meeting here. Follows this is a surface,

9
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,000
this is a surface and so on. And now we have identified that this one surface,

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,160
this is another surface, this is a third surface. In this way, the visual system

11
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,090
used knows the different kinds of junctions in the world of triangular objects,

12
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,700
and it constrains at each of these junctions to figure out which of

13
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:42,360
these lines made surfaces. Instead of thinking of this as one single surface,

14
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,120
the visual system identified this as being composed of three different surfaces.

15
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,730
And now we can recognize that this might be a cube.
