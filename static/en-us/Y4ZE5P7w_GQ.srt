1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
There are some other things to consider in customer segments

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
besides jobs to be done and pain and gain, and that is--who's the customer?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Gee, I thought we're just defined the customers, it's the archetype, it's the persona

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
but sometimes who's the customer in context is really what we need to know.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In corporations, it's pretty easy to understand that you might have someone who uses the product

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
but they might not be the person who pays for the product.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So, there might be someone up here.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The payer, let's give them a fancy name and call them the economic buyer.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So we might be buying software for accounting to use,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
but it might be the chief financial officer who has to sign off for that,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and in between those process, in a large company, you might have people who influence the decisions,

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
you might have people who actually recommend who the vendors should be,

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
you might have a decision-maker who's the head of the department

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
but he still needs to pass off the final purchase to the chief financial officer,

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and surprisingly, if you spend enough time selling to companies, you might have saboteurs

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and saboteurs in the company are individuals or organizations whose jobs feel threatened

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
if they knew piece of software or new process or new organization comes in place.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And so in complicated business to business sales, you really need to know the archetypes

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
for each one of these even though you might think, all I need to know is about my user,

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and then you might go okay well then all we need to know is about the buyer.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
As we'll see later, you actually need to understand archetypes for all.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Now, if you were kind of rolling your eyes going, well I don't sell to businesses,

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I just sell to consumers, this isn't relevant to me.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I want you to think of a case of selling entertainment software to teens.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Well, think about it. You kind of say, the user, well that's pretty simple.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That's the team. How hard can that be?

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Well, if they don't have a job, the economic buyer are their parents

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and the influencers and recommenders may be their friends,

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and the decision-maker, depending on your family might be mom or dad or the kid,

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
or somebody else in between and so when you think about business to consumer sales,

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
you also need to start thinking about is the user different than the payer.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The last example is a personal one. I was buying a car and I thought how simple could that be.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I was the customer. Well little did I know, having two teenage daughters, that really wasn't the case.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Cause when I started talking about my care or potential car, my daughters said,

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
"Dad, you can't buy that type of car. We wouldn't be caught dead on it."

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I looked at them and I said, well the car is not for you.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
They said, "Oh, we just won't even be riding in it," and they said,

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
"Well, listen if you buy that car, you can't get that color, "

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and this conversation went on for a long time until finally we're able to make a decision

40
00:02:53,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and I realized that the final decision-maker in our household was my wife.
