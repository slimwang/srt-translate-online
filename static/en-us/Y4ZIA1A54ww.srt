00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,040
Let's start with a very basic idea of what programming is. Look at this

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,889
toaster, what can it do? Okay, the toaster can toast. Good toaster. What about

3
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:15,680
this computer? The computer can run programs, why is that better? Why do we say

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,361
we are in the computer age and no one says we are in the toaster age. A better

5
00:00:20,361 --> 00:00:24,330
way to describe that is that a computer can do any instructions that you give

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:31,063
it. Whatever you tell the computer to do, it will do it. And that makes the

7
00:00:31,063 --> 00:00:35,815
computer such a universal device that can manipulate images, text, sounds and

8
00:00:35,815 --> 00:00:41,774
much more whereas a toaster can just toast. There's just one catch in order

9
00:00:41,774 --> 00:00:46,734
tell the computer what you it to do you have to speak it's language. You're

10
00:00:46,734 --> 00:00:50,082
going to learn how to tell the computer what you want it to do in the language

11
00:00:50,082 --> 00:00:55,373
that the computer understands. And that's a great thing because now you're the

12
00:00:55,373 --> 00:00:59,661
master of the machine and it will do for you quickly and reliably any number of

13
00:00:59,661 --> 00:01:05,733
tasks that you would find tedious or difficult to do on your own.
