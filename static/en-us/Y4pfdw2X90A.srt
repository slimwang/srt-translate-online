00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,860
Consider two systems A and B.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,340
Suppose these systems differ
in only two respects.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,170
System B takes twice as
much energy as system A,

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,760
but it also runs three times faster.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,010
Now, suppose you use dynamic voltage and
frequency scaling in order to rescale B.

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,160
So that it's average
power is the same as A.

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,800
My question is this.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,720
After rescaling,
will B still be faster than A?

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,290
It's a yes or no question.

10
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,310
And for this question,
I want you to ignore constant power,

11
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,090
which we called P0.

12
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,110
In other words,
just think about dynamic power.
