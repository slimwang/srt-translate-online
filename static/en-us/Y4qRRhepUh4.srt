00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,770
Epigenetic tags build up with age and silence particular genes. Often times

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,644
these tags are removed, allowing expression of previously silenced genes. Even

3
00:00:09,644 --> 00:00:13,178
identical twins have different experiences and are exposed to different

4
00:00:13,178 --> 00:00:18,523
factors. Think of things like junk food, versus a healthy diet or exercise

5
00:00:18,523 --> 00:00:24,468
versus no exercise, smoking or not smoking. So, their epigenome becomes

6
00:00:24,468 --> 00:00:28,960
increasingly different with age. This is the reason why one twin may develop

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,915
cancer, become obese or things like that, while the other one won't. They're

8
00:00:33,915 --> 00:00:38,008
genetically identical, but epigenetically, they're different.
