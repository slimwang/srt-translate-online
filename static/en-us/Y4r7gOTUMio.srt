1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,310
One thing I like to mention really quick is how I work,

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,860
in terms of what things I have open.

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,680
This is something that I always try to get guys who work with me,

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,400
at, I'd rather not have a month to do.

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,050
Got your browser, you're running your things in it.

6
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,360
And you've got your editor with your code in it.

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,580
Your browsers got some pictures and some text.

8
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,730
If your screen is big enough, I like to have them side by side, but

9
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,050
sometimes that's not the case.

10
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,190
Something people often neglect is having your terminal nearby.

11
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,340
I almost always, like when I'm doing app engine or

12
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,940
my own stuff, run the app server auto terminal so you can see the logs.

13
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,670
If you're developing, without being able to see your logs, there's so

14
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,870
much stuff you're going to miss.

15
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,570
I find many, many bugs just by using my website as in developing, and

16
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,060
watching how the, how the logs goes.

17
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,130
Because many times there's an error that you're not even aware of that could be

18
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,250
a big deal in production.

19
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,650
You could have fixed it in five seconds if

20
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,360
you had just noticed the logs scrolling weird.

21
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,570
An, another important thing, and this is one of my frustrations in App Engine

22
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,600
right now, is it's critical if you're writing code that writes to a database,

23
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,320
but the queries that you're running are printed to the log.

24
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,500
I've kind of tried different strategies of hacking my app engine to print

25
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,580
every time it runs a query, because if you've got some complicated setup with

26
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,890
your database and your cache, and your mem cache, and maybe a local cache, and

27
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,610
all sorts of things, you want to make sure it's working.

28
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,920
And I know when I'm developing I often introduce bugs that has somehow prevent

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,670
something from being cached properly.

30
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,650
And if I am browsing along and

31
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,960
I see all these database queries scrolling by that shouldn't be,

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,190
that's a sign that something is broken.

33
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,960
And I want to make sure generally that every page I run doesn't hit

34
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,020
the database unless absolutely required.

35
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,730
If I see a query running that shouldn't be,

36
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,570
you know, I can catch it by just having the log open.

37
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,310
Try to get in the habit of when your switch from your editor to your browser

38
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,450
that you instead switch from your editor to your browser plus a terminal, so

39
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:30,670
you can see things working.

40
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,330
You start to get a sense for how the logs scrolls when your

41
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,810
website's working normally, so when it deviates, you can detect it faster.

42
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,930
You'll save yourself a lot of heartache doing it that way.

43
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,000
Now, I'd like to move on to how we actually built some of these

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,450
websites that I've been referring to.
