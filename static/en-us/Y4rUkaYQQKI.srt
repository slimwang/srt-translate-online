00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,180
To create this new plot, we really just need to

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:06,530
switch out gender with our year_joined.bucket variable. This is the new

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,740
categorical variable that will take the place of color. Now, I'm

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,860
also using year_joined.bucket here so that way, I can exclude the

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,630
two people who have values of NA. I'll clean up

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,650
my code just a little bit, and then I'll run it

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,580
to create my plot. And now, here's the plot that examines

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,220
the relationship between friend_count and

9
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,050
age, split up by year_joined.bucket variable.
