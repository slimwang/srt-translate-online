1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,330
When we think about the possible ratios we could obtain, we get the following.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,980
We could take 1 over 1, and that would give us 1. We could also take negative 1

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:13,971
over 1. And that would give us negative 1. 1 over 4 gives us, well, 1 4th. 1

4
00:00:13,971 --> 00:00:17,950
over negative 4 gives us negative 1 4th. And you'll notice that if we do

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:22,325
negative 1 over 4, we get negative 1 4th again. And negative 1 over negative 4

6
00:00:22,325 --> 00:00:26,518
gives us positive 1 4th again. So because we have both a positive and negative

7
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:29,690
versions of each number in each set of factors, we're going to have a lot of

8
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:34,366
overlapping factors. This is convenient, because it means that we'll get less

9
00:00:34,366 --> 00:00:38,374
in the end than it looks like we would get. The last two possible rational

10
00:00:38,374 --> 00:00:40,869
zeros are one half and negative one half.
