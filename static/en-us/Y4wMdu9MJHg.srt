00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,868
Let's look at another simplification process involving negative exponents. I'm

2
00:00:03,868 --> 00:00:07,348
going to show you two ways of doing this problem, and then you can pick which

3
00:00:07,348 --> 00:00:11,071
one you prefer. We learned before that a base with a negative exponent can be

4
00:00:11,071 --> 00:00:15,402
moved to the denominator. So we'll have 1 divided by 2 cubed times 2 squared, or

5
00:00:15,402 --> 00:00:19,154
1 divided by 2 to the 5th. If this gives you some trouble, try applying your

6
00:00:19,154 --> 00:00:23,495
exponent rules directly. We know when we divide bases, we subtract the

7
00:00:23,495 --> 00:00:28,383
exponents. So we have 2 to the negative 2 minus 3, negative 2 minus 3 equals

8
00:00:28,383 --> 00:00:33,497
negative 5. And finally we have a base with a negative exponent, so we move the

9
00:00:33,497 --> 00:00:38,879
base to the denominator with a positive exponent. Leaving us with 1 divided by 2

10
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,608
to the 5th. And that's exactly the same as we got before.
