1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
For backed up values for the min nodes, the backed up value is always the minimum.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
For the chance nodes, it's the expectation, or the average,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and for the max node, it's the maximum.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Here the nodes that can be pruned.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This and this can be pruned because in each of these cases min has achieved

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
the best possible play that min can get, and therefore,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
doesn't need to consider any other possibilites.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Once you know you can win the game or do the best you can,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
you don't need to find another way to do just as well.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This node here can be pruned and thus, all the ones below it because

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
at this point, when we're trying to evaluate this node, max knows he can get

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
at least 1/3, and here once we know that this node is worth -1

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
then we know that regardless of the value here,

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
that has to be somewhere between -1 and +1.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So therefore, the expectation has to be between -1 and 0,

16
00:01:01,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and if 0 is the best that this can be, max knows he already has 1/3 over here.
