1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Now, let's assume that we had the clause vertices connected to these variable gadgets here.

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,630
Of course, in the same way that I showed you before, so that the clause vertex

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:17,490
can be visited like this--paying one extra edge instead of going here if the clause can be satisfied

4
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,190
and we're traveling along this gadget in the right way, then otherwise

5
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,480
it will cost us more than one edge.

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:29,030
Now my question for you would be--so if the Boolean formula has a satisfying assignment,

7
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:33,020
what is the length of the shortest path from A to B, and by shortest path,

8
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,400
I again mean one that visits all vertices.

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:42,740
I want to give you the answer as before something times n plus some number times n

10
00:00:42,740 --> 99:59:59,999
plus some number times mn plus some constant.
