00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:03,966
The answer is, we want to set inside vowel group to false when letter is not a

2
00:00:03,966 --> 00:00:09,254
vowel. If we always increment count for vowels, then words like peach would be

3
00:00:09,254 --> 00:00:14,183
counted as having two syllables. These two vowels, e and a, are in the same

4
00:00:14,183 --> 00:00:19,286
vowel group. So even though there are two, we only want one syllable. If we

5
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:22,324
change the condition of the inner if block from inside vowel group to count

6
00:00:22,324 --> 00:00:25,607
equals equals one, Will only increment count when there's already one syllable

7
00:00:25,607 --> 00:00:32,070
counted. So we'll never increment count. If we set inside vowel group to false

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,065
right after count++, we'll never be inside of a vowel group. Every vowel would

9
00:00:37,065 --> 00:00:41,128
be counted as a syllable, so this would be a lot like the first option. It

10
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:45,625
wouldn't work well for words that have two vowels together. The last answer is

11
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:50,960
the correct one. When we see a non-vowel, we want to change insideVowelGroup to

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,760
false. For example, in hello, we see the e and enter a vowel group, but then we

13
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,160
see an l, so that ends the vowel group.
