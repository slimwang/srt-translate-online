1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here's my solution.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I start with an empty list over here, and I build it up

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
using the append command over time.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I do so by iterating over all the elements in my probability p,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and I set a binary flag whether my measurement that I received is the same

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I would expect at the ith grid cell over here from this list over there.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If the case hit is positive, it's true, so we're going to multiply p with pHit.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If it's false, then the flag hit will valuate to zero, 1 - hit will be 1.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You're going to multiply pi with pMiss.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I build up the list, return it, and run it, and out comes

11
00:00:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
0.04, 0.12, 0.12, 0.04, and 0.04 as expected.
