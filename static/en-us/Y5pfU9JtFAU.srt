1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,576
So, I saw more people fights
with their co-founders and

2
00:00:05,576 --> 00:00:09,336
breaking up with their co-founders.

3
00:00:09,336 --> 00:00:14,090
Then I saw people were sticking
with their co-founders for years.

4
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,070
I think that one of the most popular
reason, one of the most common reasons,

5
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:23,260
that the companies fail is because
the co-founders fights and

6
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,030
they can't work together for
a long time.

7
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:29,050
It happens mainly because I
think there's two main reasons.

8
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,390
The first reason is
the definition of working hard.

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,020
Sometime the values of

10
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,270
one co-founder is very different
than the values of the other one.

11
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:45,400
If I believe that working hard
is working 18 hours a day, and

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,580
not taking vacation, and not taking
salaries, but my co-founder's values say

13
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:56,580
that it's working 9 to 5 but working
really hard, that sometimes collide.

14
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:02,185
You follow values that our
employees should be doing

15
00:01:02,185 --> 00:01:07,535
120% and they need to stick to doing all
nighters and we need to ship of the day,

16
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:10,270
and the other one thinks that
it should be more mellow.

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,990
It's probably going to break some time.

18
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:20,190
Another reason is not being
sure what everybody's role is.

19
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:25,230
So we decided that you're the CEO but
I'm going to be involved in everything

20
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:29,320
that you're going to decide even
though that my definition is the CMO.

21
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,880
This is also not going to work.

22
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,340
And if the CEO decides to micromanage
his cofounder This is also going to

23
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,810
break, and those reasons are, I think,

24
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,250
the main reasons that the companies
fail because of founders.
