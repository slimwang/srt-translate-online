1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,222
p could equal negative 2, or 1 4th, excellent effort if you got that one

2
00:00:04,222 --> 00:00:08,472
correct. First we distribute the p then we subtract 2 from both sides. The

3
00:00:08,472 --> 00:00:14,324
negative 2 does not have any liker terms. So we have 4p squared plus 7p minus 2

4
00:00:14,324 --> 00:00:19,000
equals 0. We look for our greatest common factor, and the only common factor

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,644
between these three is 1. So we can't factor anything out. Now I want to find

6
00:00:23,644 --> 00:00:28,774
factors of negative 8 that add to 7. The two factors are 8 and negative 1, they

7
00:00:28,774 --> 00:00:33,060
multiply to give us negative 8 and they sum to give us 7. These two factors

8
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,110
allows to rewrite our middle term and then we can use factoring by grouping. We

9
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,590
continue factoring our equation by factoring a p by the first group of terms,

10
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:46,505
and a 2 from the last group of terms. Next we said each of these factors equal

11
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:51,653
to 0. P could equal 2 or p could equal 1 4th. These are our solutions.
