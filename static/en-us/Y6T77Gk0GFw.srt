00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,080
These are the 2 bottom numbers from the last video. They're already written in

2
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:08,128
scientific notation. Let's look at the form. For a number to be in scientific

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,030
notation, the first number has to be a number greater than or equal to 1 and

4
00:00:12,042 --> 00:00:16,210
less than 10. We'll call that number a. Next, we multiply that number by a power

5
00:00:16,222 --> 00:00:20,219
of 10, so we have a times 10 to some exponent. Any number written in this form

6
00:00:20,231 --> 00:00:24,135
is considered to be in scientific notation Just be sure that this number is

7
00:00:24,147 --> 00:00:27,775
greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10. Usually it's in the form of a

8
00:00:27,787 --> 00:00:31,670
decimal, but sometimes it won't have the decimal after the numbers, it might

9
00:00:31,682 --> 00:00:32,061
just be 6 times 10 of the negative 30.
