00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,030
The diagram is similar to the diagram we just saw,

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,970
except now some of the arrows are going in different direction to indicate when,

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,830
when the various components are being notified about the events that are there.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,430
So now we have four solutions, and we,

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:17,690
we might ask the question why do we need four solutions.

6
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:22,690
That's an excellent question and it depends upon ultimately how,

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,790
how this particular program, this particular solution is going to be used.
