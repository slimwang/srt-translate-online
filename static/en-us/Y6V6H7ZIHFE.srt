1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,500
You could register a listener 
for the action power connected event

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,400
and you should do that 
within your manifest.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,240
That way, it can be called 
to start your app

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,860
once the device is getting charged, 
even if it's been terminated

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,970
since the last time you were using it. 
You can use a similar approach

6
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,160
to delay trying 
to send data until the device

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,850
has internet connectivity. 
Would it change behavior

8
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:22,120
of the user experience when you're 
connected to a car or desk dock?
