1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,860
Now, today's internet is experiencing considerable problems. And

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,740
growing pains and it's worth bearing some of these

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,170
in mind and thinking about them, as many

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,810
of them give rise to interesting research problems to

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,650
think about as we work through the material

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,910
in the course. One of the major problems is

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,110
that we're running out of addresses. The current

8
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:24,740
version of the internet protocol, IPV4, uses 32-bit addresses.

9
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:31,128
Meaning that the IPV4 internet only has 2 to the 32 IP addresses. Or

10
00:00:31,128 --> 00:00:34,770
about 4 billion IP addresses. Furthermore, these

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,060
IP addresses need to be. Allocated hierarchily

12
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,670
and many portions of the IP address

13
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,350
space are not allocated very efficiently. For

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,720
example the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,850
one two fifty sixth of all the

16
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,230
Internet address space. Another problem is congestion

17
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:57,080
control. Now congestion control's goal is to match

18
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,670
offered load to available capacity. But one

19
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,610
of the problems with today's congestion control algorithms

20
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,010
is that they have insufficient dynamic range.

21
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,970
They don't work very well over slow and

22
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,530
flaky wireless links and they don't work

23
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,720
very well over very high speed. Intercontinental paths.

24
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,600
Now, some solutions exist but change is hard

25
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,930
and all solutions that are deployed must interact

26
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,360
well with one another. And deployment in some

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,660
sense requires some amount of consensus. A third

28
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,480
major problem is routing. Routing is the process

29
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,500
by which those on the internet discover paths

30
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,670
to take to reach another destination. Today's interdomain

31
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,790
routing protocol, BGP, suffers a number of ills,

32
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:43,670
including a lack of security, ease of misconfiguration,

33
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:48,030
poor convergence, and non-determinism. But it sort of works

34
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,020
and it's the most critical piece of the internet

35
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,610
infrastructure in some sense because it's the glue that

36
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,910
holds all of the internet service providers together. Another

37
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:59,570
major problem in today's internet is security. Now while

38
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:03,050
we're reasonably good at encryption and authentication, we are

39
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,910
not actually so good at turning these mechanisms on.

40
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,620
And we're pretty bad at key management. As

41
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,540
well as deploying secure software and secure configurations.

42
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,240
The fifth major problem is denial of service.

43
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,060
And the internet does a very good job of

44
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,220
transmitting packets to a destination. Even if the

45
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,830
destination doesn't want those packets. This makes it easy

46
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,780
for an attacker to overload servers or network

47
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,550
links to prevent the victim from doing useful work.

48
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,750
Distributed denial of service attacks are particularly commonplace on

49
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,290
today's Internet. Now, the thing that all of those problems

50
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,450
have in common is that they all require changes

51
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,810
to the basic infrastructure. And changing basic infrastructure is really

52
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,380
difficult. It's not even clear what the process is

53
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,450
to achieve consensus on changes. So as we work our

54
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,190
way through the course, it will be interesting to

55
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,680
see the problems that we encounter in each of these

56
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,420
areas, various solutions that have been proposed, and

57
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,140
also to think about ways. In which new

58
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,250
protocols and technologies can be deployed. In later

59
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,500
parts of the course we'll learn about a new

60
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,430
technology called software defined networking, or SDN. That

61
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,810
makes it easier to solve some of these problems

62
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:19,500
by rolling out new software technologies, protocols, and

63
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,400
other systems to help manage some of these issues.
