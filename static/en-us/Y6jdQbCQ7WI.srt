1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,952
Scaling is done by updating the replicas
field in our deployment manifest.

2
00:00:04,952 --> 00:00:08,942
This is a best practice because even
though we could use imperative methods

3
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:10,730
like the Cube CTS scale command.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,060
Then there is no state saved anywhere.

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,350
Under the hood, deployments create
a replica set to handle Pod creation,

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,240
deletion and updates.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,020
Deployments own and
manage the replica sets for us, so

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,450
we don't have to worry
about managing them.

9
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,940
Using our deployments this way,
makes scaling up and

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,870
down as easy as one, two, three.

11
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,530
Let's have show us what this
looks like in practice.
