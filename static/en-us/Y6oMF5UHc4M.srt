1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,420
Time to make our bullets actually
mean something by detecting

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,060
when they hit an enemy.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,598
This will actually be simpler
than detecting whether Giga Gal

4
00:00:07,598 --> 00:00:08,970
has hit an enemy.

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,630
In this case, we'll just check to
see whether the center of the bullet

6
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,860
is within the radius of the enemy.

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,050
We'll also add a health
counter to the enemy and

8
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,599
destroy them when they
reach zero health.

9
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:21,250
Follow the to dos in the course
code to let Giga Gal

10
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,920
actually destroy her nemeses.
