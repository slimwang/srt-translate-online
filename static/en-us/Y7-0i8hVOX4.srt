1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,740
The objectives of this lesson are for

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,140
you to learn about, what is a light
field, and the different seven

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,880
parameters of the plenoptic function
that go into creating a light field.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,600
We'll learn about different
types of light fields.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,840
Then we'll look at variety
of camera configurations and

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,390
pinhole systems that can
be used to view a scene.

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,030
Then I will talk about
the eccentric aperture and

8
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,280
its impact on a simple lens system.

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,270
Again, how we can use that
to capture light fields.

10
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,970
And then again, how we can actually
use an array of pinhole cameras

11
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:36,580
to create an array of images that could
be used to generate light fields.

12
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:40,000
And using all of this,
I'll introduce to you a basic camera,

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,740
a light field camera,
that can capture 40 light fields.
