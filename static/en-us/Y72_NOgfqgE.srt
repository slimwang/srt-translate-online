00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,116
Andy, how'd it go?

2
00:00:02,116 --> 00:00:03,510
>> It wasn't too bad.

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,005
I got the cat clicker working.

4
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,210
>> [LAUGH] It wasn't too bad?

5
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,830
>> Yeah. >> Well okay, so what parts were more difficult for you?

6
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:09,820
>> It wasn't bad at all.

7
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,490
I mean, I was just, I'm just rusty with JavaScript.

8
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,630
I hadn't used it in awhile.

9
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,420
I'm used to Python syntax.

10
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,380
>> Okay. >> I was forgetting to declare my variables.

11
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,020
Forgetting semi colons.

12
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,858
And, I'm still just not very fluent with, you know,

13
00:00:22,858 --> 00:00:25,150
manipulating the DOM through JavaScript.

14
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,420
So, there's a lot of Google searches to just figure out how to do

15
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,590
some pretty basic stuff.

16
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,180
>> Cool, but you got it working, overall?

17
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:31,900
>> I got it working, yep.

18
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,620
My div, with the cat ID, increments its count, when you click on it.

19
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,250
>> Awesome, good job.
