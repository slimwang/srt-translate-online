1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,050
Why should you be a facilitator or a teacher?

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:07,689
Why should you give your time to Startup Weekend and these entrepreneurs?

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:12,860
Number 1, we think you'll learn a tremendous amount yourself

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:18,750
just watching a variety of teams start with an idea and watch their process.

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,500
And you as a facilitator will actually watch your skills rise

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,300
as you're able to see patterns you've never seen before.

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,090
You will gain a deep understanding of the Lean LaunchPad curriculum.

8
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,860
That is, you'll understand business model design,

9
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,460
you'll understand all the components of the business model canvas

10
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,300
and understand the startup is not just a bunch of teams who have free food

11
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,080
and you bring your dogs to work and work incredibly hard.

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,840
You'll understand that there's actually a pattern here,

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,170
and the pattern is not only the strategy, the canvas,

14
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,520
but the process of getting out of the building,

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,720
talking to customers, and understanding iterations and pivots and know when to do that.

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,800
You will get fingertip skills that will be immensely valuable in your own career.

17
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,470
And then we think that being part of an organization,

18
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:12,170
bringing the democratization of entrepreneurship to a thousand cities worldwide

19
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,780
means you're part of something bigger.

20
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,900
You're becoming part of a community and a leader and a role model

21
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,640
for the startup community in your city and your country.

22
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,740
You have an incredibly important role.

23
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,620
And I think you understand that the Startup Weekend program

24
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:36,520
is an important part of the ecosystem in your city and, potentially, your country.

25
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,930
It is the catalyst in bringing entrepreneurs together

26
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,960
and giving them a set of skills they could never acquire elsewhere.

27
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,850
And you are that leader.

28
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,990
So I want to personally thank you for dedicating your time to something

29
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,460
we all believe is so incredibly important.

30
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,800
This entrepreneurship, this education, this Lean LaunchPad, this Startup Weekend

31
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,530
and Udacity is all part of a global movement that's truly impacting the world.

32
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:06,600
I'm really, really impressed that all of you have decided to participate and give all you have.

33
00:02:06,600 --> 99:59:59,999
So thank you from the bottom of my heart.
