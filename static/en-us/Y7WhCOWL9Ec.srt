1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
[Thrun] Hidden Markov models, or abbreviated HMMs,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
are used to analyze or to predict time series.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Applications include robotics, medical, finance,

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
speech and language technologies, and many, many, many other domains.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:35,000
In fact, HMMs and filters are at the core of a huge amount of deployed practical systems

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
from elevators to airplanes.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Every time there is a time series that involves noise or sensors or uncertainty,

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
this is the method of choice.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So today I'll teach you all about HMMs and filters

10
00:00:48,000 --> 99:59:59,999
so you can apply some of the basic algorithms in a wide array of practical problems.
