The vertical asymptote is the line x equals 1. This is the value of x that

2
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:09,422
makes the denominator of a rational function eguals 0. X can equal one for f of

3
00:00:09,422 --> 00:00:13,518
x equals four over x minus 1 because well, there's a vertical asymptote right

4
00:00:13,518 --> 00:00:18,712
there. Its all starting to make sense and come together. If I draw in the line,

5
00:00:18,712 --> 00:00:22,072
x equals 1, we can see that yes in fact, it does not look But the curve of the

6
00:00:22,072 --> 00:00:27,507
rational function is going to touch this line at all. It's just going down to

7
00:00:27,507 --> 00:00:31,910
negative infinity here, and coming back down from positive infinity over here.

8
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,080
Never touching this line.
