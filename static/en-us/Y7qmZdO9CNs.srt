00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,550
Every Lego kit comes with a booklet
that's used to create the model

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:05,930
on the cover, but it's just a guide.

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,220
If you want to create the model
with a different look,

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,610
then you'd choose
differently colored pieces.

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,640
So this booklet is a template to
create the model with a specific look.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,820
Let's see how templates work in Angular.

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,120
Get ready because it's
kind of complicated.

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,720
>> Yep, that's it.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,300
Just plain old regular HTML.

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,260
There isn't any fancy
templating language or

11
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,070
special way to format the code.

12
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,375
If you can write HTML, then you've
already mastered templating in Angular.

13
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:34,908
Okay, so Angular templates
are written in HTML, but

14
00:00:34,908 --> 00:00:37,347
how does the dynamic data get there?

15
00:00:37,347 --> 00:00:40,037
How does green get here, or
my unbreakable password,

16
00:00:40,037 --> 00:00:41,270
where does it come from?

17
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,120
Most of the HTML will be the same for
every user.

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,600
Only these parts here will be different.

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,840
These dynamic parts will be set in
a controller which will fetch the data

20
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,499
from a database.

21
00:00:53,155 --> 00:00:55,840
We'll look at controllers in more
detail shortly, but for now,

22
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,630
let's use this as our controller.

23
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,210
To create dynamic
content in the template,

24
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,600
we need to use Angular expressions.

25
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,519
Expressions in Angular
are just double curly braces

26
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,080
where you can put variables or simple
mathematical operations like addition.

27
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,990
In this case, I've got username
right here in my controller.

28
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:16,330
So I'll replace Richard K
with user.username.

29
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,680
Make sure that you surround this
with double curly braces so

30
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,440
Angular will realize it's an expression.

31
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,827
Now I'll update these last ones.

32
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:30,799
And now we have an Angular template that
contains dynamic expressions that get

33
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,190
their data from a controller.
