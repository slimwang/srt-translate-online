1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is most definitely not.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This protocol depends on the integrity of the messages received.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
One easy way to see how it can fail is if an active attacker can change the value

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
of ya to 1 and change the value of yb to 1,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
then Alice and Bob will still agree on a key but that key would be 1 raised to their secret power,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
which is still 1.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It would be the key value 1, which would be known to the eaves dropper

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and make all messages encrypted using that key vulnerable.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The attacker could also intercept that protocol here

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and separately execute the protocol with each party.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This would make Alice think that she has a secure key with Bob,

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
but it's actually a secure key shared with an attacker in the middle.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It would make Bob that that he has a secure key with Alice,

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
but it's actually a key shared with an attacker in the middle.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That means the attacker in the middle could take a message that Alice encrypts

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
with this key that's actually shared with the attacker in the middle,

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
can decrypt that message, can then re-encrypt that message

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
using the key that the attacker shared with Bob and send the result to Bob.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Bob will decrypt it, thinking it's a good message from Alice.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This is a very dangerous attack.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Diffie-Hellman can only be used in places where either the integrity of the channel is guaranteed

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
or there is a way for Bob to find out Alice's ya value and know that it's really Alice.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It could also be useful in the case where there's some trusted directory that has the y values.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Bob could look up Alice's ya value, know the q and the g values,

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
and then Bob would know that he's communicating with Alice if he trusts this directory.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
One way to provide that is using a certificate authority,

27
00:01:40,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which we'll talk about in unit 5.
