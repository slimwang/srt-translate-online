00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,380
Your final challenge should
you choose to except it

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,880
is to draw the Sierpinski Triangle.

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:11,560
I offer no hints beyond the fact that
shape render has a very convenient

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:16,920
triangle function and that using a fit

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,110
Good luck and check out the solution
project if you get stuck.

00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,640
Last fractal, I promise.
