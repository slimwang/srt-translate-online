1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,850
Out of four choices,
which one did you pick, David?

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:03,960
>> So, I picked the first one, but

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,162
I think there's actually
two correct answers.

4
00:00:06,162 --> 00:00:07,060
What we're looking for

5
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,050
is something else in S1 that has
a negation in another sentence.

6
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,040
Not has wings has a negation in S2,

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,750
so we could resolve on S2 with
the not has wings portion of S1.

8
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,460
Has fur also has a negation in S3.

9
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,560
So we could also resolve on S3 and
the has fur portion of S1.

10
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,100
>> This is right, David.

11
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,290
At the end of this, we're left with
null, which is a contradiction.

12
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:33,390
Therefore, an assumption
that is not bird is false.

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,720
Therefore, it must be a bird and

14
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,920
the robot has just proved
that this must be a bird.

15
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,580
Note what we have done.

16
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,810
We have mechanized parts of logic.

17
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,430
And sort of coming up
with large truth tables.

18
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,110
And it's sort of coming up with
complex chains of inference

19
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,830
based on modus ponens and modus tollens.

20
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,484
We have found in our garden
resolutions are improving,

21
00:00:56,484 --> 00:01:01,110
which is a efficient way of proving
sentences and the truth values.

22
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,290
This is how it works.

23
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,209
Take all the sentence and

24
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:06,990
the knowledge base,
convert them into conjecture novel form.

25
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,670
Take what you want to prove and
its negation.

26
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,470
Put that as a new sentence.

27
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,220
Now, starting with this particular
sentence, a new sentence.

28
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,290
Find the literal in another sentence
on which you can resolve, and

29
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:24,160
keep on doing it until you find a null
condition, which is a contradiction.

30
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,310
If you don't find a null condition,
if you don't find a contradiction,

31
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,910
that means that what you
started with cannot be proved.
