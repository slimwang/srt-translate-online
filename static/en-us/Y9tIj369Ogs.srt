All three of these are accurate. After a year or two of under stimulation, a

toddler's brain is both smaller and less active than a typical toddler who was

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,390
stimulated. Underdeveloped neural growth translates to cognitive and

00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:17,476
intellectual deficit, such as lower IQ. This can be seen even when all

00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:23,720
nutritional needs are met, but the social or physical simulation is lacking.

00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,848
You'll see children who are severely delayed in development. In one interesting

case, a girl has adopted grew eight inches in about a year as compared to

normal two inches, given that human in social creatures. This shows how we not

only need food but we need each other
