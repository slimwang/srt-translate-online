1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,820
To build applications that
use Google Play services,

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,640
you need a development environment.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,410
And to install the development
environment there's two

4
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,109
main things that you'd need.

5
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:09,850
First, is Android studio.

6
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,300
You can download Android studio
from the developer.google.com site.

7
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,180
When you install Android studio,

8
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,360
you get the ability to use the Android
SDK Manager, that you can see here.

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,510
And using the Android SDK Manager,

10
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,120
you should install
the Google Play Services SDK.

11
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,500
You'll see it as an item on the list,
under extras,

12
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,820
near the bottom of the screen.

13
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,560
Make sure that you install
the most recent version of this.

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,800
I would also recommend that you take a
look at the Android Fundamentals courses

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,450
offered by Udacity.

16
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:36,890
There are two of them at the moment, and

17
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,540
I strongly recommend that
you at least take the first.

18
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,010
And it's really not a bad idea
to take the second as well.

19
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,363
These will give you a head start
in Android development and

20
00:00:44,363 --> 00:00:47,208
teach you many of the concepts that
we'll be covering in this course.
