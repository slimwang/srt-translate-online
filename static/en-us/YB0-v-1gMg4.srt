00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,480
The frequent garbage collection
events are the result of two things.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,420
Number one, each cell value
concatenation requires the creation of

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,870
a new character array and

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,840
this is compounded by it occurring
in rapid succession within the loop.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,740
So, it's also this one.

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,930
Now, you can also confirm this character
array bloat via allocation tracker.

7
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:17,739
We're going to go ahead and

8
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:19,790
improve the code and let's see
what happens in the next video.
