[Evans] We're only going to have 1 quiz in this unit,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and the quiz is something that should sound like a fairly simple question,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
although it's actually quite difficult to answer.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The question is, what kind of thing is computer science?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Your choices are engineering, science, and liberal art.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Check as many as you want.
