00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,570
One kind of educational technology that
people are probably very familiar with

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,450
is educational games,
or game based learning.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,380
These are games that are developed
not just to be fun and engaging but

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,360
also to teach some material.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,670
I grew up on educational games.

6
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,080
I remember things like
Super Solvers to Operation Neptune.

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,440
And they're still some
of my favorite games.

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,780
And the real power of those games is
that the learning in those games is very

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,810
authentic.

10
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,620
They find a way to take the material
they want you to learn, and

11
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,260
make a game out of that material.

12
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,330
And that's where educational games
can really have a lot of power,

13
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,650
is when they make the real
material itself come to life.

14
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,340
But there can also be a dark
side of game-based learning.

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,953
If what we make into the game is
not authentic to the material,

16
00:00:37,953 --> 00:00:40,265
if we just kind of staple on
things like achievements and

17
00:00:40,265 --> 00:00:41,740
badges onto a learning activity.

18
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,616
We risk creating very inauthentic
motivation around that learning

19
00:00:45,616 --> 00:00:46,680
activity.

20
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,963
So when we talk about game based
learning we're really going to focus on

21
00:00:49,963 --> 00:00:53,300
how we can make the authentic parts of
the material come out in an engaging

22
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:53,916
and fun way.

23
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:58,194
As opposed to stapling on gaming
conventions just to make the activity

24
00:00:58,194 --> 00:01:02,480
more fun, but ultimately not make
the fun authentic to the material.
