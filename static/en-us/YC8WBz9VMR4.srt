1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,870
We earlier discussed quality measures,
and now you'll see why.

2
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:09,480
Providers demonstrate that they have
achieved Meaningful Use Stage One

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,970
by submitting measures in three
categories, core measures,

4
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:17,830
menu set measures, and
clinical quality measures.

5
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,240
There are 15 mandatory core measures.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,831
Providers must also submit
five of ten menu set measures,

7
00:00:25,831 --> 00:00:30,020
as well as six clinical
quality measures.

8
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,790
Three of these are mandatory, and

9
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,079
providers can select the other
three from a list of 41.

10
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:41,200
The core measures are divided
into the four groups shown here.

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,010
Improve quality, safety, and efficiency,
and reduce health disparities.

12
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,510
Engage patients and families.

13
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,150
Improve care coordination and
privacy and security.
