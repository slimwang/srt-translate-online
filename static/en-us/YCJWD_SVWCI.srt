00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,107
Now that we have an expression for x, we are moving closer to simplifying and

2
00:00:04,107 --> 00:00:08,217
finding a final solution. How many real roots do you think the equation will

3
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:12,206
have? Try simplifying this expression we have x equal to, and see how many

4
00:00:12,206 --> 00:00:14,262
answers you know how to get from that.
