1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,666
So now, we've got a simple mechanical solution and we've written out a pseudo

2
00:00:03,666 --> 00:00:07,018
code. So now, we're ready to start coding but we should think carefully about

3
00:00:07,018 --> 00:00:10,390
how to do that. So now, the question is what should we do first? The choices

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,414
are, we should write the days between dates procedure that solves the whole

5
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:17,388
problem. We should write a next day procedure that takes a current date given as

6
00:00:17,388 --> 00:00:21,119
a year, month, and a day, and returns the next day. But only deal with simple

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,818
cases. Let's assume all months have the same number of days. We should write an

8
00:00:24,818 --> 00:00:28,704
isLeapYyear procedure that takes a year and returns true or false, determining

9
00:00:28,704 --> 00:00:32,414
if that year is a leap year. Or we should write a daysInMonth procedure that

10
00:00:32,414 --> 00:00:35,886
takes a month and returns the number of days in that month. This is quite a

11
00:00:35,886 --> 00:00:39,055
subjective question. You could certainly make an argument for at least two of

12
00:00:39,055 --> 00:00:42,081
these answers. But I want you to try and figure out which one is the best

13
00:00:42,081 --> 00:00:42,473
answer.
