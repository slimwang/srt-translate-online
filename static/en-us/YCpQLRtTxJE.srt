At the end of each lesson, there'll be
an exercise called networking with you.

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:05,760
In networking with you,

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,348
I want you to synthesize and organize
what you've learned in this lesson.

4
00:00:10,348 --> 00:00:13,510
I also want to provide you
the opportunity to give us feedback

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,120
on how we can improve the lesson.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,750
