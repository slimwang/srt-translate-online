1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,780
Congratulations!

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:03,760
You've reached the end of the course.

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,180
Well, the course videos anyway.

4
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,740
Now if you remember nothing else,

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,670
here's what I would say is
the biggest idea of this class.

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:12,910
When it comes to algorithm and

7
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,740
data structure design,
there is life after RAM.

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,030
In this course,
you lived three such lives.

9
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:24,290
In the form of PRAMs, distributed memory
machines, and two-level memories.

10
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:28,200
And of course you'll need, in the
afterlife, hybrid models that mix and

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,140
match any of these.

12
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,680
The main point is that there
are ways to formalize and

13
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,860
reason about communication,
which you now know.

14
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,150
So good work, you!

15
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:42,190
As for what comes next, remember
that this class was mostly about

16
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,720
algorithmic and data structure
foundations, meaning theory.

17
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,680
But there's a whole other side to HBC
which is about how do you make these

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,110
ideas actually work on real machines?

19
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,560
Many projects give you a little
bit of a flavor of this but

20
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,350
there's a lot more to it.

21
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,428
It's an especially complex topic and
one which I've wasted,

22
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:05,500
not wasted, spent,
think positive, think positive.

23
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,200
The bulk of my career thinking about.

24
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,330
So who knows?

25
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,060
Maybe you'll join me in another course
where we can spend some time together

26
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:13,820
thinking about that.

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,260
That sound like a pick up line?

28
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,760
Oops.

29
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,540
Awkward.
