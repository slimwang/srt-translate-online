00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,400
So, if you look this up using your
favorite search engine or online

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,470
encyclopedia or other reference work,
these are the answers you should find.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:12,280
A CNAME record is what's used to make
an alias from one name to another, and

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,690
it actually stands for canonical name.

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,100
It means that the canonical or

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,360
official name for this name is
actually something else it's an alias.

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,100
Now an AAAA record is the IPv6
equivalent of an a record.

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,750
It's an address,
it's just an IPv6 address.

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,780
The name is kind of a joke,

10
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,890
since v6 addresses are four
times longer than v4 addresses.

11
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:34,960
That's how I always think of this.

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,110
And lastly,
the NS record type is a DNS name server.

13
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,340
An NS record for
a particular domain says

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,270
what DNS servers have the records for
that domain.
