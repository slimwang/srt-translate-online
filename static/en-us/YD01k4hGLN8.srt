00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,238
Okay. Are you ready for the answer, here it goes. So, you have 1, 2, 3, 4

2
00:00:04,238 --> 00:00:08,532
lines, and I didn't pick up my pen. This task is important because it

3
00:00:08,532 --> 00:00:13,521
demonstrates a very important principle of creative thinking. You have to break

4
00:00:13,521 --> 00:00:17,486
out of your mental perceptual limits, these limits you might not even realize

5
00:00:17,486 --> 00:00:22,419
you have. We were going to discuss a little bit more when we talk about problem

6
00:00:22,419 --> 00:00:27,276
solving. But here, if you struggled with this, you probably didn't realize you

7
00:00:27,276 --> 00:00:32,351
impose a square on the nine dots, like this. A lot of people who struggle with

8
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:36,958
this try to stay within the box. This is a very literal example of thinking

9
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:41,508
outside of the box. If you think about things differently, from a different

10
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:46,673
perspective, you may come up with a creative solution. Breaking outside of your

11
00:00:46,673 --> 00:00:50,918
self-imposed mental limits. Highly creative people do this intuitively,

12
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:55,030
automatically. For more problems like this and to demonstrate how creative

13
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,336
thinking can be assessed, go to the website we put in the instructor's

14
00:00:58,336 --> 00:01:00,189
comments.
