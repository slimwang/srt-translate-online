1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,851
So, for example, what would the volume of the box be if these cut lengths, the

2
00:00:04,851 --> 00:00:09,660
distance x in our diagram, were 1 inch long? Well, since we know that the cut

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,607
size, x, is the input for our function, we will just calculate v of 1. And plug

4
00:00:14,607 --> 00:00:19,442
in 1 in the spot of x. After some simplification, we would see that the volume

5
00:00:19,442 --> 00:00:24,130
of the box, measured in inches cubed, would be 15. That's pretty interesting,

6
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:28,610
but one piece of information isn't enough to figure out what the best cut size

7
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:33,337
is. And remember, Athena wants to maximize the volume of her box. So let's try a

8
00:00:33,337 --> 00:00:38,008
few different values. So, I've already filled in the volume of the box that

9
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:42,564
would result if the cut size was 1 inch. And I'd like you to fill in the other

10
00:00:42,564 --> 00:00:47,163
four volumes that are left over for the other 4 cut sizes that are left over.
