1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,820
So we talked to Muriel about
vitamins versus painkillers, and

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,620
I wanted to ask you this same question.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,180
What do you think is better for

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,930
an entrepreneur when he
thinks about types of ideas.

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,430
Vitamins or painkillers?

6
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,260
>> It's funny.
I don't really think about it in those

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,720
terms, but I guess the way I think
about it is kind of the same way.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,640
I would say the pain killer
is a much bigger deal.

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,450
But even more than the pain killer, I
think you want like a life saving drug.

10
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,810
>> Right.
>> You want something that someone

11
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:29,900
really, really needs.

12
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,400
My partner Paul Buheight said way
better to build something that

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,950
a few people love than a lot
of people sort of like.

14
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,800
>> Right.
>> And so that's what we look for.

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,340
It's something that people really,
really want.

16
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,580
Because those are going to be your
initial core of passionate users

17
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,330
who are going to engage
with you sufficiently

18
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,500
to help you develop your product and
make it better.

19
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,810
If you just have something
that people kind of like,

20
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,570
they'll use it a couple of times and
then they'll go away.

21
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,670
And if your initial users just go away,
you're left with a ghost town.

22
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,720
>> Right.
>> I think that the biggest challenge

23
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,300
for startups, people talk about, you
know, you are going to run out of money.

24
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,489
You're going to this or that..

25
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,760
I think the biggest problems that most
startups have, you run out of time.

26
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,560
And part of the reason you run out
of time is because you're fighting

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,190
the apathy of the market.

28
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,210
It's not that people know about you and
don't like you,

29
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,720
it's that no one has
any idea who you are.

30
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,570
And if you solve something that is
a really deep pain for someone,

31
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,660
they're going to talk about you.

32
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,150
So forget all the conversation about
viral marketing, this kind of marketing,

33
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,710
that kind of marketing, these tactics.

34
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:34,200
If you solve something really important
to someone, they're going to mention it.

35
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,730
>> Can you give me an example
of a vitamin and a painkiller?

36
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,320
>> Yeah, I think that again it's this

37
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,340
idea of it's different things for
different people.

38
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:52,450
I think Stripe's a pretty good
example of the pain killer.

39
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,530
Integrating payments into a website.

40
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,780
Is such a big pain in the butt
without something like Stripe.

41
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:05,280
I remember when we integrated PayPal it
took days and weeks just to like, they

42
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,960
didn't even have developer documents
that you could read in any kind of way.

43
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,500
>> Right
>> And it took weeks and

44
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,350
to get this and the that and
the other thing.

45
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,490
It was a nightmare.

46
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,130
Stripe's a couple lines of code and
you have payment set up.

47
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,050
For some people, if you're not building
a website that seems like a vitamin.

48
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,700
It seems like a nice to have.

49
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:27,460
But in terms of supportability, and all
these things, and ease of use, that's

50
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,711
a huge painkiller for anyone building
something for e-commerce, honestly.

51
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:32,660
>> Very cool.

52
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:37,200
>> In terms of vitamins, I don't know,
there's kind of a lot of them.

53
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,960
Not to say and some of them are probably
really successful companies or

54
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,380
become successful over time, but

55
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,420
I think that they are,
they don't scale quite as quickly.

56
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:52,621
You know an incremental hair
dresser closer to your house.

57
00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:53,190
>> Right.

58
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,763
>> You know five miles
closer is a vitamin.

59
00:02:54,763 --> 00:02:56,910
>> Right.
>> You can drive another five mile.

60
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,800
When it comes to software,
there are a lot of things out there.

61
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,720
If you look at the app charts,
you probably see a lot of them.
