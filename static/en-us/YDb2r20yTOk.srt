1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,350
So, now we've had the chance to
explore market segmentation.

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,905
We're going to advice into some
exercises, and we want you to be able to

3
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:08,167
be involved, even if you don't
have an idea of your own yet.

4
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:12,540
So, Ronnie and I have some exciting
news we want to share with you.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,655
We decided to create Embarkment.

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,820
>> Like many entrepreneurs,
our idea came passion and need.

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,640
Lauren is obsessed with dogs.

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,880
>> That's very true.

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,000
>> And I'm passionate about finding
good, safe, and fun place for

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,620
my dog to stay while I travel for work.

11
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,960
>> So, Ronnie needs reliable and
affordable place for a dog,

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,640
and I need to spend more time with dogs,
because I can't have my own right now.

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,200
Plus, I could use the extra cash.

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,940
>> We figured we were not alone in
how we felt and what we needed.

15
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,255
So we decided to create Embarkmetn,
a safe home for your dog to stay in with

16
00:00:43,255 --> 00:00:46,418
people who are excited to spend time
with your dog while you're away.

17
00:00:46,418 --> 00:00:48,210
>> So the idea is simple.

18
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,909
You sign up for our app, as either a
sitter and tell us your availability and

19
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:55,043
about the environment you'll be
keeping the visiting dog in.

20
00:00:55,043 --> 00:00:58,804
>> Or, sign up as an owner, and tell us
what you're looking for in a sitter and

21
00:00:58,804 --> 00:01:00,590
when you'll be away.

22
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,129
We will match you with the best sitter
for your dog at a reasonable price.

23
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:06,900
>> So, we need to use market
segmentation to come up with

24
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,240
a marketing plan.

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,120
>> Obviously the first should
be sitters versus owners.

26
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,090
But even within each of these,

27
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,220
we have to understand who are the
different users and who to focus on.

28
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,450
>> Why don't you join our team and

29
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,180
help us conduct a market
segmentation for Embarkment?

30
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,850
You can start with one practice
of market segmentation and

31
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,980
then try another until you have
a solid segmentation of the market.
