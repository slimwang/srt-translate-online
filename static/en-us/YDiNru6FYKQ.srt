2
00:00:22,557 --> 00:00:23,495
All right, JP.

3
00:00:23,495 --> 00:00:25,710
The developer just finished
up the validation rules.

4
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,900
And I know that you've got
your flight to Hawaii, and

5
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,000
I've got some rest and
relaxation to catch up on.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,780
So, I can finally close this
pesky rules file, right?

7
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,760
>> Well, I mentioned authentication,
authorization, and validation.

8
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,200
You've done two of three.

9
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,160
>> JP, you're killing I me.

10
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,620
More rules?

11
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,930
Then, I guess those validation
rules are pretty important, and

12
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,010
the data is looking a lot cleaner.

13
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:50,710
>> Right, and

14
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:54,010
remember none of the validation rules
are checked when something is deleted.

15
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,550
Meaning someone could just delete the
whole database with some JavaScript and

16
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,800
also, what's the point of having
someone log in without validation?

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,820
>> Okay, okay,
then I guess the developer and

18
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,489
I could read up a little
bit more on authorization.
