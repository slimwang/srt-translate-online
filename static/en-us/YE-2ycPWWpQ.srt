1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Thrun] So this is a difficult question.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Let me compute an auxiliary variable, which is P of happiness.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That one is expanded by looking at the different conditions that can make us happy.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
P of happiness given S and R

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
times P of S and R, which is of course the product of those 2

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
because they are independent,

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
plus P of happiness given not S R, probability of not as R

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
plus P of H given S and not R

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
times the probability of P of S and not R plus the last case,

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
P of H given not S and not R.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So this just looks at the happiness under all 4 combinations of the variables

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
that can lead to happiness.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And you can plug those straight in.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This one over here is 1, and this one over here is the product of S and R,

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
which is 0.7 times 0.01.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And as you plug all of those in,

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
you get as a result 0.5245.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That's P of H.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Just take some time and do the math by going through these different cases

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
using total probability, and you get this result.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Armed with this number, the rest now becomes easy,

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
which is we can use Bayes' rule to turn this around.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
P of H given R times P of R over P of H.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
P of R we know from over here, the probability of a raise is 0.01.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So the only thing we need to compute now is P of H given R.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And again, we apply total probability.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Let me just do this over here.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We can factor P of H given R as P of H given R and S, sunny,

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
times probability of sunny plus P of H given R and not sunny

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
times the probability of not sunny.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And if you plug in the numbers with this, you get 1 times 0.7

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
plus 0.9 times 0.3.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That happens to be 0.97.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So if we now plug this all back into this equation over here,

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:45,000
we get 0.97 times 0.01 over 0.5245.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This gives us approximately as the correct answer 0.0185.
