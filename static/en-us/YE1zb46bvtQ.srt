00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,680
What if you did the following?

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,500
Consider each sink.

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,870
If the sink is at the end of an edge
that goes from a parent to a child,

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,650
then that means you're
descending into the tree.

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,950
So, let's put a +1 at those sinks.

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,900
Intuitively, the +1 signal
an increase in the level count.

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:22,790
The remaining sinks terminate edges
that go from a child to a parent.

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,090
Those nodes correspond
to decreasing the level.

9
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,200
So let's place -1 values at them.

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,340
To see if this works,
let's run a list scan.

11
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,460
Notice that as you descend,
you pick up +1 values.

12
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,630
And as you ascend,
you pick up -1 values.

13
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,620
So now to get the final result, we just
need to keep all the starred nodes.

14
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,240
If you do that,
this is what you should get.
