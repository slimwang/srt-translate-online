1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,545
If you haven't downloaded the Color
Maker Project yet, go ahead and

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:04,226
do that now.

3
00:00:04,226 --> 00:00:06,070
You'll find it in the instructor notes.

4
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:09,656
Then when you open the project in Xcode,
you'll notice that the code inside

5
00:00:09,656 --> 00:00:11,966
the view controller is
already written for you.

6
00:00:11,966 --> 00:00:15,749
Have a close look at this
change color component action.

7
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:20,751
You can see that it uses all four of
the outlets that are used in this app.

8
00:00:20,751 --> 00:00:22,363
All in this one method.

9
00:00:22,363 --> 00:00:24,429
Let's see what happens
when we run the app.

10
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:30,150
There are switches, they look okay, but
they're not actually doing anything.

11
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,505
I can't say that's all that surprising.

12
00:00:32,505 --> 00:00:36,489
Because if you look here you can see
that none of these outlets are actually

13
00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:37,202
connected.

14
00:00:37,202 --> 00:00:40,338
If you look at these circles
in the left margin, I mean.

15
00:00:40,338 --> 00:00:42,690
Connect the actions and
outlets in Color Maker and

16
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,380
choose the option that best
describes your experience.
