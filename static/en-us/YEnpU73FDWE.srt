1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,520
As you can see from Liz's story,
programming skills can impact anyone.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,520
As for my story, I became
interested in programming because I

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,580
thought it would enhance my
roles as a teacher and a dancer.

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,890
But eventually, I came to a crossroads.

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:16,320
I wasn't sure whether I wanted to
pursue a career as a programmer or

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,414
stay a teacher, so I decided to do both.

7
00:00:18,414 --> 00:00:20,850
You may be at a similar
point in your journey.

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,820
The next few lessons will explore
four specific careers within

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,600
the technology industry.

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,770
There are certainly more paths
within the programming world,

11
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,630
and you may even decide to
go in a different direction.

12
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,900
In any case, every industry
is affected by technology.

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,020
By having a better understanding of
what goes into computer programmers,

14
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,580
you can shape the tools
that impact the world.

15
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,280
Let's follow Anthony on his journey
through the world of programming.
