1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:06,300
So far, we have inspected the various variables of interest in the data.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,980
We have looked at the allowed amount, charged amount and the payment amounts.

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,760
Now we will ask the question of correlations.

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,210
In asking if the variables are correlated,

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:24,110
we can ask if the correlation is non-linear or if the correlation is linear.

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:30,140
We can inspect this by looking at a scatter diagram of the variables.

7
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:38,800
Let us now inspect the scatter diagram of the two variables, f1 and f2.

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,500
Notice that we have plotted both the variables after scaling them.

9
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,750
Once you're done, you should have a graph that looks very much like this.

10
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:55,610
The scatter plot for these two variables are very linear.

11
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:59,970
What we can conclude from that is that the paid amounts are directly

12
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,020
proportional to the allowed amounts.

13
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:08,750
Similarly, we can look at the scatter plot of f0 and f1.

14
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,140
In this case, although we have some correlation,

15
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:16,620
it is not as linear as it is between f1 and f2.

16
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,560
We want to have a quantitative measurement of the correlation between

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,150
two variables.

18
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,610
We have already observed from the scatter plot of f1 and

19
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:29,410
f2 that they're linearly correlated.

20
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:33,500
We can calculate what is called the Pearson's correlation coefficient.

21
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,580
Let's first define this quantity.
