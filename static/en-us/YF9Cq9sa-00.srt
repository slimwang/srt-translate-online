1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,610
I'll take 1000 milliseconds and
divide it by 60 frames

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:08,670
per 1000 milliseconds and I'll get
about 16 milliseconds per frame.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,910
This means that in order to achieve
a silky smooth 60 frames per second,

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,080
you need to keep all of the work in
making the frame under 16 milliseconds.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,580
But actually, the browser also has some
housekeeping work to do in every frame.

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,460
So realistically, you have somewhere in
the region of 10 to 12 milliseconds to

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,960
get everything done and
make sure the frame arrives on time.
