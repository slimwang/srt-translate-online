1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:01,740
Well done.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:02,680
You've made it through to the end,

3
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,170
and you've learned a lot about
prototyping and user reasearch.

4
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,820
Now that you've learned how to iterate,
how to bring on team members and

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,850
how to share your project, you're
ready to do the work on your own app.

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,219
Remember that this work can be done many
times over to get yourself to a great

7
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,590
finished product, and that you should
expect to throw out many early versions

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,090
to find one that resonates
with your users.

9
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,600
Once you've done this work, you'll
still need to actually build your app.

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,590
But that part of it will go way more
smoothly with this prep work complete.

11
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,400
By listening to users before
you build the app itself,

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,410
you can be sure you're creating
a great experience for them.

13
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,800
Now get out there and start prototyping.
