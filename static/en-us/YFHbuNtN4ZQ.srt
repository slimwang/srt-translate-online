1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,680
Now it's time to use your app and

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,570
see the usage data show
up in Google Analytics.

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:09,080
You can use the emulator in Android
Studio or your own Android device.

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,470
It's okay to use the emulator, but

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,889
it might not send data back
what device it's emulating.

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,710
I like to use a real device.

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,740
Make sure your device is
connected to Android Studio, and

8
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,960
click the Run button to run your app.

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,380
Make sure the app's running
on your phone, or tablet, or

10
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,620
whatever you're using.

11
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,160
Then click through to
a few different screens.

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,590
Make sure to switch the phone between
portrait and landscape, a few times too.

13
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,280
Okay, as you do these tasks,
go ahead and check the boxes.

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,490
Make sure, of course,
that your project compiles.

15
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,760
Make sure you went to some
different activities and

16
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,120
check here when you're done.

17
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,610
Then go ahead and
try the app in both orientations.

18
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:50,110
Do it in portrait and in landscape mode.

19
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,730
We're doing this so that we can
get the different orientations and

20
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,990
screen sizes to show
up in the dashboard.
