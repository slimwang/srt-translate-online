00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,650
Welcome back to Computer Vision.

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:05,490
Today we're going to talk about finding corners,

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,810
which might not feel like the most exciting thing in the world, but

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,630
actually it is fundamental to a whole bunch of computer vision.

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:16,379
Last time we talked a lot about the notion of features, and features were

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,890
sort of locations, in the image that you could find in multiple images so

7
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:25,070
you could match them, whether you were doing, essential matrix finding or

8
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,900
some other reason or some, transformation.

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,080
And we talked a little bit about what makes a good feature.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,210
So here was an example of some feature points.

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,550
The first thing that makes a good feature is simply repeatability.

12
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,230
Slash decision, but really repeatability,

13
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,420
meaning if I find you in the left image, I better find you in the right image.

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,960
Or if I have a sequence of images that I'm trying to line,

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,680
I want to find that same feature point.

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,650
I want to detect it as a point in as many of them as possible.

17
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,510
The other thing is that I should be able to be sort of

18
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:54,840
precise in my description.

19
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,630
We'll talk a little bit more about locality in a minute, but

20
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:00,330
the idea is that you know, this is the point, I find it every time, and

21
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,940
I find it more or less in the same place, with respect to the scene.

22
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,180
The next thing we said bu needed to be important about a feature was

23
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,430
the saliency or the matchability and

24
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,810
what we mean by that is, that it should have a description that's distinctive.

25
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,020
So when I find it in one image, when I look in another image,

26
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,280
there aren't a lot of other points that might match that first image, the,

27
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,780
the description should be distinctive.

28
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:26,850
Something that we sometimes forget is that one of the reasons we're doing this,

29
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,640
finding these features, is that we're going to use this,

30
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,000
remember I think I used the term constellation of features.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,740
This collection of features, is going to stand in for the image.

32
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,450
So, if you remember for fundamental matrices we

33
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,160
needed eight points although a dozen or more is better, at 20.

34
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,490
But the idea is that this is a number much smaller than the number of pixels, so

35
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,940
compactness and efficiency says we should find good features, but

36
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,270
we should not find a bazillion of them, or even half a bazillion.

37
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,430
We should find enough, but not too many.

38
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,050
How's that for a technical description?

39
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,660
But the idea is that you're finding enough.

40
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,730
But it's much, much less than a number of pixels.

41
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,380
And finally locality.

42
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:12,530
And locality means that, the description of the feature is,

43
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,510
dependent upon a neighborhood, but not too big a neighborhood.

44
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:22,050
If you remember one of the reasons we said that is that if.

45
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,110
If the neighborhood is too big, then if I change my view point a little bit and

46
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,860
something's occluding part of that, even though I can still see the feature,

47
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,010
the neighborhood might have been partially occluded and then the feature

48
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,030
might not be detected anymore or, or not described the same way.

49
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,480
So locality means that I want a descriptor based upon a region around it,

50
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,440
but not too big a region.
