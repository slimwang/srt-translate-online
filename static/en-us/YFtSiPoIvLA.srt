00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,670
So we know a game icon should give
people an idea of your game content.

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,920
But screenshots let you
show them in detail.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,940
The best screenshots show what's
unique and fun about your game.

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,880
Here are some good screenshots
from the game Temple Run.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,790
The very first image is of the main
character running away from something

6
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,440
into a temple.

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,780
It shows all the main aspects of
the game, a character who runs and

8
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,550
collects coins, with a clean visual.

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,340
The second image emphasizes a detail,
the coins that we saw in the first

10
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,890
image, and the text hopefully
explains what they do.

11
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,210
And the third screenshot
shows a special feature.

12
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,440
And you'll notice that all of
these images have some text that

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,240
helps describe the images.

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,880
In general you'll want to
communicate visually, but

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,300
it's okay to have some supporting text
that doesn't take away from the image.

16
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,180
After someone looks
at your screen shots,

17
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,690
if they're still on the fence,
they'll read your game description.

18
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,050
The description should be clear and
short and

19
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,520
talk about your game's main features.

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,310
For example, Temple Run's description
gives a bit of back story

21
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:07,500
about the player running away from
demon monkeys and collecting coins, and

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,720
then goes on to describe how to
play the game with swipes and taps.

23
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,350
It describes the gameplay,
goals, and obstacles.

24
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,360
So use your screenshots and

25
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,090
description wisely to describe gameplay,
goals, and obstacles.
