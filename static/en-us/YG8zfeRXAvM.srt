00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,956
Oh, hey there.

2
00:00:02,956 --> 00:00:06,335
well, it would be a lot easier to
keep track of all these animals,

3
00:00:06,335 --> 00:00:07,820
if we had a database of them.

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,190
You know,
I'll bet real zoo's do that too.

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,960
Keep records of all of
the animals that live there, and

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,620
what they need to eat, and so on.

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,700
And if they're not using
a relational database for

00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,260
that, well, I think they should.

00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,960
So, let's see how they might do that.
