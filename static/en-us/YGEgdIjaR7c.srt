1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,520
So the expected running time is O(4/3)^n*n raised to the power of some constant

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,930
divided by a polynomial of n, and actually, we can combine these two terms here

3
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,150
because this is a polynomial of n and this is a polynomial of n,

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,460
which we can simply write as n to the power of some constant.

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:22,220
Now, finally, let's see if you remember the use of O notation correctly.

6
00:00:22,220 --> 99:59:59,999
What does that equal.
