1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,300
Another option is this kind of manage posting.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,780
This kind of industry is changing right now.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,540
It used to be the case just a few years ago that you would rent machines from

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,170
a data center, like, these machines would already be installed and

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,440
configured and you could just, you know, rent five of them.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,530
Could do all of this online.

7
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,050
And the industry's changed a little bit.

8
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,320
This is kind of new system of dealing with this which is basically kind of

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,700
this match hosting cloud set up.

10
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,240
And that's, that's what I'm going to focus on here,

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,600
because the kind of in between guys aren't nearly as popular as they used to be.

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,790
So these are players like AWS.

13
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:30,790
Rackspace, Linode, I think, kind of does this sort of thing.

14
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,280
They're all those, these are the ones I've hear of.

15
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,320
Reddit and Hitmonth both use AWS, it's my personal favorite.

16
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,650
Generally the idea is you are renting machines.

17
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,850
In the case of Amazon, I can't speak for others, you rent machines by the hour.

18
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,100
So we pay $.10 an hour or something for our machines on Amazon.

19
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,060
You don't have to think too much about bandwidth and power.

20
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,220
You don't think about power at all.

21
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,610
Bandwidth you generally pay some amount for.

22
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,660
You can install the operating system if you want.

23
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,100
More likely you're just configuring the OS, not installing it.

24
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,560
You're in the system where your machines can just kind of disappear.

25
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,400
If your machines fail, the hosts may bring up a new machine for you or

26
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,240
they may notify you or you can write scripts to automate this whole thing.

27
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,750
This is the area where I like to live personally.

28
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,930
Still get control over your machines in the sense that you can,

29
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,490
you know exactly what software is installed, what versions are installed,

30
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:10,990
what kernel is installed, all of that stuff.

31
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:14,390
But you don't have to deal with actually installing this machines in a rack and

32
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,580
replacing them by hand and doing the physical work.

33
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,360
It's all virtual.

34
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,790
I've never seen the service that host Reddit and Hitmonth.

35
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,815
With Reddit we started out renting a few machines from this manage

36
00:01:23,815 --> 00:01:27,870
hostings provider, kind of pre-Amazon pre-Rackspace seven years ago.

37
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,860
Then we started co-locating our own machines and then when Amazon,

38
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,060
AWS, Amazon Web Services came out, that's when Reddit switched to Amazon.

39
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,260
In the office, in the Reddit office,

40
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,530
there's a bunch of physical machines sitting under a desk that used to

41
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:39,250
actually run Reddit.

42
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,630
20, 30 machines, whatever there were.
