00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,002
So here's what we know so far. We took the equation of our ellipse and we

2
00:00:04,002 --> 00:00:09,542
divided it through by 36. We came up with this equation and we just found that

3
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:15,250
the x intercepts were (2,0) and negative 2,0. So, we know these two points are

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,547
on our ellipse. So, now that we found the x intercepts, I want you to see if

5
00:00:19,547 --> 00:00:24,609
you can find the y intercepts. What do you think those two would be?
