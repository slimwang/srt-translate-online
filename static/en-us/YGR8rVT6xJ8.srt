00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,200
The fact that request animation frame, runs once

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,135
and only once during a redraw cycle also

3
00:00:06,135 --> 00:00:10,530
let's the browser optimize concurrent animations. SVG, CSS

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,250
transitions, scrolling, your own dom-based manipulation together, into

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,070
a single reflow and repaint cycle. Rather than,

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,140
each of these poking in in it's own

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,510
timer and updating the screen whenever it feels

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,850
like. This leads to much higher fidelity visual refreshes.

9
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,010
But, in addition to causing all these refreshes together,

10
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,280
this has the effect of locking the updates, to the

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,090
visual refresh rate as a maximum. You won't accidentally

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,325
call your drawing routine more than once during that magic

13
00:00:39,325 --> 00:00:43,920
16.7 millisecond long refresh cycle, which would waste work.

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,180
Request animation frame won't be called again, until the current

15
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,180
frame is pushed out to the screen and it's

16
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,980
ready for another frame. And then finally, there's one more

17
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,620
key feature to request animation frame. Their callback won't

18
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,050
be called, if the browser tab isn't visible. That's,

19
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,600
if you're running the animation loop in a tab

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,360
and the user switiches away, the browser won't keep

21
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,440
calling the visual refresh callback, it will once it's

22
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,618
visible again. But, this means you won't be using

23
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:13,988
the CPU, the GPU or extra memory potentially. Which

24
00:01:13,988 --> 00:01:17,390
will lead to longer battery life on a mobile device.
