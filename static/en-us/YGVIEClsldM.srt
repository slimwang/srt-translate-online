00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:07,180
>> So for A or not B, I got that if A is ever true, then this has to be true,

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:13,260
because it's A or not B. When A is false the negation flips the value of B,

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,420
so it makes it true when B is false, but keeps it false when B is true.

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,340
For not A and not B, that means that any time either A or

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:26,020
B is true, then this is all false. So when A is true, this is false.

6
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:30,370
When B is true, this is false. When both are false, this becomes true,

7
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,770
because those negations flip the values of both A and B.
