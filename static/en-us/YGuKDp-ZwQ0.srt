00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,210
However, solving a problem at one level is not enough. For each piece at

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:09,580
that level, you have a whole picture puzzle at a lower level. This ladder is

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,860
called a refinement of the former. Devising the puzzles at a lower level, and

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,750
ensuring that they satisfy the needs at the upper level is called vertical

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,440
decomposition. Of course the above holds true for each of the top level pieces,

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,250
and for however many levels are involved in your decomposition. So

7
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:31,060
what we really have are a collection of refinements at one level addressing a,

8
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,150
a problem at a higher level.
