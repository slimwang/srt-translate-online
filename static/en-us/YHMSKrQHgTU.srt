00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hi. Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
As you can see from this spread, this lesson is going to be about tools.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Now, we homo sapiens fancy ourselves as tool makers.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We think that's what distinguishes us from the other animals.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In the physical world, we've invented lots of tools.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
These general ones like screw drivers and plyers, you're probably very familiar with,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and some very specific tools--look at this one.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You may not know what this does, but look how nicely it fits into my hand.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Or look at this one. What do you think this one does?

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
If somebody can tell me on the forum what this one does, I'll send them a swell prize.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
or look at this one--surgeons forceps.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Now, these have been refined over the years and now we can refine them

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
where they serve as a third hand.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's got this trick where I can attach it on, and now I don't have to put my hand on it anymore,

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
because it's got a little locking mechanism.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Our tools get better and better over time.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Now, there's a saying that a poor craftsman blames his tools.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I always thought that all that meant was you shouldn't complain, you shouldn't whine,

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
but I realized it means more than that.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It means that the tools become a part of you,

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and if you're a good craftsman then the tools are a part of you.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You know what to do with them, and so you're not going to end up blaming your tools.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That's what we're going to learn in this lesson about software tools.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We're going to learn about some general software tools,

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
about some very specific software tools,

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and specifically, we're going to talk about two.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We're going to talk about, first, language.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Now, language is perhaps homo sapien's greatest invention--our greatest tool.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
In computer programming, well, a computer program is written in a language,

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
but a computer program can also employ language as a tool to do its job.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The other tool we're going to talk about is functions.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Of course, you've been using functions all along,

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
but we're going to talk about new techniques for using functions

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and learn why they're more general and malleable than other tools.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So see you in the lesson.
