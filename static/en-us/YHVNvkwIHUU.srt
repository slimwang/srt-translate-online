1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,670
All right.

2
00:00:00,672 --> 00:00:05,060
For the first one, I'm going to put 3/4 where I see a smiley face. Then, I have

3
00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:09,800
addition and then, I have 1/12 for the diamond. When adding fractions, I need to

4
00:00:09,812 --> 00:00:14,370
get a common denominator. So, I'm going to multiply this first one by 3/3, so, I

5
00:00:14,382 --> 00:00:18,940
get 9/12 + 1/12, 9/12 + 1/12 = 10/12. I can reduce this fraction by dividing by

6
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:23,139
2. And I get 5/6. For this next one, I'm going to replace this smiley face with

7
00:00:23,151 --> 00:00:27,826
3/4, I have subtraction, and then the diamond is 1/12. Again, I need to convert

8
00:00:27,838 --> 00:00:32,281
to a common denominator. Well, I know 3/4 is really 9/12 from the problem

9
00:00:32,293 --> 00:00:37,618
before. So, I have 9/12 minus 1/12. And, when I subtract 9/12 minus 1/12 is

10
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:43,235
8/12. And, the equivalent fraction for 8/12 is 2/3. I divided 8 by 4, and 12 by

11
00:00:43,247 --> 00:00:47,858
4, and I got two-thirds. Here, I replace the smiley face with 3/4, I had

12
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,711
multiplication, and then the diamond is 1/12. I can reduce common factors in the

13
00:00:52,723 --> 00:00:57,043
numerator, and in the denominator, I divide 3 by 3 and I get 1, I divide 12 by 3

14
00:00:57,055 --> 00:01:01,253
and I get 4. When I multiply my fractions across, 1 times 1 is 1, 4 times 4 is

15
00:01:01,265 --> 00:01:06,975
16. And for this last one, I have 3/4 divided by 1/12. Remember, dividing by a

16
00:01:06,987 --> 00:01:11,990
number is the same thing as multiplying by its reciporical. So I have 3/4 times

17
00:01:12,002 --> 00:01:17,009
12/1. I can reduce a common factor of 4, since it appears in the numerator, and

18
00:01:17,021 --> 00:01:21,844
in the denominator. 12 divided by 4 is 3. And 4 divided by 4 is 1. 3 times 3 is

19
00:01:21,856 --> 00:01:26,278
9. 1 times 1 is 1. So I have 9 divided by 1, or 9. Nice work on that quiz.
