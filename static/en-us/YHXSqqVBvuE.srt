00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,713
You've reached the end
of lesson three and

2
00:00:02,713 --> 00:00:06,110
created some fairly complex
API endpoints thus far.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,693
In the next lesson, you will add
some security to your API endpoints,

4
00:00:09,693 --> 00:00:12,734
as you learn to implement token
based authentication, and

5
00:00:12,734 --> 00:00:15,921
rate limiting to control
the bandwidth users have access to.

6
00:00:15,921 --> 00:00:18,009
[SOUND] Thank you.

7
00:00:18,009 --> 00:00:19,550
See you there.
