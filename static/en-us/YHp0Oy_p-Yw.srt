00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,010
Now it's time for a question. I'm showing

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:06,070
you three different structures here for the operating

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:09,220
system. Here are the monolithic structure and here

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,620
is the micro-kernel base structure, and here is the

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,030
spin structure with extensions. And the question to

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,990
you is, which of the above structures will

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,080
result in the least number of border crossings?

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,940
Is it the monolithic structure, is it the micro-kernel

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,940
structure, or the spin structure, or

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,646
either spin or monolithic structure? So, these

11
00:00:31,646 --> 00:00:35,090
are the four choices available to you, for you to pick one correct choice.
