1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So here is my truth table of these eight different outcomes.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The ones that has head exactly once are this one, this one, and this one,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
but they're not all equally likely.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Heads, heads, heads is much more likely than say tails, tails, tails

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
because heads has a probability of 0.8.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This one here has an outcome probability of 0.8³ while this one has an outcome probability of 0.2³.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
All of the green once have the same outcome probability.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
They all have exactly one head 0.8 and two tails.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So as before, we took the probability to be one of these has the truth table.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This time each of those has a probability of 0.032. That's each amount of the three.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Now, we have to consider all of these three outcomes, which means you're going to add 0.032

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
for each one of those three guys over here and this gives me as an answer 0.096.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That's a nontrivial question.
