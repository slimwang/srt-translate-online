1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And here's a somewhat non-trivial quiz.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
For the state B3, calculate the value function

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
assuming that we have a value function as shown over here

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and all the open states have a value of assumed 0,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
because we're still in the beginning of our value update.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What would be our very first value function for B3

7
00:00:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that we compute based on the values shown over here?
