1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,457
So again, in order to figure out how to evaluate each of these expressions, we

2
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:08,864
need to use our order of operations knowledge. We need to remember our PEMDAS.

3
00:00:08,964 --> 00:00:13,069
For this first problem, negative 2 to the third power, we don't have any

4
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:17,602
parentheses, so that means we need to take the exponent into account before the

5
00:00:17,614 --> 00:00:21,958
negative sign. So we have negative 1 times 2 to the third power, which is the

6
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:26,199
same as negative 1 times 8. So we get negative 8. The next problem has some

7
00:00:26,211 --> 00:00:30,467
parethesis in it, so we need to deal with what's inside of those first. And

8
00:00:30,479 --> 00:00:34,987
inside we have negative 2 squared. Just like in this first problem, you need to

9
00:00:34,999 --> 00:00:39,495
do the exponent before the negative sign. So what's inside the parethesis here,

10
00:00:39,595 --> 00:00:44,108
is negative 4, since we have negative 2 squared, which is negative 4. So this

11
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,473
equals 2 times negative 4 which is just negative 8 again. For the third problem,

12
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:52,838
we have an exponent outside of something that is inside of parentheses. SO we

13
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,984
know the negative sign is going to be part of the number that is taken to the

14
00:00:56,996 --> 00:01:01,252
exponent, so the entire quantity negative 2 is squared. So this is equal to 2

15
00:01:01,264 --> 00:01:05,643
times negative 2 times negative 2. Which is the same as 2 times positive 4,

16
00:01:05,748 --> 00:01:10,488
which is positive 8. Again we have a negative sign inside the parenthesis. So

17
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,061
it's part of this number that is taken to the 3rd power. So negative 2 times

18
00:01:15,073 --> 00:01:19,924
negative 2 times negative 2 is negative 8. Here the negative sign comes outside

19
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:24,590
the parenthesis. So you have negative 1 times positive 2 to the 3rd, 2 to the

20
00:01:24,602 --> 00:01:29,850
3rd is 8. And negative 1 times 8 is negative 8. Our last two problems, both fall

21
00:01:29,862 --> 00:01:35,150
into the neither category. 2 plus 2 squared, is just equal to 2 plus 4, which is

22
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:40,125
6. Which is not equal to either 8 or negative 8. And here we have negative 2

23
00:01:40,137 --> 00:01:45,425
squared plus 2 squared. Since there's not a parenthesis around this negative 2,

24
00:01:45,537 --> 00:01:50,767
we know that we need to square 2 before multiplying it by negative 1. So this is

25
00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:54,590
actually equal to negative 4 plus 4, and that's equal to 0. Great job, I know

26
00:01:54,602 --> 00:01:58,359
this a lot to do in 1 quiz, but I think that having to thi nk through all these

27
00:01:58,371 --> 00:02:02,244
different options that are sort of similar to each other could be a really good

28
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:06,046
way to make sure you have your order of operations sense cemented. And if you

29
00:02:06,058 --> 00:02:09,923
don't, not a big deal at all. Remember, just go back and practice a little bit

30
00:02:09,935 --> 00:02:10,163
more.
