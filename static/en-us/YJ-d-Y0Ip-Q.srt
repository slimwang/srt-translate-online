1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,450
So this quiz asked us to write code for
the function word-transformer,

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:10,000
which takes in a string word as input,
and returns a random noun if the input

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,990
word is equal to the string noun, all
capitalized which returns a random verb.

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,960
If input is equal to
verbal all capitalize,

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,570
else we just return
the first character of word.

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:23,480
All right.

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,160
So the first thing we need to
do is return a random noun,

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,130
if our input is equal
noun all capitalized.

9
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,730
We do this by comparing
a word to the string noun.

10
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,350
We'll return a predefined function
random_noun if that's true.

11
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:42,630
Now we have to return a random
verb if our input is equal to

12
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,110
VERB all capitalized.

13
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,470
As you can see the code we wrote for

14
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,830
this is very similar to
checking if a word is noun.

15
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,780
Now we have to write code for
our last case, which is if word wasnâ€™t

16
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,430
equal to Noun or Verb, we just
return the first character of word.

17
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:02,470
As you can see, we did this by using
string indexing, and there we have it.

18
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:06,280
Now we can pass words into our function,
and receive random nouns, verbs, or

19
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,890
first characters.

20
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,680
We've just written a very
important function for

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,900
our bad libs which we'll put
to use in the next quiz.
