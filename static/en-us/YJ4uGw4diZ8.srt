00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,294
So hopefully, this quiz is a little bit easier than the last one we did. What

2
00:00:04,306 --> 00:00:08,526
we're trying to do first, is just identify the terms that have w in them. So,

3
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:12,845
going through our equation up here, we see 36w and 51w. And we can just fill

4
00:00:12,857 --> 00:00:15,067
those in to these first two slots.

5
00:00:15,068 --> 00:00:19,457
Remember that it doesn't matter which order we write them in. It doesn't matter

6
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:23,786
if we write 36w or 51w first, because of the commutative property of addition.

7
00:00:23,884 --> 00:00:28,007
Next we need to identify the n terms, so those are the two that are left, 22n

8
00:00:28,105 --> 00:00:32,350
and 50n. And we just want to write those in these two slots. Again, order does

9
00:00:32,362 --> 00:00:36,613
not matter because we're just going to add everything together. I'm just going

10
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:40,717
to put the 22n first, since 22 happens to be my favorite number. The last step

11
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:44,506
to make this a fully blown equation, is to add in our plus or minus signs

12
00:00:44,518 --> 00:00:48,726
between the terms. Here, in the top equation, every term is positive. We don't

13
00:00:48,738 --> 00:00:52,863
see any negative signs here. So that means that each of these signs is going to

14
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:56,967
be a plus sign. When we switch terms around, there's no change to the value of

15
00:00:56,979 --> 00:00:57,889
each term.

16
00:00:57,892 --> 00:01:01,270
Nothing is going to become negative that used to be positive. So the only thing

17
00:01:01,282 --> 00:01:04,677
that's different about this bottom equation from this top equation is the order

18
00:01:04,688 --> 00:01:06,023
that we've written the terms in.
