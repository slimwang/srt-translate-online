00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,059
Before beginning this lesson, it might
be worth brushing up on a few concepts,

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:06,030
so that you won't have to go back and
review them later.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:11,280
We will be using complex numbers, and in
particular their polar representation,

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,815
just a familiarity with
the basics is required here.

5
00:00:13,815 --> 00:00:17,395
We will also be using
a little linear algebra,

6
00:00:17,395 --> 00:00:22,505
the ideas of matrix inverse and systems
of equations being the most important.

7
00:00:22,505 --> 00:00:25,675
And since we will be using a divide and
conquer strategy,

8
00:00:25,675 --> 00:00:28,375
it might be a good idea to review
the master theorem briefly.
