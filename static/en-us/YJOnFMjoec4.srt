00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,605
The car's instance methods look pretty good. Now you're going to implement the

2
00:00:03,605 --> 00:00:08,320
addFriend method for the person class. We decided earlier that the person class

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,740
will need instance variables for name and friends. Now the code for add friend

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,850
will go here. Before you can go this, I need to tell you a couple things about

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:21,482
strings and instance variables. You can add strings. If I make a string,

6
00:00:21,482 --> 00:00:28,880
addedStrings, which is TJ plus Jamesha, addedStrings now contains TJJamesha.

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,450
You can add together as many strings as you want. Now to talk about instance

8
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:36,440
variables. A person object can read the name of another person object,

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,930
friend.name will give you the name of the new friend. There's one more thing. I

10
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,540
told you earlier that we should store the names in a string separated by

11
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,310
spaces. So I don't want it to look like TJ Jamesha all crammed together I want

12
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:54,260
a space in between each name and the name following it. Now its your turn to

13
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,739
implement the addFriend method.
