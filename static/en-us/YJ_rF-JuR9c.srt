1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,250
We build a wider detail 
fragment layout,

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,260
using a horizontal LinearLayout

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,270
composed of three vertical
LinearLayouts.

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,280
This is what the XML code looks like.

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,264
And you can see it linked below.

6
00:00:10,264 --> 00:00:12,248
Then we use layout aliasing
to override

7
00:00:12,248 --> 00:00:14,425
the fragment_detail layout.

8
00:00:14,425 --> 00:00:17,482
In the values-land
and values-sw600dp folders,

9
00:00:17,482 --> 00:00:19,570
we create res.xml files.

10
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,916
In both files, we alias 
fragment_detail

11
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:23,312
through fragment detail wide.

12
00:00:23,312 --> 00:00:26,000
And now we have a more
responsive layout to wider screens.
