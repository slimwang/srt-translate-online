00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,834
To do this, we would find the square deviation of each value from their

2
00:00:03,834 --> 00:00:11,415
respective mean. 1.5 minus 1.5 squared, plus 1.3 minus 1.5 squared, plus 1.8

3
00:00:11,415 --> 00:00:22,030
minus 1.5 squared, etc., all the way to 2.7 minus 2.875 squared. This give us

4
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,219
.836.
