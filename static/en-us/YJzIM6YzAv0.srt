00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So here's a Bayes Network, with 6 variables, A, B, C, D, E, and F.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'd like you to count parameters.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
If this was a binary based network,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
where each variable can take on two values,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
then, A would require one independent parameter,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and B another one.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And C would require four independent parameters,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
because there's four different ways A and B can come together in condition C.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now in this question I'd like to ask you,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What happens if each node can assume three values, not just two?

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So A can be, A1, A2, A3.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And C can be, C1, C2, C3.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
For each node, specify the number of independent parameters required

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
to state the conditional probability of that node.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And I'll tell you this is a tricky question,

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So for A, the correct answer is two.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I won't give you the other ones.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And, it's two because A can take three values,

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
but it takes two independent parameters.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The last one can be inferred from, one minus the first two.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Please fill in the values for all the other variables.
