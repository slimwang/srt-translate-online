00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,050
Humans have been trying to figure out how traits are inherited

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,430
in all their peculiar ways since the beginning of recorded history.

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:11,640
>> Listen. I think we can even hear the eternal argument happening now.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,000
>> You gotta be kidding me. Pea plants. I can explain blended

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,410
traits, but you think what works for pea plants works for humans?

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:18,930
>> My method explains all the traits

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,950
that yours can't, even those that appear to

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,640
skip generations. After the rules of heredity

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,470
are true for all living things. From pea

10
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,380
plants to humans.

11
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,180
>> No, you guys are forgetting about the really complex

12
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,530
behavioral traits that play a big part in the environment.

13
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:31,530
>>

14
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:31,700
[CROSSTALK]

15
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,040
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,270
>> guys, there's no need to yell at each other. I'm sure this is something

17
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,220
we can settle with the friendly demonstration. Hippocrates

18
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,970
Why don't we go with your idea first?
