1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,170
So the first one is obviously correct.

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:05,800
So far, we have not found a polynomial time algorithm for the three problems here.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,930
We've shown in the last unit that they are practically relevant or at least

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,680
slightly simplified versions of highly relevant problems.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,460
All of the simple problems go through an exponential number of solutions.

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,870
That's what made all of those simple algorithm so bad and their running time--

7
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:25,130
all led to the exponential running time, but the thing is going through that exponential

8
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,910
number of 0-1 assignments is also what made those problems hard to solve.

9
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:34,360
If you have given a certain assignment, checking if that is valid and how large it is--

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,780
for example, if it's better than a solution you have found so far--that is relatively easy.

11
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,680
It's doable in polynomial time.

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,600
Now, the answers to this quiz might seem rather obvious to you

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,220
and you might be wondering what we're going to do with those answers,

14
00:00:47,220 --> 99:59:59,999
but I promise you it will all make sense very soon.
