1
00:00:00,311 --> 00:00:04,041
Create a matching 
location entry table-creating query

2
00:00:04,061 --> 00:00:06,249
from the location entry contract,

3
00:00:06,249 --> 00:00:08,747
using the weather entry one as a model.

4
00:00:08,828 --> 00:00:11,355
The good news is that this 
is a simpler query.

5
00:00:11,405 --> 00:00:15,209
And if you really hate databases, 
just move to the solution.
