1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,920
So, let's take a look at what an impulse response looks like in an image.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,300
So here we have an impulse.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,310
Okay, and so, here's our impulse, right?

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,960
It's just a single pixel with a value of one, okay?

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,830
And we're going to filter it with some kernel, h, okay?

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,570
Remember kernel mask,

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,390
thing that we're moving around in order to make our filter, so we have our H.

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,360
So the question is, what is the output?

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,600
And again, I want to thank Christin Gramen for having made these slides so

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,780
I can change them, steal them, move them around.

11
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,410
So first I put down my filter, and

12
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,730
you see my filter's over here like this, right?

13
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:38,940
So it doesn't hit that 1 at all, and so its value is just going to be a 0.

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,410
Fine, no big deal.

15
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:40,920
All right.

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,580
Now, move the filter over a little bit.

17
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,221
Well, it just pulls out the f here, right, so this

18
00:00:46,221 --> 00:00:52,003
pixel right there pulls out the f so an f goes right there, in, in my result.

19
00:00:52,003 --> 00:00:56,322
Move it over one more time, what do I get, I get the e.

20
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:59,530
Move it over one more time again, what do I get, I get the d.

21
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:06,520
So, you notice that even though the filter goes D-E-F, left to right.

22
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,060
In the image, what comes out is F-E-D, going the other way, and

23
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,020
that's just because of how this correlation pulled it up.

24
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,790
And it won't surprise you that it, not only does it flip it left and

25
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,470
right, it also flips it up and down.

26
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:25,110
And that's what happens when you do a correlational filter of a impulse.

27
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,230
Just because of the way you slide it over,

28
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:31,030
you'll end up flipping that entire response.

29
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:34,030
By the way, something that I was being implicit about is I was assuming that

30
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,900
this center of that filter was what we were calling the reference point, right.

31
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,810
So wherever the center was located, wherever that center pixel.

32
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,790
That was the one that was being entered into on the result.

33
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,410
Okay.

34
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,490
You could use a different point, but we're going to assume that the center pixel

35
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,770
is the reference pintal, pixel of the filter.
