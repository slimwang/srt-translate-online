1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,900
This one was pretty tricky. For the first one, we get the HTML and send request

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:11,960
for style.css and timing.js. So, we can rule out the inline option. Next, we

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,930
get timing.js and execute it and css

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,000
arrives afterwards. This tells me this must be

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
the async script, because if it weren't. We'd have to block and wait for CSS.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,600
>> Great job! Next one?

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,160
>> Okay. So, we get the HTML.

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,670
Send request for style.css. I don't see

9
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,200
any request for JavaScript. But then, when we

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:35,250
finish loading the CSS we run the script. So, this must be the inline case.

11
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,790
>> Yup. Inline scripts, block, and CSS.

12
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,190
>> And, in this last one, we have

13
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,600
request for CSS and JavaScript, and JavaScript arrives first.

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,990
But then, we block and wait untill CSS

15
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,100
is available. So, this must be blocking script tag.
