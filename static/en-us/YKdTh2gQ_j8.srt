Take a second to think about your best friend. What kind of personality traits

2
00:00:04,118 --> 00:00:08,788
stand out? How did you come to that conclusion? Meaning, how did you determine

3
00:00:08,788 --> 00:00:13,642
that they have these traits? Well, psychologists don't often have the luxury of

4
00:00:13,642 --> 00:00:17,618
measuring personality in people that they know. And frankly, there'd be a lot

5
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:22,160
of problems in doing that, such as being biased or having a small sample size.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,314
So, we've developed many different methods to measure personality, including

7
00:00:26,314 --> 00:00:30,220
behavioral observations, interviews, projective tests and self-report

8
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:34,984
questionnaires. Susan and I are going to talk about each of these in detail.

9
00:00:34,984 --> 00:00:38,390
But let's start with Susan who's going to go over behavioral observations.
