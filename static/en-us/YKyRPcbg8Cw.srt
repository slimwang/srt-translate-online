00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,950
Collaboration is awesome, but
remember, your goal is to learn.

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,080
With so many resources
available to you on the web,

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,630
you will inevitably find yourself
using code snippets you found online.

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:17,270
It is very important to learn how
code works before you use it.

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,670
Keep in mind,
if you are helping someone,

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,180
make sure to explain your thought
process to them so they can also learn.

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,090
And never post full code solutions.

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,770
Finally, it's important to follow
code attribution guidelines

9
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,750
whenever using pieces
of someone else's code.
