00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,670
Lets try one of these out together to see what happens. How about one of these

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:09,604
more difficult ones. Let's say g of g inverse of x. g of x is 1 4th times the

3
00:00:09,604 --> 00:00:14,910
quantity x minus 9. So in place of x, we need to plug in the function g

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:23,978
inverse, which is 4 x plus 9. So, look at 4 4th times 4x plus 9 minus 9. What

5
00:00:23,978 --> 00:00:28,530
does this simplify to? Inside the parentheses, we just end up with 4x and 1 4th

6
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:34,198
times 4x is equal to x. Hmm, I'm going to go through and find all these other

7
00:00:34,198 --> 00:00:39,660
compositions right now. Let's see what happens. And it looks like each of these

8
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,791
composite functions is in fact just equal to x. This confirms another

9
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:48,571
fascinating property of inverse functions. The composition of a function with

10
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:52,111
its inverse and vice versa will both give us what is known as the identity

11
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:58,123
function. It's just the independent variable, which in this case is x. So,

12
00:00:58,123 --> 00:01:01,966
another way to think about inverse functions is that the function f inverse

13
00:01:01,966 --> 00:01:07,542
will undo whatever the function f has done to the independent variable. In this

14
00:01:07,542 --> 00:01:12,050
case, f is adding one and f inverse is subtracting one. Here, g is subtracting

15
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:17,485
9 and then dividing by 4. And g inverse is multiplying by 4 and then adding 9.

16
00:01:17,485 --> 00:01:23,012
Lastly, h cubes and h inverse takes the cube root. I think we're really getting

17
00:01:23,012 --> 00:01:25,592
down to what it fundamentally means for functions to be inverses for one

18
00:01:25,592 --> 00:01:27,930
another. That's really awesome.
