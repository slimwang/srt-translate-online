00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,170
In this lesson,

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:05,240
I'm going to introduce you to another
great framework called AVFoundation.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,180
The AV stands for audio and video.

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,480
It is the audio part we're going
to look at in more detail.

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,740
In particular, we're going to use
a class called AVAudioEngine.

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,350
That'll let us record audio,
mix and alter it, and play it back.

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:23,560
Here, we can see our application,
Pitch Perfect, on the top of the stack.

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,710
On the bottom is the Audio Hardware,
that's going to record and

9
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,160
play back the audio.

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,050
To use it, we're going to go through
the AVFoundation framework, and

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,480
in particular, the AVAudioEngine class.

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,240
Ready?

13
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,400
Let's get to recording some audio.
