1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,839
So let me show you now,

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,100
complete feature based morphing
approach here with these two images.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,870
First we're going to put features, here
these basically kind of show off the eye

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,170
features, eyeball, lips, and everything.

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,780
And of course we can apply
the same to this image also.

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,610
By using this I'm now
basically doing the morphing.

7
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:18,110
We get.

8
00:00:22,568 --> 00:00:26,177
So let me now actually show perhaps one
of the most widely used methods for

9
00:00:26,177 --> 00:00:28,190
trying to do feature-based morphing,

10
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:32,698
and this was actually in the Michael
Jackson's black or white video.

11
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:37,100
This is a method actually
done by Byron Neely.

12
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,390
Very early in 1992 and actually just for
those of you interested

13
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,160
even the kinds of techniques we've
looked at like cross fading and

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,200
stuff like that were actually widely
used in the pre-computer era, in 1940s,

15
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,080
of trying to do fading between things
to kind of show the morphing examples,

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,590
I'm about to show you.

17
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,160
And the effect really was kind of do
fading between two different types of

18
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,560
images and kind of changing
the fade level to show you a morph.

19
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,860
Now of course, with the,
now with the kind of the geometry and

20
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,490
all of that stuff available, with great
patterns we can do a much better job.

21
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,320
So again, this is the video
that you may have seen.

22
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,270
Here you notice a couple of
interesting things happen, right?

23
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,220
And this is where feature based
morphing comes in and notice the hair.

24
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,490
They basically can control
how the hair comes in.

25
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,450
The eyes are all aligned, of course,
this is very nicely choreographed.

26
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,602
Everybody was doing the same
exact steps to music.

27
00:01:27,602 --> 00:01:30,850
An, lot of things about features
if you notice this range and

28
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,069
shape of that is much
more nicely adapted.

29
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:38,835
Notice another example,
where you'll see the hair grow again.

30
00:01:38,835 --> 00:01:39,511
And again,

31
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:44,047
these are because of the corresponding
feature lines help you do this.

32
00:01:55,334 --> 00:01:58,930
I think quite an impressive piece
of work, and again, you know, and

33
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,904
this kind of image morphing is widely
used in the special effects industry.

34
00:02:02,904 --> 00:02:06,190
Just for fun, let me actually show
you another interesting example,

35
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,251
I wanted to showcase we can do this
very easily, so I went ahead and

36
00:02:09,251 --> 00:02:12,288
from our College of Computing
web page just took pictures of.

37
00:02:12,288 --> 00:02:15,890
Our deans legally and the three of
us who are the associate deans.

38
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,760
Ron Arkin, he's an associate dean,
and Charles S Bell and myself.

39
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,080
And I'd just thought I'd generate
a nice morph of all of us.

40
00:02:29,622 --> 00:02:30,975
So, kind of fun and interesting.
