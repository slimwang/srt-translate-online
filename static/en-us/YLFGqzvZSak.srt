00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,860
We need to modify the service worker
to intercept requests to the API.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:11,050
And store responses in the cache so
that we can easily access them later.

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,800
It's good practice to
keep the resources for

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,250
your app shell separate
from the application data.

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,270
That way you can update one
without disturbing the other.

6
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,081
In the service-worker,

7
00:00:24,081 --> 00:00:28,560
I've added a data cache name
variable to the service-worker.

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,590
Next, I need to modify
the fetch event handler

9
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:37,690
to handle requests to the data
API separate from other requests.

10
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,710
The fetch event handler first
checks the requested URL

11
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:46,030
to see if it starts with
the address of the weather API.

12
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,890
If it does,
it makes a network request for the data.

13
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,290
Once the response is returned
the code opens the data cache,

14
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,558
clones the response,
stores it in the cache.

15
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:02,155
And finally returns the response
to the original requester.
