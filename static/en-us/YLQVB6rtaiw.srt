00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,105
Congratulations. You just mastered the second challenge of

2
00:00:03,105 --> 00:00:06,300
finding out where the robot is, with measurement noise.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,480
Now, we're going to turn the attention to motion,

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,135
to control. Your mission, should you choose to accept

5
00:00:13,135 --> 00:00:17,600
this, is to capture the robot. And to make it a little bit easier, we made you

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,580
twice as fast, and took away the measurement problem

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,940
so you can seize the state again. Good luck.
