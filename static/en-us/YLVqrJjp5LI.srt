00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Narrator] Welcome back to programming languages.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's an exciting time, and the story thus far

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
we have already completed lexing and parsing,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
but remember that our goal was ultimately to make a web browser?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Let's see how things are going towards that goal.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We are going to start with your average web page,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
a string of HTML with some embedded Java script,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and we wanted to break it down into tokens or words,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and that process is called lexical analysis.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Once we have a bunch of tokens, we were going to parse those into a tree like one of these trees,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and that approach is called syntactic analysis or just parsing,

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and now we want to walk that tree and understand it, and do useful work,

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and this is called either symantics, a fancy word for meaning, or interpreting.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We want to look at this abstract syntax tree that has 5 and 3 as a child of plus,

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and say that means 8.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And we want to do this for web pages, and the meaning that we're going to extract from them is what they look like.
