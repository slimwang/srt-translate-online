1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,800
So, before we talk about this
different kind of models, and

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,040
we will talk about a number of them,

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,680
let's sort of explore what is new thing
that we need for implementing them.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,010
So, we're obviously, I said, going
beyond discretionary access control.

5
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:20,778
Well, implementation of this mandatory
access control model is going to require

6
00:00:20,778 --> 00:00:22,360
some new functionality,

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,030
some new mechanisms the system
has to now include.

8
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:30,290
So one of the new things that we're
going to talk about all the time is,

9
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:34,280
what is called sort of these labels
that we're going to associate.

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,550
That's a key new
implementation requirement for

11
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,310
defining these models and for
implementing these models.

12
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:45,270
But idea is that we're going to see
that both users and resources of

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,680
documents are going to have certain
labels attached or associated with them.

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,880
And they're going to get used in the way
we make access control decisions.

15
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,000
So what's the purpose of a label that
you want to attach to a document or

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,290
associate with a user?

17
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,310
The label is actually going
to tell us how sensitive

18
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,900
certain information may be.

19
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,090
Labels also actually have something
that describes the nature of the data.

20
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,530
What topic,
what area does the data come from?

21
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,010
We talked on payroll as another example,
before.

22
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,970
So labels could also include
sort of a category of

23
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,040
the nature of the data
that we have here.

24
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,680
And that's sort of useful in answering
this question, who needs to know or

25
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,930
needs to have accessed?

26
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,430
If you're in the payroll department,

27
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,020
of course you need access
to payroll information.

28
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,616
Labels with documents,
or data files, or users,

29
00:01:35,616 --> 00:01:40,110
are going to capture something
about the information that's

30
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,050
contained in those documents and
the users who need to access them.

31
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:48,660
So these labels are actually going to
get manipulated each time access to

32
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,370
an object or document is requested.

33
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:55,560
So TCB is actually not going to
associate, but it's going to use these

34
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,200
labels associated with user and
the object any time the request is made.

35
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,430
So when I say the labels look right,
of course we have to sort of say,

36
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,940
here's the label for the user, and
here's the label for the document.

37
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,250
Should the user be able to access
this document, to be able to read it?

38
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,980
So we have to sort of relate or
compare the labels,

39
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,750
and we're going to see
results of that comparison.

40
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,990
But you're going to say,

41
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:25,300
here is user with this label, here
is a document with this other label.

42
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,790
Does the user's level imply that
he can access this document?

43
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,120
So we have to relate, compare,
the labels that we have.

44
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,620
Now exact nature of what the labels look
like, and how we are going to be able to

45
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,515
compare them, and what the result
of the comparison is, well, that's

46
00:02:40,515 --> 00:02:44,620
going to depend on the particular model
or policy that we're going to implement.

47
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,460
We're going to look at several different
examples, and each one of them has

48
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,110
a very different kind of a label,
and how you make use of that label.

49
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,260
A label goes with, not just
the document, but also with a user.

50
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,000
And we'll see examples of those.

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,195
So in the Department of Defense,

52
00:03:00,195 --> 00:03:03,520
we're talking about the labels
actually going to include.

53
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,080
For a user,
it'll be their clearance level.

54
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,320
For a document, at what level
the document is classified.

55
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,920
And compartment is this category
that we're talking about.

56
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,350
What kind of information is
contained in this document?

57
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:20,220
Of course, in the commercial world,
we don't have clearances and

58
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,230
classifications.

59
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,440
So these labels have to look different.

60
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,240
And the concerns are going to
be of a different kind, also.

61
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,520
For example, we may have
conflict-of-interest concern.

62
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,160
So access control must be such that when
somebody has a conflict, they don't get

63
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,720
to access a certain document where a
conflict-of-interest, or COI, may arise.

64
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,090
Similarly, sometimes we may have
separation-of-duty requirements.

65
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:47,270
The same person can do two different
things, when allowing them to do that

66
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,960
requires a level of trust or potential
for fraud and things like that.

67
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:56,650
So, the needs would be different
in commercial versus DoD,

68
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,800
or garment DoD intelligence agency.
