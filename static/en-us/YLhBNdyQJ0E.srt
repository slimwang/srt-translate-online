Noam Chomsky is a philosopher and a linguist,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and in his seminal 1955 work "Syntactic Structures,"

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
he suggests that utterances have rules, syntactic rules,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and they're governed by formal grammars.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The problem with the wrote, wrote, wrote, de, de, de bag of words above

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
is that they don't form a grammatical sentence.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We much prefer grammatical sentences.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's easier to interpret them and figure out what they mean.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We can write down these formal grammars

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
using a special notation.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Here these 5 lines together

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
are my formal grammar, and each one

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
is what is known as a rewrite rule.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The words that I've written in blue are called non-terminals.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
If you have one of these things written in blue,

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
you can rewrite it with whatever is to the right of the arrow.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
These words that I've written in black never occur on the left

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
of any one of our rewrite rules, so they can never be replaced.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Once you get there, you're stuck, and the process terminates.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We call them terminals.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Using these rules, if I start with sentence,

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I can rewrite sentence to be subject verb,

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and then I could rewrite that by picking any one of the rules

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
that has subject on the left.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let's pick students.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I've only replaced subject, leaving this verb non-terminal alone.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
But then I could replace verb with any one of these rules,

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and at this point I think we're done.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The process terminates because I can't replace students or think

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
with anything, so here I've used 1, 2, 3, rewrite rules

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
to start from sentence and end up with a valid utterance.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This sort of maneuver with all these arrows is sometimes called

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
a derivation because I was able to derive

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
"students think" starting from sentence using these rewrite rules.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Even using this relatively simple grammar, however,

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I have a few options.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Here I've shown another derivation starting with sentence.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Sentence goes to subject verb, verb goes to write,

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
subject goes to teachers, and I've produced another string

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
in the language of the grammar.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Both "students think" and also "teachers write"

42
00:02:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
can be produced by that grammar.
