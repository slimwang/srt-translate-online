1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,260
The first is column drop.

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,620
Column drop is probably the easiest.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,700
At its narrowest viewport,
each element simply stacks vertically,

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,550
one on top of the other.

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,740
As things get wider,
the elements expand,

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,570
until the first break point is hit.

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,140
At the first break point, instead
of having all the elements stacked,

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,020
two elements are now side by side.

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,910
And the third element is underneath.

10
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:29,490
The elements keep expanding as the
viewport gets wider until the next break

11
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,010
point is hit.

12
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,280
And then,
things reflow to a three-column layout.

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,760
Generally, once the viewport hits a
maximum width, the columns hit a maximum

14
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,410
size, and instead of getting wider,
margins are added to the left and right.

15
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,200
So how do we code this?

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,610
Let's start with the smallest viewport.

17
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:52,080
We have our three divs,
inside of a container div.

18
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,090
The container is a flex container,
with flex-wrap, wrap.

19
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,470
Next, I've set the width of
all of the divs to 100% to

20
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,610
give me that stacked layout.

21
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,209
Because this is just a sample,

22
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:10,190
I'll pick a totally random
break point at 450 pixels.

23
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:14,520
I want that dark blue div to be
25% of the viewport width, and

24
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,950
the light blue div to be 75%.

25
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,940
And I want to keep the green
at the full width.

26
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,930
I'm going to add a new media query that
checks if min width is greater than or

27
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:31,510
equal to 450 pixels, and then change
the width of dark blue to 25 and

28
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,334
light blue to 75%.

29
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:40,234
I'll add a third break point at 550
pixels and make the dark blue div 25%,

30
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:45,250
the light blue div 50%, and
the green div to be 25%.

31
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:49,950
To get that to happen, I'll add
a new media query that tests for

32
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,130
screen, and min-width 550 pixels.

33
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,620
Inside that media query,
I'll set the width for

34
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:02,085
dark blue and green to 25% and
light blue to 50%.

35
00:02:02,085 --> 00:02:04,460
Let's try it in the browser.

36
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,470
We're all stacked at 400 pixels.

37
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:13,680
At 450, our layout changes,
and again at 550 pixels.

38
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:15,700
Perfect.
