00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,620
Recall that we said that a lot of this AI agent will have two parts to it,

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,520
a knowledge base and then the rules of inference. We'll come to the rules of

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,300
inference a little bit later. First let us look at how can we construct

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,350
a knowledge base in the language of logic. So what we are trying to do now is

5
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,880
that an AI agent has some knowledge about the world and it is going to express

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:25,025
it in the scheme of logic. In earlier schemes of knowledge representation,

7
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:29,114
we discussed how there were objects and relationships between objects. And

8
00:00:29,114 --> 00:00:32,195
any knowledge representation scheme we need to capture both objects and

9
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:37,280
relationships between those objects. Logic has a particular way of doing it.

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,530
So consider an object like a bird. This object may have various arguments.

11
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,460
We'll define something called a predicate,

12
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:48,210
which is a function that maps object arguments to either true or false. So

13
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,490
let us consider an example. Here we have bluebird as the object and

14
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:57,350
feathers as the predicate on this object. Let's consider this example. Here,

15
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,980
bluebird is the object and feathers is the predicate on this object.

16
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,410
Feathers is now a function that can map either into true or into false.

17
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:09,410
Either bluebird has feathers or bluebird doesn't have feathers. In this

18
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:14,130
particular case, feathers of bluebirds would be true, because bluebirds do have

19
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,220
feathers. Now, just like we had bluebird as the object in the previous example,

20
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,950
here we have animal as the object, the same predicate. Now, of course,

21
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,280
not all animals will have feathers, so this particular predicate may be true or

22
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,960
false, depending on the choice of the animal. In this sentence there are two

23
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,530
predicates, one object, animal still, but there is a predicate feathers and

24
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,845
a predicate bird. And we can capture the relationship between these two

25
00:01:38,845 --> 00:01:44,110
predicates, by saying that if feathers animal is true, then bird animal is

26
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:49,770
also true. This example has two predicates. Here there's one object,

27
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,550
the animal. But the predicates are feathers and birds. And the sentence is

28
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:59,350
capturing a relationship between the two predicates. If the animal has feathers,

29
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:03,210
then the animal is a bird. In logic we call sentences like

30
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:08,734
this as having an implication. This is an implicative relationship. So in logic,

31
00:02:08,734 --> 00:02:12,990
we'll read this as Feathers(animal) implies Bird(animal). Or

32
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,620
if the animal has feathers, then it implies that the animal is a bird.
