1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,130
You might be wondering why you should

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,780
be learning about exploratory data analysis in the

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,910
first place. Hal Varian, the cheap economist

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,940
at Google, said what's becoming ubiquitous and cheap?

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,890
Data. And what is complementary to data?

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:19,010
Analysis. In general terms, exploratory data analysis or

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,660
EDA. Is the examination of data and relationships

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:27,330
among variables, through both numerical, and graphical methods.

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,000
It often takes place before more formal, more

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,720
rigorous statistical analyses. EDA is often the first

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,200
part of a larger process. It can lead

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,460
to insights, or new questions, or even feed

13
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,690
into the process of building predictive models. It's

14
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,300
also an important line of defense against bad

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,020
data. It's an opportunity to check some of

16
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,720
your assumptions and intuitions about a data set.

17
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,570
Many times, business decisions are made using unpolished

18
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:59,270
visualizations that come out of exploratory data analysis.

19
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,910
Other times, you might polish some of those

20
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,850
visualizations or summaries before presenting them to a

21
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:08,500
larger audience. Let's hear from Chris about an

22
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,050
example of how EDA can fit into the

23
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,780
larger process of building predictive models. A great

24
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,660
example of EDA comes from the Netflix prize competition.

25
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,480
Teams competed for a million dollar prize to improve

26
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,130
the Netflix movie recommendation system by at least 10%.

27
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,100
You can read more about the contest and results

28
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,910
By clicking on the link in the instructor notes.

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,820
This visualization was created by Todd Holloway to show

30
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,310
clusters of movies based on movie ratings. Movies that

31
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:41,200
are closer together, receive similar movie ratings, whether those

32
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,780
ratings are high or low. And it's exactly this

33
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,180
type of visualization that allows us to get a feel

34
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,210
for the data and determined what could be a part

35
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,660
of it and what could be explored in more depth.

36
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,800
So, even before performing complex data analyses on the data,

37
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,800
we can learn a lot about visualizing our data. Nathan

38
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,540
Yau, a noted statistician and visualization guru provides his reflections

39
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,780
about this plot. You can read his thoughts and check

40
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,560
out the interactive visualization from the instructor notes as well.

41
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,940
So, whether you want to learn an in-demand skill

42
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,560
Or compete in $1,000,000 competitions. EDA has something to offer

43
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,770
to you. At the least, learning about EDA will

44
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:22,030
improve your ability to reason through data, sharpen your communication

45
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,330
skills, and expand your career opportunities. Now I want

46
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,980
you to take a few minutes to think about your

47
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,260
previous work and your educational experiences. Write a few sentences

48
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,930
about why you would like to learn about EDA And

49
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,670
once you've got your ideas down, share

50
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,540
your thoughts and your experiences in the forum.

51
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,090
And remember, there's no right or wrong

52
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,050
answer here. This question is just for you.
