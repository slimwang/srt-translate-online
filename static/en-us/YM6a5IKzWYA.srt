00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,390
Remember that with our model view
octopus paradigm, the view and

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:08,109
the model should never communicate
directly with each other.

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:12,390
That means you should have put zero for
this one right here, and zero for

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,710
this one right here.

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,420
All the rest of them are fine.

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,630
We know that we can go between the view
and the octopus, and the octopus and

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,520
model, and vice versa.

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,850
Now if the number you put in here or
here wasn't zero,

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,540
you may want to consider pausing this
video and going back to your code to see

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,470
if there's a better solution
that you can come up with.
