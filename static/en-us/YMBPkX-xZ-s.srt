1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,020
Time to get real data.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,245
We'll move the code from onUpdate
into our separate IntentService.

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,190
Call startservice from
our onUpdate method.

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,685
Send our broadcasts when the data's
changed from the SyncAdaptor.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,805
Then receive that broadcast
in our AppWidget+Provider.

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,050
Finally, we'll update our
IntentService to query for real data.

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,820
Don't forget to add your IntentService
to your Android manifest.
