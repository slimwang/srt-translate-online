What if I want to make a computer player
for a stochastic game like backgammon?

2
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:05,309
>> Well in backgammon,

3
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:08,830
your moves are limited each turn
based on the rolls of two dice.

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,679
Since you can't know the result
of the dice ahead of time it

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,209
would seem at first that you
can't do a game tree for it.

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,359
In actuality you can.

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,109
And then use an algorithm
called Expectomax

8
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:23,129
to make best choice
decisions on your moves.

9
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:25,939
To show how we handle
probabilistic games

10
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,410
I've invented a variant of
isolation I call sloppy isolation.
