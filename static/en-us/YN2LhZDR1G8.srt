1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,290
First we need to modify
the activity main layout so

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,350
that we can add the text views for
price.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,460
If the device preview
isn't showing already,

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,270
you can click on this link here that
says Preview in order to make it appear.

5
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:16,315
Now, when we change the XML, we can
just see it update automatically, here.

6
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:18,875
In this screen shot we provided for

7
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:22,445
you, the price was presented in
a similar way to the quantity.

8
00:00:23,675 --> 00:00:26,855
We have a header, as well as
a text view, to show the value.

9
00:00:26,855 --> 00:00:29,995
So we can just copy over these
two text view elements and

10
00:00:29,995 --> 00:00:31,295
then paste it beneath it.

11
00:00:32,305 --> 00:00:34,675
Now we just need to tweak
the values to fit our scenario.

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,590
Instead of quantity,
it should say price.

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,980
And, we should also change
the ID to be price text view.

14
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,100
You can have two views with the same ID.

15
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,240
But, anyways, in the quiz, we told you
to change this to be price text view.

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,050
So, it would match our code.

17
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,270
There.
And that makes the error go away.

18
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,030
Okay, looking at the preview, we have
the price header, and zero beneath it.

19
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,560
We also want to just change
this just to be zero dollars.

20
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,230
And you can use your own
currency symbol if you want.

21
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,765
The header is in all caps and

22
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:11,210
the actual price value has the text
size of 16 sp and a black text color.

23
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,490
That looks good so far, except I do
notice there needs to be a little

24
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,018
more vertical space between the price
header and the quantity value.

25
00:01:19,018 --> 00:01:20,400
I'm just going to
change all the views so

26
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,140
that they have a margin top,
value of 16dp.

27
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:28,110
And then instead of margin bottom here,
I'm just going to do, margin top,

28
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,230
16, and that actually fixes it.

29
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,260
Cool.

30
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,110
Now all the views
are evenly spaced apart.

31
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,550
Once you think the XML
is in a good state,

32
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,929
then you can just run it on your device.

33
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,260
Cool, and that looks good.

34
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,760
Let's work on the MainActivity file now.

35
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,670
If this Android DDMS window pops up, you
can just collapse it using this arrow.

36
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,900
In the MainActivity,
we asked you to copy and

37
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,460
paste the displayPrice
method that we gave you.

38
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,910
Hopefully, you also modified
your Android Studio preferences

39
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,260
to automatically import things
if they were unambiguous.

40
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,260
That would help resolve the problem
of it not knowing what number format

41
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,340
referred to.

42
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,850
But now with the import statement,
the app knows that number format is

43
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,890
something that's provided automatically
by Java to help format numbers.

44
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,490
Then for the last step, we modify
the submit order method, so that when

45
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,290
the button is clicked, we display
the quantity and also display the price.
