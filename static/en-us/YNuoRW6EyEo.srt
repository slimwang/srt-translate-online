00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,546
Well first we need to find the population standard deviation, which is about

2
00:00:06,546 --> 00:00:12,578
1.7078. And remember, our sample size is 2. So according to the center limit

3
00:00:12,578 --> 00:00:18,970
theorem, this standard deviation of this distribution Is sigma divided by route

4
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:24,798
N which is one point seven zero seven eight, divided by the square of two and

5
00:00:24,798 --> 00:00:30,394
this is about one point two zero seven six. It's okay if you round it. And you

6
00:00:30,394 --> 00:00:35,017
can even find that yourself by brute force since the population only consists of

7
00:00:35,017 --> 00:00:40,222
six values. So you could take all samples, one, one, one two, one three, one

8
00:00:40,222 --> 00:00:45,355
four, one five, one six, two one, two, two, two three, two four, blah, blah,

9
00:00:45,355 --> 00:00:50,836
blah and then you can find the mean of each sample of size two and then find the

10
00:00:50,836 --> 00:00:56,460
standard deviation. Of that data set, consisting of all the means, and you'll

11
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,812
get this number. But, we already know, because of the central limit theorem, we

12
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:07,416
can find this number just by dividing the population center deviation by root n.
