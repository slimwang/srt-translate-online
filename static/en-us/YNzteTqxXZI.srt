1
00:00:01,902 --> 00:00:06,081
This graph looks very strikingly like an exponential distribution.

2
00:00:06,081 --> 00:00:09,570
Now, what does that mean about our process?

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,870
Well exponential processes are very frequently used in

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,640
the industry to model rare events.

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,650
For example, they're used to model the distribution of everything from

6
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:25,410
heart attacks in a given city to traffic accidents to the arrival of

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,900
requests in a file system.
