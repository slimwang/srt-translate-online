1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,163
So great, now you've gotten
the geo-fence event from the intent.

2
00:00:04,163 --> 00:00:06,270
The next thing of course to
do is to figure out, well,

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,550
what kind of event did you get?

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,080
Has someone entered the geo-fence?

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,000
Has someone left the geo-fence?

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,540
And in order to keep my poor
dog from getting confused,

7
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,762
you might want to play a different
sound in these circumstances.

8
00:00:17,762 --> 00:00:21,110
To get a transition type
on a geo-fencing event,

9
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,190
you call the get geo-fence
transition class.

10
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,590
This would return an integer
which contain the value one,

11
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:34,220
if someone enters the geo-fence, or
two if they're exiting the geo-fence.

12
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:38,440
The geo-fence API contains constants
that will make your code easier to read,

13
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,970
instead of checking for
the values one or two.

14
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:45,735
Update your code to get the transition,
and then to check if it's an Enter or

15
00:00:45,735 --> 00:00:46,563
Exit event.

16
00:00:46,563 --> 00:00:48,420
And when you're done check this box.
