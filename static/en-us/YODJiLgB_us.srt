00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,870
The answer I got to this problem was 36 over 5. I can see though two very

2
00:00:03,882 --> 00:00:08,085
different methods of going about solving this. So, let's look at each of those.

3
00:00:08,182 --> 00:00:12,170
The first method would be to, right away, try to get all the variables on one

4
00:00:12,182 --> 00:00:16,560
side of the equation and all the constants on the other side. Then however, we

5
00:00:16,572 --> 00:00:20,526
have to deal with having a fractional coefficient for x for pretty much the

6
00:00:20,538 --> 00:00:24,599
entire problem. This isn't hard to deal with, it's just a question of what you

7
00:00:24,611 --> 00:00:28,615
prefer doing. To get rid of the fraction, I multiply by the reciprocal. This

8
00:00:28,627 --> 00:00:29,639
method does give us the current answer, 36 over 5.
