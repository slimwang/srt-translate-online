00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,072
The answer is sometimes. When sample sizes are equal, in other words, there

2
00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:11,438
could be five values in each sample, or n values in each sample. The grand mean

3
00:00:11,438 --> 00:00:16,787
is the same as the mean of sample means. Since there's an equal weight to each

4
00:00:16,787 --> 00:00:22,262
sample in calculating the grand mean. However, when sample sizes are unequal.

5
00:00:22,262 --> 00:00:26,227
We have to find the grand mean by adding all the values from each sample and

6
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:32,125
dividing by the total number of values, the sum of the sample sizes. When

7
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:37,941
sample sizes are equal. The grand mean is the same as the mean of sample means.

8
00:00:37,941 --> 00:00:42,836
Since there is an equal weight to each sample. And this is the same as the

9
00:00:42,836 --> 00:00:48,039
means of all values. Where capital N is the total number of values in all the

10
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:54,229
samples. But when the sample sizes are unequal. We can't use the mean of sample

11
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:59,003
means. We have to add all the values in all the samples and divide by the total

12
00:00:59,003 --> 00:01:04,316
number, the sum of the sample sizes. But in this lesson we'll only work with

13
00:01:04,316 --> 00:01:09,669
samples of the same size, so it's fine to use the mean of means. Here's a quick

14
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:15,072
explanation in symbols, if you're interested. Let's say we have three samples.

15
00:01:15,072 --> 00:01:20,601
X, Y, and Z. The mean of X is X bar. The sum of each value, divided by the

16
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:26,748
number in that sample. The mean of Y is the sum of all the values in Y, divided

17
00:01:26,748 --> 00:01:33,749
by the number in Y. And likewise for sample Z. We want to know if the mean of

18
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:39,330
means. Equals the total mean, the sum of all the values in x, y, and z, divided

19
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:45,690
by the total number in each sample. Well, we know that because the mean of x is

20
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:52,220
the sum of the x values divided by the total number. That the sum of x is just

21
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:59,840
x bar times the number. So we can replace that in each of these. The sum of the

22
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,623
x i's equals the average times the number in x. The sum of the y values, is the

23
00:02:06,623 --> 00:02:12,792
average of y times the number, et cetera. Well these are not the same if the

24
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:18,517
number in each sample is different. But if there is the same number in each

25
00:02:18,517 --> 00:02:24,236
sample, let's just call it n. Then we can rewrite this as n times the sum of

26
00:02:24,236 --> 00:02:30,032
the sample means divided by 3n. The ends cancel out and then you get the same

27
00:02:30,032 --> 00:02:34,952
thing. So, that's why if the sample sizes are the same, which they will be

28
00:02:34,952 --> 00:02:41,145
throughout this lesson, we can just use the mean of means. But, just remember,

29
00:02:41,145 --> 00:02:46,247
for later in lesson 13, we'll work with different sample sizes. So to calculate

30
00:02:46,247 --> 00:02:50,151
our grand mean we'll have to add all the values and then divide by the total

31
00:02:50,151 --> 00:02:52,517
number of values.
