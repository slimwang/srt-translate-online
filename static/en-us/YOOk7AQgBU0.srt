1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,940
Moving from left to right,
let's look at the first choice.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:09,020
The first choice has an image and
a numbered list followed by some text.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:14,140
While it might seem like this page is
using additional CSS, in fact, it isn't.

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,630
The image, numbered list and
text are simply content on the page and

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,310
look like this with just HTML.

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,300
The spacing you see between the elements
is just the default styling applied by

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,370
the Google Chrome browser.

8
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,400
As you start writing CSS moving forward,

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,900
it is important to remember that
each browser comes with its own set

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,250
of default styling that
might be slightly unique.

11
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,890
Next, looking at number two,

12
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,902
you see some different sized
headings as well as a hyperlink.

13
00:00:41,902 --> 00:00:44,410
The hyperlink is blue and
underlined, but

14
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,900
this is not because additional
CSS is being applied.

15
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:53,200
Again, by default Google Chrome is
applying some default styling to HTML.

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,490
In this case, Chrome's default styling
is to change links to be blue and

17
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,050
underlined.

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,980
Finally, this leaves
us with option three.

19
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,060
If you look at option three,

20
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,470
you can see that there is a colored
button, as well as images and

21
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:10,240
text that have been aligned
horizontally to the center of the page.

22
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,900
You might also notice
the use of a different font.

23
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,710
To style a page like this
requires the use of CSS.

24
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,150
So, option three is the correct answer.
