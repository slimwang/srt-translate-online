1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,420
Now we need to change the behavior of
our edit text preference appropriately.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,330
What we'd like to do is
disable the okay, or

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,850
positive button,
until the user's typed enough text.

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,610
The first part of this is easy.

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:16,730
We'll override the show dialogue method
which is called the show the dialogue.

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,630
After the superclass is called,
the dialog should be present, so

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,600
we can safely fetch the edit text
view by calling get EditText.

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,750
We'll use a special callback of
EditText called an EditTextListener.

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,440
We'll add an EditTextListener
which will get

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,550
called when the user changes the text.

11
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,130
We'll only utilize the after
text change callback.

12
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,170
Now there is a tricky part.

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,110
We'd like to get the alert dialog that
is used by our edit text preference.

14
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,550
But, there's no supported
way to get at it.

15
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,890
We know it has to be there, because the
dialogue preference provides an alert

16
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,390
dialogue builder to
customize the dialogue.

17
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,660
Let's take a quick look at
the Androids source that implements

18
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,550
dialogue preference.

19
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,730
First of all,
let's grab a Chrome extension.

20
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:03,220
This extension not only makes it
easy to search the Android SDK, but

21
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:08,850
it also adds an Android View Source
link to developer.android.com.

22
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,660
So now we can just type AD to search for
edit text preference.

23
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,688
And when we see DialogPreference
we also get a link to its source.

24
00:01:16,688 --> 00:01:20,420
As you can see, there's
an internal member called Mdialog.

25
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,940
This is what is returned in Get Dialog.

26
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:24,960
But where is it created?

27
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,140
As we can see, it's created for
our builder as we expected.

28
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,200
So at least in current
versions of Android.

29
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,990
We can expect this to
be an alert dialog.

30
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:35,990
Great.

31
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,690
But just in case this changes in
the future, we'll protect the code.

32
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,470
We'll use the instance of
operator to verify that

33
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:49,350
the dialog return using Get Dialog
is an alert dialog as expected.

34
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,490
If so, we can call dialog.get
button AlertDialog.button_positive

35
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,650
to get the button we need to enable and
disable.
