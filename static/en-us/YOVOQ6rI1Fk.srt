1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,260
So now it's time to look at
how you can show real ads and

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,550
see how much you can earn from them.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,750
This is done by creating
an AdMob account.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,930
Let's go back to the following picture.

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:15,560
So what we'll see in this section
is how to create real ad unit ID

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,090
that are associated with
real ads from advertisers.

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,990
And that when you use them,
you will actually load these real ads.

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,910
So let's look at what we'll do.

9
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,430
First of all, I'll show you how
to create an AdMob Account.

10
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,210
Then we'll look at how to add
an app to this account and

11
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,550
then we'll see how to
create Real Ad Unit IDs.

12
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,210
So this will be similar to the test ad
unit IDs from the perspective of syntax.

13
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:44,870
But they will actually be tied to
real ads created by real advertisers.

14
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:49,030
And all of these things we will
do from the AdMob web interface.

15
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,530
Let's start by looking at
creating an AdMob account.
