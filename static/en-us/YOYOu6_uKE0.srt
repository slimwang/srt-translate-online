00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:04,490
Now, classical conditioning explains a lot of our behaviors. But only our

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:09,536
reflexive behaviors. Things such as salivation, and our startle response. So

3
00:00:09,536 --> 00:00:13,274
how do get the more complicated behaviors that we engage in? Well, we do so

4
00:00:13,274 --> 00:00:17,062
through what's called operant conditioning. Now, B.F Skinner started the field

5
00:00:17,062 --> 00:00:21,120
of operant conditioning. And he had the idea that we operate on our

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,935
environment. And our behavior is selected from the environment, meaning, if we

7
00:00:25,935 --> 00:00:29,352
engaged in the behavior and something positive happens from that, we're likely

8
00:00:29,352 --> 00:00:34,637
to do it again in the future. However, if we engage in a behavior and something

9
00:00:34,637 --> 00:00:39,316
bad happens, we're less likely to do that again in the future. So with operant

10
00:00:39,316 --> 00:00:42,696
conditioning, we have our large muscles in being involved instead of our just

11
00:00:42,696 --> 00:00:46,930
reflexive behaviors. Let's go into this in a little more detail.
