Do you remember how we used the add and remove operation awhile ago to

2
00:00:03,945 --> 00:00:09,475
rearrange images in the gallery? We removed the last element and added it

3
00:00:09,475 --> 00:00:14,642
before the first one. Now that you know how removal and adding works in Java

4
00:00:14,642 --> 00:00:20,576
code I'd like you to tell me Tthe cost of this operation. How any elements were

5
00:00:20,576 --> 00:00:25,336
visited in the process? With visiting I mean, how many elements were read and

6
00:00:25,336 --> 00:00:29,418
how many were modified. So count every read and every write and tell me the

7
00:00:29,418 --> 00:00:31,070
total number of visits.
