1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,165
Now let's make the Hello App a little
more interesting by adding a new

2
00:00:03,165 --> 00:00:05,190
endpoint with some different inputs.

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,500
Let's make it possible for your app to
say good morning or good evening or

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,730
even good breakfast time if you want.

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:15,320
Add one more endpoints function to your
application called greetByPeriod that

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,540
takes a period input as
well as a name input.

7
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,390
The period input could be morning or
afternoon or evening or, or

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,280
breakfast time.

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,510
And this function will return
a hello object, whose message is,

10
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,150
Good Breakfast Time Marcus Aurelius, if
that's what you happened to pass to it.

11
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,580
Note that you do not have to write
the front end code for this.

12
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,200
Just to find the endpoints method.

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,860
But of course, you're welcome to add
this functionality to the web front end

14
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,210
as well, if you wish.

15
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,690
So when you're done, check off
these items on the checklist, and

16
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:41,790
then fill in your project ID
