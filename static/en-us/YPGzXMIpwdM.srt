00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,730
In this unit, we will be working with Monte Carlo approaches because we're looking at

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,720
NP complete problems and actually as you will see there is not that many algorithms using randomness

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,990
for NP complete problems anyway and one I'm going to show you

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,220
in more detail is a Monte Carlo algorithm.

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:18,340
Now the important thing about a Monte Carlo algorithm is this here, the probability.

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:23,550
Now of course it would be great if the probability with which we get the best possible solution

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,260
would be some constant because then we would have a very good algorithm

8
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,020
as the next quiz will show you.

9
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:34,720
So say we have a Monte Carlo algorithm with probability 1/2, how often do we need to run it

10
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,470
until we are 99.9% certain that we have the best possible answer

11
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,820
and please enter your answer here in this box.

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,400
Now if you don't feel comfortable with probabilities, of course, you can also skip ahead,

13
00:00:45,400 --> 99:59:59,999
but even if you just have a basic knowledge of probabilities, you can probably get this one.
