00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,814
From earlier we developed this general equation where we use the coordinates of

2
00:00:04,826 --> 00:00:09,234
2 points along a line to find the slope of that line. Now the coordinates of

3
00:00:09,246 --> 00:00:14,262
home are (0,0) and the coordinates of the city Udacity on the map are (200,700),

4
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:18,761
not forgetting the scale of either axis. I'm going to pick the coordinates of

5
00:00:18,773 --> 00:00:23,822
this point to be x2 and y2, and this one to be x1 and y1. Let's plug them in. We

6
00:00:23,834 --> 00:00:29,407
have 700 minus 0 over 200 minus 0. Well that's pretty simple. It's just 700 over

7
00:00:29,419 --> 00:00:34,622
200. If we cancel out a common factor of 100, we find that the slope of this

8
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:39,550
line is 7 over 2. Since Garrett really wants to know how to find out the

9
00:00:39,562 --> 00:00:44,821
coordinates of any point along this route, we'll eventually want to incorporate

10
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:49,341
this slope into an equation for this line, but we're not there quite yet. Great

11
00:00:49,353 --> 00:00:51,381
job on this really difficult lesson.
