1
00:00:00,077 --> 00:00:01,846
The circle has a radius of 4

2
00:00:01,846 --> 00:00:05,506
and its center is at the point 2, -3.

3
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:08,247
Great work if you found these two answers.

4
00:00:08,247 --> 00:00:13,556
Again, we'll start by moving this constant term of -3 to the right hand side.

5
00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:16,021
So we'll add 3 to both sides of our equation.

6
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:19,860
Then I'll regroup my two x terms together 
on the left hand side,

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,353
and I'll regroup my two y terms on the
left hand side as well.

8
00:00:24,353 --> 00:00:30,006
Now I'm ready to complete the square for the x terms
and the y terms.

9
00:00:30,006 --> 00:00:32,806
We add 4 to complete the square for the x terms

10
00:00:32,806 --> 00:00:35,804
and we addd 9 to complete the square for the y terms.

11
00:00:35,804 --> 00:00:38,579
Keep in mind we also need to add 4 and 9

12
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,578
to the right hand side of our equation

13
00:00:40,578 --> 00:00:42,894
to make sure it's balanced.

14
00:00:42,894 --> 00:00:46,984
So, these three terms can be written as x - 2 squared

15
00:00:46,984 --> 00:00:50,688
these three terms can be written as y + 3 squared

16
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:55,667
and then we simply combine these three terms to get +16.

17
00:00:55,667 --> 00:00:58,973
So now our equation is in a form we recognise.

18
00:00:58,973 --> 00:01:01,747
Our centre is at 2,-3.

19
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:03,707
Since the h value is +2

20
00:01:03,707 --> 00:01:06,894
and the k value is -3.

21
00:01:06,894 --> 00:01:09,603
We take the square root of our constant term

22
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:12,395
to get a radius equal to 4.

23
00:01:12,395 --> 99:59:59,999
Again great solving if you got these two answers.
