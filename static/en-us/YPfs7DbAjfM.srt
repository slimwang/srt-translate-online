1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here is the result of such an operation.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We have yet again a left image over here. The right one is missing.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Here you can see what's called a disparity map,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
which the map of the best match.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In the right image, the further the disparity, the more we have to assume the patch shifted.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We extracted every possible patch from this image, did the search on the right image,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and we find in the foreground, the disparity is much larger than the background.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Sometimes we get a black spot, like over here,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
where the information itself is not good enough to make any decision.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Or in the pathway over here, there are no real features.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Same for the sky over here.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
But in most cases, we can see a nicely shaded gray that decreases with distance

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
where the disparity decreases.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This is a very typical stereo vision result.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Here is a disparity map from driving in desert with our DARPA Grand Challenge car, Stanley.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We equipped it with two cameras, one on the left and one on the right.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You can see the two camera images, and on the right the disparity map.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's not that informative, because there is very little structure in the road surface itself,

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
but by and large you can see things further away end up being darker.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The big dominant thing here is lack of texture,

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
which leads to certain areas in the disparity map just being black,

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
which means we don't know.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
But where it registers it does a pretty find job.
