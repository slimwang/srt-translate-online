1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,100
The design support library
has a built in fab widget.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,760
It already has ripples and
elevation enabled.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,050
But it's a good exercise
to wire up one yourself

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,370
to see what's been done for you.

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:14,870
We're going to create this app.

6
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,580
It has two fab widgets.

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,610
One we've created by hand, and one
that uses the design support library.

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,890
So I've gone ahead and
created a new project and

9
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,500
selected the Blank Activity option.

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,162
In my build.gradle file,

11
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:33,220
I've made sure to add the design
support library as a dependency.

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,870
At the core of a fab
widget is an image view.

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,980
We can make life a little bit
simpler by using an ImageButton.

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,010
I've set the background to
use the accent color, and

15
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,880
a plus button as the source image.

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,000
Fabplus is a vector
drawable I've created.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,800
You could use an image with transparent
images, but it's more scalable to use

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:59,190
a vector drawable because they can
be resized without any quality loss.

19
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,310
As you can see here,
our button isn't very circular.

20
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,880
We can do that by setting
it's background to be a shape

21
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,030
shaded in our accent color.

22
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,220
Now is also a good time
to set our elevation.

23
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,680
Because we use the background drawable,

24
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,100
Andriod can use that data
to calculate a shadow.

25
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,430
We don't need it in this case, but

26
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,540
you could create a custom outline
provide to control how shadows are cast.

27
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,430
You can see more information about
that in the instructors notes.

28
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,670
So going back to our button,
we have a button that we can click and

29
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,270
that has elevation but
it doesn't have any ripples and

30
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,400
it doesn't raised to our touch.

31
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,440
Let's go ahead and add a ripple.

32
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,910
To enable ripples, we need to change the
buttons background from a static shape

33
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,570
to one that's enclosed in a ripple tag.

34
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:53,230
The color control highlight is the color
applied to things like ripples,

35
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,600
list selectors, etc.

36
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,002
The main difference
between oval_shape and

37
00:01:59,002 --> 00:02:04,460
oval_ripple is that the ripple
tag encloses our shape.

38
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,820
The next thing we need to do,

39
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,660
is add a material reaction to the fab
widget to raise it up to meet our touch.

40
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,640
To do this, we'll add a state list
animator to run an animation when

41
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,060
the user touches the button.

42
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,360
In the layout,
we reference a file fab_raise,

43
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,950
that lives in the resources
anim directory.

44
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,958
We have two object animators, one for

45
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:32,680
when the button is pressed and
one for when it's released.

46
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,290
Notice how we animated the translation
Z property of the button,

47
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,070
rather than the elevation.

48
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:42,420
The final elevation is calculated by
adding the current value of translation

49
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,960
Z to the base elevation we set in code.

50
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:52,200
So this translation Z property
goes from a value of 0 to 8 dps.

51
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,760
Now if we remember, our fab button
has a resting state of six dp.

52
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,780
So it's going to actually go
from an elevation of 6dp to 14.

53
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:06,300
You won't generally need to
implement fabs from scratch and

54
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,170
you definitely should
use the design library.

55
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,460
But it's likely that you'll need to
create custom widgets that you'll

56
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,240
need ripples for or elevation changes.
