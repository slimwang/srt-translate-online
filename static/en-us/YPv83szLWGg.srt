1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,102
Now what I'd like to do is just, to kind of help us think through this.

2
00:00:03,102 --> 00:00:07,158
I'm going to show you a whole lot of examples to cover the space of

3
00:00:07,158 --> 00:00:12,330
what it means to go from different values of the exposure triangle.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,023
Let's take f number 5.6.

5
00:00:16,023 --> 00:00:20,160
And I will start off with a shutter speed of one over ten.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,600
This is the same scene.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,250
And of course, because of the fact that the apertures open for a while.

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,590
And I'm also keeping the shutter speed.

9
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,610
There is a lot of light entering the sensor.

10
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,010
This image might be refered to as over-exposed.

11
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,250
Same aperture value.

12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,110
I've now basically gotten the shutter to work at one one-twentieth,

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,880
twice the speed of this.

14
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,650
Twice as fast.

15
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,740
Of course here you can start seeing that image is less over-exposed

16
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,040
then this one.

17
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,550
I'm going down again, doubling the shutter speed.

18
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:53,730
Doubling it more.

19
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,920
And now you can start seeing that this image actually seems to have

20
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,400
less overexposure than any one of them.

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,445
But I keep on going there to one one-sixtieth.

22
00:01:02,445 --> 00:01:03,991
Same aperture value.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,990
Now it might start getting darker.

24
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,160
More darker.

25
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,280
Even more darker and now we are getting into the range of underexposed.

26
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,440
For those of you interested, we may actually now start thinking about

27
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,540
what would histograms of these images would look like.

28
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,870
Based on the lecture we looked at before.

29
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:25,400
Darker image, nothing like this, this would be.

30
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,530
Overexposed, underexposed,

31
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,740
extremely underexposed because now we really can't see any details.

32
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,940
Let's now actually move up and down these axes.

33
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,108
So now, I'm actually going to take this speed,

34
00:01:37,108 --> 00:01:40,540
one over one-hundredth of a second.

35
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:46,096
And then I'm going to go in and actually give it an f number of 4.0.

36
00:01:46,096 --> 00:01:48,127
F 5.0.

37
00:01:48,127 --> 00:01:50,043
This was 5.6.

38
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,483
7.1.

39
00:01:51,483 --> 00:01:52,703
9.0.

40
00:01:52,703 --> 00:01:54,025
13.0.

41
00:01:54,025 --> 00:01:55,140
And 20.

42
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,080
Again, you can see what the impact was.

43
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,220
It was, these of course the images are much smaller.

44
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,400
So you can't details of the depth of field kinds of stuff here.

45
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,878
But this seems to be a nicely exposed image.

46
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:08,590
A little over-exposed, but fine.

47
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:14,290
But as you go on increasing the aperture size, oh sorry, decreasing

48
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:19,590
the aperture size, we notice that now we're getting a lot less light in there.

49
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,820
So here, we went this direction and we basically make the shutter speed faster.

50
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,166
And here we went down this way and basically made the aperture smaller.

51
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,919
These two are underexposed.

52
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,850
These two are overexposed.

53
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:38,010
We can imagine actually filling this complete matrix out, but

54
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,580
that would have been a too crowded of a slide.

55
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,600
I just wanted to show you the impact of all of this.
