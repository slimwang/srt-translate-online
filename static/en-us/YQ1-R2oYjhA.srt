00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,850
Let's look at the same setup again, lens is a symmetric so the focal lens will

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:09,930
be on both sides of the lens, lets imagine that I have a 3D object on

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:15,050
this part of the scene here, and, the image plane is being formed on this side.

4
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,740
So I put an object here, basically remembering what we,

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,700
looked at in the last side, any parallel light goes through,

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,230
goes through the focal point here, continues on,

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,560
anything that goes through, the optic will point here, goes to unadulterated and

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,400
then the third line, of course, the opposite of the converse of this one,

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,990
anything that goes with the focal point will become parallel on the other side.

10
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:42,160
So in essence, these three lines, will converge at this point and this is where

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,190
the image will be formed, so this is where the image point is for this object.

12
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,510
So, rays from points on a plane parallel, to the lens,

13
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:56,950
focus on, a point that is far away here, and

14
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:01,070
we will actually now come up with an equation that basically connects the object

15
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,940
distance from the lens, to the focal length to where the image is formed.

16
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,330
So here, of course would be my tree again, as we've noticed, on the other side,

17
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,590
it'll be formed upside down, and again, just calling this distance of

18
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:19,430
the object from the lens itself to be o and the distance to the image as i.

19
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,500
So this is what is referred to as a lens equation, and mathematically,

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,790
basically, it's 1 over the distance of the object from the lens plus 1 over

21
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:32,490
distance of the image from the lens is equal to 1 over the focal length.
