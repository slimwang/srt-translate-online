00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,253
Soon, very soon you're going to have
a similar story that you can share with

2
00:00:04,253 --> 00:00:06,610
your friends and family.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,890
Hi, I'm Jessica Allman, and I'm going to
be here to help you walk through

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,680
the process of building
an app from scratch.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,470
Now, this course is going to be
a little bit different than what

6
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,740
you've previously experienced
in Udacity courses.

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,300
For one, you've already got the
technical traps to build this app, but

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,260
you might need a little bit more
help with maybe a processor or

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,720
method for doing so.

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,240
And, that's what I'm here for.

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,210
So, to do so, we're going to be
asking you a series of questions,

12
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,360
to help you start kind of
thinking like a developer and

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,790
asking questions that
they would be asking.

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,180
And we hope that you really do think
about and answer these questions,

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,400
recording your answers either
in a blog or on the forums.

16
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,160
Or if you're a little shy and
don't want to post it publicly,

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,610
maybe in a handy notebook or
on your own computer.

18
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,360
Let's take a look at how
we're going to build an app.
