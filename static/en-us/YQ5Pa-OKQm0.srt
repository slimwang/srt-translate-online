00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,422
Here is my implementation of twiddle. This

2
00:00:02,422 --> 00:00:04,339
is a routine that you can keep this way for

3
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:07,192
many, many different applications. All it

4
00:00:07,193 --> 00:00:09,739
requires is a way to evaluate something that

5
00:00:09,739 --> 00:00:11,539
depends on the parameters and gives you a

6
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:13,809
single arrow that you would like to minimize.

7
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:15,660
We have three parameters in total, I set the

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,806
parameters themselves to zero, but the deltas

9
00:00:17,806 --> 00:00:20,956
to one and it’s just the counter, its unimportant.

10
00:00:20,956 --> 00:00:23,820
If the sum of D params is still larger than our

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,371
tolerance which we initially have as 0.001 and they go through all

12
00:00:27,371 --> 00:00:29,636
the parameter sequentially I increment that

13
00:00:29,636 --> 00:00:32,323
by D params, find out what the arrow is if

14
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:34,088
the arrow is better than our best arrow,

15
00:00:34,088 --> 00:00:35,693
which I initialize with the initial arrow

16
00:00:35,693 --> 00:00:38,220
and I keep the best arrow and I even increment

17
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,433
D params. Otherwise, I try the other direction.

18
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:46,232
One, find out the arrow, if that succeeds,

19
00:00:46,232 --> 00:00:49,603
I keep it, I increment D params. And here is

20
00:00:49,603 --> 00:00:51,973
my last case, I didn’t succeed, so going to

21
00:00:51,973 --> 00:00:54,865
set it back to the old parameter vector and

22
00:00:54,865 --> 00:00:58,178
decrease my D params by 0.9. I increase my

23
00:00:58,178 --> 00:01:00,862
counter, here is my little print out command

24
00:01:00,862 --> 00:01:03,525
for debugging and I will turn the parameter

25
00:01:03,525 --> 00:01:05,617
vector. So it will be comingout of the print

26
00:01:05,617 --> 00:01:08,470
vectors over here and play with this a little more

27
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,358
. If I want twiddle, compute the best parameters

28
00:01:11,358 --> 00:01:13,828
and then calculate the error using these

29
00:01:13,828 --> 00:01:15,536
parameters and print out the parameters

30
00:01:15,536 --> 00:01:18,154
along with the arrow, I get a parameter vector

31
00:01:18,154 --> 00:01:20,473
and I get an arrow that’s basically zero.

32
00:01:20,473 --> 00:01:22,709
Now let’s switch off the integral term.

33
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:24,682
And I can do this with a little trick.

34
00:01:24,682 --> 00:01:28,270
I just set D params number two, which is the

35
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,108
final one to 0.0 as if I’ve already learned the

36
00:01:31,108 --> 00:01:34,082
integral term. When I run this, I get a zero

37
00:01:34,082 --> 00:01:36,510
integral term, but the arrow that’s somewhat

38
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,753
larger than the final arrow, the desired. And

39
00:01:39,753 --> 00:01:41,316
that’s because the integral term is really

40
00:01:41,316 --> 00:01:43,642
required to drive the arrow, down to zero. Let’s

41
00:01:43,642 --> 00:01:47,468
also remove the D term and see what happens

42
00:01:47,468 --> 00:01:49,363
and the result is a really large arrow,

43
00:01:49,363 --> 00:01:52,963
0.55. That large arrow, sustains even if

44
00:01:52,963 --> 00:01:55,046
I remove the over drift by commenting

45
00:01:55,046 --> 00:01:58,305
it out. You still get an arrow, of 0.10 if

46
00:01:58,305 --> 00:02:00,670
it does have a proportional controller, whereas

47
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,181
if I add in the differential parameter again,

48
00:02:04,181 --> 00:02:09,827
by removing the D param 1 command the

49
00:02:09,827 --> 00:02:15,255
0.103 goes down to 5.7 to the minus 11,

50
00:02:15,255 --> 00:02:17,268
which is practically zero. So you can see

51
00:02:17,268 --> 00:02:20,162
the importance of the D term for driving

52
00:02:20,162 --> 00:02:22,534
the arrow, down to zero, in the case without

53
00:02:22,534 --> 00:02:26,108
drift and for the integral term in cases for

54
00:02:26,108 --> 00:02:28,352
vowels with a systematic bias. You play

55
00:02:28,352 --> 00:02:29,800
a little bit more with this code for the

56
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,800
homework assignment. But this is it for now.
