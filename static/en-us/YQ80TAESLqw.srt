1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Thrun] So now let's return to hidden Markov models.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Those are really the subject of this class.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Let's again use the rainy and sunny example just to keep it simple.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
These are the transition probabilities as before.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's assume for now that the initial probability of rain is 0.5;

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
hence, the probability of sun at time 0 is 0.5.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The key modification to go to hidden Markov model is that this state is actually hidden.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I cannot see whether it's raining or it's sunny.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Instead I get to observe something else.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Suppose I can be happy or grumpy

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and happiness or grumpiness is being caused by the weather.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So rain might make me happy or grumpy,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and sunshine makes me happy or grumpy

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
but with vastly different probabilities.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
If it's sunny, I'm just mostly happy, 0.9.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
There's a 0.1 chance I might still be grumpy for some other reason.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
If it's rainy, I'm only happy with 0.4 probability and with 0.6 I'm grumpy.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
In fact, living in California I can attest that these are actually not wrong probabilities.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I love the sun over here.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Suppose I observe that I'm happy on day 1.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
A question that we can ask now is what is the so-called posterior probability

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:35,000
for it raining on day 1 and what's the posterior probability for it being sunny on day 1?

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What's the probability of rain on day 1 given that I observed that I was happy on day 1?

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This is being answered using Bayes rule,

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
so this is the probability of being happy given that it rains

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
times the probability that it rains over the probability of being happy.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We know the probability of rain at day 1 based on our Markov state transition model.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
In fact, let's just calculate it.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The probability of rain on day 1 is the probability it was rainy on day 0

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
and it led to a self transition from rain to rain from day 0 to day 1

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
plus the probability it was sunny on day 0 times the probability that sun led to rain over here.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
If you can plug in all these numbers to obtain 0.4,

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
you can just easily verify this.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So we know this guy over here is 0.4.

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
This guy over here is 0.4 again, but now it's this 0.4 over here.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The probability of being happy on a rainy day is 0.4.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
This guy over here resolves to 0.4 times 0.4

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
plus the same situation with sunny in time 1

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
where the prior is 0.6 and the happiness factor is 0.9.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And that gives us the entire expression is 0.229.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Let's interpret the 0.229 in the context of the question we asked.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We know that at time 0 it was raining with half a chance.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
If you look at the state transition diagram, it's more likely to be sunny afterwards

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
because it's more likely to flip from rain to sun than sun to rain.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
In fact, we worked out that the probability of rain at a time step later was only 0.4,

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
so it was 0.6 sunny.

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But now that I saw myself being happy, my probability of rain was further lowered

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
from 0.4 to 0.229.

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And the reason why the probability went down is if you look at happiness,

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
happiness is much more likely to occur on a sunny day than it is to occur on a rainy day.

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And when you work this in using Bayes rule and total probability,

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
you would find just the fact that it was at happiness at time 1

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,000
makes your belief of it being rainy go down from 0.4 to 0.229.

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
This is a wonderful example of applying Bayes rule

55
00:04:08,000 --> 99:59:59,999
in this really relatively complicated hidden Markov model.
