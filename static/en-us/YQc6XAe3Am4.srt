1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,070
So the answer is
a little bit subjective,

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:07,105
depending on how much you trust me
versus the United States government,

3
00:00:07,105 --> 00:00:10,810
[LAUGH] but let's start with number one.

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,060
The absolutely no question

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,357
the most valuable asset among
these three is number one,

6
00:00:17,357 --> 00:00:22,750
$1 right now, because you can take it,
you can go with it, you can spend it.

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:28,540
These other two are promises for
a reward in the future.

8
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:34,390
Now among these two, I personally
would value myself as number two,

9
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:39,450
but it's probably more correct to
say that the US government promise

10
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,560
to give you in a dollar as
the second most valuable.

11
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,200
And then of course I am number three.
