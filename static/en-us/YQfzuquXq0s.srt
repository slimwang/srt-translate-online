1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,670
And the answer here is that the length of the tour

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:07,180
is exactly 2 * the weight of the spanning tree.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,320
That is because of the way that the walk was constructed,

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:15,500
so you'll remember that when I just showed you how to walk along a spanning tree,

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,270
or any tree for that matter, you use every edge exactly twice.

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:26,220
So, if the weight of the tree is the sum of all the edges,

7
00:00:26,220 --> 99:59:59,999
then the length of the tour will be twice that number.
