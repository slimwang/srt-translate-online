1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Let's assume there are two coins equally distributed, same probability of having each.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The first type of coins are fair. The second type of coins have a probability of heads of 0.9--90%.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's assume you and I both flip a coin. When I flipped, I get the following sequence.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
When you flipped, you get the following sequence.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So please write in this box the probability that we flipped coins of the same type.
