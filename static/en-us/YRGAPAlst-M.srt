Thanks Chris for that question. The answer here is 57. Let's see how we got

2
00:00:04,646 --> 00:00:09,218
that. So whenever I replace the variables with these variables, I have to

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:14,128
remember to use parentheses. So I'm going to substitute the values in. I have a

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,794
negative and then I have a cubed. I know that a equals negative 2. b is negative

5
00:00:18,806 --> 00:00:24,456
1. We want to raise that to the c power and c equals 5. 5ac means 5 times a,

6
00:00:24,582 --> 00:00:30,243
times c. So we have 5 times a, a is negative 2 and c is 5. Now we have to use

7
00:00:30,255 --> 00:00:36,236
the order of operations to evaluate the expression.First we want to do. Any

8
00:00:36,248 --> 00:00:42,403
operations that are inside parentheses, but there are none. So next I want to do

9
00:00:42,415 --> 00:00:48,545
my exponents or my powers. Here the negative is inside the parentheses, so it's

10
00:00:48,557 --> 00:00:52,176
negative 2 times negative 2 times negative 2, which gives me negative 8. When we

11
00:00:52,188 --> 00:00:56,665
raise negative 1 to the fifth power, 5 is an odd number, which means the

12
00:00:56,677 --> 00:00:59,915
answer's going to be negative. So negative 1 to the 5th power is simply negative

13
00:00:59,752 --> 00:01:04,364
1. Remember, when we're doing order of operations, and we're doing

14
00:01:04,376 --> 00:01:09,465
multiplication and division. We want to perform each operation in order from

15
00:01:09,477 --> 00:01:13,215
left to right. So first I have negative 1 times negative 8, gives me positive 8.

16
00:01:13,422 --> 00:01:16,691
I bring down the plus negative 1 and then I have negative 5 times negative 2.

17
00:01:17,017 --> 00:01:20,759
That gives me positive 10. Positive 10 times 5 is positive 50. Now that I've

18
00:01:20,771 --> 00:01:26,863
done all my multiplication and division, and I only have addition. I can do

19
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:31,980
those in order from left to right. So first I do 8 plus negative 1, which is 7.

20
00:01:32,242 --> 00:01:36,090
And, 7 plus 50 is equal to 57.
