1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,650
Congratulations.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,245
You've completed lesson two.

3
00:00:03,245 --> 00:00:05,043
[SOUND] That was a lot of concepts.

4
00:00:05,043 --> 00:00:08,507
>> Piece by piece, you're learning
about all the components involved in

5
00:00:08,507 --> 00:00:12,230
retrieving data from the Internet and
displaying it in an app.

6
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,670
>> Yeah.
We covered how to create and

7
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,240
configure an HTTP request,

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,130
as well as how to send a request
using the HTTP URL connection class.

9
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,790
>> Then, we learned how to receive and
parse the response.

10
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,680
Remember that the response
comes as a stream of data and

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,630
we use a buffered reader
to convert the input stream

12
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,710
into a string while learning
about the string builder class.

13
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:33,530
>> Totally.

14
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,620
There are a lot of tough
concepts in this lesson, so

15
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,990
be proud of yourself for
persisting through it.

16
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,720
>> Hey Chris, what's the best
way to really learn something?

17
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,330
>> What's that?

18
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,430
>> Is to teach somebody else.

19
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,830
>> Yeah, great idea.

20
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,730
So why don't you find a friend or
a family member and

21
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,770
explain what you learn in this lesson.

22
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:52,360
You can use a networking diagram
to help you teach concepts.

23
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,190
>> Then, let us know how
the conversation went by sharing your

24
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,220
experience in the discussion forum.

25
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,650
Good luck, you're going to do great.

26
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,210
>> Awesome work
finishing up this lesson.

27
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,000
Now, it's always good

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,349
to reflect a little bit about
the things that you've learned.

29
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,900
So I want you to go ahead and explain
what you've learned about networking

30
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,530
this lesson to a friend or
a family member.

31
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:13,070
And feel free to use the diagrams
linked below if they're helpful.

32
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:13,680
More than anything,

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,840
it'd be great if you could share your
experience in the discussion forum.

34
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,860
So feel free to do that,
and check this box here.
