00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,110
If you're interested in becoming
an investor, what are things to do or

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:04,610
what are things to think about?

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:09,690
And the first thing I tell people is
to get out Excel and do the math.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,180
Knowing that if 19 out of 20
companies are going to fail and

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,950
you're going to invest
a certain amount of money.

6
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,670
One, how many companies
do you need to invest in?

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:19,950
If 19 of 20 are going to fail,

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,330
investing in one company is
not going to help you out.

9
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:28,840
The other thing is,
how much do you have to spread your bet?

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,816
And then,
what kind of returns do you need to see?

11
00:00:32,816 --> 00:00:36,314
And it is very enlightening,
in particular, actually even if you're

12
00:00:36,314 --> 00:00:39,423
an entrepreneur, doing that
math is incredibly insightful.

13
00:00:39,423 --> 00:00:41,170
Because then when you're
talking to the investor,

14
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,120
you're kind of seeing it from
the other side of the table.

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,710
And they're seeing how
they're evaluating your idea.
