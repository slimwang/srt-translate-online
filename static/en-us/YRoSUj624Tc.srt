1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is definitely the first two, maybe the third.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In the first case, TrustyKeys generated Key AB.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
That's the key used to protect these messages,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
so any message over this channel that TrustyKeys can intercept it can read.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
TrustyKeys can impersonate any customer because it has a key shared with them.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It can generate a fake channel, make it seem like Alice is talking to Colleen

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
but pretend to be Colleen in that communication.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And finally, if there's a malicious party C,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
well, maybe they could tamper with messages along these channels.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I didn't provide enough details on what we're using for encryption here

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and what mode of operation is used and other details

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
to know whether or not that's possible.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Let's assume we could solve this problem.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
These other two are really big problems, and there's no way to solve these

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
if we're using a third party to generate our keys.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We also haven't solved the key distribution problem

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
because we still needed to set up all these shared secret keys

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
between TrustyKeys and every other party.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We haven't really solved our problem.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This would only work if everyone completely trusted TrustyKeys,

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
which seems unlikely, even with the green box,

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and if there was a secure way for everyone to establish

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
a shared secret key with TrustyKeys.
