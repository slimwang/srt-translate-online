1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
Now we're going to add images to the

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,349
recording buttons. Right now we have the

3
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:07,230
Main.storyboard file open. But first

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,580
let's double check and ensure we've

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,589
created IBOutlets correctly for the

6
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:15,089
recording and stop buttons. Click the

7
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:18,778
assistant editor, hide the utilities

8
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:22,199
panel and double check to see if we have

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,350
IBOutlets for both of our buttons.

10
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,699
It looks like I don't have them, so I’m

11
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,230
going to add them real quick before we

12
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:51,219
get started.

13
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:53,829
All right now we're good to go. Let's add

14
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:55,689
images to make this app look even better.

15
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:59,049
I’m gonna go back to our standard editor.

16
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:03,159
Let's click on this Assets.xcassets

17
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:05,620
file in the project navigator.

18
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,189
This is the assets catalog for our project.

19
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:11,620
We're going to add a new image set.

20
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,170
Start by clicking on this plus

21
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:18,909
button on the bottom of the screen,   and

22
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:23,260
then select New Image Set. Let's name

23
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,349
this set to RecordButton. Click on the

24
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:29,530
existing name once and wait for it to

25
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:34,959
let me edit. And we’ll name it to

26
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:40,509
RecordButton. Now we need images for 1x

27
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:44,920
2x and 3x. We're going to explain 1x 2x

28
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,439
and 3x in full detail in UIkit

29
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,709
fundamentals later. For now just know

30
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:52,299
that we need different sizes for

31
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:55,959
different iPhones and iPads. Ok so what

32
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:59,829
images will we use? Lucky for us, our awesome

33
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:01,569
graphic designer Joseline has already

34
00:02:01,569 --> 00:02:03,519
created these images for us.

35
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,260
You can download them in the resources section.

36
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,679
All I need to do is drag the

37
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:10,959
correct icons from the Finder folder

38
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,739
into the corresponding Xcode box. So let

39
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:20,769
me find the image for recording.

40
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:21,310
Here we go.

41
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,939
I'll drag the Record.png to the 1x box.

42
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:30,759
then Record@2x to the 2x box

43
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:38,860
and Record@3x to the 3x box. Now that was

44
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,930
a little tedious to do for each image.

45
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,400
The good news is that we can shortcut

46
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,489
that process. For the remaining images,

47
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:47,590
just select them all in Finder and drag

48
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:57,340
them into the assets catalog.

49
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,209
So here I've selected them all and I’ll

50
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:02,769
drag them into the assets catalog.

51
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:10,060
Awesome since our images have the same

52
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,930
names with 2x and 3x suffixes,

53
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,699
Xcode automatically knows how to create image

54
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:17,049
sets for each one.

55
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:19,479
Alright now that we have our assets in place,

56
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,128
let's add an image to our

57
00:03:21,128 --> 00:03:30,509
recording button.

58
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:32,938
Back in Storyboard, select the Record

59
00:03:32,938 --> 00:03:35,579
button in the document outline and make

60
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:38,400
sure you're showing the inspectors. And

61
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,959
let's find the image property for this button.

62
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:43,590
Click the drop-down and select

63
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:48,568
RecordButton. Note that our button now

64
00:03:48,568 --> 00:03:51,360
has an image and text. We could remove

65
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,969
the Record text, since the image plus the

66
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:56,068
Tap to Record label does most of the

67
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:59,489
explaining for us. So I’ll delete Record

68
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,378
and make sure you press Enter for

69
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:04,650
the changes to take effect. Adding the

70
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,658
image to our button may have caused our

71
00:04:06,658 --> 00:04:10,199
AutoLayout constraints to break. We can

72
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,939
fix this easily with the help of Xcode.

73
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:15,689
Click on the yellow disclosure arrow

74
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:19,500
in the document outline. Here we see the

75
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,288
AutoLayout issues. One is with the

76
00:04:22,288 --> 00:04:24,029
recording button one with the recording

77
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:25,589
label and one with the stop recording button.

78
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:27,750
Recall that everything on the

79
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,430
screen is positioned based upon the

80
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,350
recording button’s position. So we need to

81
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,160
fix that first. Select it by clicking the

82
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,220
yellow triangle and make sure

83
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,069
“update frames” is selected and then fix the

84
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:44,129
displacement. This adjust the positioning

85
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:47,098
of our Record button. For these other two

86
00:04:47,098 --> 00:04:48,899
issues, we’ll choose the update frames as well.

87
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:51,449
First let's fix the Record Label.

88
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:59,519
update frames Fix Misplacement. And we'll

89
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,629
do the same for the Stop Recording button.

90
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:06,120
update frames Fix Misplacement.

91
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,629
Great, they are all correct and properly

92
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:11,490
positioned based off of the Record button.

93
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,069
Now before we move on, I want to

94
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:16,050
show you a shortcut for situations like these,

95
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,139
instead of fixing each issue one by one,

96
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:22,228
we can fix them all at once.

97
00:05:22,228 --> 00:05:23,970
I’m going to purposely move each of our UI

98
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,560
elements, so that their new positions

99
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,779
will conflict with what we've told

100
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:32,540
AutoLayout.

101
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,300
Now we see three warnings like we had earlier.

102
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,060
This time when I select the

103
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,680
yellow triangle to update the first frame,

104
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,779
I’m also going to select Apply to

105
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:46,310
all views in container. This should fix

106
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,959
the problem for the other UI elements,

107
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,189
because they all belong to the same

108
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:53,420
containing view. Boom that was easy.

109
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,430
Alright last thing, let's turn off that

110
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,160
green background. With the recording

111
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,870
button selected in the document outline,

112
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,029
let's find its background color property

113
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,920
and change it to the default transparent option.

114
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:10,759
There we go.

115
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,560
Our recording button looks much better now.

116
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,810
Below you'll find steps for adding

117
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:22,089
the icon to the stop recording button too.
