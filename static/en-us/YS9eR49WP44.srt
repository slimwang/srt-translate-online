1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The correct answer is no. Let us try this out.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Let's enter a 3.0 for the differential term, run everything,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and the y error is still large.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It converges now, 0.87, but it's still really, really large.
