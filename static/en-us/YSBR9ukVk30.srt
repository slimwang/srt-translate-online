1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,318
To answer question 1 no. Thousands of

2
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:06,690
notes, images and whatever else a user

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,638
might store would be way too much

4
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:11,009
information for NSUserDefaults to handle.

5
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:13,048
The performance of your app would be

6
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:14,189
terrible.

7
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:16,559
The answer to question 2 would also be

8
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:19,800
no way. Even though NSUserDefaults could

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,410
store videos as NSData, it would be a

10
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,550
horrible idea.

11
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,859
videos are way too big for poor

12
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,890
NSUserDefaults. These would both be great

13
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,469
jobs for Core Data. we’ll learn more about

14
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:33,808
Core Data in lesson three. To answer

15
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:35,340
question 3,

16
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,229
yes, it would be a perfect match for

17
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:39,960
NSUserDefaults. This class was designed

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,450
for saving precisely this type of simple

19
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:50,300
user preferences. Go NSUserDefaults.
