1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
For this quiz, the goal is to see that you understand lists

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and can define a procedure that uses them.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You'll be given a variable, days<u>in</u>month,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
which is initialized to a list containing 12 entries

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
where each entry is the number of days in the corresponding month,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
so January has 31 days, so that's why we have 31 here.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
February--at least in a non-leap year--has 28 days.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
March has 31, and so on up to December that has 31 days.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Your goal is to define a procedure called how<u>many</u>days--

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
with underscores between the words--

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
that takes as input a number representing a month

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and outputs the number of days in that month,

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and we should use the conventional way of numbering the months,

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
so here's a few examples.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If we call how<u>many</u>days, passing in 1,

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
meaning the month January, the output should be 31

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
since there are 31 days in January,

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and that corresponds to the entry in the zeroth position of days<u>in</u>month.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If we call how<u>many</u>days, passing in 9, that's September.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We should get 30.
