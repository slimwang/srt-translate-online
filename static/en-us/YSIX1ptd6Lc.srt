1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:05,542
And the answer is, all of these could possibly go wrong. If we're a responsible

2
00:00:05,542 --> 00:00:09,234
programmer, we should definitely at least worry about these first two. You

3
00:00:09,234 --> 00:00:12,535
probably only need to worry about these if you're really paranoid. There

4
00:00:12,535 --> 00:00:15,769
certainly are situations where people do worry a lot about cosmic rays hitting

5
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:19,525
processors. And there are lots of places where you have to worry about what

6
00:00:19,525 --> 00:00:22,935
happens if power gets out in the middle of executing this. We're not going to be

7
00:00:22,935 --> 00:00:26,301
paranoid enough to worry about these two in this class, but there are some links

8
00:00:26,301 --> 00:00:29,626
at the bottom to places where you do worry about these two. We are going to be

9
00:00:29,626 --> 00:00:34,073
responsible programmers though, so we need to learn to deal with these cases.
