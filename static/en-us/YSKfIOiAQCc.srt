00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,540
To wrap up this lesson,

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:05,160
we want to make sure we drive
home these two main points.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,700
It is incredibly important that
you're always doing experiments and

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,200
iterating on your marketing decisions.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,030
Don't make assumptions,
base your decisions on your research.

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,427
And don't waste time on planning
the best strategy on the first go,

7
00:00:18,427 --> 00:00:19,386
just get started.

8
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,990
You can iterate on your plan as you go.

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,260
It's more important to measure and

10
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,610
improve your performance than it is to
get the absolute perfect plan down.

11
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,640
>> Also, find the right balance
between your qualitative insights and

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,470
your quantitative data that you
receive through your experiments and

13
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,992
user testing.

14
00:00:34,992 --> 00:00:38,390
You want to learn what's happening with
your marketing message through your data

15
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,450
and why it's happening
through your user testing.

16
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,280
This way you're going to be able to make
more informed decisions in the future.

17
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,693
>> And hopefully, you are in
the mindset of building, measuring and

18
00:00:48,693 --> 00:00:51,441
learning from marketing
experiments on an online basis.

19
00:00:51,441 --> 00:00:54,985
>> Now we really want to congratulate
you on completing this course and

20
00:00:54,985 --> 00:00:57,844
we wish you the best of luck
in your future endeavors.

21
00:00:57,844 --> 00:00:58,980
Come back and share [INAUDIBLE]
with us when you have them, bye.
