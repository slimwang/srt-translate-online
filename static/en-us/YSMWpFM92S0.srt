1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
It follows it's got to be something like a quarter.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We already learned that 4 widens the quadratic, so that can't be it.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
One is already shown over here.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Zero makes no sense because we have division by 0

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
which you can think of as a quadratic that shoots up almost like a straight line,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
but honestly it doesn't make any sense.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
A quarter is the one that really describes this particular quadratic the best.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, that's great. Now we understand this expression over here.
