00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,250
So how would you use analogical reasoning to design an agent to answer Raven's

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:06,030
progressive matrices? This might be a tough question at first,

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,300
because the agents we're designing only operate in one domain,

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,610
taking the Raven's test. They don't look at other areas. So, we're

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,210
going to get the knowledge necessary to do cross domain analogical transfer.

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,840
In this instance instead of the agent doing the analogical reasoning,

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,850
maybe it's you doing the analogical reasoning.

8
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,580
Can you take inspiration from other activities to inspire how you

9
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,430
design your agent? Or can you take knowledge from other activities and

10
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,920
put them in your agent, so that it can do the analogical reasoning?
