00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,377
In the last lesson,

2
00:00:01,377 --> 00:00:05,970
we saw that an operating system
is really a reference monitor.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,018
Every time a request is made for
a particular resource,

4
00:00:09,018 --> 00:00:13,610
it must say,
what is the source of this request?

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,090
Authentication helps us
answer this question.

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:22,080
In particular, it tells us on
whose behalf a process is running

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,670
that is making a request for
the resource.

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,940
We will explore multiple
authentication methods and

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,330
how they can be implemented
in a computer system.
