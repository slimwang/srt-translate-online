00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,280
Once you have a handle on the major elements and behaviors you can begin to

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:08,290
construct an analysis model. We'll use the UML class-model diagram to

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,510
express this analysis. A class-model diagram has rectangles for

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:17,780
classes which we're going to use the term components to indicate

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:22,510
the structural elements. We're going to use classes to, denote the components.

6
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,528
Each rectangle is divided vertically into three compartments. One for

7
00:00:26,528 --> 00:00:30,430
the compartment name, at the top. One for its attributes, in the middle.

8
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,520
And one for its operations, at the bottom. And then lines

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,260
between the rectangles are going to denote relationships among the components.
