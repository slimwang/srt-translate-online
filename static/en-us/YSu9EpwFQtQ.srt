1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And of course, the correct answer for the mean

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
is to sum up all the data and divide it by the number of data items.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So you use the command sum(data)

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
divided by len(data)--realize that inside the function this thing is called data.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Then if we plug in data 1, the specific data sequence, into the function,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and we go and hit the run button, we get 54.4 as an answer.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That's the correct mean.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So if you got this right,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
you wrote an interesting piece of software already.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Now if you have lots of programming experience, this was trivial,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but if you're new to programming, it's actually quite remarkable.
