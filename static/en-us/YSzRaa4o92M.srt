>> Keeping in mind that we don't want any common factors to be within any of the

00:00:03,856 --> 00:00:07,948
final factors we end up with that multiply to create a polynomial, how would you

3
00:00:07,948 --> 00:00:11,955
factor this polynomial? I'll give you a little hint, and that hint is that if

4
00:00:11,955 --> 00:00:15,798
there are any common factors that all of the terms have, you should start the

5
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:17,841
problem off by pulling those out first.
