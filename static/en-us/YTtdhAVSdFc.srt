00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,868
Noting that x cannot equal negative 4 and x can also not equal 0, since that

2
00:00:05,868 --> 00:00:11,945
would make the denominator 0. Multiply both sides by the denominators, the

3
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:19,251
quantity 4 plus x and 2x, not forgetting the parentheses. Distribute. Subtract

4
00:00:19,251 --> 00:00:27,281
6x squared and 23x from both sides and simplify. Add 4x to both sides, then

5
00:00:27,281 --> 00:00:32,711
divide by negative 27. And the answer is 4 over 27.
