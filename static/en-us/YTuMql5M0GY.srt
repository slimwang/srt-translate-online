1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,827
So you're probably saying so what? Why
would I want to reduce factors first?

2
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:08,367
Well, what if I wanted to find 3/10*5/12?
I could draw a diagram of the candy bar

3
00:00:08,379 --> 00:00:12,433
and split up the pieces before it. I could
split up the 10's and then 12's. But

4
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:16,360
that's kind of a lot of work and I know I
just really need to multiply these 2

5
00:00:16,372 --> 00:00:21,152
fractions. Multiplying these two fractions
together I get 15/120. But now

6
00:00:21,164 --> 00:00:25,483
I have to figure out if I can simplify
this, and how to simplify this fraction.

7
00:00:25,582 --> 00:00:30,310
This can be frustrating working with large
numbers, so let's make our work easier and

8
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:34,840
simplify our fractions first. I know 10
can be written as 2*5, and 12 can be

9
00:00:34,852 --> 00:00:40,283
written as 3*4. Remember any number
divided by itself makes 1. Like 4/4 makes

10
00:00:40,295 --> 00:00:45,530
1, 5/5 makes 1. It doesn't work for zero,
but we should keep this in mind when we're

11
00:00:45,542 --> 00:00:50,948
simplifying. Here I have 3/3 so that makes
1 and 5/5, so that also makes 1. Now I'll

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,609
just multiply my numerators. So I have
1 times 1, which is 1 and I have 2 times 1 times 1 times 4 or I

13
00:00:57,609 --> 00:01:02,603
have 2 times 1 times 1 times 4.
Which I know that's just really 2*4 or 8.

14
00:01:02,603 --> 00:01:08,582
So 15/120 is really the same thing as
1/8th. I am showing you this longer method

15
00:01:08,582 --> 00:01:12,757
so you can really see why we can cancel
factors. You can do ahead of the time and

16
00:01:12,757 --> 00:01:18,256
this is what it would look like. I know 5
and 10 share a common factor of 5, so I

17
00:01:18,268 --> 00:01:24,730
can divide them both by 5, 5/5 makes 1,
10/5 makes 2. 3 and 12 also share a factor

18
00:01:24,742 --> 00:01:31,329
of 3, so 3/3 makes 1, and 12/3 makes 4.
Now, I multiply, just like before, 1*1 is

19
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:36,105
1, and 2*4 is 8. So either way I do it
this long way, or this shorter way with

20
00:01:36,117 --> 00:01:37,526
cross-cancelling, I get 1/8.
