00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,500
Okay, now that you've learned how to
extract suitable features from an image,

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,629
let's think about how you
can use them to detect cars.

3
00:00:07,629 --> 00:00:11,841
A classic approach is to first design
a classifier that can differentiate car

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,311
images from non-car images, and then run
that classifier across an entire frame

5
00:00:16,312 --> 00:00:19,060
sampling small patches along the way.

6
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:22,737
The patches that classified as
car are the desired detections.

7
00:00:22,737 --> 00:00:24,774
For this approach to work properly,

8
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:28,789
you must train your classifier to
distinguish car and non-car images.
