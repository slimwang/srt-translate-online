00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,930
Rebecca just moved to a new house so

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:04,210
let's update her address
in the database.

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:06,240
Here, we find Rebecca in
the employee database,

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,610
assuming she's the only
Rebecca Allen in our employee table.

5
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:13,600
Next, we find her address
by matching rebecca.id to

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,309
the employee id in the address database.

7
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:20,880
Then, we set the street property of
her address to 281 Summer Circle.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,890
We also update her zipcode to 00189.

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,180
Now, what do we add to our
session before we commit so

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,490
that this update takes place?
