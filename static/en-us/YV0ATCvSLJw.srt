Welcome to homework assignment number 3.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is all about particle filters. All ask you three questions.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Then we have a fairly involved programming assignment.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Here is my first question.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Consider the following world with 4 states--A, B, C, and D.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Suppose we wish to initialize our estimate with uniformly drawn particles.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
My question is what is the probability that cell A is empty?

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm asking this for different values of N--

9
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
N equals 1, 4, and 10.
