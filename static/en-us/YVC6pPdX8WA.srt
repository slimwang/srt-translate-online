00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,950
We just calculated that the exact length of segment BC was the square root of

2
00:00:05,962 --> 00:00:11,560
180. But there's actually a different way that we can write this. What if I

3
00:00:11,572 --> 00:00:17,280
remind you that 180 is actually equal to 36 times 5? So, the square root of 180

4
00:00:17,292 --> 00:00:22,915
is equal to the square root of the quantity 36 times 5. We also know, though,

5
00:00:23,037 --> 00:00:28,314
that 36 is the same as 6 squared. Taking this into account, can you think of a

6
00:00:28,326 --> 00:00:32,923
different way to write the length of BC, so that there's one number under a

7
00:00:32,935 --> 00:00:37,965
radical sign and another number multiplied by that that's not under the radical

8
00:00:37,977 --> 00:00:38,473
anymore?
