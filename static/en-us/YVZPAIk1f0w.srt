1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,710
Now we finally come to the last part of the business model canvas.

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:11,040
We've talked about value props, customer segments, channels, customer relationships,

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,970
revenue streams, partners, resources, and activities, and now we get to cost structure.

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,940
It's kind of ironic we're getting to the last part of the business model canvas

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,660
that could actually put us out of business.

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:29,900
Because remember costs need to be less than the revenue stream.

7
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,740
At least if not on day 1, over time,

8
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,640
or else you haven't built a profitable and sustainable business.

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,640
Let's take a look at cost.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,510
If you really think about it, there are two general types of cost.

11
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,310
One called fixed cost, that is how much does my building costs?

12
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,940
How much are my employee costs going to show up every month,

13
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,990
month to month, that don't move.

14
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,910
The other things are, what are my most important costs?

15
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,880
Are there resources from the resoures part of the business model canvas?

16
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,129
Are there activities that are most expensive?

17
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,630
Did I have to do something with my suppliers?

18
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:13,010
I really want to understand what's the cost structure to operate the business.

19
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,470
What are my fixed costs? What are my variable costs?

20
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,650
What are my most expensive resources? What are my most expensive activities?

21
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:27,250
I want to add them all up and make sure that the interaction between cost and revenue

22
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,730
has costs less than my revenue.

23
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:38,410
Again on day 1 you could say no we're not going to make money for the next year, 2, or 3,

24
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:42,570
and as long as your investors agree and you eventually make money and can prove

25
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,280
to yourself and them you can make money,

26
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,280
it's okay to have costs being a little more expensive.

27
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,870
But you and your investors need to be in sync about costs versus revenue from day 1.

28
00:01:54,870 --> 99:59:59,999
This is something you don't want to surprise investors about.
