1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,070
That's a great question. So what do data scientists do?

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,680
I think it's it's really hard to to pinpoint exactly

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,140
what they do because it's going to be tailored to

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,130
their actual application area that they work. But in general, what

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,650
they do is they take data and they find meaning

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,870
in the data. And what the meaning is going to be

7
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,990
really geared towards is going to be the, the case

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,703
for what they would like to explain. So it could be

9
00:00:25,703 --> 00:00:27,823
that a particular company, if they are looking

10
00:00:27,823 --> 00:00:29,946
at a company or, or the project. If they

11
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:32,691
are looking for some, some particular signal or

12
00:00:32,691 --> 00:00:35,460
something. I think in general in my mind what

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,000
data science does is, is use is use this data. Data sciences uses data

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,240
to essentially explain and perhaps predict behavior

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:52,210
be it human behavior or even like, like, behavior of of of a more

16
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,780
machine generated system, anything could be like that.
