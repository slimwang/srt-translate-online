1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,510
We can start out by writing y and equals sign, since we know that we want an

2
00:00:03,522 --> 00:00:07,174
equation for the total amount of money that Grant spends a month, and that's y.

3
00:00:07,262 --> 00:00:10,863
We also know that no matter how productive his business is, he's going to pay

4
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:14,323
$1200 in rent. And this is just a constant amount that he's going to spend,

5
00:00:14,411 --> 00:00:17,718
regardless how much else he spends on other things. Things.

6
00:00:17,721 --> 00:00:23,112
So, you can write 1,200 as a constant and then a plus sign. He'll spend $6.50 on

7
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:28,207
every single wiper blade he makes. So, we need to add 6.5x to the end of our

8
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:32,024
equation. Voila, we have and equation with 2 variables.
