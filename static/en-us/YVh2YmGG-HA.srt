00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,640
Now for
a quick exercise on residual networks.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,440
Consider the flow over
the network on the left.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,930
And I want you to mark
the edges with errors

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,360
in this attempt at a residual
network on the right.
