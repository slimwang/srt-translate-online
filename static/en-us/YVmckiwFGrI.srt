1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,460
So for a given function, we've learned that the domain of that function, is the

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,668
set of all allowable inputs, the set of all of the values of the independent

3
00:00:10,668 --> 00:00:15,820
variable that we can plug into our function to come up with a value. But if we

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,510
were to talk about the allowable input so much, it's also probably important for

5
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:25,220
us to learn about the possible outputs, the values that the function can equal.

6
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,276
The set of all possible outputs of a function is called its range. And how might

7
00:00:30,276 --> 00:00:34,286
you find the range? Well, we can figure out what the range is by plugging in all

8
00:00:34,286 --> 00:00:38,293
the different values of the independent variable that are in the domain. Once

9
00:00:38,293 --> 00:00:42,705
we've covered all of those, we will have covered all of the values in the range.

10
00:00:42,705 --> 00:00:46,995
So, the domain then is associated with the independent variable, like x in this

11
00:00:46,995 --> 00:00:51,788
case and in many other cases. And the range is associated with dependent

12
00:00:51,788 --> 00:00:56,252
variables like f of x. For each of these different variables, the domain and the

13
00:00:56,252 --> 00:01:00,309
range basically state what values the corresponding variables can take on. So,

14
00:01:00,309 --> 00:01:04,340
considering this definition of the range, what do you think the range of this

15
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:08,654
function is? Remember, this is just the set of all the different values for the

16
00:01:08,654 --> 00:01:13,150
function, all the different vertical coordinates expand in this graph itself.
