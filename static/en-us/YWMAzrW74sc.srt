1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,460
So our first step will be to create
a schema and a contract class.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,970
So creating a database schema
is just a fancy way of saying

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,330
you need to plan out
your database structure.

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,540
And to do so,
we answer these two questions.

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,710
First, what is the name of the table?

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,140
And second, what are the names and data
types of the columns in these tables?

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,630
So what's nice about this
part of the planning process?

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,500
Is that you're a cool cat,
who's already created a database schema.

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,580
So to jog your memory, remember
this CREATE TABLE statement, And

10
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,150
how we could use our .schema command

11
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:40,120
in the SQLite 3 program in order to see
the statement used to create our tables?

12
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,300
Well using that, we can answer
these questions about our database.

13
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,950
Now, I'll leave that up to you
as part of the next exercise.

14
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,010
So here's our exercise for
identifying the schema.

15
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:55,280
So for this given SQL statement,
answer the following questions.

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,840
First, what's the name of the table?

17
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,590
And what are the names of the columns,
and their corresponding data types?

18
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,450
So as hints,
remember that the table name and

19
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,600
the column names were chosen by us.
