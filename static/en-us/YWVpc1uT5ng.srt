00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,230
Once again, I've drawn the vertical, and the horizontal asymptotes, for this

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:07,836
rational function, on our coordinate plane. And we can see, that this time, the

3
00:00:07,836 --> 00:00:13,166
graph is divided into six different sections, by these asymptotes. In which

4
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:16,774
sections of the plane does the graph reside? Think about where its x and

5
00:00:16,774 --> 00:00:20,990
y-intercepts are, and also, try plugging in points, from these different areas,

6
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:24,822
and see which ones work for this equation.
