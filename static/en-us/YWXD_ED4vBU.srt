1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,110
So the question that I'm going to pose to you

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:05,180
is the following, in an RPC, there is a

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:09,440
client call, followed by the server procedure execution, and

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,264
then the returning the results to the client. How

5
00:00:12,264 --> 00:00:15,608
many times does the kernel copy stuff from the

6
00:00:15,608 --> 00:00:19,675
user address spaces into the kernel, and vice versa?

7
00:00:19,675 --> 00:00:21,938
And I want you to focus on the question

8
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:25,620
a little bit more carefully. I said, the entire

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,830
interaction, going from the client call, to server

10
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,840
execution, and returning results back to the client,

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,840
the whole package in order to execute an

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,246
RPC. How many times does the kernel copy

13
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:40,522
stuff from user address spaces into the kernel

14
00:00:40,522 --> 00:00:44,021
buffers, and vice versa? Meaning, from the kernel

15
00:00:44,021 --> 00:00:50,393
buffers, back out to the user address spaces. Is it done once? Is it done twice?

16
00:00:50,393 --> 00:00:52,850
Is it done three times? Or four times?
