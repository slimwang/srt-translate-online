00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,280
Here's something that kind of surprises
many people when they learn SQL.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,280
So far whenever you've done a select.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,400
You've selected from either a table or
a few joined tables.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,005
There's another thing you
can select from as well.

5
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:15,650
Namely the results of a select query.

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,150
This is one form of something called
a subquery or sometimes a subselect.

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,900
Remember back in lesson one when I
mentioned that the result of a query

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,410
is always a table?

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,710
This is why.

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,570
Since the result of a query is a table
you can select from it, join it,

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,470
aggregate it, and so on.

12
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:36,460
Here's a table that lists mooseball
players and what team they're on and

13
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,240
the number of points they
scored in the last season.

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,190
And here's a query that will find
the highest scoring player's score for

15
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,470
each team.

16
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:49,930
This uses the max aggregation, grouping
by team, to find the highest score.

17
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,585
But suppose that we want to know
what the average score of a highest

18
00:00:53,585 --> 00:00:54,990
scorer is.

19
00:00:54,990 --> 00:01:00,540
To do this we can take this whole query
and stick it inside of another query.

20
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:05,760
The outside query, gives the average
of the inside query's results.

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,680
The syntax of SQL requires that we give
the subquery result table a name, maxes

22
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,000
here, even though we don't actually
use that word anyplace in the query.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,750
It's just required.
