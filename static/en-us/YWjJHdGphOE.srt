00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,140
Okay, first things first. Once we've started to receive this HTML,

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,320
we'll be parsing it as we get it. So that's step one.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,220
DOM construction can be incremental, and the response may not arrive all at

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:18,550
once. So, we may not finish constructing it all at once. In the head,

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:23,200
we'll find links to CSS and JavaScript, so then we'll fire off those requests.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,180
That's step two. But there's a gotcha. The script is synchronous, and

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,670
we can't execute it until we have the CSSOM. So we'll need to create the CSSOM

8
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:36,610
as soon as possible. Completing the CSSOM will unblock the JavaScript engine, so

9
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,160
we'll be able to execute JavaScript as soon as we've received it.

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,050
Once the JavaScript is finished, we can resume and finish constructing the DOM.

11
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,890
Once we have the DOM and CSSOM, we'll merge the two and

12
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,660
build the Render Tree. After that, we run layout and paint the page.
