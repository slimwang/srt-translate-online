00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,750
We're going to start out with a really

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:04,070
fun challenge. [CROSSTALK] Pizza. So your going to

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:08,189
design the perfect pizza application on Android.

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,190
So this app is not like Seamless, just

5
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:11,930
imagine your ordering pizza from a single

6
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,560
pizza parlor. [NOISE] So what are the top

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,810

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,082

9
00:00:21,082 --> 00:00:23,894
this exercise, without really telling you why, but

10
00:00:23,894 --> 00:00:25,769
it plays a critical role in you doing

11
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:28,970
really well in this particular lesson. So please put some time

12
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,980
in thinking about what makes a great pizza app for Android.
