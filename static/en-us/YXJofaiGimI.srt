00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,250
An ArrayList collects objects. We call those objects the elements of the list.

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,742
Here's one way of thinking about an ArrayList. You can think of it as a

3
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:14,320
sequence of mailboxes. Here is how you get an element out of an ArrayList.

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,050
Remember that gallery was an ArrayList of pictures. The get method can get a

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,545
picture out of that collection. The argument of the get method is called an

6
00:00:25,545 --> 00:00:32,070
index and as it happens in Java the index values start with zero. So the first

7
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,110
element is at position zero. The second element is at position one, the third

8
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,693
at position two and so on. The get method returns the elements stored at the

9
00:00:41,693 --> 00:00:47,330
index position. In our case that's the initial element and we store that in

10
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:52,414
this variable. What if we wanted to get at the last element? Then we need to

11
00:00:52,414 --> 00:00:57,166
know how many elements are stored in the ArrayList at this time. The size

12
00:00:57,166 --> 00:01:01,944
method tells us that. So gallery.size is the number of elements that's

13
00:01:01,944 --> 00:01:06,465
currently stored in this particular ArrayList. Since the first index is zero,

14
00:01:06,465 --> 00:01:12,585
the last index is one less than the size. Look at over here. This list here has

15
00:01:12,585 --> 00:01:18,090
length five and the last element has index four. Now once we have the last

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,270
index, we can again use the get method passing at the last index to get the

17
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,450
last element out of here. Here you've seen how to access elements individually.

18
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:30,900
More often than not, we actually want to access all of the elements in a loop.

19
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,590
So let's have a look at that. In order to work with every element in an

20
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:40,607
ArrayList, you want to call the get method for every valid index. That means

21
00:01:40,607 --> 00:01:47,324
zero, one, two and so on up to the size minus one. So here's what we need to

22
00:01:47,324 --> 00:01:52,273
put into our four loop. I starts at zero. It get incremented at every step and

23
00:01:52,273 --> 00:01:57,526
we stay in the loop while i is less than the size of the ArrayList. So this is

24
00:01:57,526 --> 00:02:02,483
the classic loop to traverse all of the elements in an ArrayList. I takes every

25
00:02:02,483 --> 00:02:07,009
legal index value, for each i we get the element stored in the ArrayList and

26
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:12,688
then we do something with that element. You will get to try that right now. Go

27
00:02:12,688 --> 00:02:17,801
ahead and write a loop that draws every picture in the gallery.
