00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,748
Let's take a second to step back and look at the steps we've gone through over

2
00:00:03,748 --> 00:00:08,834
the past few quizzes to move from f of x, to f inverse of x. First, we change

3
00:00:08,834 --> 00:00:12,250
variable names from f of x to y, just to make our manipulations a little bit

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:16,602
easier. Then we did something that's generally not legal when we're modifying

5
00:00:16,602 --> 00:00:21,990
equations. We switch the positions of x and y in our equation. This is a really

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,290
important step, because it's in this step, that we're actually switching from

7
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:30,158
the original function to the inverse function. After that, we rearrange our

8
00:00:30,158 --> 00:00:35,315
variables once more, so that y was by itself on one side. Then since we know

9
00:00:35,315 --> 00:00:38,853
this is the inverse function. To make that clear, we change the name of y to f

10
00:00:38,853 --> 00:00:43,516
inverse of x. Showing its relationship with the original equation we started

11
00:00:43,516 --> 00:00:46,740
out with. I think it would be worth it to have a bit more practice finding the

12
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:52,322
inverses of functions. So let's do that, I've written three functions here for

13
00:00:52,322 --> 00:00:56,788
you, f of x equals x plus 1, g of x equals one fourth times x minus 9 and h of

14
00:00:56,788 --> 00:01:02,515
x equals x cubed. For each of these functions, I'd like you to find its

15
00:01:02,515 --> 00:01:06,352
inverse. If you're having trouble remembering what to do and why, then please

16
00:01:06,352 --> 00:01:09,463
go back and just watch the past few videos, or just review the beginning of

17
00:01:09,463 --> 00:01:11,499
this quiz.
