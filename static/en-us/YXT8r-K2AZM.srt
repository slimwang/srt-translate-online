00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,874
Hospital health IT systems came into
widespread use in the late 1970s and

2
00:00:05,874 --> 00:00:06,466
80s.

3
00:00:06,466 --> 00:00:09,890
There were some early attempts
to provide a single vendor

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:14,210
fully integrated hospital wide solution,
but most systems were developed for

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:20,430
a particular department, such as
pharmacy, clinical lab, or radiology.

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,410
And it was common for each of these
departments to select their own system.

7
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,230
As a result,

8
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,410
hospitals were faced with the problem
of communicating among those systems.

9
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:34,530
So, for example, patients could
be uniformly registered and

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,260
charges could be reliably collected.

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,370
Health level seven, HL7, evolved to
create these messaging standards.

12
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:47,190
It used EDIX12 to format the messages.

13
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:53,230
Its latest version, 3, migrates to XML,
which, as we discussed earlier,

14
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:57,190
is a technology developed for
the internet in which tags and

15
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:02,540
HTML formats are used to described
data elements within web pages.

16
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,779
While it is more verbose, memory and
disk space are now inexpensive.

17
00:01:06,779 --> 00:01:11,028
It is more human readable, and
of course, still machine readable, and

18
00:01:11,028 --> 00:01:13,200
it's easily rendered in a browser.
