1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,620
You know by now that
serving one single file for

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,110
every context is not a good idea.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,560
>> Yeah, I mean, the image file
you would want to serve for

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,030
a large display size on
a big high definition TV

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,930
is totally inappropriate for
a watch, for example.

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,220
So how do you serve the right image for

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,800
every combination of device
capability and display size?

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,400
In the last lesson, you learned some
techniques that use CSS background

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,680
images in media queries to
display different images for

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,470
different viewport sizes.

11
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:34,760
That kind of works, but it was
pretty messy and difficult to debug.

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,010
To do it properly,

13
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:40,730
you potentially needed to write CSS to
handle umpteen different use cases.

14
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,180
And what about the future?

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,790
What if all your fancy media queries
don't support some future platform?

16
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,220
>> Yeah, I mean, using media
queries like this is an attempt to

17
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:55,200
guess at build time what image
file will be best at run time.

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,490
You're forcing image choice on the
browser rather than giving the browser

19
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,720
information to make
the best choice possible.

20
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,250
The other problem with media queries
is that they only refer to the viewport

21
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,720
dimensions, not the actual
display size of the image.

22
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,320
What if you give your image
a percentage width, say I don't know,

23
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,690
50% of the viewport width.

24
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,190
Media queries won't help.
