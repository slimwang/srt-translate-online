1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,770
you've reached the end of the deep

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,429
learning module congratulations boy just

3
00:00:05,429 --> 00:00:06,599
like Sebastian right there

4
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:08,308
thank you i try to be just like

5
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:12,388
Sebastian so do you feel like a deep

6
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:13,679
mourning expert now

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,079
well I wouldn't necessarily say expert

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,750
but I think I know what tools I've got

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,960
all right I think you're ready to build

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,778
the behavior of cloning network the team

11
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:26,640
at Udacity has built an awesome

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,278
simulator for you it's going to be your

13
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:31,800
job to drive your car around the track

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,619
collect data and then train a deep

15
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:36,869
neural network to do the driving for you

16
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:39,899
so how would you approach this kind of

17
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:40,710
problem

18
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,689
well i guess i know i compute the

19
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:47,878
gradient yeah and then once I got to

20
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:50,039
stop stop stop this is deep learning but

21
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,899
not computer vision denoting already

22
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:52,979
have no focus

23
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:56,159
good morning got it okay that I think

24
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:01,649
I'd go fire by simulator thank you when

25
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:03,119
you're done you're going to have an

26
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:05,670
awesome portfolio project to show off

27
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:12,560
actually that was kinda cool
