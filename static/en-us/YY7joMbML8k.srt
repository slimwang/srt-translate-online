1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We also had questions about other ways to host your web app.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Right now we're using Google AppEngine, but there are plenty of other alternatives,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and some of them are Amazon AWS, Linode, Rackspace--

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
if you Google web application hosting services, you should probably find

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
many, many options.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Amazon AWS is what Steve uses for Hipmunk.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I believe it's what he used for Reddit as well,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and he really likes AWS, and he would recommend it.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
There are plenty of other options, though,

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and plenty of other options where you can use Python.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Migrating it from one service to another can be a little bit complicated.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And depending on the size of your web application, it can be worth it,

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
or it can be something that you really don't want to do

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
just because it would take your application offline,

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
or it'd just be too much complication to deal with at the time.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We're going to be talking about that a lot more in Unit 7.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Unit 7 is basically going to be about the problems that Steve has run into himself

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
in building web applications and the solutions he came up with,

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
the solutions he wished he came up with, and things like that.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
There were a lot of questions related to that:

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
how to migrate from one service to another,

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
how to come up with an idea and pitch it to people,

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
how to make sure that lots of people see your site and can find your site.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So we'll be going over all those kinds of questions in Unit 7.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So stick around!
