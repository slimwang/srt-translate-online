00:00:00,294 --> 00:00:04,718
You may be thinking,
life cycles are really important.

2
00:00:04,718 --> 00:00:09,004
However this section, 
is on persisting and recovering data.

3
00:00:09,004 --> 00:00:12,232
Trust me, I just want to get us
coding again. However,

4
00:00:12,232 --> 00:00:16,493
these things are closely linked 
and they're easy to get wrong

5
00:00:16,493 --> 00:00:18,221
if you don't understand both.

6
00:00:18,427 --> 00:00:23,248
As Reito mentioned, Android saves 
the state of the application in bundles.

7
00:00:23,487 --> 00:00:25,660
You might have had the idea 
that you would just save

8
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,824
all sorts of information in these bundles

9
00:00:27,824 --> 00:00:31,079
and not have to worry about 
any other form of persistence.

10
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:35,634
But, the thing is, these bundles go away
as soon as the user hits the Back key

11
00:00:35,634 --> 00:00:37,034
in your main activity.

12
00:00:37,034 --> 00:00:39,492
It's really important that they do this.

13
00:00:40,468 --> 00:00:43,884
When the user chooses 
to close your activity with the Back key,

14
00:00:43,884 --> 00:00:47,303
the expectation is that next time 
your activity is displayed,

15
00:00:47,303 --> 00:00:49,270
it will be in the default state.

16
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:53,290
If the user backgrounds your app 
using the Home key or the App Switcher,

17
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:58,019
the next time your activity is created,
it should resume from the current state.
