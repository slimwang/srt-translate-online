00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here we're given a marchov chain between A and B,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
with the transition of A to itself is 0.9 with 0.1 chances transitions to B.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
B stays in B with 0.5 chance and transitions back into A.with 0.5 chance.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'd like to know the stationary distribution over here.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So what's the probabability of A in the stationary distribution?

6
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Of course correspondingly, what's the probability of B in the stationary distribution?
