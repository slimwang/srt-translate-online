00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,760
Let's look at this. If each parent randomly passes down one card,

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,770
there are three combinations total. So if you notice, only one out

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:14,850
of the three have two aces. So only one of these combinations

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,100
would give you the abnormal heart condition. Let's go back to Matt.

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,690
>> That's right. So even though the parents didn't show

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,040
the heart condition The child ended up with a trait

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,220
that neither parent showed. All because there are two

8
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,659
copies, and one version was hidden by the other.

9
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:35,750
>> That's all very interesting, but you're missing out on

10
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,370
all the other traits that have an important environmental component.

11
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,010
>> Okay, well Skinner, let's hear it.
