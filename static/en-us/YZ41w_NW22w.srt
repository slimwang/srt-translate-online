1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now, one other thing affects pricing, and we should think about it.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
If you remember our discussion about market type,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
we have existing markets, we resegment markets, we might be in a new market,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
or in a country outside the United States we might cloning an existing business model.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
But if we're in an existing market,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
we've got to think about competition.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Is there a monopoly?

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Is there a duopoly? An oligopoly?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That is, are there dominant players that really shape the pricing in our markets?

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What we really want to understand is what's their product?

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What are their costs and prices?

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And what pricing will make them feel the worst?

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
More importantly, can we do strategies like bracket them?

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Can we undercut them? Can we niche or blue ocean strategy them?

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
These are the things you want to think about.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If there are dominant players in an existing market,

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
you want to actually have pricing as a strategy,

18
00:01:00,000 --> 99:59:59,999
not just a reaction.
