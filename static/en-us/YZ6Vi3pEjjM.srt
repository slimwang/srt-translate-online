00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,975
So, the important thing about types is what we can do with objects of that type.

2
00:00:03,975 --> 00:00:07,943
Depending on the type of an object, we can do something with it, but not others.

3
00:00:07,944 --> 00:00:13,195
So, here's an example. The string type, or STR type as it's actually called, has

4
00:00:13,195 --> 00:00:18,155
an operation find so if we have a string, we can do find on the string and that

5
00:00:18,155 --> 00:00:23,319
gives us 2, the position of the 3 on the string. The list type does not have a

6
00:00:23,319 --> 00:00:28,167
find operation. If we try to access the find attribute of a list object, it

7
00:00:28,167 --> 00:00:32,958
doesn't have one, and we get an error. The error is giving us an AttributeError

8
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:37,182
that says, well, we had a list object, that's the object 1, 2, 3 that we created

9
00:00:37,182 --> 00:00:41,274
here, and it has no attribute find, so Python doesn't know what to do when we

10
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:45,538
ask to find on a list. There are other operations like multiply that might work

11
00:00:45,538 --> 00:00:49,113
on different types but have different meanings on different types. So, when we

12
00:00:49,113 --> 00:00:53,401
do multiply where the inputs are integers, we get the results of multiplying

13
00:00:53,401 --> 00:01:00,766
those 2 integers. When we do multiply when the first input is a string, we get

14
00:01:00,766 --> 00:01:03,803
repetition of that string.
