00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,760
In order to implement the singleton pattern, the first thing you do is define

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,210
a class variable holding the instance. Then, you can define a class operation

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,100
that creates the instance and saves a reference to it in the class variable.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,510
The operation checks whether the instance already exists and if not creates it.

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,960
In order to protect yourself from creating other instances in implementing

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,610
the Singleton pattern you make the constructor private or protected.
