00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,910
Alright Andy, what do you want to build,

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,290
or what kind of report do you want to make?

3
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,880
>> I really like those little needle sort of, you know, the one that

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,650
actually shows up in your car dashboard and says like, oh you spent this

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,790
much. And if it's green you're really happy, but that would have to do

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,160
with, you know, have you made as much money as you were hoping for?

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,680
>> So, I think you're talking about an odometer in your car.

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:19,910
>> Yes.

9
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,755
>> And then what you're talking about in Salesforce would be a gauge chart.

10
00:00:22,755 --> 00:00:24,690
>> Okay, let's make a gauge chart with a needle.

11
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:25,810
>> Yeah.

12
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:30,040
So, in order to do that for total revenue on the entire festival,

13
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,950
we need to go down to the attendee and create a formula field first

14
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,930
on how much each attendee spent. Because we know how many tickets we have,

15
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,880
or how many tickets they purchased, and we know how much a ticket costs.

16
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,355
>> Remember they also have different ticket prices, so like the

17
00:00:43,355 --> 00:00:47,113
V.I.P. ticket will be like a $100 and general admission $50.

18
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:48,920
>> Exactly. And so that's probably why a

19
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,930
formula field would make the most sense in order

20
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,660
to store that data around that conditional use case.

21
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,080
>> Okay, so add a formula on attendees

22
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,850
to figure how much money each one's spending?

23
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,810
>> Yeah, let's start off that.
