00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,360
The shortest distance here would be 29 miles. Good thinking if you found this

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,373
number. We can actually use the Pythagorean theorem in this case, since we have

3
00:00:08,373 --> 00:00:13,590
a right triangle. We know that our town is due south of the interstate, and our

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:19,022
interstate runs from west to east. So, this means that the interstate and this

5
00:00:19,022 --> 00:00:23,810
north south direction meet at a right angle. So, the distance between these two

6
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:28,270
mile markers is one leg of our triangle. And this distance, 21 miles, is

7
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:33,192
another leg of our right triangle. So, we can square this leg and add it to the

8
00:00:33,192 --> 00:00:38,599
square of this leg to get the square of our hypotenuse. So, we'll have a

9
00:00:38,599 --> 00:00:42,801
squared plus b squared equals c squared. When we square these numbers and find

10
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:46,366
their sum, we'll get 841 equals c squared. And then taking the square root of

11
00:00:46,366 --> 00:00:50,300
both sides, we'll have 1c is equal to the square root of 841, which equals 29.

12
00:00:50,300 --> 00:01:02,056
Great solving if you applied the Pythagorean theorem in this situation.
