1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,161
So it seems like variables are being accessed correctly now in

2
00:00:03,161 --> 00:00:05,700
accordance with the rules of lexical scoping.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,450
But our program needs to actually call the new saga function in order for

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:10,560
it to do anything useful.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,790
So let's call that function twice so

6
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,540
that we can see two different sagas playing out.

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,140
We also need to make sure that the inner function gets called.

8
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,850
So let's do that twice as well.

9
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,220
Meaning each saga will consist of two sentences.
