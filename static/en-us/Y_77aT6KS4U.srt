1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So, this question I want to test your knowledge about

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
the dimension of the state space of a dynamic system.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In all these questions, I'm going to look at a ball, like a soccer ball.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The interesting thing about a soccer ball is its orientation

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
is an unimportant variable, whether it's upside down and so on.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So, in all of these questions we're going to explore this,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and the fact that this object is rotationally invariant.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let me start with a simpler question,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
which is the kinematic state, which is the state without any velocities

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
of the soccer ball, where it is on the ground.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And I'll follow up with a question with the same kinematic state

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
of the ball in mid-air,

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
the difference being between these 2 questions that on the ground

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
it's confined to be in a 2-dimensional ground plane,

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
whereas in mid-air, you might add another dimension or not.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
There's also the dynamic state on the ground and in mid-air.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And for the dynamic state, I wish to ignore things like spin.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I just care about velocities as a person really far away

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
could observe them, just to make things clear.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And finally, I'd like to include spin,

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
so let me take the most complicated situation

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
of dynamic state in mid-air considering spin.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The last one is really a tricky question,

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
so I don't mind at all if you get this wrong.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But in all of those, I would like to exploit the fact

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
that I really don't care about the absolute orientation of the soccer ball that is a sphere,

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
so it's invariant to its orientation, but it might still have spin.
