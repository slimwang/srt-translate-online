First I'm going to make a 2-element queue,.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm going to set temporary variable r1 to be the return value

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
of enqueuing an element and set r2 to be the returned value of enqueuing

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
another element, r3--a third element, r4 to be the value returned by dequeuing an element,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
r5 to be the returned value of dequeuing another element, and finally r6

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
to be the returned value of dequeuing yet another element.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Now the question that I'm asking is what are the values of these 6 variables.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Choice A is going to be 6, 7, 8, 6, 7, 8.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Choice as B is going to be True, True, True, 6, 7, None.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Choice C is going to be True, True, False, 6, 7, 8.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Choice D is going to be True, True, False, 6, 7, None.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 99:59:59,999
