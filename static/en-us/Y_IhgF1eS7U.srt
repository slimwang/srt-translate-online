The solutions to this absolute value equation are 1 half, or 3. If you got the

2
00:00:04,252 --> 00:00:08,875
right answers, great job. Let's see how we got these answers. This time, I have

3
00:00:08,887 --> 00:00:13,435
an absolute value equation, but I have an extra term next to the absolute value.

4
00:00:13,536 --> 00:00:18,084
Before I can split my absolute value equation into two cases, I have to isolate

5
00:00:18,096 --> 00:00:23,098
the aboslute value first. So I can do that by subtracting. 2 from both sides.

6
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:29,465
Then, I have the absolute value of 4 x minus 7 equals 5. Now that my absolute

7
00:00:29,477 --> 00:00:35,760
value is isolated, I can split it into two cases. I have 4 x minus 7 equals 5,

8
00:00:35,772 --> 00:00:41,743
and 4 x minus 7 equals negative 5. So, let's solve this one first. I add 7 to

9
00:00:41,755 --> 00:00:47,753
both sides, 4 x equals 12. I divide both sides by 4, and I get x equals 3. For

10
00:00:47,765 --> 00:00:53,988
the negative case, when I add 7 to both sides, I get 4 x equals 2. When I divide

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,443
both sides by 4, I get x equals 2 4th. Remember, whenever I have a fraction, I

12
00:00:59,455 --> 00:01:04,815
have to make sure I put it in lowest terms or in reduced form. So, 2 4th is the

13
00:01:04,827 --> 00:01:09,830
same as 1 half. And that's how we got 3 and 1 half. Let's try just a couple more

14
00:01:09,842 --> 00:01:12,337
absolute value equation problems.
