1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,930
Now that we have the concepts down, let's go through some actual code.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,590
You can find a link to the repository that contains this application in

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,250
the instructor notes.

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,820
So here we have a pizza ordering application.

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,690
You can click on this Add Pizza button here to add pizzas, and

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,080
each pizza has its own unique number.

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,184
We can also click any of these X buttons to remove the pizzas.

8
00:00:22,184 --> 00:00:24,904
And you'll notice that if we add a couple more pizzas,

9
00:00:24,904 --> 00:00:26,810
it starts off where we left off.

10
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,220
Seven, eight.

11
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,430
Now let's take a look at the actual code behind this.

12
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,860
More specifically, the model that's driving it.

13
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,000
Now before we dive into the JavaScript I'll just mention that we have

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,850
an HTML file here and we've also got a style.css file right here.

15
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,097
You can go through this code on your own if you'd like to figure out how it

16
00:00:47,097 --> 00:00:48,897
works, but it's relatively simple.

17
00:00:48,897 --> 00:00:52,763
Just some HTML dom nodes and some CSS selectors and properties.

18
00:00:52,763 --> 00:00:56,061
The JavaScript is where the heart of this application lies.

19
00:00:56,061 --> 00:00:58,720
We have var data.

20
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,386
And if we scroll down we also have var octopus and var view.

21
00:01:03,386 --> 00:01:05,650
Let's take a look at the model up here.

22
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,200
Now in this application the model is just called data.

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,110
It doesn't necessarily have to be called model per se, but that's its function.

24
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:18,420
And you can see that our model is just a simple object with a couple

25
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,820
properties inside.

26
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:25,610
It's got a property for the last ID of the pizza and an array of pizza objects.

27
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:29,060
With such a simple example it may not seem obvious why we want to

28
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,390
separate this out.

29
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,305
But bear with me.

30
00:01:31,305 --> 00:01:35,480
[SOUND] Sometimes our model isn't so simple and

31
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,610
we'll see examples of this in the near future.
