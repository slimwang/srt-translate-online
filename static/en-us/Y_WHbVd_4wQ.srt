00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,832
Let's see how you did. If you have a pair of jeans that a store paid $23 for and

2
00:00:05,844 --> 00:00:11,614
they mark it up by 32%, customers will pay $30.36. Let's see how we got 30.36.

3
00:00:11,737 --> 00:00:17,568
Well we know the original price of the jeans was $23 and they were marked up by

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,617
32%. Since they were marked up, we add 32% to 100% So 100 percent plus

5
00:00:22,617 --> 00:00:23,687
32 percent is 132%.

6
00:00:23,697 --> 00:00:30,625
Remember when you do problems with percents, they, you always have to convert

7
00:00:30,637 --> 00:00:36,681
the percentage to a decimal. To convert 132 percent to a decimal, we have to

8
00:00:36,693 --> 00:00:41,148
move the decimal over two places. So 132 percent is 1.32.

9
00:00:41,152 --> 00:00:45,375
Now, we just have to multiply 23 times 1.32, and when you multiply those

10
00:00:45,387 --> 00:00:49,765
together, you get 30.36. Now, one thing to keep in mind is whenever you're

11
00:00:49,777 --> 00:00:54,155
solving word problems, you have to remember to put units. So, in this case,

12
00:00:54,257 --> 00:00:59,025
we're talking about dollars, so the answer is going to be $30.36. Don't forget

13
00:00:59,037 --> 00:01:00,320
to put the dollar sign.
