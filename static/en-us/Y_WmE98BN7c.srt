00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Narrator] To understand the branching factor,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
let me quiz you on

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
how many states you can possibly reach

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
from any other states, and as an example

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
from C1, you can reach under

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
any action choice B1, C1, and C2, but it

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
will give you an affective branching factor of 3.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So when I ask you what's the affective branching factor in B3?

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What is the maximum level of states

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
you can reach under

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
any possible action from B3?

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So how many states can we reach

13
00:00:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
from B3 over here?
