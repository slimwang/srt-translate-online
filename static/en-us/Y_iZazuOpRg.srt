00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,969
Here, the solutions were 2 plus the square root of 10 or 2 minus the square

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:08,870
root of 10. Nice work if you got these two answers. So first, we add 6 to both

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:14,130
sides of our equation, so we can set up the left side to complete the square.

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,198
To complete the square, we're going to add b over 2 squared to both sides of

5
00:00:17,198 --> 00:00:23,472
our equation. The b here is negative 4. So, b over 2 would be negative 2 and b

6
00:00:23,472 --> 00:00:28,614
over 2 squared would be positive 4. Now, we're ready to write the left-hand

7
00:00:28,614 --> 00:00:32,720
side as a perfect square. Since our b term is negative, we know we're going to

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:38,378
need x minus a number. It turns out it's x minus 2. Now you can either get that

9
00:00:38,378 --> 00:00:41,612
by thinking about what binomial squared would give us this trinomial or you can

10
00:00:41,612 --> 00:00:46,530
just pull it from this b over 2. This is negative 2, so we use that in our

11
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,665
binomial. Now that we have our perfect square, we take the square root of both

12
00:00:50,665 --> 00:00:53,878
sides of the equation and we add two do both sides of our equation to solve for

13
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:58,778
x. And we know we can't simplify the swuare root of ten since there's not a

14
00:00:58,778 --> 00:01:01,470
perfect square that divides into ten evenly
