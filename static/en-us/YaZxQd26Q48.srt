First, I want you to know that this experiment was completely safe. The baby

2
00:00:04,408 --> 00:00:08,527
couldn't fall. The plexiglass could hold the baby's weight, and they also had a

3
00:00:08,527 --> 00:00:12,532
barrier around the sides of the platform. I didn't draw it here, that way, you

4
00:00:12,532 --> 00:00:16,849
could see the cute baby. This demonstrates to us that by the time the baby can

5
00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:21,100
crawl, he or she has developed the ability to perceive depth. We know this

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,523
because they won't go over the cliff. If they couldn't tell depth, they would

7
00:00:24,523 --> 00:00:28,510
just keep going. That's cool, right? We learned more about sensation and

8
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,150
perception studies during the earlier sensation and perception lesson. So, we

9
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:36,040
just wanted to cover some of the interesting facts regarding human development.

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,560
There's always more you can learn about sensation and perception development.

00:00:47,175 --> 00:00:49,170
on to cognitive development with Susan.
