00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:06,780
This circle will have a radius of 2 and a center at the point negative 3, 1.

00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,916
Great work if you found those two. Now if you struggled with this, I recommend

3
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:14,638
going back to looking at completing the square. You'll need this as a helpful

4
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:19,677
tool for the many of the types of problems, you'll encounter later. We want to

5
00:00:19,677 --> 00:00:24,552
start by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation. So we'll have negative

6
00:00:24,552 --> 00:00:28,700
6 on the right, and then we'll have our x squared term and 6x on the left, and

7
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:34,841
our y squared term and negative 2y, also on the left. I'm moving my constant

8
00:00:34,841 --> 00:00:38,668
term to the right. And I'm regrouping the x terms together, and the y terms

9
00:00:38,668 --> 00:00:42,756
together. We'll add 9 to our x terms, and we'll add that to both sides of our

10
00:00:42,756 --> 00:00:51,233
equation. We add 9 since b over 2 squared equals 9. B is 6. We divide it by 2

11
00:00:51,233 --> 00:00:55,776
which equals 3 and we square it to get 9. To complete the square for the y

12
00:00:55,776 --> 00:01:00,842
terms. We'll add 1 to both sides of the equation. The b here is negative 2. So

13
00:01:00,842 --> 00:01:05,434
negative 2 divided by 2 equals negative 1. And then we'll square it, which

14
00:01:05,434 --> 00:01:09,933
equals positive 1. So these terms terms can be written as the perfect square of

15
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:15,800
x plus 3 squared. And these three terms could be written as the perfect square

16
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,860
of y minus 1 squared. And then on the right hand side, we simply add these

17
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:25,355
constants together to get a total of 4. Now our equation is in a form we

18
00:01:25,355 --> 00:01:32,040
recognize. We have h, which is negative 3. And we have k, which is positive 1.

19
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,763
And then our radius is simply the square root of this number, it's 2.
