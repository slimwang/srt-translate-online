00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,085
Your next problem is not too tough. The PolygonGeometry function has been

2
00:00:04,085 --> 00:00:07,880
extended to include a location. This is where the center of the polygon is to be

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:13,210
located when it's created. Note that the location is passed in as a Vector3. So,

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:18,318
you'll access the location as shown with location.x, and location.y. You can

5
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:23,147
ignore the value of location.z. I'm going to. Your program should look like this

00:00:23,147 --> 00:00:24,493
when running correctly.
