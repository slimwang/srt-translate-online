00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,452
Just like we did last time, let's find where 20 falls on this distribution. It's

2
00:00:05,452 --> 00:00:10,618
here between 7.8, 1 standard deviation away from the mean, and 22.6, so the z

3
00:00:10,618 --> 00:00:16,050
score will be somewhere between 1 and 2. Let's find out what it is exactly. So

4
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,712
we find the distance from the mean, which is now going to be positive and divide

5
00:00:20,712 --> 00:00:25,618
by the standard deviation. We get that 20 is 1.46 standard deviations away from

6
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:31,395
the mean. Now, let's bring up our z table. So like I said before, if we have our

7
00:00:31,395 --> 00:00:38,463
z square, we'll find the proportion less than that z square. So let's start with

8
00:00:38,463 --> 00:00:45,597
that. The proportion less than 1.46 is .9279, here at 1.4. And then the top of

9
00:00:45,597 --> 00:00:54,007
this column is 0.06. So if the proportion less than 20 is 0.9279, then the area

10
00:00:54,007 --> 00:01:00,964
above it must be 1 minus 0.9279. Because remember, the total area under the

11
00:01:00,964 --> 00:01:07,273
curve will always be 1. This is .0721, so about 7.21 percent of students have

12
00:01:07,273 --> 00:01:13,026
gotten more than 20 points per post on average. If you've gotten more than 20

13
00:01:13,026 --> 00:01:17,814
points per post on average, then you're in the 93rd percentile of students,

14
00:01:17,814 --> 00:01:22,678
congratulations. Before we move on, I'm going to show you one more way to look

15
00:01:22,678 --> 00:01:28,687
at this. Since the data is. Symmetrical. Then not means that amount greater than

16
00:01:28,687 --> 00:01:34,616
1.46 is equal to the amount less than negative 1.46. That means that we don't

17
00:01:34,616 --> 00:01:40,940
necessarily have to calculate the proportion less than 1.46 and then subtract it

18
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:47,486
from 1. We could just find the proportion less than negative 1.46. And we find

19
00:01:47,486 --> 00:01:54,454
that the proportion less than negative 1.46 is the same thing that we calculated

20
00:01:54,454 --> 00:01:55,973
before, 0.0721.
