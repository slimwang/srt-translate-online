1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
These are four True or False questions

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
for computer vision, and specifically,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
perspective projection.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Consider a projective image of an object.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Which of the following statements is true?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
If the object moves closer to the camera,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
the size of the projected image

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
of the object will increase.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Is this True of False? Please just check one.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If we use a camera with a longer focal length,

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
as a result of using the longer focal length,

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
the size of the projected image will increase.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Check one.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
If we double the distance to the object,

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
the projected image will be half as large, as before.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Check one.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And finally, the ratio of the focal length

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
over the distance to the object

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
is the same as the projected size of the object in the camera plane.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Please check True or False.
