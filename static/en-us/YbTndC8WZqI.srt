00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,730
I want to repeat that I can't teach you design, you have to learn it. And

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:09,520
I want you to learn it using the projects that have been defined for

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,190
the course. I encourage you to invest energy in those projects and

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:18,140
to think systematically about the design issues that each one of them raises.

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:23,440
Express that systematic thinking in the form of some experiments that you run,

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,660
then write up those experiments in the form of a report. I think by doing this,

7
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,600
it will force you to reflect upon the design process, and

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,680
thereby, make it much more real to you.
