Hi, and welcome to Exploratory Data Analysis, or EDA. In the

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,610
last few months, I learned about R, a programming language, and EDA

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,420
with the help of my friends from Facebook. And in this course,

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,410
I'll teach you how to use R to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis.

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:15,810
>> EDA is one part of the

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,010
larger process of collecting, learning from and acting

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,350
on data. In this course, I'll share

8
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,730
my advice about working with data and visualizations.

9
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:25,640
>> By the end of this course,

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,930
you should feel confident when exploring new data

11
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,250
sets to uncover meaningful patterns. In the last lesson,

12
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,190
I'll walk you through an analysis of the

13
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,600
diamond market with an eye toward building predictive models.

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,880
>> We're excited to teach this course, and to show you

15
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,460
how EDA can be used to answer questions with data. But before

16
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,620
we dig in to EDA, let's talk about data. Data is

17
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,900
ubiquitous. You can find information about

18
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,990
hurricanes, forest fires and state finances

19
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,650
on websites like data.gov. Social networking sites like

20
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:58,400
Facebook, where we work. Collect petabytes of data everyday.

21
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,780
And some people have started tracking their own personal

22
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,540
data using calendars, mobile apps, and physical activity trackers.

23
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,290
>> There is so much data out there in

24
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,530
the world, and so little of it has been explored.

25
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,970
For example, I was poking around on Google trends

26
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,080
the other day and here's what I found. I searched

27
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,940
for the word chicken, because I had read a

28
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,580
news article that morning about chicken food poisoning and salmonella.

29
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,050
And when I search for the word, Google Trends gave

30
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,710
me this graph. This graph shows the interest in searching

31
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,650
for the word chicken over time. In reality, it's counting

32
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,280
how many times we see chicken in any newspaper headlines

33
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,380
in a given month. So from 2005 to 2013, we

34
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,070
can see that occurrences of chicken has been increasing. Now,

35
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,480
I didn't want to stop my search there, so I decided

36
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,290
to enter two more generic word to see what I could find.

37
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:51,620
So I added the word music and I added the word movies.

38
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,170
And then I got this graph. Now when you look at this

39
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,840
graph, tell me some things that you notice. You can talk

40
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,120
about anything interesting that you find in this graph, or you might

41
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,150
compare the first graph to this one and write some things that

42
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,134
you find. Now, keep in mind there is no right or wrong

43
00:02:07,134 --> 00:02:09,460
answer here, I just want to get you thinking about data.
