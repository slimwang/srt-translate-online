1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,750
>> So, there's many, there's many nouns in this in this paragraph description.

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,380
let's, let's concentrate on the ones of those having to do with the electronics,

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,700
the software for which we're going to be building in this example.

4
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,150
>> Okay. So, I have the water strainer, but in terms of the electronics,

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,340
there's a sensor that we talked about being associated with that,

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,300
that would tell us whether there's water in it or not.

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,210
So, there's that, the brew button.

8
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,860
And any other kind of control widgets, the on/off light for the coffee's ready.

9
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,380
As well as the warmer plate.

10
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,330
We're interfaced with that.

11
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:38,570
I wrote down Mark IV special, that's kind of like the facade.

12
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,200
Everything we're looking at >> The overall system?

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,210
>> Right, so, there's that element as well.

14
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,730
The other heating element, to actually, create the steam.

15
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,020
And you know, and then the result with the coffee so those,

16
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,090
those are some of the things that are listed.

17
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,110
>> Okay well we could have,

18
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,110
we could go through the whole process here of underlining the nouns.

19
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:03,510
We could put them into groups, we could stem them just like we did before.

20
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,860
But for now it's enough to get a sense of the the particular elements we're

21
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,330
going to have to be primarily concerned with
