00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,543
To solve this one, we plug these values into this equation as shown. When I do

2
00:00:04,543 --> 00:00:09,393
vector math, I don't not like double negatives. So I usually fold this minus

3
00:00:09,393 --> 00:00:14,747
into the coordinates themselves. Adding up these coordinates, the final answer

4
00:00:14,747 --> 00:00:16,460
is negative 6, 9, and 42.
