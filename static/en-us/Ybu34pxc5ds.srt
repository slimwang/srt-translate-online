1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,814
The flight for Las Vegas won't change and the flight to New York City won't

2
00:00:03,814 --> 00:00:08,794
change, but the flight to Chicago will be less this time. When we write the

3
00:00:08,794 --> 00:00:13,247
condition this way, the original price 100 will not be less than 100, so it

4
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:19,826
will go into the L's and subtract 20. Whereas before, it went into the L's and

5
00:00:19,826 --> 00:00:25,350
subtracted only 10. For the threshold value, it matters whether we say original

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:31,394
price is greater than 100 or original price is less than 100. Even if we switch

7
00:00:31,394 --> 00:00:36,512
the if and else clauses because it changes which group 100 falls in.
