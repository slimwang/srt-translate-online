Let's look at another polynomial function. This time, we have f of x equals x

2
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:09,682
to the 4th minus x cubed minus 3. Now, on your own piece of paper, I'd like you

3
00:00:09,682 --> 00:00:14,296
to sketch the graph of this function. For the part of the domain where x lies

4
00:00:14,296 --> 00:00:19,644
between negative 3 and 3. And please include those end points. Now, did you

5
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:23,643
actually sketch the graph? Please tell me yes or no.
