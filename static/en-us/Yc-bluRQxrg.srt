1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,670
So, let's take a closer
look at this command.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,130
Print f is a shock command for
printing formatted strings.

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,590
If I run it on its own,
it just prints out what I've put here,

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,380
which is an HTTP request.

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,225
You can Printf anything like this,
it's kind of like echo, but

6
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:18,825
it's a little smarter.

7
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:22,145
You can do things like
turn into a line break.

8
00:00:22,145 --> 00:00:25,760
Whereas echo would just print
out the \n's by themselves.

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,670
And nc stands for
net cat nd it's a handy tool for

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,980
mentally talking to internet services.

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,380
Here I'm giving a command that will
connect to the Wikipedia web server but

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,680
nc doesn't know anything about HTTP
in particular instead of Wikipedia.

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,640
I can use it to say hello to
the local host SSH server on port 22.

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,690
I can't speak SSH personally but
I can see what it says.

15
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:57,320
Or we could use it to say hello to
an email server such as Gmail's.

16
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,380
We get a little greeting
here from google.com SMTP,

17
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,720
which is the email protocol.

18
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,600
So we'll be using and see your netcat as
a sort of network Swiss army knife to

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,340
connect to various servers.

20
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,360
And later even to act
as a server itself.

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,570
Now let's take another look
at this here in the middle.

22
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,340
The vertical bar here is a pipe.

23
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,340
It's the standard UNIX way to say.

24
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,910
Take the output of this program and feed
it in as the input of that program So

25
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:28,050
we're taking the output of printf, which
is a string that forms an HTTP request

26
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,020
and we're using that as the input to nc.

27
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,890
Nc picks that input and sends it
over the network to the address and

28
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,220
port that we tell it to and
displays the output.
