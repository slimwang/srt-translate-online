00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,290
Let's try an exercise.

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,939
Here's the 2012 version of the Nexus 7.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:09,750
The screen resolution in
pixels is 1280 by 800.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:15,940
The density is 213 dpi, and the diagonal
screen size is seven inches.

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,390
Now, using the conversion
formula we looked at before,

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,505
what's the resolution of
the 2012 Nexus 7 in dips?
