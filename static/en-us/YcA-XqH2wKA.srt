1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,510
So think about this scenario. You're sitting in class. Your professor is

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,982
telling you everything that's going to be on your exam, and you really need to

3
00:00:07,982 --> 00:00:11,286
write all this down, but you forgot a pen so the girl next to you lends you

4
00:00:11,286 --> 00:00:16,334
one. Okay, now you have your pen, back to focusing on what the professor is

5
00:00:16,334 --> 00:00:20,920
saying. And ignoring the fact that the room is freezing and the guy to your

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,170
right is smacking his gum. Oh, man, there's so much on the slide to write down

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,933
before the professor moves on, hurry, write, write, write, but wait. Why are

8
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:32,840
people laughing? You look around and you notice that people are looking at a

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,410
guy standing outside the window with roses. And a huge sign that says I love

10
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,054
you Torry, be mine. The girl next to you said that guy recited a poem using

11
00:00:42,054 --> 00:00:47,850
like ten poster boards, while doing an interpretive dance. How on earth did you

12
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,462
miss that? Well, back to writing before the slide changes. You're almost done

13
00:00:51,462 --> 00:00:54,423
writing the list of topics for your final when you hear two people behind you

14
00:00:54,423 --> 00:00:57,478
talking about your favorite band and saying they're going to the concert next

15
00:00:57,478 --> 00:01:02,795
week. Oh, man, you've got to get tickets for that concert. Oh no. Slide just

16
00:01:02,795 --> 00:01:06,380
changed. Okay, now you have to focus on your professor's closing remarks.

17
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,832
Because this is the essay portion of the exam. You know, it's going to be hard,

18
00:01:09,832 --> 00:01:14,044
but you can do it. Okay, so now class is over. You turn and give the pen back

19
00:01:14,044 --> 00:01:17,206
to the girl you borrowed it from, but you notice that she's not there, it's a

20
00:01:17,206 --> 00:01:22,628
guy sitting next to you and he's sleeping on his desk. When did that happen?
