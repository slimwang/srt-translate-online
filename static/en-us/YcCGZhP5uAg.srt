00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,410
Okay, so back to this picture real quick. You know,

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,710
I drew these little caches you know, these were the little

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,165
caches you've already seen before. Remember our program ask each

4
00:00:07,165 --> 00:00:10,215
end presently right now is using a dictionary cache to store

5
00:00:10,215 --> 00:00:13,005
stuff. And when we have multiple app servers, this can

6
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:16,798
create a problem. Because we have multiple caches. Which brings me

7
00:00:16,798 --> 00:00:21,340
to my next quiz. Why is our dictionary cache problematic with

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,940
multiple app servers? It's not this is actually a trick question.

9
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,710
Multiple app servers means multiple caches. How do we

10
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,490
keep those caches in sync? Each app server may

11
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,160
have to hit the database to update its cache.

12
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,710
Or we'll caching data redundantly. Check all that apply.
