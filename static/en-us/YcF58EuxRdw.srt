00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It's quiz time. Let's show off our knowledge of memoization.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Submit via the interpreter a definition for a memofibo procedure that uses a chart

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You're going to want the Nth value in the chart to hold the Nth Fibonacci number

5
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
if you've already computed it and to be empty otherwise.
