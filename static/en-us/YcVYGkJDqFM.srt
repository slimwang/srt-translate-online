1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,770
Are we debugging code here or are we building coding standards?

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:05,530
Are we building coding standards or debugging code?

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,650
>> I dunno. It seems to me that I'm being blamed on a lot of things,

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:12,690
that just you know, depending on the fact of having a standard or not but

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:13,470
it's [INAUDIBLE].

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,470
>> Research says building standards significantly reduces the number of

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,546
errors in software.

8
00:00:17,546 --> 00:00:20,281
And so, we should.

9
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,470
Make a note that there are no standards existing in this group, and

10
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:25,415
that they ought to be done.

11
00:00:25,415 --> 00:00:27,008
Here's some suggestions, but

12
00:00:27,008 --> 00:00:30,800
that's a bigger problem than what we're addressing here.

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,680
>> [COUGH] While you're starting it, let's continue it Doctor Vaughn.

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,190
>> At this point we just you know,

15
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:41,710
there's just brackets to c lose catch statement And

16
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:46,320
then the method, and then the classes, and then that's it, the codings.

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,520
>> What is the exit status if everything runs correctly?

18
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,670
>> Oh, it just says it's fine.

19
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,100
>> Shouldn't we be setting an exit status of zero.

20
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,650
>> I think that's probably by default or something.

21
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,270
>> Is it? I don't know, I'm not so sure.

22
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,568
>> I don't know I thought it was by default.

23
00:01:02,568 --> 00:01:04,143
That's what told me.

24
00:01:04,143 --> 00:01:05,440
>> Yeah, but- [CROSSTALK]. >> That was for in our job.

25
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,336
So, you have to be. [LAUGH].

26
00:01:08,336 --> 00:01:12,178
>> Well, while we're [COUGH] mention printing to a log.

27
00:01:12,178 --> 00:01:15,277
Shouldn't we, for the, when we're printing the characters in the while loop.

28
00:01:15,277 --> 00:01:16,984
Shouldn't that, isn't that debug information.

29
00:01:16,984 --> 00:01:18,293
Does the user even need to see that?

30
00:01:18,293 --> 00:01:20,180
They just really need to see the count, right?

31
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,820
Shall we be worried about what's being print to kind of the logger and

32
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,750
then what's printed to standard out?

33
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,660
>> Well, I see that you're kind of changing the specs on me but yeah.

34
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,210
If there has to be a logger then yeah the model will have to change.

35
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,360
>> Well, it says right here, the purpose.

36
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,780
Count the number of blanks in a sentence.

37
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,570
>> Right, I know. >> It doesn't say a purpose.

38
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,010
Write out all of the things.

39
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,446
>> Hm. >> You know, as you're going along.

40
00:01:41,446 --> 00:01:43,390
>> So is the comment wrong or the spec wrong?

41
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,000
>> Well, it's a, that's an excellent question.

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,830
I would say that the I believed what I read there.

43
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,070
But I could be incorrect.

44
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:51,910
>> Yeah, that's the spec I got.

45
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,870
>> Since this is a program without a specification.

46
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,145
I think he just invented it, you know, just.

47
00:01:57,145 --> 00:01:59,110
[CROSSTALK] So he said I need to do this.

48
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,855
He said, okay I can do that.

49
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:04,553
[CROSSTALK] I can copy code from various places and hack this thing together.

50
00:02:04,553 --> 00:02:08,511
>> This way it was nice for the users to see what [INAUDIBLE] but

51
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:10,750
it doesn't have to be the case.

52
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,380
>> I don't know what kind of users you've been around.

53
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,854
>> Oh, you know, users that can put a period at the end of the sentence.

54
00:02:15,854 --> 00:02:16,583
[CROSSTALK].

55
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:19,840
We did and Dr. Bug, anything else for this?

56
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,340
>> That's sound perfectly good.
