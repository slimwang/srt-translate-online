00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,250
First let's look at the device
experience from a user's perspective.

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,850
If I prefer to use a different language,
I can go into the Settings app and

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,770
then tap on the Language and
Input setting.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,510
If I tap on Language,

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,501
then I see the whole list of languages
that are supported on Android.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,450
It includes character based
languages like Chinese, and

7
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:20,860
left to right languages like Arabic.

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,590
I'm going to change
the language to Spanish.

9
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,610
And just like that, all the text
is now showing up in Spanish.

10
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,260
You can see this across
the whole settings app.

11
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,520
If you check the other apps on the
device, those will appear in Spanish if

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,220
the developer chose to
support that language.

13
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,700
However, when you open
up our Just Java app,

14
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,080
it's a drawing experience because
everything in this app is still in

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,630
English, while the other apps
on the device are in Spanish.

16
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,880
So how do we make our
App support Spanish?
