Martin uses the term stable to mean hard to change. Or, if you try to change it,

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,290
it's going to have many implications. Typically, a module's hard to change if

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,080
a lot of other modules depend on it. Martin's stable dependency principle

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,110
suggests that you should depend in the direction of stability. In other words,

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,210
no package should be dependent on packages that are more likely to

6
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:26,300
change than it is. This principle is similar to the previous one, that is, you

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,370
should depend downward and not introduce loops into the dependency hierarchy.

8
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:35,040
Note that we usually think of the term stable as a positive term but Martin is

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,490
treating it as undesirable. A corollary to this stable dependency principle

10
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,870
is Martin's Stable Abstraction Principle in which stable packages should be

11
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,000
abstract packages. The idea is that they're hard to change but easy to extend.
