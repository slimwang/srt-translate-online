1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,340
So, let's look at these
set of parameters.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,821
This is, in essence,
referred to as the Plenoptic Function.

3
00:00:06,821 --> 00:00:12,570
The Plenoptic Function is, in essence,
equivalent to putting a sensor, an eye,

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,580
a pinhole camera, any point in
the world, and measuring at that point,

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:23,050
which, of course, the location of
that point is Vx, y, and z, Vz.

6
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:29,210
Recording the intensity of the rays
of light with wavelength at any time,

7
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,840
and basically, at all possible angles.

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,530
Again, the bundle of rays of light
around Vz, or in terms of x, y, and z.

9
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,690
So, that's what we are interested in,
and this is basically,

10
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,440
what a Plenoptic Function is.

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,500
It's a concept that was introduced
by Adelson and Bergan in 1991,

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,600
look at the paper,
if you want more details please.

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,450
Just to be specific, the term Plenoptic,
is a Latin word, which kind of

14
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:58,105
merges the words plenus and optic,
and in essence, again, it's basically,

15
00:00:58,105 --> 00:01:02,310
is capturing the light traveling in
every direction in a given space.

16
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,970
This allows us to kind of start
thinking of the Plenoptic, or

17
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:09,480
a Light field camera that basically
says, that at any point in the world

18
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,420
we can capture a light field, and
render pixels from that as needed.

19
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:17,130
So, now actually rather than converting
pixels right away, we want to

20
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,190
capture a lot more information about
the Light field at that point, and

21
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,450
then we can render pixels
whenever we need to.
