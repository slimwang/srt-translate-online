1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,920
Well so, there's a couple a ways to think about it,

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,230
but let me just kind of go top down. So, here's what I'm

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,640
thinking. I think the same principle applies, where you sort of want to

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,600
ask the question that gives you the maximum amount of information. And

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,430
from the teacher's point of view, I might be able to

6
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:18,680
pick a question that gives you the answer right away, depending upon

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,990
what h is and what x is. But from the learner's point

8
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,970
of view, I sort of can't. So what does the learner know?

9
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,346
>> So, when we ask a question,

10
00:00:25,346 --> 00:00:29,155
x, it's going to either have a yes answer. Or a no

11
00:00:29,155 --> 00:00:32,342
answer. And let's say that at any given point in time,

12
00:00:32,342 --> 00:00:36,270
we have n possible people that we're trying to reason about.

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,010
And then after we choose x, after we choose the question,

14
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,220
if the answer is yes then we're going to have, I don't

15
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,790
know, some other number of people. Let's say l. And if

16
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,370
the answer is no then it's going to be n minus l,

17
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,290
right? And so you said that in the case of the teacher,

18
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,460
pick a question so that this yes is going to whittle it

19
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,630
down so that this is just going to be the one right answer.

20
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,970
>> That's exactly right. That, that's assuming that x is set up

21
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,180
in such a way that you could ask that kind of question.

22
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,080
>> Basically a question could be of the form, is it this or this or this

23
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,220
or this or this? Any pattern of answers

24
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,550
that we want, we can construct the corresponding question.

25
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,980
>> Okay, that makes sense to me and I don't think it changes, my

26
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,830
thought process, so, so, that's good. So

27
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,380
I always want to ask the question that's going to

28
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,740
give me maximum information. I'm the learner.

29
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,570
I don't know, everything like the teacher does,

30
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:26,630
but what I do know are all of my hypotheses. Alright. So I know how

31
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,900
each hypothesis responds to each of the

32
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,100
questions. So, in general, it seems to me

33
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,890
that I should try to eliminate as many

34
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,240
hypotheses as I can, okay? That makes sense?

35
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,540
>> Yeah, I'll write that down. I like that.

36
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,224
>> Now, you could say,

37
00:01:40,224 --> 00:01:42,876
that's what the teacher did. But, let's take what the teacher did,

38
00:01:42,876 --> 00:01:45,564
the teacher knew that there was a hypothesis where it would whittle

39
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:47,964
it down that, since the answer was yes, it would whittle it

40
00:01:47,964 --> 00:01:50,365
down to one. But if the answer had been no, it would have

41
00:01:50,365 --> 00:01:53,264
only gotten rid of one. So since the teacher knew the answer

42
00:01:53,264 --> 00:01:57,203
the teacher could pick that question. But as a learner, I don't know

43
00:01:57,203 --> 00:02:00,966
the answer, so finding questions that whittle it down to one if

44
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:05,209
the answer is yes aren't very helpful because the answer might be no.

45
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:05,650
>> Alright

46
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:08,538
so how many. Let's see so under the assumption the

47
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:11,840
target hypothesis was chosen from H say, uniformly at random.

48
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,070
>> Right.

49
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,620
>> What's the expected number of hypotheses we

50
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,530
can eliminate with a question that has this form?

51
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,450
>> Well, it's binary. So if you assume

52
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,600
that the hypothesis covers every, the hypothesis base

53
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,340
covers everything. Then the best you can do

54
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,090
is eliminate about half of them, on average.

55
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,380
>> Well, so, but in particular, if you have

56
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,860
a question like this, x. That, you now, you ask

57
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,060
it when there's n possible people. And then, after

58
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,510
you ask it if the answer is yes, you're

59
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,650
at l possible people. And otherwise, you're at n

60
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,820
minus l. Which branch are we going to go down?

61
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,210
>> Well, we don't know. It could be either one.

62
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,070
>> ha. But do, can we put a probability on it?

63
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,790
>> Yes if it covers everything. It's about a half

64
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,230
and a half. You said it was uniform, right? Uniformly chosen?

65
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,150
>> The, the right answer, the, the target person is uniformly

66
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,274
chosen. But this question isn't, isn't necessarily of that form, right?

67
00:02:56,274 --> 00:02:58,794
This, this question could be very skewed, it might only have one thing

68
00:02:58,794 --> 00:03:01,806
on the left. And n minus 1 on the right like you said.

69
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,010
>> Right, well then I, that's not a very good question to ask.

70
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,520
>> No, that's right. But I wanted, I

71
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,430
want to be able to distinguish good from bad questions

72
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,640
by saying we want questions that, that, that are

73
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,410
going to leave us with the smallest expected size set.

74
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:16,190
>> Oh, well then since all possibilities are there, the smallest

75
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,988
the, the best you can hope for is about a half.

76
00:03:18,988 --> 00:03:21,060
>> Yeah, and in particular, eh, with this,

77
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,532
this particular question's going to do, is it's going to have a probability

78
00:03:24,532 --> 00:03:26,884
of n over l of going down the left branch and getting

79
00:03:26,884 --> 00:03:29,646
an l. And it's going to have a probability of n minus l

80
00:03:29,646 --> 00:03:32,636
over n of going down the right branch and getting n minus

81
00:03:32,636 --> 00:03:35,990
l. And so that could be one way of actually scoring this,

82
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:39,684
this quesiton The question that has the best score, as you pointed

83
00:03:39,684 --> 00:03:42,063
out, is going to be one where l is about the same as

84
00:03:42,063 --> 00:03:44,991
n minus l, in fact, half would be a really good choice.

85
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,213
>> Right, I thought that's what

86
00:03:46,213 --> 00:03:46,550
I said.

87
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,030
>> Yeah.

88
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,640
>> Oh, okay, good.

89
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,260
>> But, but I just wanted to write down the formula.

90
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,330
>> Okay, that makes sense, that makes sense. Okay, no,

91
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,470
it's always good to write down the formula. Okay, so

92
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:57,200
you want to pick questions that roughly split things in half.

93
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,910
And if you can do that every single time, then every

94
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:03,146
single time, you will split the set in half. So

95
00:04:03,146 --> 00:04:05,866
you'll start out with n, then n over 2, then n

96
00:04:05,866 --> 00:04:08,246
over 4, then n over 8, then n over, and

97
00:04:08,246 --> 00:04:11,399
eventually you'll get to n over n which will give 1.

98
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:14,151
So you'll only have one, possible answer. And

99
00:04:14,151 --> 00:04:17,740
so that'll take you a logarithm amount of time.

100
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,329
>> Right, so the number of times you can divide

101
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:21,140
a number in half before you get down to one

102
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,660
is exactly the log base two. So if we start

103
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,130
with size of h hypothesis, it will take us like log

104
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,540
base two to whittle it down to a single question.

105
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,370
This is a lot larger. I mean this is a

106
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,650
nice small number, but it's a lot larger than one,

107
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,780
right? You know, one, one is really great. This is you

108
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,410
know, exponentially, no, this is much, much worse than one. But

109
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,070
but it's still really good. You can, you know, it's not

110
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:45,870
considering all the hypothesis. It's very cleverly whittling it down so

111
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,323
that it only has to look at the log of that.

112
00:04:48,323 --> 00:04:48,700
>> Right.
