1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,709
So far we've been using a generic

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,080
UIViewController for our second scene.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,359
Remember this view where you set the

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,609
background color? Now UIViewController

5
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:10,740
it's a great class, but we

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,558
can't add any code to it directly.

7
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:15,419
In order to do audio playback, we need a

8
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:17,760
UIViewController subclass that we can

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,039
add our code to. I’m going to show you how

10
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,778
to create this new class which will call

11
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:24,719
the PlaySoundsViewController. In the

12
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:26,518
Navigator panel, let's right-click the

13
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:28,980
PitchPerfect folder and go to New File.

14
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,759
Make sure iOS is selected and then

15
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,869
select the Cocoa Touch Class and click Next.

16
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:43,140
For the class name, let's set it to

17
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,210
PlaySoundsViewController and set it

18
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,829
to be a subclass of UIViewController.

19
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:52,710
And make sure the Also create XIB file

20
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,109
is unselected and the language is Swift.

21
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:59,969
And then click Next. Here we just make

22
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:01,378
sure that the file were created as part

23
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:04,109
of our project PitchPerfect and that

24
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:07,530
it's selected as one of the targets and

25
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,430
click Create. Now we can see our

26
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,319
PlaySoundsViewController in the Navigator

27
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:15,719
panel. There's one more step,

28
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:17,400
the storyboard doesn't know that we want

29
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,109
to use this file for the second

30
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:20,310
View Controller.

31
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,170
Let's walk through changing that. Back in

32
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,478
the Main.storyboard file, select the

33
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:31,228
second View Controller, then in the

34
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:33,000
inspector panel, go to the identity

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,040
inspector which has the icon that looks

36
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,549
like the ID card. In the drop-down for

37
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:40,319
class, let's select PlaySoundsViewController.

38
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,969
Make sure you press Enter for

39
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:47,609
it to take effect. And that's it, now

40
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:49,319
storyboard knows how to use the new

41
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:51,209
PlaySoundsViewController class

42
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:52,228
instead of just the generic

43
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:58,250
UIViewController
