00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,011
So the answer you can see
here in Android Studio.

2
00:00:03,011 --> 00:00:06,494
First of all,
I create a GeofencingEvent object.

3
00:00:06,494 --> 00:00:10,140
And I'm going to use the GeofencingEvent
abstract class with its

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,280
fromIntent method, passing it my
intent to get the GeofencingEvent.

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,245
Then once I have the GeofencingEvent,
it has an hasError property, so

6
00:00:20,245 --> 00:00:24,570
I can say if geofencingEvent.hasError(),
do something.

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,320
I'm creating a string
called errorMessage, and

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,170
I'm using the geofencingEvent's
getErrorCode method

9
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,970
to create the error string out of that.

10
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:38,100
Now you'll notice here I have
GeofenceErrorMessages.getErrorString,

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,490
and this creates the string for me.

12
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,240
Now you may not find this class
anywhere in the documentation

13
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,840
because this is one that
I actually built myself.

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,608
And you can see it in here.

15
00:00:47,608 --> 00:00:51,720
So the GeofenceErrorMessages
class is just a simple class

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,730
that converts an error code from
the GeofenceStatusCodes into a string.

17
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,695
So for example, Geofence not available.

18
00:00:57,695 --> 00:00:59,990
There are too many Geofences registered.

19
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,250
There are too many
PendingIntents registered.

20
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,630
Each of these status codes has
a friendly string that we can associate

21
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,270
with it, and then that friendly string
will be returned to the caller.

22
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,010
So that's how we get our
onHandleIntent started.

23
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,520
We get our GeofencingEvent.

24
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,095
We check if it has an error.

25
00:01:16,095 --> 00:01:17,976
If it doesn't have an error,
we'll continue.

26
00:01:17,976 --> 00:01:19,633
If it does have one, we'll log it and

27
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:22,260
then just return out of this
function and end right there.
