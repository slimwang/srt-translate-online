00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,470
In closing, we covered a lot of ground on operating system structuring. We saw

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:10,988
how the vision of extensible services, which had its roots in the

3
00:00:10,988 --> 00:00:14,540
HYDRA operating system, and the visualization

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,695
technology for hardware, that started with IBM

5
00:00:17,695 --> 00:00:21,480
VM/370. How all culminated in the

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,170
virtualization technology of today that has now

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:31,520
become mainstream. Data centers around the world are powered by this technology.

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,230
All the major IT giants of the day from chip makers, to box makers,

9
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:43,820
to service providers are all in this game. Processor chips from both Intel

10
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,400
and AMD have started incorporating virtualization

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,060
support and hardware that makes it easier

12
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,950
to implement the hypervisor, especially for overcoming architectural

13
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:00,930
quarks that we discussed in the context of VM were like

14
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:06,190
full virtualization. Even Xen, which started out with

15
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:11,450
paravirtualization, has newer version that exploit such

16
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:16,380
architectural features of the processor architectures to run unmodified

17
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,700
operating systems on top of Xen,

18
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,030
a technique that they call hardware-assisted virtualization.
