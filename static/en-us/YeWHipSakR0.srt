00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,035
These two graphs are the only two that show step functions. The other two

2
00:00:04,035 --> 00:00:08,326
aren't, because this one has linear parts, with slopes that aren't just 0, and

3
00:00:08,326 --> 00:00:13,854
this one has a part that's a problem. This third one is sort of a funny case,

4
00:00:13,854 --> 00:00:17,394
you might call it a trivial case of a step function, because it's just one

5
00:00:17,394 --> 00:00:23,517
constant function. This is just f of x equals 3. This step function only has

6
00:00:23,517 --> 00:00:27,594
one constant piece, so it's sort of a silly example, but it still counts. This

7
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:31,570
first one is a more classic example of a step function. And probably something

8
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,259
you'll see more typically when people talk about step functions.
