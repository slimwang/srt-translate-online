1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,128
The answer is sqrt(P)+2.

2
00:00:02,128 --> 00:00:05,730
Let's take an edge,
I don't know, how about this one?

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,380
Let's see which logical edges
map to this physical edge.

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:13,380
There are square root of P edges
that come from the matching edge

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,890
as well as all of these vertical edges,
but that's not all.

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,950
There are also these
pesky wraparound edges.

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,830
This wraparound edge
corresponds to this path.

8
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,190
And what about the other
wraparound edge?

9
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,130
The shortest path for

10
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:33,070
this wraparound edge would start here,
go along the first row,

11
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,210
down this wraparound edge in the ring,
and back across the bottom row.

12
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,900
So notice that it also
has to touch this edge.

13
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,285
So the wraparound edges give me the + 2.

14
00:00:42,285 --> 00:00:46,440
If you were off by one or two, the
auto-grader should have forgiven you.

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,700
Asymptotically, the important point
is that congestion grows by square

16
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,260
root of P.
