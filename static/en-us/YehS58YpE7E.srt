1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,767
The first graph crosses the y axis at this point. We moved 0 horizontally and 3

2
00:00:05,767 --> 00:00:11,179
up vertically, so our y-intercept is 0, 3. For the other graph, we moved 0

3
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:16,939
horizontally and then down 1 or negative 1 in the y direction, so 0, negative 1

4
00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:21,039
is our y intercept. Great work if you got both of those.
