1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,890
Now you know who are your competitors,
but

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,970
what are your competitive advantages and
disadvantages?

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,030
Think about your values and
be honest with yourself about it, so

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,360
you are aware of where
you stand against others.

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,600
Analyze your competitive advantages and
disadvantages.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,810
An advantage is gained by a company
when it can provide the same value as

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,200
its competitors but at a lower price.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,660
Or I can charge higher prices,
by providing greater value for

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,270
differentiation.

10
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,410
Competitive advantage results
from matching core strengths

11
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:30,340
to the opportunities.
