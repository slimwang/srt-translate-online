1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Obviously these two criteria are in conflict to each other.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In reality, what we do is minimize both, and you do that with some sort of a weight, alpha,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
which you can play with in the code.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The stronger alpha, the smoother the path.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The smaller alpha, the more we retain the original points.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Here's my next question. Suppose we optimize both at the same time with an appropriate alpha?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
What do we get? An original path, a smooth path, or no path?
