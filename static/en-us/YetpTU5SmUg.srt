00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,471
Percentages range from 0% to 100%, just like proportions, how they range from 0

2
00:00:06,484 --> 00:00:12,375
to 1. And again, all percentages should add to 100. So, if you added all of

3
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:18,554
these, we should get that our total is 50 here, since we have 50 in our sample,

4
00:00:18,683 --> 00:00:19,482
1 and 100%.
