00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,848
For this equation, the final solution was negative 5 and negative 14 5ths. Both

2
00:00:05,848 --> 00:00:10,900
of these values work for b. Great work if you found these two answers. I know

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,870
one of them was a fraction, and you might not have gotten all the way there.

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:17,115
But I hope you were able to make the substitution for b plus 3 and at least

5
00:00:17,115 --> 00:00:23,058
find the values for u. Let's see how we do that. We can start by making the

6
00:00:23,058 --> 00:00:28,570
substitution u equals b plus 3. So wherever I see b plus 3, replace that with a

7
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,639
u. Now we want to solve this quadratic equation, so we need to move this term

8
00:00:32,639 --> 00:00:37,110
to the left hand side. So, we'll have a quadratic expression here and 0 on the

9
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,078
right. After subtracting 2 from both sides, we want to try and factor this

10
00:00:41,078 --> 00:00:47,510
expression. We find factors of negative 10 that sum to positive 9. Those

11
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:52,499
factors are negative 1 and positive 10. We use factoring by grouping to get

12
00:00:52,499 --> 00:00:57,196
these two factors equal to 0. Then, we can set each of these factors equal to 0

13
00:00:57,196 --> 00:01:03,970
to solve for the values of u. U can equal negative 2, or u can equal 1 5th. So,

14
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:08,450
since we know u equals negative 2 and u equals 1 5th, we can say b plus 3

15
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:14,922
equals negative 2 and b plus 3 equals 1 5th. We solve for this value of b to

16
00:01:14,922 --> 00:01:20,076
get b equals negative 5. Over here, we'll subtract 3 from both sides to get b

17
00:01:20,076 --> 00:01:26,184
equals 1 5th minus 3. We'll change 3 into 15 5ths and then subtract to get

18
00:01:26,184 --> 00:01:28,934
negative 14 5ths.
