00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,830
As you may have started to see in other
apps, there are plenty of different ways

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,430
to inform the user that there may
be a problem with connectivity.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,940
The material design spec offers some
guidelines on how to present this type

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:15,890
of error to the user, with an example
in the email app and the search app.

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,410
In the last coding task of this lesson,
and

6
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,570
of this course, we'll introduce logic to
check if there is network connectivity

7
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,570
before we initialize the loader
to kick off the request.

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,930
Now, if there isn't
internet connectivity,

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,410
then we'll change the empty state text
view to show a no internet connection

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,370
error message, like in this screen shot.

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,010
Now I'm providing you with a link to
this developer guide on how to connect

12
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,250
to the network and
check for connectivity.

13
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,230
Now one more really important
note here at the top of the doc,

14
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,150
you'll also need to declare another
permission in the Android manifest file

15
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,880
to access the network state,
as you an see here.

16
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,510
So make sure you add this
line to your manifest.

17
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,760
Once, you've completed
the first two tasks,

18
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,270
then test your app to make
sure it works with and

19
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,800
without internet connectivity
by using airplane mode again.

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,890
Now, remember the force stop
the app in between tests, so

21
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,060
that the activities is destroyed and
created again from scratch.

22
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,480
You can do this by swiping
