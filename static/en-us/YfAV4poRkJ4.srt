00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,652
A kind of Epigenetics that interests psychologists involves modifying DNA

2
00:00:04,652 --> 00:00:09,870
without changing the sequence. Molecular tags known as Methyl Groups get

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,950
attached to the DNA and once tagged this can signal for a gene to be turned

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:19,790
off. Or silenced regardless of the actual sequence.

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,877
>> So this is an example in mice that was done a while back and it demonstrates

6
00:00:23,877 --> 00:00:29,815
the power of the environment on your genes. Two genetically identical strings

7
00:00:29,815 --> 00:00:34,036
of mice from different mothers turned out looking very different because their

8
00:00:34,036 --> 00:00:39,664
respective mothers had very different diets. Now one pregnant mother was fed a

9
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:44,420
diet rich in nutrients for things like methyl groups. The other mother was fed

10
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,370
a diet lacking nutrients for these methyl groups. The mother who had a diet

11
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:53,660
rich in nutrients for methyl groups gave rise to offspring that were obese and

12
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:59,398
had yellow fur. Whereas the mother that had a diet lacking these nutrients had

13
00:00:59,398 --> 00:01:04,834
normal offspring that were non obese with brown fur. Now the amazing thing

14
00:01:04,834 --> 00:01:11,246
about both of these mice is that they're genetically identical. The mother who

15
00:01:11,246 --> 00:01:15,258
was fed one diet rich in nutrients presumably was able to regulate gene

16
00:01:15,258 --> 00:01:21,352
expression in a certain way that gave obese mice with yellow fur. The other

17
00:01:21,352 --> 00:01:24,892
mother was fed a different diet which was alternatively effect the gene

18
00:01:24,892 --> 00:01:30,260
expression and resulted in a brown furred, non obese mouse. So importantly,

19
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,880
these two mice are genetically identical, but they turned out appearance wise

20
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:41,004
very different. We refer to these as having the same genotype. But a slightly

21
00:01:41,004 --> 00:01:46,370
different epigenome, and a very different appearance or phenotype.

22
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:49,709
>> So although this is yet to be shown in humans, it demonstrates that genes are

23
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:54,370
not our destiny. Their expression is influenced by what we do and get exposed

24
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:57,400
to from our environment. So lets go to this quiz.
