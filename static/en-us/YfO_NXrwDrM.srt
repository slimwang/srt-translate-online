00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Congratulations. You just learned about pie charts.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
They're great for relative data, and they're wonderful for comparing

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
which slice of the pie is bigger.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So in the next class we'll look at relative data again, and we'll pick up the touchy issue

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
of gender discrimination in college admissions,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
using a study originally performed at UC Berkeley here in California.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This'll be a really deep statistical question, and I promise you you'll be surprised by the result.
