1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,609
The challenge should be clear.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:03,670
Physicians are busy.

3
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:10,150
Their work depends on data taken from a
huge and complex set of possible values.

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,740
They have little,
if any training in informatics.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,730
EMRs could be better.

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,280
Isn't it possible to innovate and
offer approaches to the computer

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,395
physician interface that are more
imaginative and hopefully more

8
00:00:23,395 --> 00:00:28,280
successful than mimicking the paper
tools that have been used for decades?

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,280
We turn to that now.
