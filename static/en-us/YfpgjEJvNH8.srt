1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,748
So when learning like order of operations. That was something that I never

2
00:00:03,748 --> 00:00:07,087
really thought twice of, especially you know when you're a kid and you're in

3
00:00:07,087 --> 00:00:11,937
the math class and then you're in high school and college. And I mean you're

4
00:00:11,937 --> 00:00:15,187
told that there's different order of operations but when you're programming

5
00:00:15,187 --> 00:00:18,387
it's a little bit different because then you know you've got you know doubles

6
00:00:18,387 --> 00:00:21,637
and ints and floats and that's something that like off the bat, like I kind of

7
00:00:21,637 --> 00:00:24,837
struggled with, like sometimes my, like I would run my code and it would work,

8
00:00:24,837 --> 00:00:30,620
other times it didn't work. And I ended up learning that one of the most

9
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,900
important things is being able to know the answer before it comes out and

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,646
understanding how that answer works. And understanding the sequence like the

11
00:00:37,646 --> 00:00:42,785
operations like, what, what different things would work and what wouldn't work.

12
00:00:42,785 --> 00:00:46,079
And, one of the things for me, like, you know, even just sitting down with a

13
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,481
piece of paper and understanding, okay, so if I divide by an int, will I get an

14
00:00:49,481 --> 00:00:55,524
int back. Like, if it's a double that I was dividing by. Like, what, what's the

15
00:00:55,524 --> 00:00:59,725
actual way to do this that's right. And then if that something wasn't right, I

16
00:00:59,725 --> 00:01:02,470
really needed to work hard to understand why at first and now, I mean, it's

17
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,440
more instinctive that I like, I'll, I'll even write it not thinking twice about

18
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,440
it. But, when you're learning this, it's something that, like you don't realize

19
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,936
is actually important to keep things, I guess together and concise. Something

20
00:01:14,936 --> 00:01:15,499
like that.
