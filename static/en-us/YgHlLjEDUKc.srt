In the section on error handling,

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:07,610
we used the @objc attribute to expose an
enum of type ErrorType to Objective-C.

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:11,460
When I place that modifier in
front of this particular enum,

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,950
the compiler doesn't like it very much.

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,653
Okay, let's see what
the compiler has to say here.

6
00:00:17,653 --> 00:00:22,670
@objc enum raw type 'String'
is not an integer type.

7
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,490
So I'm reminded to change
this to an integer.

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,600
And of course I have to change
the values to integers, too, and

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,271
the error goes away.

10
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:36,807
And now I'm able to access these
error codes from the parts of my

11
00:00:36,807 --> 00:00:39,310
project that are written in Objective-C.

12
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,810
These compiler errors
can be really helpful

13
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:45,900
because they flag code that would
otherwise be silently ignored.

14
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,367
For example, let's say we're
back in our house class and

15
00:00:49,367 --> 00:00:52,430
we've added a Swift struct
to represent a hot tub.

16
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:58,615
If I mark this HotTub struct with
an @objc attribute, I see an error.

17
00:00:58,615 --> 00:01:01,660
@objc can't be applied
to this declaration.

18
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:06,160
And of course I'm reminded that
Objective-C can't consume structs.

19
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,990
So I edit my HotTub to be a class.

20
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,120
I make sure it inherits from NSObject.

21
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,830
I edit these functions a little bit.

22
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:21,110
And now when I add the @objc attribute,
I don't see that error any more.

23
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,080
I can see that there's no problem.

24
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,120
Although, now that HotTub
inherits from NSObject,

25
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,140
I actually don't need
the @objc attribute any more.
