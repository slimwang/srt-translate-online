We know that the two lines on this graph are perpendicular to one another, and

2
00:00:04,188 --> 00:00:08,411
we just discussed that being perpendicular has a lot to do with slope. Now, I've

3
00:00:08,423 --> 00:00:12,544
named these two lines, p and q, and I'd like you to start off by telling me what

4
00:00:12,556 --> 00:00:14,219
the slope of each one of them is.
