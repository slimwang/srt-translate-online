1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is that it's theoretically impossible

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
to compute this for an arbitrary sequence.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The first answer is not correct.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
If S is truly random, this would be correct.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
But if S is not truly random, there might be some shorter way to compute it.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So this gives the maximum value of the Kolmogorov Complexity

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
of sequence length S.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And an example of such a program would just be this Python program,

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
that would be the program "print" + S.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That would print out the sequence S.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's length would be the length of S plus the 5 characters for the print

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
plus 1 for the space.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
But that doesn't prove that there isn't a shorter program that can produce S.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The trick in the second answer is this part.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This assumes that we can execute P to completion.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
In order to do that, we would need to solve the halting problem.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We would need to know that P will either never finish

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
or know how long to wait to keep running P.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So we can't actually do this step.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This might run forever; this loop may never finish.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So we would never learn the result. So that's why this doesn't work.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This is not enough to prove that it's impossible,

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
because maybe there's some other way to do it.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And I'm not going to go through

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
how we actually prove that the Kolmogorov Complexity is uncomputable,

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
but I'm going to show you a paradox that will give you a little bit of an idea

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
why that is.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The paradox is known as the Berry Paradox.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What the paradox asks is,

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
"What is the smallest natural number--"

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and by that I mean the set of numbers 1, 2, & 3--

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
sometimes we'll design it starting from 0--

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
the paradox would work just as well either way--

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
"that cannot be described in eleven words?"

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So this seems like a reasonable question.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We can define the set of numbers that cannot be described in eleven words.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It seems like a perfectly reasonable description of a set.

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's also a case that any set of natural numbers

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
has the smallest element.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The numbers are well-ordered, so whatever that set is,

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
there must be some smallest number.

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So that means there should be an answer to this question--

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
that there is a smallest number that cannot be described in eleven words.

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And I'm going to describe it for you.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Here's my description.

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And my description has 1-2-3-10-11 words.

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So I just described the smallest natural number

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
that cannot be described in eleven words,

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
but I've described it in eleven words.

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So that suggests that no such number exists,

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
but that contradicts the properties we had before.

52
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
That's why this is a paradox.

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This is certainly not a proof that the Kolmogorov Complexity is undecidable,

54
00:02:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
But it should give you some sense of how we might prove that.
