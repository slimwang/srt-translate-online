1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,840
I don't know, I guess, I might try to add another column or

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,870
I guess another field that would be the attendee I wanted to add.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,982
>> So, that might make sense, but, not

4
00:00:08,982 --> 00:00:12,610
really because we could have 10,000 attendees, right?

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,425
>> You're so kind.

6
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:13,680
[LAUGH]

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,720
Okay, right, okay. So, we don't want 10,000 new columns that makes

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,970
sense. So I guess just make an entirely new object called attendee?

9
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:20,660
>> Right.

10
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,670
>> Okay, cool.
