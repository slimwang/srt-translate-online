00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Here is my solution. I build a variable called "diff<u>crosstrack</u>error,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
which is in my differential, that is set to the momentary crosstrack error

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
minus the previous one which I the very first time initialize to the present one.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Then in the steering, I don't just steer proportionately to the crosstrack error,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
but also proportionately to the differential crosstrack error times the parameter 2.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
When I put this in and I run it, I will get exactly the output that I showed you.
