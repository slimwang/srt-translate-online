1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,060
So this code over here
gets the job done,

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,890
this HTML translates to
a nice looking readme

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,520
But we can do this in less code
if we do this in markdown.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,828
So let's start translating this so
that we get the same results.

5
00:00:11,828 --> 00:00:16,690
Right after that, we can see that
we've got an H1 and two H2s over here.

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:22,370
These can be translated pretty easily
using the hash syntax in markdown.

7
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,320
Remember that the number
of hashes indicates

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,840
which H tag you're going to be
using from H1 all the way to H6.

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,200
Next we can see that we've
got two paragraphs here.

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,540
In markdown, these P tags for
the paragraphs are not necessary so

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,440
we can go ahead and take those out.

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,190
Next we've got the strong
tag along with the em tag

13
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:44,850
which should look familiar
from the last exercise.

14
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,320
Strong makes our text bold,
em makes our texts italics.

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,860
So, we can go ahead and rewrite those
and we've got now the last two sections,

16
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,750
our list and our code blocks.

17
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,001
This is going to be where mark down
really going to come in handy And

18
00:00:58,001 --> 00:00:59,570
save us a lot of code.

19
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,790
We've got our unordered list here.

20
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,379
And you can see we have the UL tag and

21
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,680
then an LI tag for
each one of those list items.

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,130
In mark down, we just need a single
asterisk for each one of those list

23
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,430
items, and it's going to automatically
know that this is a list.

24
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,030
And you can see that our read
me still looks exactly the same.

25
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,410
Next we can take this anchor tag
here and shorten that a bit.

26
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,650
We're going to use the bracket syntax to
indict the text that we want in our link

27
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,580
and then parenthesis
to indicate our path.

28
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,280
Here at the bottom we see
the pre-code combination here

29
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,300
which will generate this code block.

30
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,620
This may not be code that
you're super familiar with.

31
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:42,070
But when you are writing code like
this it comes in handy very often.

32
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:46,010
But this can be rewritten easily
using the three back ticks.

33
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:50,600
So we'll use three back ticks to
indicate the start of our code block,

34
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,670
another three to indicate
the end of our code block.

35
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,330
So as you can see, this mark down
translates to the same read me

36
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,520
that the HTML we had written did.

37
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,920
But it does it in a way
that is much more readable.

38
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,100
Even if we didn't have this mark down
file being generated here on the right.

39
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,199
We could still look through this mark
down file and more or less understand

40
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,170
what's going on and it took us
considerably less code to get there.
