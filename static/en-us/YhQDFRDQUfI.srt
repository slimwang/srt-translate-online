1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,390
So for upward markets we want larger
beta, because that means we'll go up

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,550
even more than the market
if beta is greater than 1.

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,000
If we have a smaller,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,770
that means we're not getting the full
advantage of the market going up.

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,290
In downward markets
we want smaller beta.

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:21,080
So for instance if the market goes down
1% and our beta is much less than one,

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,140
that means our portfolio
will go down less than 1%.

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,270
So on a downward market,
the smaller the beta the better.
