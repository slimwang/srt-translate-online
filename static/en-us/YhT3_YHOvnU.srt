1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,802
So let's take a very simple example.

2
00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:04,346
So here I have two frames and

3
00:00:04,346 --> 00:00:10,778
I'm telling you that the rotation of A to B is just about the z-axis.

4
00:00:10,778 --> 00:00:13,414
So the image on the right, I'm looking down on the z-axis.

5
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:16,283
Now this should look very familiar to you when I ask you,

6
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:17,818
what is the rotation matrix?

7
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:18,386
Why?

8
00:00:18,386 --> 00:00:19,954
Because you did this in algebra, right?

9
00:00:19,954 --> 00:00:23,489
You talked about just rotation of an angle theta,

10
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:26,527
about the origin when you were doing x, y.

11
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:29,030
And hopefully, you remember something that looked like this.

12
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:33,401
See it says, cosine theta minus sine theta, sine theta, cosine theta.

13
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:34,325
Right?

14
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:37,461
George Thomas who wrote the Calculus textbook that many of us use,

15
00:00:37,461 --> 00:00:40,207
taught it to me as Charlies little sister, sock Charlie.

16
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,998
And that way you remember where the minus sign goes.

17
00:00:42,998 --> 00:00:47,960
anyway, so the point is that this matrix here is just for

18
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,086
rotating the x and y, keeping the z constant.

19
00:00:52,086 --> 00:00:56,901
So if I wanted to get an arbitrary orientation, basically what I

20
00:00:56,901 --> 00:01:01,729
could do is a series of rotations to get things where I want them.

21
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:04,965
Turns out there are many standards about how to do that.

22
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:09,722
One that most of, many of us know in math and computer vision are Euler angles.

23
00:01:09,722 --> 00:01:12,640
Euler angles say, you rotate about Z.

24
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,645
If, if this was Z, you would rotate, let's pretend Z is up, rotate about Z.

25
00:01:16,645 --> 00:01:21,849
Rotate about the new X, and then you rotate about the new again, Z.

26
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:22,988
All right?

27
00:01:22,988 --> 00:01:27,621
For those of you who fly airplanes, I think it's heading, pitch and roll?

28
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:29,290
Maybe it's boats, I don't know.

29
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,625
Heading, you orient yourself.

30
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,727
So, you know northwest.

31
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:37,598
You pitch, that's up and down this way, and then you roll.

32
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,635
That's rotation about this way.

33
00:01:39,635 --> 00:01:40,167
All right.

34
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:44,878
So you're about the world Z, the new X, the new Y.

35
00:01:44,878 --> 00:01:46,273
There's roll, pitch and yaw.

36
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,772
There's azimuth, elevation and I guess roll for

37
00:01:48,772 --> 00:01:52,413
those of you who are used to launching mortars, azimuth, el, anyway.

38
00:01:52,413 --> 00:01:56,585
Basically, there are these three basic matrices, rotation about the X, Y and Z.

39
00:01:56,585 --> 00:01:58,285
The order matters, okay?

40
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:02,857
We're not going to worry too much, in fact not at all about getting that order.

41
00:02:02,857 --> 00:02:07,240
But what it is, is here are the three rotation matrices written as

42
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,562
a function of the, their angles.

43
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:13,300
There's the rotation about x, rotation about z, rotation about y.

44
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,235
I put them in that order.

45
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:15,002
Why?

46
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:18,239
I have no idea they used to be a different order, but, but it doesn't matter.

47
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,078
The idea is that you can rotate about each of these different axes.

48
00:02:22,078 --> 00:02:26,580
Now, whether you pre-multiply or post-multiply, that's an issue.

49
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,216
So do we do the x1, then the y1 and the z1?

50
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:31,519
Or the z1, the y1 and the x1?

51
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,156
And that depends upon whether you're rotating in the new frame or the old frame.

52
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:38,526
Then, is theta positive or negative?

53
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:41,762
So you have to worry about these things really well when you do this.

54
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:46,100
And this is why we build spacecraft in simulation before we build them for real?

55
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,292
Because when it doesn't work in simulation, the engineer goes, says,

56
00:02:49,292 --> 00:02:50,838
I don't know, try negative 20.

57
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:54,070
Because knowing which way your angles go is, is, is a very difficult thing.
