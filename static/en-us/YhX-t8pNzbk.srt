1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,550
So let us try our hand at computing
some reliability and availability.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,450
Suppose that the system we
are considering is just a hard disk.

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:09,600
And this disk, we buy it.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,200
We put it in our machine and
now, it works fine for

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,910
12 months and then it breaks
because it cannot spin any more.

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,810
And then it takes us one month to
replace the motor in the disk.

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,070
And after that fix,
it works fine for about four months.

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,280
And then it breaks again and

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,910
we find that the problem is
that it can not move heads, and

10
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:35,580
it took us two months to figure that
out and then get the heads unstuck.

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,500
And now the disc works fine for
14 months.

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,780
And then it breaks.

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,100
And we find that the head has broken.

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,510
And we find this quickly but

15
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,340
then realize it will take
us 3 months to fix it.

16
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,720
So we throw this disk away and
buy a new one.

17
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,913
So the questions for you are,
what is the MTTF for this disk,

18
00:00:51,913 --> 00:00:57,720
what is the MTTR for this disk, and

19
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,770
what is the availability of this
disk expressed as a percentage?
