If you're looking for f inverse of f of x, then in the place of x in the

2
00:00:03,975 --> 00:00:10,511
function 10 to the x, we need to plug in log base 10 of x. That's going to give

3
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:15,650
us 10 to the power of log base 10 of x. We know that since these are inverses,

4
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:20,550
that will just equal x. Putting this in the exponent undoes what the log did to

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,519
x.
