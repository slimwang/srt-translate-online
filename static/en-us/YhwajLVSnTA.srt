00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I hope you've enjoyed our introduction to RSA and asymmetric cryptography.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's really a very powerful idea.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In this unit, we introduced the idea of using asymmetric cryptography

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
both for privacy and for signatures.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
There are lots more that we can do with asymmetric cryptography.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We'll talk about some of that in the next unit.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We talked about the RSA cryptosystem,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
which is probably still the most widely used public key cryptosystem.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
There are billions of transactions going on every day using RSA.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Nearly every time you use secure website, it's very likely that RSA is being used.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We'll talk about the protocol for that next unit.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We argue that RSA was correct, that it was invertible and had all the properties

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
that we needed to be able to encrypt and decrypt messages.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Its correctness depended on theorems that go back thousands of years

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
from Euclid--there are more recent ones, but still many hundreds of years old

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
from Euler and Fermat.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's putting those things together in the right way that lead to this solution

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
that enables most of modern ecommerce.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We also argued that RSA is probably secure--at least for the time being.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That depends on the hardness of factoring.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Then we talked about some issues in using RSA in practice,

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
the dangers of encrypting small messages

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
or messages from a small set of known messages,

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and solutions to that based on using random padding.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
There's one issue that we haven't covered yet.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That's how does Bob actually know Alice's public key.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If they can get together in a room, maybe she could give it to him.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
That's not usually possible, so this is a hard problem.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Until we have a solution for that, we're going to have to take away Bob's smiley face.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
He's still a little bit frowny.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Until we have a solution to this problem, we don't have a good way

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
to use asymmetric cryptography in practice,

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
because it relies on being able to get all these public keys.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That's one of the things we'll talk about next unit--

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
how to build a public key infrastructure so Bob can learn Alice's public key

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
as well as lots more interesting applications of asymmetric cryptography.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Hope to see you back for unit 5.
