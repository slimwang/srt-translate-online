1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,124
Now compute the sum of squares for the within group variabilities. That's the

2
00:00:05,124 --> 00:00:10,498
sum of the square deviations of each value from it's respective mean. Remember

3
00:00:10,498 --> 00:00:17,376
that's the square deviation of 2 from 3. 4 from 3, 3 from 3, 6 from 6, 5 from

4
00:00:17,376 --> 00:00:23,375
6, et cetera. And you sum all these squared deviations to get some kind of

5
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:26,960
measure for the variability of each sample.
