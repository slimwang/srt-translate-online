One problem with Q learning is that
it takes many experienced tuples to

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,540
converge.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,290
This is expensive in terms of
interacting with the world,

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,290
because you have to take a real step,

5
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:15,850
in other words execute a trade,
in order to gather information.

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:20,180
To address this problem,
Rich Sutton invented Dyna.

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,260
Dyna works by building models of T,
the transition matrix and

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,130
R the reward matrix.

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,470
Then after each real
interaction with the world,

10
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:34,330
we hallucinate many additional
interactions, usually a few hundred.

11
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,620
That are used then to
update the Q table.
