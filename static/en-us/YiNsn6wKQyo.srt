1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,850
So one vital question to ask at this
point is which circle of feedback

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,250
we should be targeting?

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,200
Since the current
prototype is pretty sparse,

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,860
it makes a lot of sense to
target the first circle,

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,490
just to be sure that we're going
in the right direction with this.

6
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,410
You need to make sure that
you're going to the right city

7
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,730
before you get directions to
a specific address there.
