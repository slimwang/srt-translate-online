Here's our square with a few slider controls. I can scale the polygon to be

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,810
larger in either dimension. The texture stretches to fit. What's more

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,550
interesting is what happens when I change the u or v values. Here I'm changing

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,403
the u value of the two points on the right edge. The value starts at one. If I

5
00:00:16,403 --> 00:00:19,667
increase the value, this has the effect of putting more copies of the texture

6
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:25,162
along that axis. Let's switch to the mosaic texture. If I decrease the value of

7
00:00:25,162 --> 00:00:30,980
v, less of a texture is mapped to the square. I can do the same thing with u.

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,432
This is how mosaicing works. Each triangle is given some fractional u and v

9
00:00:34,432 --> 00:00:38,864
values that select the piece of the texture needed. Give this demo a try and

10
00:00:38,864 --> 00:00:42,050
get a sense of how the values affect the rectangle and texture.
