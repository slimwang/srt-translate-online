1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,710
Now that you got a POJO,

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,460
you might be really eager to start
inserting items into your code.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,140
But hold on a second,
lets talk about performance.

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,120
I want you to consider a couple of
different database organizations, or

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,200
data structure organizations that we
could use for shopping list items.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,930
Here's one I'm going to
call Data Structure A.

7
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,340
We have our root, our active list,
and then here's the data for

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,670
each of our lists.

9
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:26,090
When we add items, we'll go ahead and
add them inside of each of these lists.

10
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,445
So, here are our lists of items
within our shopping lists.

11
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:35,060
So for example, this shopping list here
who's name is stored somewhere in here,

12
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:40,670
lets say Smores Supplies, has four
different items each with their name and

13
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,430
their owner, and this shopping list
has two items each with their name and

14
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,620
their owner and so on.

15
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,280
This basically has all
the information for

16
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,390
a shopping list bundled together in
nice little shopping list objects.

17
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:56,360
This organization matches what we're
used to when we think of Java objects.

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,520
You'd probably have an array list
of items within your Java shopping

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,180
list object.

20
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,530
Okay, let me show you something a little
bit different, here's Data Structure B.

21
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,760
It starts out pretty similar,
and then instead of storing items

22
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,040
as part of the shopping list,
we make an entirely new node.

23
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,950
Maybe call it something like
shopping list items, and

24
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,260
then store the items for
the shopping lists here, separately.

25
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,712
So, my question to you is,
which data structure is preferable.

26
00:01:22,712 --> 00:01:25,820
All right, here are two data
structures side by side.

27
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,590
To analyze which of these data
structures is better, I want you to

28
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,760
take a look at the two main screens
that we have in our app right now.

29
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,390
This right here is
the ShoppingLists fragment screen.

30
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:38,517
And as you can see,
it has all of our shopping lists, and

31
00:01:38,517 --> 00:01:39,210
then we have the active
list details screen, and

32
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,090
then we have the active
list details activity.

33
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:45,080
And this is of course, the activity
that will contain all the items on it,

34
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,220
as well as information
about specific lists.

35
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,390
Now, before you answer this question,
I want you to consider this fact.

36
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,995
Each time you grab a data snapshot,

37
00:01:51,995 --> 00:01:54,575
it takes a picture of a specific
portion of the database.

38
00:01:54,575 --> 00:01:56,797
If you take a picture
of active lists here,

39
00:01:56,797 --> 00:02:00,215
it contains all of these active
lists and all the children nodes.

40
00:02:00,215 --> 00:02:04,597
If you take a snapshot of push ID K6215,
it will also contain all of its

41
00:02:04,597 --> 00:02:08,310
children, but none of these
other nodes or parent nodes.

42
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,240
When shopping list ++ hopefully
becomes very popular,

43
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,290
we're going to have a lot of shopping
list items and a lot of users, and

44
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,410
we want to minimize the data sent
between the server and the app.

45
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,270
So if you had to choose one of these
two data structures solely for

46
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,070
getting all the information
that you need for

47
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,630
the shopping list fragment screen,
would you choose A or B?

48
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,790
In the same way, if you had to pick
one of these two data structures for

49
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,680
active list details activity,
which one would you pick A or B?
