00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:01,980
As we saw in the previous code

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,130
example, properties can have different types. These are

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,860
called property types. For the recipe kind, some

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,495
of the property names and types were name,

5
00:00:11,495 --> 00:00:15,841
which was a string. Vegetarian, a boolean indicator.

6
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:19,490
And the number of servings, an integer. But

7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,135
these are just a few property types. In

8
00:00:22,135 --> 00:00:25,530
fact, Datastore supports a lot more property types.

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,113
And we mean, a lot. The

10
00:00:28,113 --> 00:00:31,403
official documentation on developers.google.com lists around

11
00:00:31,403 --> 00:00:34,870
20 of them. In this class, we're only going to use a small

12
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,440
subset of these. And the ones you can see listed here are some

13
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,245
of the most common properties. Integers.

14
00:00:41,245 --> 00:00:46,080
Floating-point numbers. Strings. Dates and binary data.
