1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:02,930
You're still here.

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:04,260
All right, cool.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,330
Well, if you're wondering
what to do next,

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,180
there's a few things I'd
recommend checking out.

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,280
All the links are in
the instructor notes below.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,910
If you haven't already, check out
the offline web application course.

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,900
It's not just about offline, but

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,550
dives deeper into service workers,
the mechanics of caching and index db.

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,100
Even though we use promises in this
course, we didn't cover them at all.

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,130
So if you've never seen them before, or
if you're still trying to wrap your head

11
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,380
around them, check out
the JavaScript Promises course.

12
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,980
We're working on a course for
push notifications right now.

13
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,310
But in the meantime,
we've got a code lab that you can use

14
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,700
to add push notifications
to your weather app.

15
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,870
There's also the web tooling and

16
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,700
animation course which will
help you level up your skills.

17
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,930
I learned a few good things
by taking that course.

18
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,700
I'm sure I'm missing something.

19
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,583
So take a look at the instructor
notes for any updates or

20
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:08,798
anything new and in a word of
one of my heroes, it's over.

21
00:01:08,798 --> 00:01:11,799
Go home, go.

22
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:16,757

23
00:01:16,757 --> 00:01:18,590
Why are you still here?

24
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,740
Thanks for sticking with me.

25
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,300
Kind of quiet and lonely in here.

26
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,740
They wouldn't let me have
the little clapper thing.

27
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,560
I wanted that, it was fun.

28
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,534
There was a picture on the back
that was always fun to look at.

29
00:01:32,534 --> 00:01:35,198

30
00:01:35,198 --> 00:01:35,971
&gt;&gt; All right.

31
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:39,680
[LAUGH] I think we can cut now.
