00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,620
So just to quickly summarize, I showed
you a variety of different videos

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,040
of a rather practical way of
actually combining cameras and

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,730
projectors together.

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,730
So basically, we are talking about
how we can actually take controlled

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,870
light sources and
couple them with a camera,

6
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:18,680
where the camera basically knows what
light is actually being displayed, and

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,350
actually can control it to figure out
what light actually should be displayed

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,240
in a different types of contexts and
scenes.

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,980
Basically, what we described was
projector camera system, or procams.

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,649
This is a growing discipline that's
actually been now actually getting a lot

11
00:00:32,649 --> 00:00:33,390
of attention.

12
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,925
You saw examples of something
as practical as, you know,

13
00:00:36,925 --> 00:00:41,890
controllable headlights for
cars to augmented reality experiences.

14
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,230
Again, the intention here was to
introduce to you this concept and

15
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,540
show you a variety of examples.

16
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,730
For further details basically look at
these papers that I'm listing here that

17
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:56,390
go through all aspects of how Light
Stage works to being able to then use

18
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,720
different types of ways of calibrating
cameras and projector systems.

19
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,290
And then also, going towards how we can
actually try out the kinds of systems

20
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,950
that we saw in some of the later videos.

21
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,490
I showed you a whole lot of videos,

22
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,300
and actually you can see all of them
on your own, in their full detail,

23
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,740
from these sites that actually will also
be presented to you with the lectures.
