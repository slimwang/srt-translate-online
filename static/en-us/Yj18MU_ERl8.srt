00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,290
Dan mentioned the idea of using
widgets to bring our Sunshine data

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,100
directly to the user's home screen.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,670
What exactly is a widget?

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:11,940
So far, we've only focused on
activities, full screen experiences, and

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,610
fragments, which are reusable
portions of those activities.

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,500
Widgets differ in that area
provides just the view.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,230
That view is then passed
to the home screen app,

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:26,440
the launcher to display alongside other
widgets and other app launcher icons.

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,115
App widgets had a humble beginning.

10
00:00:28,115 --> 00:00:32,280
Fixed-size widgets that could
respond to one action, tapping.

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,840
It was great for control widgets or

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,460
widgets with just a single piece
of information to display.

13
00:00:37,498 --> 00:00:41,500
In Android 3, widgets got support for
collections of data and

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,910
vertical swiping.

15
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,380
Now, you can display a stack, list,
or grid of data right in your widget,

16
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,335
making it easy to jump into exactly
the piece of information you need.

17
00:00:51,335 --> 00:00:55,425
Android 3.1 opened up the possibility
of resizing your widget either

18
00:00:55,425 --> 00:00:57,985
horizontally, vertically, or both.

19
00:00:57,985 --> 00:01:01,285
This gave users the ability to customize
exactly how much space they want

20
00:01:01,285 --> 00:01:04,675
to give to your widget, and
gave developers the tools needed to

21
00:01:04,675 --> 00:01:09,175
customize how they display their data
depending on the size of the widget.

22
00:01:09,175 --> 00:01:12,425
So, can we use these capabilities for
Sunshine?

23
00:01:12,425 --> 00:01:14,800
Let's focus on two common cases.

24
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,380
Today's weather, where we'll build
a horizontally resizable widget,

25
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,170
showing information just about today.

26
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,030
And the weather forecast,
where we'll build a detail widget,

27
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,390
which will display the same data we
see in the main screen of Sunshine,

28
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,300
to give users quick access to their
forecast, right from the home screen.

29
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,170
So let's get started.
