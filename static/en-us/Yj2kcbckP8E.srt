00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,180
Good job. Now you know the names of the cells, but

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,230
usually instead of words in the cells we'll have numbers or data.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,650
If this is the case, you'll have to copy and paste

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,560
the data from the shared Google spread sheet, into your own spreed

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,970
sheet in order to analyze it. Lets get familiar with this.

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,260
To create your own spreed sheet go to your Google Drive. All

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,600
of this is also explained in the Instructor Note section. If

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,270
you're signed in to your Google email account, you should see a

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:30,430
bar at the top that looks like this. You can click Drive, or you can just go

10
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:34,670
to drive.google.com. Make sure you're signed in. From your

11
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,320
Drive, I suggest your first step should be to

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,030
create a new folder for this class. To do

13
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,120
that, click this icon here. Name this whatever you

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,380
want. Maybe just Statistics. After you name it, you

15
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,260
should see a Statistics folder appear in your drive.

16
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,590
You can use this folder to store all the

17
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,620
datasets you work with throughout this class. Click on

18
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,860
it. Once you're in your Statistics folder, you can

19
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,270
create a new spreadsheet by clicking this button and selecting

20
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,840
Spreadsheet. You should then have a new spreadsheet that

21
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,700
looks like this. Then you can copy and paste

22
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,240
the data that I provide, like this flight cost

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,320
data. You just click Cmd+c, or Ctrl+c if you're on

24
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,414
a PC. And then you go to your

25
00:01:17,414 --> 00:01:21,710
spreadsheet and click Cmd+v or Ctrl+v. Now you're able

26
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:25,150
to analyze the data. I recommend either creating a

27
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,940
new spreadsheet for each new dataset. Or, create a

28
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,140
new sheet within this same sheet by clicking this

29
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,420
plus sign at the bottom. Then you'll have a

30
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,850
new sheet within the same spreadsheet, in which you

31
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,370
can input a different dataset. Then you could call

32
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:45,600
this spreadsheet something like Statistics Datasets. And rename each

33
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,912
sheet to what it is, and what lesson. For example, this is

34
00:01:50,912 --> 00:01:56,130
fFight Cost data from lesson 15. Alternatively, within

35
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,350
your Statistics folder, you can just continue

36
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,390
creating new spreadsheets. And then naming the entire

37
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,950
spreadsheet the name of that dataset that

38
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,570
I originally provide you. Its up to you.
