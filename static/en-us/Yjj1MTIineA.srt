00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,750
Now let's take Andy's spaghetti code and identify what parts of it belong where.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,029
Because as it turns out, you can do this.

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,990
If you separate functionality into these three buckets, model, view, and

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,735
octopus, you can take spaghetti code and

5
00:00:14,735 --> 00:00:17,270
refactor it to be organized and extensible.

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:22,060
You can find the repository with Andy's actual code in the instructor notes.

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,950
Now, the first thing I do before refactoring is I run the app itself.

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,010
I play around with it and figure out what the functionality is, and

9
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,100
that will help me understand the code later on.

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,100
It looks like you can click any of these buttons here and

11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,450
you'll get a different cat.

12
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,351
You can also click the image of any of the cats to increment the number for

13
00:00:39,351 --> 00:00:40,280
the cat.

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,060
Now, go ahead and hop into Andy's actual code and

15
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,580
see if you can figure out how Andy is displaying the different cats.
