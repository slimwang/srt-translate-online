00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,410
Step five in the object or in analysis process has to do with relationships.

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,090
The main elements in the class model diagram are going to correspond classes and

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:16,100
relationships. And we're going to depict the classes ash compartmentized,

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,880
rectangles and relationships are going to be indicated by

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,640
lines connecting the rectangles. And there are going to be three different

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,250
kinds of relationships that we'll look at. One kind is generalization, and

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,620
that's indicated by a line at, and at one end of the line will be a little

8
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:41,070
open triangle. The second kind is called aggregation.

9
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,680
This is going to be used for situations like what we mentioned parts of, and

10
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,050
in this case, the line ends with an open diamond, and then if we don't

11
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:55,760
have any adornment on the line at all, that's going to be a general association.

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,870
So let's look at each of those three categories of relationships and

13
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:03,930
see if we can find examples of them in our, our example problem.
