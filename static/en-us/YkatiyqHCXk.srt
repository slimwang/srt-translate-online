1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:01,867
So, that’s all I’d like to say about Path Links for

2
00:00:01,867 --> 00:00:04,645
now. Next I want to focus for a little while on the

3
00:00:04,645 --> 00:00:08,010
notion of a clustering coefficient. Now, you might

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,816
be less familiar with this notion of clustering

5
00:00:09,816 --> 00:00:13,021
coefficient than you are with paths and graphs, so

6
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:16,688
let’s go through how this is often defined.

7
00:00:16,688 --> 00:00:19,464
What the clustering coefficient is trying to capture is,

8
00:00:19,464 --> 00:00:22,560
as I said before, cliquishness. How likely is it that

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,045
two nodes that are connected are part of some kind

10
00:00:27,045 --> 00:00:31,022
of larger highly connected group of nodes? So one

11
00:00:31,022 --> 00:00:34,155
typical way of defining the clustering coefficient is to

12
00:00:34,155 --> 00:00:36,593
start-off by taking about the clustering coefficient for

13
00:00:36,593 --> 00:00:39,116
a particular node in a graph, I’m going to generalize

14
00:00:39,116 --> 00:00:41,412
this to clustering coefficients for the entire graph

15
00:00:41,412 --> 00:00:44,336
next, but let’s focus on a single node. So say, V is

16
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:50,043
that node and Kv is its degree and Nv of V is the

17
00:00:50,043 --> 00:00:53,171
number of links between the neighbors of V. So, let’s

18
00:00:53,171 --> 00:00:55,419
look at this example graph to ground out some of

19
00:00:55,419 --> 00:00:58,997
these concepts. So here we’ve got graph, let’s call

20
00:00:58,997 --> 00:01:01,807
this node V. Could point to any of them but I’m going

21
00:01:01,807 --> 00:01:04,029
to go with this one. Let’s take a look at the neighbors

22
00:01:04,029 --> 00:01:06,390
of V. Those are the nodes that are directly

23
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,506
connected to V in the graph. We’ve got this one, and

24
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:15,790
this one, and this one, and this one. So the number

25
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:20,421
of those neighbors is exactly the degree of V, which

26
00:01:20,421 --> 00:01:23,528
in this case is 4. And now let’s look at the links

27
00:01:23,528 --> 00:01:28,485
between these neighbors of V. So, there is this one

28
00:01:28,485 --> 00:01:33,458
that goes between the two pink nodes and that

29
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:36,263
seems to be it. This node isn’t connected to any

30
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,616
other pink node. This one is not connected to any

31
00:01:38,616 --> 00:01:40,401
other pink node. This is not connected to any pink

32
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:45,847
node and so on. So in this case, Nv is 1. And we are

33
00:01:45,847 --> 00:01:47,843
going to combine these quantities together as

34
00:01:47,843 --> 00:01:52,243
follows. We take twice the number of neighbor links

35
00:01:52,243 --> 00:01:55,626
divided by the degree of V times one minus the

36
00:01:55,626 --> 00:01:59,304
degree of V. Now, this may look a little odd but let’s

37
00:01:59,304 --> 00:02:02,907
compute what it is and then I’ll explain it. So in this

38
00:02:02,907 --> 00:02:09,235
case, two times Nv just one, divided by K times K

39
00:02:09,235 --> 00:02:12,651
minus one. So it’s four times three. And the result we

40
00:02:12,651 --> 00:02:15,944
get in this case for this particular V is 1/6. So what

41
00:02:15,944 --> 00:02:18,663
this represents is actually the fraction of possible

42
00:02:18,663 --> 00:02:22,855
interconnections between the neighbors of V. So,

43
00:02:22,855 --> 00:02:25,478
because it’s a fraction, we’re expecting it to be

44
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,704
something between zero and one. And in fact we

45
00:02:27,704 --> 00:02:30,714
can get zero if we’ve got something that’s like a star.

46
00:02:30,714 --> 00:02:33,896
So V has edges going out but none of those connect

47
00:02:33,896 --> 00:02:37,396
to each other. And it can actually be all the way to

48
00:02:37,396 --> 00:02:42,330
one if we have a cleek. So V is connected to its

49
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,618
neighbors and all the neighbors are connected to

50
00:02:44,618 --> 00:02:47,776
each other. So that’s why this formula has the form

51
00:02:47,776 --> 00:02:51,535
that it does, Kv times Kv minus one all divided by

52
00:02:51,535 --> 00:02:55,682
two is the maximum number of connections among a

53
00:02:55,682 --> 00:02:59,323
set of nodes of size Kv. So, we take the reciprocal of

54
00:02:59,323 --> 00:03:02,282
that multiplied by Nv that gives us the fraction that

55
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:08,897
we’re looking for. So, in this case V is a sixth, it’s you

56
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:12,653
know a six of the way from being a star to being a

57
00:03:12,653 --> 00:03:15,381
cleek. So it’s not that tightly connected and in fact

58
00:03:15,381 --> 00:03:18,686
you know that sort of what we saw as well that V is

59
00:03:18,686 --> 00:03:19,967
connected to a bunch of neighbors but they are not

60
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:22,982
really connected to each other all that much. I am

61
00:03:22,982 --> 00:03:25,964
going to say that the clustering coefficient for graph

62
00:03:25,964 --> 00:03:28,228
is just the average of the clustering coefficients of

63
00:03:28,228 --> 00:03:31,249
the nodes in the graph. So if we wanted to compute

64
00:03:31,249 --> 00:03:33,395
the clustering coefficient of this graph, we’d actually

65
00:03:33,395 --> 00:03:35,697
have to go through node, to node, to node, to node,

66
00:03:35,697 --> 00:03:37,651
to node, to node, to node, compute the clustering

67
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:41,000
coefficient for each one and then average.
