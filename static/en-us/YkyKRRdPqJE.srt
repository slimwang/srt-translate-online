00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,132
This is a difference of two cubes, and the first term, the positive term, is in

2
00:00:05,132 --> 00:00:10,467
the slot where y cubed initially was. So that means that x is used here in place

3
00:00:10,467 --> 00:00:15,456
of y. Instead of z cubed, we have 8. So that means that 8 is equal to z cubed.

4
00:00:15,456 --> 00:00:20,382
If we take the cube root of both sides of this equation, we get 2 on the left

5
00:00:20,382 --> 00:00:23,550
side and z on the right side. So z must equal 2.
