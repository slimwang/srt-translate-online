With all this complexity, you might ask, why

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,200
don't I just set the viewport width to 760

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,160
pixels? The width of that column of text I showed you in the dev tools, and call

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,100
it a day. Is it because that would be too easy? Or because, then my site would

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,260
scale the same layout across all devices? Or

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,160
because the fonts would be wrong in some way?
