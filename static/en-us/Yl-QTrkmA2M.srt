00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,770
In the debugging demo, Ki, noted that the word hello, got truncated to hell.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,235
The place where text is set is in the constructor, so something must be wrong

3
00:00:08,235 --> 00:00:12,810
in this constructor. Let me set a break point to check it out. I just clicked

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,700
next to the line I want to stop on. Now, if I run the syllable counter, give it

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:22,034
hello yellow peach and hit Enter. It pops up my debugger, and my code shows the

6
00:00:22,034 --> 00:00:27,030
line that the debugger is stopped on. So far, not a whole lot has happened.

7
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:32,229
We've just converted S to lower case and put it in text. I want to skip these

8
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:35,732
loops and get to the juicy part and figure out what they computed. So, I'll

9
00:00:35,732 --> 00:00:40,357
just single step until I get to the last line. Try that out. What will the

10
00:00:40,357 --> 00:00:45,620
local variables, i and j be equal to if you step all the way to this last line?

11
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,148
You'll really need to do this in BlueJ because the Udacity IDE doesn't have a

12
00:00:49,148 --> 00:00:54,161
debugger. So, if you run syllable counter and enter hello yellow peach and then

13
00:00:54,161 --> 00:01:01,234
step to the last line of the constructor, what is the value of I? How about j?
