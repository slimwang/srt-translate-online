00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,280
Let's take a look at the conference API class.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,300
This class defines the API that are exposed through endpoints.

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:11,030
See this API annotation right here? This is what indicates

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,780
it. This class contains functions to be exposed through endpoints.

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,670
There are rules around how you can name the

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,600
API and one of the rules is that the API

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,550
name must start with a lowercase letter. So far this

8
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,340
class contains a few methods. The one that we're going to

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,740
be looking at in this lesson is save profile.

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,010
Let's take a look at it. Here's the Save

11
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,210
Profile Method. You can see up here that we've

12
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:38,190
defined the @Api Method which indicates that this method

13
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,820
is going to be exposed through end points. So

14
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,270
let's look in to the saved profile method. You

15
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,290
see it defines a bunch of fields user ID,

16
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:50,520
main email, display name, t-shirt size. For the display

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,670
name and the t-shirt size we've set some default values.

18
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,330
And when you're working with your code you can change

19
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,150
these default values as you like. You'll see that the

20
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:04,420
code contains a bunch of to do's. You're going to be filling

21
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,190
in these to do's, and the numbers indicate the order

22
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,360
in which to do them. So obviously, you do to do

23
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,520
one before you do to do two. So the other

24
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,540
thing that this method does is it creates a new profile

25
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,820
object, passing in the user ID, the

26
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,870
display name, main email, the t-shirt size. And

27
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:26,330
then it returns a profile. So at this point, it doesn't really do a whole lot

28
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:30,980
except create and return a Profile object. So let's take a quick look at the

29
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,800
Profile class. Here's the Profile class in an

30
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,510
editor. And not surprisingly, it takes displayName, mainEmail,

31
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,620
teeShirtSize. These are the fields that get passed

32
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,670
in to it. When it's constructed and the

33
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,480
constructor just takes the values that are passed

34
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,620
in and puts them into appropriate fields. The class

35
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,800
also contains getter methods for these fields, it

36
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,340
doesn't contain setter methods, because we only want the

37
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,770
values to be set at construction time. So

38
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,850
now let's run the app and see what happens.

39
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,360
So, we're going to deploy to local host. Okay

40
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,330
and while the deployment is going on, you'll see a

41
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,890
bunch of messages. And at the end you should see

42
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:19,380
this INFO: Dev App Server is now running. So, now

43
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,500
let's go to the browser and see what we can

44
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,250
see. So we want to look at the app in

45
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,020
the APIs explorer. So you go to the local host

46
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,880
colon, what ever your port number is, in my case

47
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:39,740
is 8080 and then is _ah/api/explorer. And then,

48
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,030
you see the API explorer, and you see the

49
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,040
conference API, so we can drill down into

50
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,640
it, couple methods. We haven't done anything with the

51
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,510
other method. We'll just look at save profile.

52
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,800
Let's see what happens if we execute save profile

53
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,320
function. Just go ahead and execute it. And

54
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,300
we didn't provide any input parameters so we just

55
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:03,170
go the default response. So, which is a profile object containing the display

56
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:07,870
name, that the default that we set and the t-shirt size. Doesn't know what

57
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,200
the t-shirt size is yet because you haven't told it. So go ahead

58
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,360
and post a video if you like and try this out for yourself now.
