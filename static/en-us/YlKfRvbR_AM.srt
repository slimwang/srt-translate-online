00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,480
There will be due dates to help you stay on track. The summer course is on a

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,814
condensed schedule. We will be covering 15 weeks of content in ten weeks, so

3
00:00:07,814 --> 00:00:12,472
keeping up is vital. There is a draft version and a final version of each

4
00:00:12,472 --> 00:00:16,470
problem set. There are three main exercises due on Wednesday, and a draft

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,884
version due on the Sunday before. The draft will help you start thinking about

6
00:00:20,884 --> 00:00:25,535
the problems, so you can ask questions early. There will also be about 20 short

7
00:00:25,535 --> 00:00:31,030
problems due with the final version of the problem set. Problem sets are always

8
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:36,838
due at 11:55 p.m. U.S. Pacific time. You can work ahead. We especially

9
00:00:36,838 --> 00:00:41,760
recommend this if you have travel plans. We cannot accept late problem sets.

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,408
It's important that we post the solutions shortly after the due date and it is

11
00:00:45,408 --> 00:00:49,439
not fair to accept work after the solutions are put up.
