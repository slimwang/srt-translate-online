00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,242
Of course, there are situations or life events that can bring on a depressive

2
00:00:03,242 --> 00:00:07,623
episode. But for some people, depression just seems to come on without an

3
00:00:07,623 --> 00:00:12,110
external event. So, here we can see the interplay between our Neurochemistry

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:16,936
and our life circumstances. For example, people who are deficient in the

5
00:00:16,936 --> 00:00:20,880
neurotransmitters seratonin and neuropeptide Y, are more likely to experience

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,050
depression following an extremely stressful event. Therefore, we can have two

7
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,830
people face the same stressful event and only the person who's deficient in

8
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:37,197
serotonin and neuropeptide y will actually result in depression. So, here we

9
00:00:37,197 --> 00:00:40,725
see the environment or nurture which is the stressful event and the

10
00:00:40,725 --> 00:00:44,694
neurochemistry or nature, the lack of serotonin and neuropeptide Y and the

11
00:00:44,694 --> 00:00:47,760
resulting depression.
