1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
As the previous example suggests, we can use parentheses to control ambiguity.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Here I've taken our expression grammar from before and updated it with a new rewrite rule.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now expression can be replaced by open parentheses, expression, close parentheses.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This should totally remind us up the P goes to open P close rule from before for balanced parentheses.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's going to behave mostly the same way.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
With this new grammar, both of these utterances--

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
open 1 minus 2 plus 3 and 1 minus open 2 plus 3 close--

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
both of them are in the language of this grammar.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
However, while both of these are okay, so is this one.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It doesn't forbid the ambiguous one.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It just allows us to have more precise renditions.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We've solved some of the problem.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
If we're thinking ahead, we can use parentheses, but we're still allowing ambiguous phrasing.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Here I've drawn our favorite utterance from before--1 minus 2 plus 3--

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and I've written out two different parse trees for it.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This one corresponds to 1 minus 2 plus 3.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
At the top level we're subtracting, and then the 2 plus 3 are grouped together.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This one corresponds to 1 minus 2 plus 3.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
At the top level we're adding, and the 1 minus 2 is grouped together.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Formally, we say that a grammar is ambiguous if there is at least one string in it--

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
1 minus 2 plus 3 and that single string has more than one parse tree.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Here I've drawn very stylized versions of the parse trees.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
If you can find even one string for which this is true,

24
00:01:51,000 --> 99:59:59,999
officially the whole grammar is ambiguous.
