00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,390
In this lesson we're
going to look at optimizers.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:09,160
Optimizers sound scary, but
they're really cool and really fun.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,500
I'm going to show you all kinds of neat
things you can do with optimizers.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,950
What is an optimizer?

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:19,610
An optimizer is an algorithm that
can do the following things.

6
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:24,340
Optimizers can be used to find
minimum values for functions.

7
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:31,932
So say you have a function
like f(x)=x2+x3+5 or

8
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:38,450
something like that,
an optimizer can find.

9
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:42,530
For what value of x is this
overall function minimized?

10
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:47,410
Another thing that optimizers can
do is find the parameters for

11
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,700
parameterized models from data.

12
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,900
So we might have some data
from some experiment, and

13
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:02,060
we can use optimizers to find
a polynomial fit to that data.

14
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,400
And that is actually one thing we
are going to learn in this lesson.

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,660
Finally, we can use an optimizer

16
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,540
to refine allocations to
stocks in portfolios.

17
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,570
What does that mean?

18
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:18,530
Well, that means for instance,
you can decide what percentage of

19
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:23,320
funds should be allocated to
each stock using an optimizer.

20
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,060
How do we use an optimizer?

21
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,950
It's really just as simple
as three key steps.

22
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:33,410
First thing you need to do is define
a function that you want to minimize.

23
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:37,780
As an example you might
use something like f of x

24
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,510
is equal to x square plus point five.

25
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:46,930
You define that in Python and then the
minimizer will call this function many,

26
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:51,310
many times as it tries to
find the minimum values for

27
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:55,120
x that causes this function
overall to be smallest.

28
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,580
You also need to start
with an initial guess for

29
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:03,670
x that you think might be close
to the solution to the problem.

30
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:07,560
If you don't really know,
then you can choose a random value or

31
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,400
just some standard value.

32
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,750
But then the optimizer starts
with that guess and it repeatedly

33
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,650
calls a function, tests different
values, and narrows in on the solution.

34
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,084
Finally, you call the optimizer
with these parameters and

35
00:02:26,084 --> 00:02:29,496
stand back while it searches for
the minimum.
