Often when you're writing code for a class like the person class, you want to

2
00:00:03,668 --> 00:00:07,993
give each person a unique ID. That might look something like this, you would

3
00:00:07,993 --> 00:00:12,769
have a private int ID, and each person object would have one. Now, there are a

4
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:17,532
few ways to generate a different ID for each person. One would be to create a

5
00:00:17,532 --> 00:00:22,419
static variable. LastAssignedId and use the lastAssignedId to set each person's

6
00:00:22,419 --> 00:00:26,262
ID when they are created, we would also want to increment the lastAssignedId

7
00:00:26,262 --> 00:00:31,827
every time we used it. Try this out yourself. How would you give each person a

8
00:00:31,827 --> 00:00:35,607
unique ID starting from 1 and going up one at a time, so the first person would

9
00:00:35,607 --> 00:00:40,430
have ID 1, the second person would have ID 2 and so on.
