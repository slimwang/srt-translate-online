00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,260
The Android Sandbox and the iOS Sandbox
have different implementations.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,620
But from a security point of view,

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,780
one of the main differences is
how they handle permissions.

4
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:16,490
For Android, an app can announce
the permissions they requires and

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:20,910
the users can approve these
permissions and install time.

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,220
The apps can ask for
very powerful permissions.

7
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:28,520
For iOS, all the apps have
the same set of basic permissions.

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,509
If an app needs to access
system resources or data,

9
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:38,970
such as the users address book, user
approval is required at the first time.

10
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,620
In general,
iOS apps have only limited permissions.
