1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,260
>> All right, the next concept that we're going to

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,530
need to understand the folk theorem is the notion

3
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,810
of a minmax profile. So a minmax profile is

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,390
going to be a pair of payoffs, one for each

5
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,880
player. And the value for player represents the payoffs

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,040
that that player can achieve by defending itself from

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,630
a malicious adversary. So what do you suppose a

8
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,940
malicious adversary would mean in a game theory context?

9
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,400
>> Someone who's desperately trying to hurt you.

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,770
>> And what does hurt mean?

11
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:25,340
>> Gives

12
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,120
you the lowest score.

13
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,330
>> Yeah, and what does that remind you of from your lesson?

14
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,190
>> My grad students.

15
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,530
>> You think they're malicious?

16
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,070
>> It would explain a few things.

17
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,660
>> Yeah, I don't think they're malicious.

18
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,390
>> They're sweet.

19
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,760
>> [LAUGH]

20
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,770
Yeah, I know a lot of them and they're, they're wonderful people.

21
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,580
>> Well, what it reminds me of is, they

22
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,240
are wonderful people. It reminds me of zero-sum games.

23
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,380
>> Exactly. So you can imagine thinking about the game

24
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,410
that we're playing, now, no longer as being I get my payoff and

25
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,360
you get yours, but I get my payoff and you get the negative of

26
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,030
my payoff. So you don't, you don't really care about yourself anymore. All you

27
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,550
care about is hurting me. And that's, that's the idea of a malicious adversary.

28
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,160
>> I have some ex-girlfriends like that.

29
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,290
>> I'm so. Oh. [LAUGH].

30
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,960
It is. People do get into this mode sometimes. And that,

31
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,780
that's actually going to be important in understanding the folk there.

32
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,750
>> Hmm.

33
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,910
>> So what

34
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,840
I'd like to do is figure out what the min-max profile is for this game. So this

35
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,680
is a very famous Game theory, game example.

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,680
Sometimes goes by the name battle of the sexes.

37
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,970
>> That what the b and the s stand for?

38
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,410
>> Sometimes it stands for Bach and Stravinsky.

39
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,430
>> Blech.

40
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,160
>> Those are like composers, I think.

41
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,650
>> You mean like the Backstreet Boys and Sting.

42
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,820
>> Ahh. Alright, that works for me. So,

43
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,860
so, let me explain this story. It turns out that

44
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:49,140
Smooth and Curly actually got away, they didn't make any kind

45
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,800
of deal, they actually just figured out a way of

46
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,840
escaping from the jail. So they're, they're back out on the

47
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,500
streets again, and they decided that they'd like to celebrate

48
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,140
their freedom by going out to see a concert. And they

49
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,235
both decided that in advance, but what they didn't know was

50
00:02:03,235 --> 00:02:05,718
which concerts were available. Once they escaped out into the world,

51
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:07,580
they couldn't communicate with each other, they

52
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,270
discovered that there's in fact two concerts

53
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,520
in the city that night. The Backstreet Boys are playing, and Sting is playing.

54
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,460
>> Okay.

55
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,500
>> Now as it turns out, each of them is now going

56
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,380
to have to choose, whether to go to the concert with Backstreet

57
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:24,140
Boys or Sting, and they're choosing independently. Now, if they end up

58
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,740
going to different concert's they're both going to be unhappy and get zero's.

59
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,340
>> I see.

60
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,470
>> If they end up at the same concert, then they're going to be happier,

61
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,800
but in fact, as it turns out, Smooth really likes

62
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,870
the Backstreet Boys and would prefer that they both end up

63
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,500
at the Backstreet Boy concert. But Curly really likes Sting

64
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,150
and would prefer that they end up at the Sting Concert.

65
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,320
>> That's not realistic.

66
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,730
>> Which part?

67
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,110
>> The fact that I prefer the Backstreet Boys to Sting.

68
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,220
>> What, what do you mean you? I mean this is Smooth. He's a criminal.

69
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,340
>> Mm, that's a fine point that you

70
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,460
make there. There is no connection between these

71
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,000
characters and ourselves.

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,730
>> Real life characters, living, dead

73
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,570
or fictional, or mathematical, or instructional.

74
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,390
>> If so, otherwise purely coincidental.

75
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,370
>> Yeah. I could switch these around if you'd prefer.

76
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,428
>> No, no. I'll go with your fantasy.

77
00:03:09,428 --> 00:03:14,510
>> [LAUGH] All right. I, yeah, I think that payoff matrix may look

78
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:18,620
something like we both have twos in, in the s, the same place.

79
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:18,680
>> Mhm.

80
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,520
>> But anyway, but let's say for the purposes of this example,

81
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,190
there's a little bit of a disagreement. Okay, so now what we

82
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,610
need to figure out is what the minmax profile is for this game.

83
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:27,890
>> Okay.

84
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,080
>> Alright, so that's going to be a pair of numbers.

85
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,130
>> Mm-hm.

86
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:34,270
>> One number corresponds to the payoff for Curly and one number

87
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,740
corresponds to the payoff for Smooth. And it should be, the payoff

88
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:42,510
for Curly should be the payoff that Curly can guarantee himself even

89
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,480
if Smooth is trying to get him to have a low score.

90
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:46,790
>> Okay.

91
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,390
>> And vice versa. Smooth's score is going to be the score that it

92
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,760
can guarantee, he can guarantee himself even

93
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,590
if Curly is trying to minimize Smooth's score.

94
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,380
>> All right.

95
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,050
>> So let's do this as a quiz. So,I want you

96
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,290
to find the min-max profile for this game, this Bach, Stravinsky

97
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:05,440
game or Backstreet, Sting game, and put the, the number for

98
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,420
Curly in the first box and Smooth in the second box.

99
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:07,940
>> Okay.

100
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,750
>> Go.
