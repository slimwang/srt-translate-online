1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,840
Wow, that's a lot of progress.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,740
First, we set up a new project and
then set up the game architecture.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,790
We created the player, added two ways
to control the players movement and

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,980
added the eponymous icicles.

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,219
We also learned how to use a fancy
data structure to clean up icicles

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:16,940
we no longer need.

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:23,040
In the next and final level we'll detect
when the player runs into an icicle and

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,570
add a head-up display for
the player's score.

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,840
We'll even add a whole new
difficulty select screen.

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,350
See you there.
