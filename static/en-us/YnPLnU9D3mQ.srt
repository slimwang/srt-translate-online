1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,400
So the answer is none, that we can't actually make

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,670
any words with just this rule. And the reason for that

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,700
is this is a circular definition, and it's a circular

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,840
definition because we, we can never stop. If you remember the

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,780
rules for BNF grammars, that we can start from a

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,680
starting on terminal, and we keep doing replacements. We can only

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,820
stop once we have all terminals. We are never going to get

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,300
there if this is our only rule. We can keep adding

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,000
more counters, but we can never replace the non-terminal

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,110
word. Because every time we end up with the non-terminal

11
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,560
word again, on the right side. So with just

12
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,990
this rule, we can't actually make any words. All we

13
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,850
can do is start from word. Now our only

14
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,190
choice is to replace word, with counter-word well, we only

15
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,270
have one rule, so our only choice is to replace

16
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,330
the word here with counter-word. So now we end up

17
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:54,755
with counter-counter-word, but since word is a a nonterminal, we're

18
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:57,660
never done. So we can never make any word this way.
