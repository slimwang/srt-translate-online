1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,000
So I'm just going to show how I added
the polyline to the map with all my

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
different ice rinks.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,898
So to draw the polyline, I set up
the latitudes and longitudes for

4
00:00:06,898 --> 00:00:10,444
all the different ice rinks, Renton,
Kirkland, Everett, Lynnwood, etc.

5
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:12,650
And this time I'm just setting
them as LatLng objects.

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,270
Earlier they were marker options,
but now they're just latitudes and

7
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,430
longitudes.

8
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,510
I set up my camera position to be
exactly as I did in the earlier sample.

9
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:24,276
Now in my onMapReady, I just move
the camera to my camera position,

10
00:00:24,276 --> 00:00:25,341
which is Seattle.

11
00:00:25,341 --> 00:00:28,090
And then to draw the polyline
I just call map.Polyline.

12
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,440
It's a new Polyline object,
geodesic true,

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,810
and then I just add all
of the latitudes and

14
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:39,200
longitudes that I had created earlier,
Renton, Kirkland, Everett, Lynnwood.

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,560
Notice that I begin at Renton and
I also add Renton at the end.

16
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,690
And then this just closes the shape.

17
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,760
Because what will happen when you draw a
polyline is it will draw from Renton to

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,260
Kirkland, from Kirkland to Everett,
from Everett to Lynnwood, etc.

19
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,600
So, if I want to close the shape,

20
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,160
I just want to go back to
the initial one at the end.

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,999
And then I will get all my rinks drawn
into a polygon like shape by adding

22
00:01:00,999 --> 00:01:01,910
a polyline.

23
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,830
And this is what it will look like.

24
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,880
Here you can see on my tablet I
have the same map of Seattle, and

25
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,670
I have all the endpoints
of the different rinks.

26
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,990
My home rink of Renton that I showed
earlier on is the beginning and

27
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,330
ending point, and then the polylines
get drawn from Renton to other rinks.

28
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,652
So for example,
this is the rink in Kingsgate.

29
00:01:20,652 --> 00:01:22,830
You can see,
Kingsgate highlighted there.

30
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,810
Or I can go all the way
the rink in Everett, etc.

31
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:29,430
So, these are the polylines that I've
drawn from me connecting the rinks.

32
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,684
And because I just joined the last rink
at ShoWare back to Renton in my code

33
00:01:33,684 --> 00:01:36,150
the shape gets completed.

34
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,230
And as you can see here,
my second last one was ShoWare.

35
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,600
I then added Renton and
the shape got completed.

36
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,380
So my polyline actually
became a polygon.

37
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,440
You can actually also
do a map.addPolygon and

38
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,080
specify the endpoints and
it will auto close it for you.
