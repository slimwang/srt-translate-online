00:00:00,037 --> 00:00:02,930
There are five sorts of classes involved in the visitor structure.

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:04,540
The participants, one is of course,

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,590
the visitor itself, which is an abstract class declaring a visit operation,

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,510
that is then applied by each of the concrete elements.

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,200
ConcreteVisitors are specialization of the visitor class,

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,270
implementing an operation on each of the concrete elements.

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,390
And, in addition, they may store local state, that is,

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,190
if your navigation wants to accumulate statistics,

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,020
there's a place to do that accumulation inside the ConcreteVisitor.

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,369
The Element class is an abstract class declaring the accept operation that takes

11
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:33,166
a Visitor as an argument.

12
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:38,240
It is sub-classed by Concrete Elements, representing the various different

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,940
kinds of nodes in the complex data structure, and

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,290
each of those elements takes an except operation with a Visitor as an argument.

15
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:50,190
Finally, the fifth of the classes is the Object Structure class,

16
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,280
itself, which usually provides a way of enumerating the various elements,

17
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,210
serving as the root of the data structure itself.
