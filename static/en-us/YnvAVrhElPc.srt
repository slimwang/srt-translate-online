00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,876
Our plus or minus here means that we can either have negative 5 plus the root of

2
00:00:04,876 --> 00:00:09,431
1 over 2 as our value of x. Or we can have negative 5 minus the root of 1 over

3
00:00:09,431 --> 00:00:14,246
2. Let's figure out what each of these numbers actually is. Well, the root of 1

4
00:00:14,246 --> 00:00:18,640
is just 1. So this number should be negative 2 and this number should be

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,426
negative 3.
