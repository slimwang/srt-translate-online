1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,270
Now let's talk about the syntax
of first order logic.

2
00:00:04,269 --> 00:00:07,379
And like in propositional logic,
we have sentences,

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,560
which describe facts that are true or
false.

4
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:17,239
But unlike propositional logic, we also
have terms, which describe objects.

5
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:22,519
Now the atomic sentences are predicates
corresponding to relations.

6
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:27,992
So we can say, Vowel (A) is an atomic

7
00:00:27,992 --> 00:00:32,277
sentence or Above (A, B).

8
00:00:32,277 --> 00:00:37,229
And we also have a distinguished
relation, the equality relation.

9
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:40,705
We can say 2 = 2,

10
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:45,800
and equality relation is
always in every model.

11
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:51,339
And sentences can be combined with all
the operators from propositional logic.

12
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:58,800
So, that's and, or, not, implies,
equivalent, and parentheses.

13
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:07,109
Now terms which refer to objects
can be constants, like A, B, and 2.

14
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:11,933
It can be variables,
we normally use lowercase like x and y.

15
00:01:11,933 --> 00:01:17,912
And they can be functions, like number
of (A), which is just another name,

16
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:22,444
or another expression that
refers to the same object as 1,

17
00:01:22,444 --> 00:01:27,010
the least in the model
that we showed previously.

18
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:31,219
And then there's one more type of
complex sentence, besides the sentences

19
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:36,280
we get by combining operators that
makes first order logic unique.

20
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:40,150
And these are the quantifiers.

21
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,042
And there are two quantifiers.

22
00:01:43,042 --> 00:01:43,677
For all,

23
00:01:43,677 --> 00:01:49,350
we write with an upside down A followed
by a variable that it introduces.

24
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:54,103
And there exists,
which we write with an upside down E,

25
00:01:54,103 --> 00:01:57,855
followed by a variable
that it introduces.

26
00:01:57,855 --> 00:02:02,518
So for example, we could say, for all x,

27
00:02:02,518 --> 00:02:08,270
if x is a vowel,
then the number of x is equal to one.

28
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,199
And that's a valid sentence
in first order logic.

29
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:15,665
Or we could say, there exists an x

30
00:02:15,665 --> 00:02:20,382
such that the number of (x) = 2.

31
00:02:20,382 --> 00:02:23,846
And this is saying that there's
some object in the domain to

32
00:02:23,846 --> 00:02:27,450
which the number of function applies and
has a value of 2, but

33
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:29,759
we're not saying what that object is.

34
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,848
Now another note is that sometimes as an
abbreviation, we'll omit the quantifier.

35
00:02:37,848 --> 00:02:42,378
And when we do that, you can just
assume that it means for all,

36
00:02:42,377 --> 00:02:45,119
that's left out just as a shortcut.

37
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,052
And I should say that these forms
of these sentences are typical.

38
00:02:48,052 --> 00:02:50,810
And you'll see these form over and
over again.

39
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,120
So typically, whenever we have a for

40
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,650
all quantifier introduced,
it tends to go with a conditional.

41
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:01,277
Like vowel(x) implies number of (x) = 1.

42
00:03:01,276 --> 00:03:04,689
And the reason is, because we usually
don't want to say something about

43
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:09,310
every object in the domain,
since the objects can be so different.

44
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,849
But rather we want to say something
about a particular type of object.

45
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:15,609
Say, in this case, vowels.

46
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:21,970
And also, typically when we have
an exists an X or exists any variable,

47
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:28,756
that typically goes with just a form
like this and not with the conditional.

48
00:03:28,756 --> 00:03:32,569
Because we're talking about just one
object that we want to describe.
