00:00:00,062 --> 00:00:04,789
So from our last two quizzes, we now have
developed a new expression for total money

2
00:00:04,814 --> 00:00:09,464
earned by Grant. Instead of money from
wipers, we have 36w, where w is the amount

3
00:00:09,489 --> 00:00:15,136
that each set of wipers cost. And instead
of money earned from nozzles, we have 11 times

4
00:00:15,136 --> 00:00:20,324
2n, where n is equal to the amount that a
person pays for one nozzle. Now when I

5
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:24,954
look at this term 11 times 2n, it looks a little
bit complicated to me, definitely more

6
00:00:24,979 --> 00:00:31,139
complicated than 36w does. Can you think
of a simpler way to write 11 times 2n?

7
00:00:31,139 --> 00:00:35,279
Now, there are a ton of different ways that we
can write 11 times 2n and come up with a

8
00:00:35,304 --> 00:00:39,885
mathematically equivalent expression, but
I would prefer that we try to come up with

9
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,525
a simpler way to write this. So, if you
have an idea of how to do that, please

10
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:45,805
type it into this box right here.
