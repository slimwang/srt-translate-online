00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
One of the things I just want to reemphasize because we mentioned it earlier

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
is the difference between single-sided markets and multi-sided markets.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Now, in single-sided markets the customer is the user and the payer.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That's a single-sided market. There are no separate users, and there are no separate payers.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You're it. Congratulations. You're the customer and you're going to pay for it.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But in multi-sided markets there might be users,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
but they're also might be very separate people who are payers.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The example we keep using is Google,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
because everybody around the world has probably had at one time or another

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
been a Google user.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When you use the Google search bar you're one side of a multi-sided market.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You're the user, but you're not the payer. You're not paying for the product.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
But in reality, you're paying implicitly,

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
because there is another side.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The other side are the people using Google Adwords

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
to look for keywords.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
In multi-sided markets the company, your startup,

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
typically cares about acquiring a massive amount of users

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and then figuring out how to monetize those users next.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Google decided to go from millions and then tens of millions of users,

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and then the keywords came after.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Now, depending on your investors, this might be their strategy.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I tend to prefer that we actually try to look for who the payers are as early as possible,

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
but this is a question you might want to ask your investors.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Do we go for lots of users and then say if we get 10 million people

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
the revenues will come?

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Or do we want to look at both sides of the market at the same time?

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Again, if you're in a physical channel,

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
my suggestion is you want to take a look at users and payers simultaneously.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
If you say your business is advertising-based,

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
some of the tactics are how do you get to 10 million monthly users?

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
How do you become one of the top five websites?

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And how much do the payers actually pay?

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Now, if you wait 2 years to find this out,

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
you might have gotten 10 million of the wrong users.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Your job is not only to talk to the users in a multi-sided market.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You're job is to get out of the building and talk to the payers.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Because you have a hypothesis, an important one,

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
which is how much will those payers pay for the users you think you're collecting.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Guess what?

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
If you're wrong, the time to know about it is now, not two years from now,

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and it's okay to be wrong,

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
because most startups all you have is a series of hypotheses,

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
and it's really easy to get caught up in the passion that says,

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
well, if we get all these people obviously these people will pay us lots of money.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But as soon as we get out of the building that obviously might turn into maybe not.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What we want to do is get the facts as quickly as we can

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
and then iterate and pivot.

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So, don't worry if your assumptions were wrong here on your revenue model.

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You just want to find it out before you start burning a lot of cash

51
00:03:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and building a lot of value prop around the wrong model.
