00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,410
Today we'll talk about frames. Frames are a very powerful and

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,260
very common knowledge representation. Frames are our first step,

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:14,230
a basic unit towards building a creative common sense reasoning. They'll also

4
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,930
come up in several other topics, such as understanding. We'll begin by talking

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,560
about the function of frames, what are they useful for, and what makes them so

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,000
useful. Then we'll talk about several properties of frames. We'll relate

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,180
the knowledge representation of frames with other knowledge representations,

8
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:35,170
such as semantic networks and production systems. And finally, we will

9
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:41,730
show how frames can be very useful for sense-making. For story understanding.
