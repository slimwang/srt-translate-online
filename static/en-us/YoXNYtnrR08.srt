00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,169
We know that to multiply this polynomial
by this polynomial, we need to ensure that

2
00:00:05,169 --> 00:00:10,803
every term over here is multiplied by
every term over here. So if we take these

3
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:16,466
two terms one by one, and make sure that
each of them is multiplied by every term

4
00:00:16,466 --> 00:00:20,529
over in the right=-hand expression, then
we'll cover every combination of pairs of

5
00:00:20,529 --> 00:00:24,200
terms and also make sure that we don't
repeat any. So I'm going to start by

6
00:00:24,212 --> 00:00:28,211
distributing the 3x to every term over
here. And now that I've multiplied it by

7
00:00:28,211 --> 00:00:32,946
each of the three terms that I needed to,
I move on to the 1. At this point, all

8
00:00:32,946 --> 00:00:37,134
that's left to do is to simplify each term
and combine like terms. And we get a final

9
00:00:37,134 --> 00:00:42,734
answer of 3x^3-14x^2+x+2.
