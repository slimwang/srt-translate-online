>> Straight forward. Hope, hopefully you all got, got that one. So,

2
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:34,176
second step is preconditions. And we're, we are talking about a function here,

3
00:00:34,176 --> 00:00:40,550
or functions. And the precondition will take the form of an assertion about

4
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:46,010
the function's input arguments. In particular, think. Along the following lines.

5
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:52,000
If you were writing some code to compute a function that took some arguments,

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,870
one of the first statements you might have in your code, is something that

7
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:00,810
checks whether the input arguments are what you expected. What we like to do,

8
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,730
is in our specification, state what those conditions are. And

9
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:08,060
the set of those conditions is the precondition for the function's execution.
