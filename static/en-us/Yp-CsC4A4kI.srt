00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,710
Hey Andrea.
We created illustrations of those acorns

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,550
and family photos that you provided us,
and

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,150
we added them as images into the app.

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:06,689
Here, take a look.

5
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,060
>> This is so cool.

6
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,280
Look at these family member icons.

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,580
This one looks just like my grandmother.

8
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,160
And the colors, and the acorns.

9
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,170
This is starting to really feel great.

10
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,930
>> Yeah, everything's coming
together really well.

11
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,640
>> But I think there's one
more feature we can add.

12
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,490
>> What's that?

13
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,400
Well, the ability to hear the correct
pronunciation of each word.

14
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,260
>> Pronunciation is really
important in learning a language.

15
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,650
It's been the hardest thing for me.

16
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:30,200
>> That's true, and

17
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,760
in order to do that we need an audio
file of each word being spoken.

18
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,420
Andrea, could you records
some audio files for us?

19
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,370
>> Sure.

20
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,040
I'll have to brush up
on my pronunciation.

21
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,870
>> Don't worry.
You're going to do great.

22
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:45,070
Let's go into the recording studio
to make those sound clips, then.

23
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,830
>> So while they're doing that,
let's get back to the course map.

24
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:51,380
All right, so right now we're at lesson
four out of our four lesson course.

25
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,110
We're in the homestretch now.

26
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:57,180
Now in this lesson, we're going to first
allow the user to play an audio file to

27
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,425
hear the pronunciation of
each word when they touch it.

28
00:00:59,425 --> 00:01:02,365
Next we're going to learn about
Android's activity lifecycle and

29
00:01:02,365 --> 00:01:05,655
also learn how to properly clean up
resources in the right callbacks.

30
00:01:05,655 --> 00:01:08,915
Now, here's a diagram of the activity
life cycle that we'll be discussing more

31
00:01:08,915 --> 00:01:09,935
in detail later.

32
00:01:09,935 --> 00:01:10,455
Now, onward.
