00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,120
In this lesson, we answered the big question, what is an operating system?

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,160
And we saw that it's important because it helps abstract and

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,630
arbitrate the use of the underlying hardware system.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,650
We explained that to achieve this,

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,900
an operating system relies on a number of abstractions, like processes and

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,700
threads, a number of mechanisms that allow it to manipulate those abstractions,

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,630
and a number of policies that specify how those abstractions can be modified.

8
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,840
We saw that operating systems support a system call interface that

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,260
allows applications to interact with them.

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,790
We looked at several alternatives in organizational structures for

11
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:35,990
operating systems.

12
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:40,660
Then very briefly, we looked at some specific examples of operating systems,

13
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,205
Windows, Linux, and Mac OS to see some examples of

14
00:00:44,205 --> 00:00:46,780
their system call interfaces or their organization.
