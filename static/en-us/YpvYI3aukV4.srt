1
00:00:00,211 --> 00:00:03,922
So the last question,
where it was an algorithm question,

2
00:00:03,922 --> 00:00:06,445
where we were asking, given an array and

3
00:00:06,445 --> 00:00:11,066
a number, find two elements in the array
that add up to that given number.

4
00:00:11,066 --> 00:00:14,736
The reason we asked that question,
or I asked that question,

5
00:00:14,736 --> 00:00:19,054
is to check basic understanding of
does the interviewer know run times.

6
00:00:19,054 --> 00:00:23,169
Can they reason about how long a program
they're going to write is going to take?

7
00:00:23,169 --> 00:00:27,522
Can they reason about how much space the
program they're going to write is take,

8
00:00:27,522 --> 00:00:28,556
Phillip did both?

9
00:00:28,556 --> 00:00:31,847
And can they come up with
a solution that's as,

10
00:00:31,847 --> 00:00:36,800
that uses as little memory pressure and
runtime pressure as possible.

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,034
And Phillip did really well on that.

12
00:00:38,034 --> 00:00:41,907
It also tests your understanding of
using data structures that are common

13
00:00:41,907 --> 00:00:45,592
across languages so a hash map is
something you'll definitely have to

14
00:00:45,592 --> 00:00:48,348
use at your job,
regardless of what you're doing.

15
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:50,175
And Philip ended up using one,
and using it well.

16
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,854
And being able to reason
about how it works and

17
00:00:52,854 --> 00:00:56,954
why you want to use your given data
structure is also very important.

18
00:00:56,954 --> 00:00:58,470
And Philip did that well too.
