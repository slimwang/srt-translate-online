1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,950
And here's the code that we use to do that.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,445
Now, you might remember form edit name from before.

3
00:00:06,445 --> 00:00:08,427
And we added form edit role.

4
00:00:08,427 --> 00:00:15,061
Now, to create our form edit role, we took html header role.replace,

5
00:00:15,061 --> 00:00:21,940
and we replaced the data placeholder with the role that we created up here.

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,400
So, this next bit of code is a little bit tricky.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,740
So, over here we have our header div.

8
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:33,950
We can see that header already has an unorder list inside of it.

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,600
So, if we pin the data, it would actually put the data right here.

10
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:43,580
We want it to show at the beginning of our header tag, right here.

11
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,760
In order to add elements to the beginning,

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,350
we actually need to use prepend instead of append.

13
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,240
So, we want our name to appear first and our role to appear second.

14
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:03,060
So running through this code, when we append our form edit role,

15
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,739
it'll show up at the top here.

16
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:12,000
And then when we prepend our name, instead of showing it

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,290
at the end as append would, it will insert it in the beginning.
