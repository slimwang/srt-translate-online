00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,328
In this exercise, you'll make a river flow. Well, it's more like a square lake

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:06,088
than a river and really the texture should be more stretched to look like

3
00:00:06,088 --> 00:00:10,466
flowing water and the banks of the river - well, well never mind. This is an

4
00:00:10,466 --> 00:00:13,720
exercise after all so I want to keep it simple. The initial code doesn't have

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,420
anything moving. Your job is to use the texture transform feature in Three.js

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,708
to animate the water as shown, moving from top to bottom. The rate of movement

7
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:24,946
is one second per copy of the texture. In other words, when the texture repeat

8
00:00:24,946 --> 00:00:28,282
is three, a point at the top of the square will take three seconds to move from

9
00:00:28,282 --> 00:00:31,741
top to bottom. When the repeat is changed to one, the top of the texture moves

10
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:35,431
down the screen in one second. For your solution, the movement should be tied

11
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:38,949
to the elapsed time in the real world. If you look just above where your code

12
00:00:38,949 --> 00:00:41,289
should go, you'll see how the texture repetition parameter is set on the

13
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:44,869
texture. You'll need similar code in your solution.
