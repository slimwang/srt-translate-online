Here's our first challenge problem for u-substitution. Notice that we have

2
00:00:03,862 --> 00:00:08,289
fractional exponents in our original equation. What type of substitution do you

3
00:00:08,289 --> 00:00:12,638
think we can use? And be careful when you go back to solve for the original

4
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:16,955
value of a. When you think you've got it, write your answer here. Now of

5
00:00:16,955 --> 00:00:21,535
course, since this is a challenge problem, there won't be a solution. Try your

6
00:00:21,535 --> 00:00:24,325
best, and if you get stuck, head to the forums and discuss it with some other

7
00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:25,540
students.
