1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,210
This is what the numbers
activity file should look like.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,930
So down here, we deleted the for
loop and added

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:12,610
these three lines of code to create an
adapter and then set it on the listView.

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:17,160
Now we also modified
the activity_numbers.xml layout file.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,230
So in here, notice that we used
a listView and it has an ID

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,010
list, by the way on Android Studio
if you show the preview window for

7
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,560
the activity numbers layout file

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,430
you notice that the device preview
shows a list of items and sub-items.

9
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,790
So since a list view needs to be
populated with list items using Java

10
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:42,940
code and not XML this is just a preview
of what it could look like, but

11
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,740
when you check your device you
won't see these exact items.

12
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,860
All right so
let's run the app on a device now and

13
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,180
this is what it should look like
displaying list numbers one through ten.

14
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,830
We also see a divider
between each list item and

15
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,670
this divider comes built in with
listView but you can customize it or

16
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,680
even hide it completely by
modifying listView XML attributes.

17
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,100
For our use case we're going to
leave the dividers as is.

18
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,050
Well now that we have a listView and
adapter in our app.

19
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,620
Let's go ahead and figure out what
on Earth they're actually doing.
