1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,106
If your intuition tells you that
the incremental approach of

2
00:00:03,106 --> 00:00:06,720
the Ford-Fulkerson method produces
a maximum flow, that's a good thing.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,580
Your intuition is correct.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,300
But it's important that it be
correct for the right reasons.

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,710
Not all incremental approaches work.

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,240
Often in optimization, we get stuck
in local minima or local maxima.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,410
We need to argue either that
we never make a mistake,

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,850
the analysis of greedy algorithms
typically have this feel.

9
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,530
Or we need to be able to argue
that the rules for incrementing

10
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,350
allows us to undo any mistakes
that we have made along the way.

11
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,980
The latter will be the case for
maximum flow.

12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,840
The argument we'll make is complex,
and will require us to introduce a new

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,200
notion of a minimum
cutograph along the way.

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,900
But in the end it's rewarding, and

15
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,730
provides an example of how to
find elegance in analysis.

16
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,600
To show that Ford-Fulkerson returns
a maximum flow, we're going to introduce

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,420
the concept of a cut, and then relate
the capacity of a cut to a flow.

18
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,290
Here's a picture of our understanding so
far.

19
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,980
We know that the network will have some
possible non-negative flow values, but

20
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,080
it's not exactly clear how
high this range goes, or

21
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,720
where the results of
Ford-Fulkerson fit in.

22
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,630
One observation is that the flow
value can't exceed the capacity of

23
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,950
edges coming out of the source.

24
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:19,267
Remember that the flow is defined to be
the sum of the flows over these edges.

25
00:01:19,267 --> 00:01:23,850
Separating S from T in this way
constitutes a cut in the graph which,

26
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,690
as we'll see, is an upper bound
on the value of any flow.

27
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,590
It's possible that there will
be smaller cuts as well,

28
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,400
which will shrink the range of
possible flow values for us.

29
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,440
Even better, however, we'll see that
the flow produced by Ford- Fulkerson

30
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,430
has the same value as the cut.

31
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:44,340
And since this cut serves as an upper
bound on all possible flows,

32
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,590
this flow must be a maximum.

33
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,970
That's where this argument will end up.
