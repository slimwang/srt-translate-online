00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,710
In order to make sure that
they're getting the point here

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:06,200
let us revisit an exercise
we had come across earlier.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,925
This is a truncated
version of the exercise.

4
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:11,090
That one had six choices,
here there are only four choices.

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,160
The similarity weights are shown here.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,900
David, which one do you think is
the right choice for this problem?

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,480
>> So it seems to me that
given these four choices,

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,590
the right choice is
going to be number 2.

9
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,190
>> What does everyone think
about David's answer?

10
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,005
Did David give the right answer with 2?
