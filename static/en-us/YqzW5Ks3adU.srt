1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,300
Step 9 is to implement
the onActivityResult.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,140
Now, the onActivityResult
override takes three parameters.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,470
There's an int for the request code,
there's an int for the response code,

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,130
and there's an Intent.

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,460
The only thing we're really
interested in checking for is,

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,830
on the request code to see if
we're an RC_SIGN_IN and if we are,

7
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,190
we take a look at the response code.

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:24,575
If the response code is Result_OK, then
we want to set our signed in status to

9
00:00:24,575 --> 00:00:28,360
STATE_SIGN_IN, which basically means
that we want to keep catching errors and

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,250
handling errors because they may be
more intent, such as the account or

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,390
such as the permission screen.

12
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,980
Otherwise if it's not Result_OK,

13
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,030
then we know we're actually
in a signed in state.

14
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:40,870
So we're good to go.

15
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,590
We just set our sign in
status to be signed in.

16
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,770
This is everything that
the onActivityResult needs to do.

17
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,380
See if you can implement it,
I know it's a little tricky.

18
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,840
If you get stuck,
the code is in the speaker notes.

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,120
But check this box when you're done.
