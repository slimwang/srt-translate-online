00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So this completes this unit. Congratulations! I'd say this was nontrivial.

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I didn't derive every piece of math for you. But you've learned a number of things.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,000
If X is normal with parameters µ and σ², then aX+b will yield parameters aµ+b and a²σ².

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You also learned if you combined X and Y, that the combined thing adds up the means

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
in this case two µ's and adds up the variances as well.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So we did some very basic math on normals.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We got a feel for how they changed as we turned them into problems and manipulate them.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'll leave it at this. This was possibly the most insightful and deep probability consideration.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You now go back to statistics, and we worry about confidence and other things.
