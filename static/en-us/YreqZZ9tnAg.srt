1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,800
For our first asynchronous request,

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,720
let's get the Google Maps Street View of the location.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,540
Remember, we want the background of our app to be an image of

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,140
the location where we're thinking about moving.

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,410
So, in this case, we've got the White House in the background.

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:19,380
Now, what you're about to perform isn't technically an Ajax request because here

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:25,940
we're requesting an image asset instead of asking for data like a JSON object.

8
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,080
But, it's important and fun to use services like Street View because they make

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,960
the background more entertaining.

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,890
It's actually pretty nice that we're starting with Street View because we

11
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,780
won't even need to use jQuery to get it to work correctly.

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,320
Our page will be requesting an image from Google and,

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,140
based on the various parts of the URL.

14
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,540
Google will know what image to serve us.

15
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,050
Essentially, every Street View image has it's own URL endpoint.

16
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:54,240
And, the URL can contain a string of the street address at that location.

17
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,610
We can see here that the location is set to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,

18
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,330
Washington D.C..

19
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:04,420
And, it's pretty obvious that the image we've got is the White House.

20
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,130
Notice how there is a comma between the street address and the city.

21
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,260
Inside script.js, we can see this function setup called, loadData.

22
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,910
If we scroll down all the way to the bottom of the page,

23
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:22,030
we can see this jQuery selector for the form entry at the top of the page,

24
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:26,010
which when somebody hits submit, will run the loadData function.

25
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:30,440
For this quiz, I want you to us jQuery to collect the street address and

26
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,010
city that users type in here.

27
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:37,270
Use the address in the city to fill in the end of the URL string here,

28
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,690
that is being used to collect the image.

29
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:43,660
Now, pin the resulting image to the page inside an image tag, with the class bg

30
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:48,250
image, and set the source to the string, similar to the one you see here.

31
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,700
Where the street address and city were collected from the form up at the top.

32
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,440
When you're done, you should be able to type in an address and

33
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,780
city and see a cool street-view image show up in the background.

34
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,150
Inside the documentation for

35
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,730
the Street View API, we can figure out the way these images work.

36
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:08,268
We see that the street-view image comes from a url with this beginning.

37
00:02:08,268 --> 00:02:11,480
We see maps.googleapis, dot yada, yada, yada.

38
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,020
And then, at the end of it we've got some parameters.

39
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:19,920
The parameters must have a location, or it must be an id to a specific panorama.

40
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,700
But, you can also set the size of your image.

41
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,360
In this example, they set the size to 600 by 300 pixels and

42
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,360
set the location to a latitude and longitude for the location of this image.

43
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,630
In our example, we're not using latitude and longitude.

44
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,580
We're just using street address and city.
