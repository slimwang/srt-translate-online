00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,822
Remember that we can easily see what the equation of a parabola might look like

2
00:00:04,822 --> 00:00:09,665
if we just think about what its x intercepts are. These are the points where y

3
00:00:09,665 --> 00:00:14,659
equals 0. So one of those factors needs to be the x minus 4, since that factor

4
00:00:14,659 --> 00:00:19,522
as a whole will equal 0, when x equal 4. And the other needs to be x plus 2,

5
00:00:19,522 --> 00:00:24,637
since that will be 0 when x equals negative 2, our other x intercept. So y

6
00:00:24,637 --> 00:00:30,390
equals x minus 4 times the quantity x plus 2 must be the correct answer.
