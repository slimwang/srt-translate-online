1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The step size of 0.050 is just at the threshold of working.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is what we get for the distribution of temperature

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and you can already see quite some artifacts cropping up.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
If you use just a slightly larger time step, hell breaks lose.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You'll get huge temperatures, you'll get negative temperatures, and lots of oscillation.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Our method becomes unstable.
