00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,815
The fast Fourier transform is
an instance of the discrete Fourier

2
00:00:03,815 --> 00:00:08,508
transform, which as we've said has its
own significance in various branches of

3
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:13,220
mathematics, physics and engineering,
signal processing most especially.

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,756
In the study of algorithms,

5
00:00:14,756 --> 00:00:18,725
however, the fast Fourier transform
is most interesting for its role and

6
00:00:18,725 --> 00:00:23,620
a very practical and very fast way of
convolving two sequences of numbers.

7
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,303
We'll illustrate
convolution by an example.

8
00:00:26,303 --> 00:00:30,888
We're given two sequences of numbers
shown here, we'll call them a and b.

9
00:00:30,888 --> 00:00:36,609
And we want to obtain a new sequence
defined by this formula here,

10
00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:42,434
where the kth element in the sequence
is the sum from 0 to k over i and

11
00:00:42,434 --> 00:00:45,270
ai times b sub k minus i.

12
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,587
We can visualize convolution by
reversing the order of b and lining it

13
00:00:50,587 --> 00:00:56,101
up with a, so that the the 0th element
of b is under the kth element of a.

14
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:58,697
This is the alignment for k equals 0,

15
00:00:58,697 --> 00:01:03,496
then we multiply all elements that
overlap and add up these products.

16
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:08,894
For k equals zero,
this is 2 times 1, which is 2.

17
00:01:08,894 --> 00:01:12,562
So we'll write down
that C0 is equal to 2.

18
00:01:12,562 --> 00:01:17,771
For k equals 1, we shift the sequence
over, multiply the corresponding

19
00:01:17,771 --> 00:01:22,825
elements and add those up, that is
a total of zero and that becomes C1.

20
00:01:22,825 --> 00:01:26,521
For K equals 2 we shift
the B sequence over again,

21
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:31,802
multiply the corresponding elements and
add them up for a total of 5 and

22
00:01:31,802 --> 00:01:36,906
we continue sliding b along doing
these products and then summing all

23
00:01:36,906 --> 00:01:43,350
things together and we keep doing this
until there is no more overlap left.

24
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,724
Convolution has many applications, but
the one that will be most convenient for

25
00:01:47,724 --> 00:01:50,246
us to talk about is
multiplying polynomials.

26
00:01:50,246 --> 00:01:54,666
Given two coefficients of polynomials,
we can find the coefficients of

27
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:58,802
the product just by convolving
the two sequences of coefficients.

28
00:01:58,802 --> 00:02:02,114
In fact, we can easily repeat
the example we just did, but

29
00:02:02,114 --> 00:02:04,827
in the context of
polynomial multiplication.

30
00:02:04,827 --> 00:02:08,814
First, I lined things up, so
that we get the constant terms and

31
00:02:08,814 --> 00:02:10,180
that product is two.

32
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:14,997
Then we line them up, so
that we get the linear terms, 0 times x.

33
00:02:14,997 --> 00:02:18,110
Then we line them up, so
we get the quadratic terms.

34
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,420
5 time x squared and so forth and so on.

35
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,020
How long does this process take?

36
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,930
Well, for each element in the longer
sequence, we had to do as many

37
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:34,320
multiplications and additions as there
are elements in the shorter sequence.

38
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,187
Sometimes it will be a little
shorter around the edges,

39
00:02:37,187 --> 00:02:40,177
because the shorter one ran off
the edge of the longer one.

40
00:02:40,177 --> 00:02:42,681
But on average,
it was at least about half.

41
00:02:42,681 --> 00:02:47,413
Therefore, we can say that convolving
two sequences via the naive

42
00:02:47,413 --> 00:02:52,317
strategy outlined here, takes theta
n times m operations where n and

43
00:02:52,317 --> 00:02:55,650
m are the lengths the sequences.

44
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,670
The Fourier Transform will give
us a way to improve on this.
