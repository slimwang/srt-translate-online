1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,050
So we want to do efficient exploration
in general stochastic MDPs.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,689
And so we're going to need to combine
the two ideas that we've been

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:07,360
talking about.

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,220
>> Wait, what were the two
ideas we were talking about?

5
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,590
>> Well in the context of bandits,
we talked about stochastic processes.

6
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,690
And the trick that we used was to use
something like a Hoeffding bound.

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,060
We just keep repeating the stochastic
thing until we have enough data, so

8
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,500
that we can make accurate estimates.

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,920
>> Oh, okay.
>> And then we talked about

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,950
sequential domains
that are deterministic.

11
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:28,100
And the main trick that we used there
was this r max trick that said,

12
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,160
if there's a state action pair
that we don't know about,

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,320
assume it's really, really good.

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:32,880
>> Okay.

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,790
>> We can put these two ideas together
and get a stochastic version of Rmax.

16
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,060
>> Okay, so
we'll have Hoeffding regions.

17
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,050
>> Yes.

18
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:40,755
Good, good, good.

19
00:00:40,755 --> 00:00:43,740
>> [LAUGH] We're still going to use
Hoeffding bounds on the individual state

20
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,300
action pairs.

21
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,010
>> Okay.

22
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,140
>> In fact, regions probably
means state action pairs here.

23
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:47,730
>> So I was right.

24
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:48,450
>> Yes, you were right.

25
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:48,970
>> Good.

26
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,200
Well, then I think we're done here.

27
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,190
>> All right, so let's write down
what this algorithm looks like.
