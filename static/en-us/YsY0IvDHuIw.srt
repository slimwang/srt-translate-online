1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,840
So David,
how did you configure the chair?

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,530
>> So you can see here my final
configuration for this chair.

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,955
I ended up with a 160 gram chair.

4
00:00:07,955 --> 00:00:12,230
It cost $16 based on
having four metal legs.

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,210
I didn't give it arms.

6
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:14,790
I gave it a metal back.

7
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,820
And of course the 100 gram
metal seat that was required.

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,580
As far as how I actually did
this though, like before,

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,050
I started off by writing out
the initial constraints we were given.

10
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,360
The chair has to cost less than $16.

11
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,960
It has to have 100 g metal seat.

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,530
And it has 100 g metal seat.

13
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,049
And that seat has to cost $10.

14
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:36,330
So 100 grams times $0.10 per
gram means $10 for the seat.

15
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,660
After this, however, we're already
pretty close to our price limit.

16
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,510
So the plan I'm using might specify
that when we're getting within a certain

17
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,530
range of our price limit to operate
under a heuristic that calls for

18
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,250
minimizing the cost.

19
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,660
That heuristic in that
plan might then say,

20
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,490
find the part that can be
minimized the most next.

21
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,730
That part would be the arms.

22
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,970
The arms had a range
from 0 grams to 50 grams,

23
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:59,510
meaning that arms are not
even required in our chair.

24
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,040
So to minimize our costs, we're
going to go ahead and cut the arms, and

25
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,840
say that our arms cost nothing.

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,810
Now our plan might recognize that we're
no longer quite as constrained by our

27
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,970
price, so we're going to choose the next
most important part of the chair,

28
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,610
which might be the legs.

29
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,300
Given some information that
the plan has about the ideal legs,

30
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,290
it might choose to have four legs,
that are ten grams each and

31
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,490
are made of metal,
which gives us a cost of $4.

32
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,810
Based on the $10 seat and
the four dollar legs,

33
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,720
we now know that we have $2 left for
our back.

34
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,420
The plan may have a heuristic that
says it's ideal to match materials or

35
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,080
the plan may have a heuristic that
says that metal is the optimal

36
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,650
material to use.

37
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:33,888
So it may choose metal.

38
00:01:33,888 --> 00:01:37,740
And given $2 for the remaining money and
a material of metal,

39
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,250
it can derive that 20g is
the mass available for the back.

40
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,060
And now that all of these individual
variables have been assigned,

41
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,455
we can then see that the final mass
is 160g, and has a cost of $16.

42
00:01:48,455 --> 00:01:50,550
At most $16 meets that constraint.

43
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,290
And we have our 100g
metal seat over here.

44
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,315
>> That's good David.

45
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:58,430
This important note that David used
several different kinds of knowledge.

46
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,010
First, he had knowledge
of the general chair.

47
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,430
He knew about the components,
he knew about the slots, but

48
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,980
not necessarily all the fillers for
the slots.

49
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,430
Second, he had heuristic knowledge,
he used the term heuristic.

50
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,440
Recall that heuristic stands for
rule of thumb.

51
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,280
So heuristic knowledge about
how to go about filling

52
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,258
the values of some of these slots.

53
00:02:18,258 --> 00:02:22,560
Third, explicit list is not
just knowledge about legs and

54
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,990
seats and arms and so on,
but also how this chair,

55
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:29,260
as a whole,
is decomposed into its components.

56
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,610
That is one of the fundamental rules
of knowledge and knowledge-based AI.

57
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,490
It allows us to structure the problem so

58
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,330
the problem can be
addressed efficiently.

59
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:41,630
Note that this process of configuration
design is closely related to the method

60
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,800
of constrained proposition that we
discussed in a previous lesson.

61
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,020
Here are some constraints, and
these constraints have been propagated

62
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,970
downwards in the plan
abstraction hierarchy.
