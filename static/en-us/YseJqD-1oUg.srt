1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So we just learned something important.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
There's a probability for an outcome; I'm going to call it A, for now.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And we learned that the probability of the opposite outcome,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
which we're going to call Â¬A

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
(this over here just means "not")

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
is 1 minus the probability as expressed right over here.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That's a very basic law of probability, which will become handy as we go forward,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
so please remember it.
