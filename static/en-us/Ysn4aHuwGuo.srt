1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,765
In the other lessons of this course,

2
00:00:01,765 --> 00:00:03,890
we've talked about some of
the pedagogical strategies.

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:05,950
Some of the research methodologies.

4
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,240
Some of the existing tools and

5
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,240
some of the broader issues
in educational technology.

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,130
With this knowledge, you're now
equipped with the information you need

7
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,060
to start to solve some problems or
investigate some phenomena.

8
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,854
In case you're curious
what you should look into,

9
00:00:18,854 --> 00:00:21,569
though, we're going to spend this lesson
talking about some of the open issues

10
00:00:21,569 --> 00:00:23,129
in the educational technology community.

11
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:25,435
We'll talk about some of
the problems that still exist,

12
00:00:25,435 --> 00:00:27,321
that haven't been solved
by technology yet.

13
00:00:27,321 --> 00:00:30,743
And we'll talk about some of the
phenomena that have been introduced or

14
00:00:30,743 --> 00:00:32,330
emphasized by technology.

15
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:35,090
You really could use some investigation,
could use some better understanding.
