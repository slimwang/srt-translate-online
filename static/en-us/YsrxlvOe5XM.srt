1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:05,000
So it needs to get
the new reported height.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,660
>> Okay.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,460
>> From the event that has occurred, and

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,620
it doesn't necessarily need to aggregate
anything down to the file manager.

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,590
It just has to change the size
of the view port itself.

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:25,820
Well, if the viewport size changes,
there might be more lines.

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,550
>> I see.
>> So it has to be responsible for

8
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,090
getting those lines if necessary.

9
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:29,640
>> That's true.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,050
And I guess I overlooked
that it would also need.

11
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:39,420
Okay, so first things first is it
needs to get the new location of,

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,870
or based on the height it's going to
get the new position of the scroll bar.

13
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,110
And that scroll bar will
indicate if it needs,

14
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,760
well, the scroll bar doesn't move.

15
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:57,280
>> Okay, so this raises an ambiguity,
and it's good to raise ambiguities.

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,190
So the act,
if the size of the window changes,

17
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,340
the height of the tray for
the scroll bar changes.

18
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:10,780
So, at least in absolute terms,
the position of the handle may change.

19
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,460
But its relative position may or
may not change.

20
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,750
Okay, so go ahead.

21
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,522
>> Then based on that
>> It needs to request from the file

22
00:01:20,522 --> 00:01:23,950
manager any additional lines
of support [CROSSTALK].

23
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:24,880
>> Okay.

24
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,460
And what was our other
indirect effect here?

25
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,510
If we now have, let's say,
a smaller or larger window?

26
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,340
The proportion of the skull
bar walls have changed.

27
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,060
>> The handled proportions can change.

28
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:37,690
>> Can change.
>> Okay.

29
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:42,570
So, the if we're aggregating all of
this, the viewport is then responsible

30
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,990
for informing all it's other
components of what it needs.

31
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,080
And asking them to make whatever
changes they have to make.
