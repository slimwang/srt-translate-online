1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,960
So one thing that we should explain is
the difference between the terminal

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,290
and the shell.

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,074
>> The terminal is a program
that draws text in a window, and

4
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:10,020
lets you type things in on a keyboard.

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,340
Technically it's called
a terminal emulator,

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,690
since it acts like one of those
old school hardware terminals.

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,360
It displays output on the screen and
it accepts input from the keyboard.

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,470
>> But the terminal itself doesn't
know what to do with that input.

9
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,410
It needs another program to do that.

10
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,820
In this case, that program is the shell.

11
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,930
When you type things in the terminal
just sends what you type to that

12
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,170
separate program.

13
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,750
When you press Enter, the shell
interprets what you wrote as a command,

14
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,670
figures out what program you
want to run, runs it and

15
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,460
sends the output back to the terminal so
you can see it.

16
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,520
>> You could actually use
the terminal without the shell,

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,850
with a lot of terminal programs you
can tell it what program to run.

18
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,320
The default is a shell, but

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,650
you can have it run say,
the Python interpreter instead.

20
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,176
>> Also, there are actually a lot of
different shell programs that you can

21
00:00:52,176 --> 00:00:53,320
choose from.

22
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,750
The default one on most Linux systems,
and on the Mac, is called GNU Bash.

23
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,770
But there are others called TCSH,
KSH and Seashell.

24
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:05,260
They all work slightly differently and
have various different features.

25
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,600
For this course,
we're just going to stick with Bash.

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,460
>> And you can also use a shell
without the terminal, sort of.

27
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,610
You can write shell commands
into a file and arrange for

28
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,240
your computer to run the shell
program on that file.

29
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,710
This is called shell scripting.

30
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,510
It's a bit of an advanced topic and
we don't go into it in this course.
