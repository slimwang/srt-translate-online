Several other principals proposed by Martin concern Reuse.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,510
One of these is the release Reuse Equivalency Principle

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:15,100
that says that the granules of reuse should be the granules of release.

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,830
That is you should release your your software in such a way that the pieces can

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,550
be individually reused. Of course, reuse can take place at all levels so,

6
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:27,010
what Martin is really suggesting is that we re, Release highly cohesive code

7
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,830
units. In particular, Martin suggested Java packages as a good unit of release.

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,960
The converse of this principle is the Common Reuse Principle, also by Martin.

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,850
Classes that aren't reused together should not be grouped together.
