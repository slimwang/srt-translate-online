Hi. Welcome to Version Control.

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,300
I'm Carolyn, one of your instructors for the course.

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,350
>> And I'm Sarah, your other instructor.

4
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,340
In this course, we'll cover the concept of Version Control and

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,960
why you might want to use it.

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,610
>> Yeah. So, Version Control is sort of like having a giant undo button for

7
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,530
your project.

8
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,720
>> You mean like this one?

9
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,600
>> Yeah, exactly.

10
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,320
It makes it easy to save versions of your files at different points in time.

11
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,190
You can also restore previous versions and compare different version.

12
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,386
Yeah, it also makes it a lot easier to collaborate with other people.

13
00:00:25,386 --> 00:00:28,598
>> No more sending huge .zip files of your project back and forth.

14
00:00:28,598 --> 00:00:32,211
>> Now, learning to use Version Control is a little bit like learning to type:

15
00:00:32,211 --> 00:00:35,948
it's hard at first, but once you can do it, it makes you a lot more efficient.

16
00:00:35,948 --> 00:00:39,081
>> You might feel like learning a whole new system to keep track of versions of

17
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:41,252
your files is a lot of work and maybe not worth it, or

18
00:00:41,252 --> 00:00:44,200
that if you're hard core enough, you don't need Version Control.

19
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,930
But if you look at successful companies like Google and

20
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,260
Facebook, you'll find that they all use Version Control internally.

21
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,000
What about you, Caroline?

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,480
>> Well, when I first started using Version Control,

23
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,300
I basically only used it when I needed to.

24
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,450
But now I like to use it for all of my projects.

25
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,600
It's kind of addicting.

26
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,280
>> Cool.

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:00:59,960
Let's find out why.
