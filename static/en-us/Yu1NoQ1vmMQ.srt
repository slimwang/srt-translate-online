1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,170
Now that we've finished
building the UI for our app,

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,080
it's time to think about
how it should operate

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,060
when it's not in the foreground.

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,612
One of the most powerful
features of Android,

5
00:00:08,612 --> 00:00:11,633
is the ability for any app
to run in the background.

6
00:00:11,633 --> 00:00:14,456
But with great power
comes great responsibility.

7
00:00:14,456 --> 00:00:18,190
So you need to be very conscious
of how it's consuming resources.

8
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,613
In this lesson, you'll learn more about
how the Android framework

9
00:00:21,613 --> 00:00:23,172
manages background apps.

10
00:00:23,172 --> 00:00:25,011
And you'll be introduced
to the service class

11
00:00:25,011 --> 00:00:26,440
to help make that happen.

12
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,920
You'll also learn techniques
for efficient data transfers

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,290
using sync adapters
and Google Cloud messaging.

14
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,550
And be introduced to the 
notification framework

15
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,230
to send messages to your users 
when your app isn't in the foreground.
