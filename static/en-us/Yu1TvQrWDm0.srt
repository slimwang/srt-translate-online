1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,910
First, import the sales
data into Alteryx.

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,860
Next, filter the data to
show only data from 2010,

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,110
including the week ending
on January 1st, 2011.

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:17,243
We'll add the formula tool and multiply
the weekly customer spend per store,

5
00:00:17,243 --> 00:00:22,890
by 1.064 to calculate the 6.4% lift and

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,910
a new value for
average weekly customer spend.

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:30,650
Now we're ready to bring in the number
of weekly customers per store per week.

8
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,530
Let's import the data from the weekly
customers per store Excel file,

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,740
selecting sheet one for our data.

10
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,430
We'll use a join tool to combine
the data, joining on store ID and

11
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,509
their week ending value.

12
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,893
Also, we'll deselect the right values
of both columns to avoid duplicates.

13
00:00:46,893 --> 00:00:49,935
[BLANK_AUDIO]

14
00:00:49,935 --> 00:00:52,968
Next, let's calculate the total
spent per week, before and

15
00:00:52,968 --> 00:00:56,750
after the new candy introduction,
using the formula tool.

16
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,900
The formula for
total spent per store, per week,

17
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,810
is simply the average spent per
customer times the number of customers.

18
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,930
We'll repeat and calculate
the predicted new spend per customer.

19
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,510
And finally,

20
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,670
we'll calculate the difference
between the two total spend values.

21
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,575
Running the workflow,
we can see the new values.

22
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:20,088
[SOUND] The total spend column is
the average spend per customer times

23
00:01:20,088 --> 00:01:21,841
the number of customers.

24
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:24,480
The new total spend column
is the predicted average

25
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,210
spend per customer times
the number of customers.

26
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,660
And the difference is simply
the difference between the two columns.

27
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,600
Our last step is to aggregate
the values for the entire year.

28
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,390
We use a summarize tool and select
the sum for the total customer spend and

29
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,800
new total customer spend and
the difference.

30
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,460
Running a workflow provides our answer.

31
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,680
The total sales amount in
2010 was $1.3 million.

32
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,640
Had we introduced the new candy line,

33
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,109
the total spend may have
increased to $1.38 million,

34
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:01,644
or, an increase of $83,462.
