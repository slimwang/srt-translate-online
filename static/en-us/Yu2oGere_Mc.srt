1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,296
JP: Well welcome, everyone.

2
00:00:03,296 --> 00:00:05,170
First of all, thank you
very much for waiting

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:09,980
in the hot sun outside in line
to come to our presentation.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,047
My name is JP.

5
00:00:11,047 --> 00:00:13,630
PETER: And I'm Peter, and we're
here from the Google Developer

6
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,230
training team.

7
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,780
JP: And we're excited to present
our first Google certification:

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,960
Associate Android Developer,
a performance-based exam

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,270
where you'll write real
apps to show your skill.

10
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:32,090
PETER: So the Google
Developer Training Team

11
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,230
is part of the Developer
Relations Team at Google.

12
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,520
And in this team,
our mission, really,

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,970
is to educate and
inspire developers.

14
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,200
And we'd like to
do that at scale.

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,680
So what we'd like to
do is help developers

16
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,880
like yourself teach the best
practices, the design patterns,

17
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,420
the tips and tricks
that you need

18
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,210
to know to build high
quality apps in the most

19
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,500
efficient way possible.

20
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,300
Now, JP and I and other
members of the training team

21
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,150
that are also here today, we've
been in this training world

22
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,470
for awhile.

23
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,080
And one of the things about
developer certifications

24
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,410
is whether you
should do it or not.

25
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,190
And it's kind of
a tricky balance.

26
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,510
Many certification
programs kind of

27
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,480
miss the mark of what they're
intending to try to do.

28
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,240
And so at the same time, we
felt that the certification

29
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,690
could really set the bar
for helping people achieve

30
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,330
some of their goals--
career wise, job wise--

31
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,300
and really accomplish
what they want to do.

32
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,160
And that's what we're trying to
set up with this program here

33
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,240
today that we're
really excited about.

34
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,906
JP: What we want to
do today is give you

35
00:01:40,906 --> 00:01:42,840
a short view of the
program, introduce you

36
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,130
to Associate Android Developer
and really show you how to get

37
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:46,899
started.

38
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:48,440
We want to keep this
short and sweet.

39
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,610
We want to give you lots of
time for questions and answers,

40
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,110
and give you lots
of time so you can

41
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:56,900
get a good seat for
the concert too.

42
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,000
So imagine a developer.

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,750
She has this amazing app, and
she wants to change the world.

44
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,810
Now, if you're already
an entrepreneur

45
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,980
or an independent app developer,
you can do this today.

46
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,949
And we even have
training to help you.

47
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,054
However, there's
other situations,

48
00:02:13,054 --> 00:02:14,470
situations where
it's not quite so

49
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,080
easy to go from zero to
hero, where developers

50
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,330
around the world look for
and need resources to help

51
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,730
them accomplish their dreams.

52
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,140
So one of these
situations, which

53
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:31,380
is familiar to probably many
of us, is getting a job.

54
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,770
Maybe you or someone
you know is looking

55
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,940
for a job as an app developer.

56
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,160
Maybe it's a first job, or maybe
it's a new job or a new career.

57
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,480
You have ideas.

58
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,580
You have skills.

59
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,180
You have a network.

60
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,570
But maybe you can't quite
connect to employers

61
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,710
to land that job.

62
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,289
There's really a gap
between skilled developers

63
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:54,580
and those jobs that will let
them fulfill their dreams.

64
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,617
Now, as Peter and I started
to look at this gap,

65
00:03:00,617 --> 00:03:02,200
and other members
on the training team

66
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,815
looked at this gap, we
discovered it was really,

67
00:03:04,815 --> 00:03:07,560
I'd say, way larger
than we thought.

68
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,834
We saw it in
developer education.

69
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:11,000
We saw it in the job market.

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,250
We saw it where skills that
employers were looking for

71
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,845
and how people were
training to get those jobs.

72
00:03:17,845 --> 00:03:20,290
And really, two questions arose.

73
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,980
The first question,
for employers,

74
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,002
how do you show that
somebody is qualified?

75
00:03:25,002 --> 00:03:27,335
How do you know that somebody
can perform the tasks that

76
00:03:27,335 --> 00:03:29,210
are required of them?

77
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,310
The second one, for
individuals, how

78
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,711
do you stand out for job
interviews and get recognized,

79
00:03:33,711 --> 00:03:35,460
whether it's for a new
job or a promotion?

80
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,820
PETER: Separately, a
lot of industry studies

81
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,960
came out that showed that we
had a significant disadvantage

82
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,460
here.

83
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,190
For example, this report
from Vision Mobile

84
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,250
really pointed that out.

85
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:54,970
And we realized the lack of
this objective industry standard

86
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,580
was really holding us
back, and specifically

87
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,290
in different countries
around the world.

88
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,900
Now, we started thinking
about this quite deeply.

89
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,920
And I have to say,
this is something

90
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,030
that kept us up at night.

91
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:11,100
We really wanted to
solve that for Google.

92
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,560
Now, generally with the rise of
these alternative credentialing

93
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,529
methods, like the
ones you're probably

94
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:20,180
familiar with with Udacity
and General Assembly,

95
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,480
we realized that there
was a real appetite

96
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,260
for learning app development
that would directly

97
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,130
lead to jobs.

98
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,090
And so over the last few
years, we've done quite a bit

99
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,780
to close this gap.

100
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,330
And perhaps a lot
of you are already

101
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,020
familiar with some
of our training.

102
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,080
But I'll go into a little
more detail on that as well.

103
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,760
So for example, with Udacity,
our online training partner,

104
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,360
we built 35 MOOC
training courses

105
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,670
providing end to end paths
for Android development, web

106
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,300
development, and tech
entrepreneurship.

107
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,710
We also built other courses
around machine learning

108
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,370
and cloud computing and so on.

109
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:04,890
Now over the last few years,
the people enrolling in this

110
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,550
have really
dramatically increased,

111
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,620
and it's still picking
up a lot of steam.

112
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,870
For example, we now have
1 and 1/4 million people

113
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,850
enrolled in our Google
courses on Udacity.

114
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:20,160
And we have about 2,500 people
enrolling in these courses

115
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,310
every single day, right now.

116
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,790
So it's been a really
good platform for us

117
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,550
to get the message out,
to educate developers,

118
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,310
which is our original mission.

119
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,240
Now, we also realize
that not everyone

120
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,290
learns with the same--
online and self-paced.

121
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,260
And so we worked together
with General Assembly

122
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:44,260
to build a complete 12 week
Android immersive, sort

123
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,850
of a full time in-person course
where you go on-site and spent

124
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,060
12 weeks really
dedicated to that,

125
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,220
whereas most of the online
learning is self-paced.

126
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,420
And we just had our first
people graduate from that.

127
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,630
The first cohort in New
York, about 25 people,

128
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,830
and the next one is
graduating very soon here

129
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,120
in San Francisco.

130
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,430
And there is going to be opening
up about 12 order locations

131
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,180
globally.

132
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:15,040
So I wanted to take just a
quick step back about what we've

133
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,220
done, specifically to Android.

134
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,350
Two years ago at I/O, we
released the first Android

135
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,020
fundamentals or Developing
Android Apps training

136
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,830
course with Udacity.

137
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:31,970
And that's sort of our
flagship Android course.

138
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,560
We have almost 300,000 people
enrolled in that course.

139
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,450
I think it's 288,000
at last count.

140
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,830
This is a course
that's developed

141
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,250
by Reto Meier, Katherine Kuan,
who's here in the audience,

142
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,020
and Dan Galpin.

143
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,820
So a really great course.

144
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,200
But at that time, we
were still building

145
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,120
in a very ad hoc manner.

146
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,090
So we were building one
course on the HTML5 games,

147
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,900
another one on mobile
web development,

148
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,170
and another one on
Android fundamentals.

149
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:05,660
But what we were lacking
was that well-lit path

150
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,070
for developers through
an entire curriculum that

151
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,610
would lead directly to jobs.

152
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,590
And so we decided to
start building that.

153
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:17,570
And last year at I/O
[INAUDIBLE] announced

154
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,410
that we launched the
Android Nanodegree.

155
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:25,290
And later in the year, we
launched that in September,

156
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,710
or relaunched that
effectively, in India

157
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,850
with local pricing,
1,000 scholarships,

158
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:35,815
and local e-commerce
options for Indian students

159
00:07:35,815 --> 00:07:36,690
to take that as well.

160
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:41,030
Of course, they could have
taken that by itself already.

161
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:44,090
Now late last year, we started
seeing the first graduates

162
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,680
from these Nanodegrees.

163
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,210
It takes generally
about six to 12 months

164
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,350
for people to complete.

165
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,570
We hosted a career
summit in Mountain View

166
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,640
for about the 50 top students.

167
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,620
And what we're seeing there is
that people are getting jobs.

168
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,660
For example, in India, we
have 16 Nanodegree students.

169
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,340
And keep in mind that this
is still kind of early days

170
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,850
because it takes
six to 12 months,

171
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,950
and it's only been 12 months.

172
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,220
And out of these six
students, four of them

173
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,950
were hired without even as much
as an interview at Flipkart.

174
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,430
So pretty amazing stories.

175
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,210
Some of these graduates have
also been hired at Google.

176
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,570
So a pretty high level
of mastery, and just

177
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,740
a great outcome.

178
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,960
We also launched last year the
Android for Beginners course.

179
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,630
This is a fantastic course.

180
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:40,020
All you need for that is
a phone, a computer where

181
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,159
you can install Android Studio,
and an Internet connection.

182
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,770
You could take that
course and really

183
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,410
take you from zero
programing experience

184
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,560
all the way to actually having
apps running on your machine.

185
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,710
That's Katherine
Kuan and [INAUDIBLE],

186
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,040
who are here in the
audience today, somewhere.

187
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,460
Raise your hand.

188
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:57,960
There.

189
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,802
All right, thank you.

190
00:08:59,802 --> 00:09:01,385
So we launched that
as well last year.

191
00:09:01,385 --> 00:09:06,030
So then fast forward
to this year.

192
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,590
We realized there
were still a big gap.

193
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,040
Generally we say that
for Android fundamentals

194
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,780
and the Android Nanodegree,
you need about two years

195
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:18,290
of programming experience.

196
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:21,230
Android for Beginners takes
you part of the way there,

197
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,710
but it's not quite complete.

198
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,232
And so we've been working
really hard-- in fact,

199
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,690
Katherine and
[INAUDIBLE] have been

200
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,960
working really
hard-- on bridging

201
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,440
that gap in intermediate
Android development skills.

202
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,490
And so stay tuned for some
really exciting announcements

203
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,080
in that space because we're
building out, effectively,

204
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,540
an entire end to end path
for developers on Android

205
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,860
so that we no longer
have to tell people,

206
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:50,580
if you want to take
the Android Nanodegree,

207
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,870
go off and go to these
16 different places

208
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,310
to learn the prerequisites.

209
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,490
So we'll have an end to
end, zero to hero path

210
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,860
for all of that.

211
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,620
So in summary, we've
come a long way

212
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,740
to closing that gap
that JP described.

213
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,840
When we're trying to accelerate
that gap even further.

214
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,240
And so today, we're
taking one step closer

215
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:17,140
to supercharging how employers
and employees can effectively

216
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:21,700
work together in the
most efficient way.

217
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,210
JP: Today we're excited to
announce Google Developer

218
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:27,570
Certification, a new program
to help close the gap

219
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:31,300
for employers and job seekers,
to help set common standards,

220
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,320
and to help
developers worldwide.

221
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,800
Now, we're very excited
about this program.

222
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,320
We think that it's going to
help developers stand out,

223
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,400
be recognized, get a job, help
build higher quality apps.

224
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,430
And I'm going to tell you about
the details, what it contains,

225
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,830
and how you can benefit.

226
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,510
Now, if you're an
individual, if you've

227
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,350
got a great idea, if
you're looking for a job,

228
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,470
or maybe you represent
a company or an agency

229
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:00,670
looking for talent, we think
we've got something for you.

230
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,920
PETER: Now, I want to talk
a little bit about how this

231
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,280
is not, let's say, an ordinary
developer certification,

232
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,470
or expel a few
myths that you might

233
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:11,230
think about when you think
of developer certification.

234
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,330
So one of the big
things here is that it's

235
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:17,750
based on job task
analysis, and JP

236
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,330
will tell you more about
that in a little bit.

237
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:24,060
The big difference with,
let's say, a typical exam

238
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,530
is that this is a
performance-based exam.

239
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:30,570
We're trying to take
certification into 2016,

240
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,860
do it in a bit of a Googley way.

241
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:37,910
And basically, you'll need to
build apps and show your skills

242
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,500
to pass these exams.

243
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,290
It's very performance-based.

244
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:48,320
So it's not a 200 question,
trick question, multiple choice

245
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,870
exam.

246
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,720
It's not really
a knowledge test.

247
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,210
It's really testing
actual app development.

248
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,067
JP: So we've thought about this.

249
00:11:57,067 --> 00:11:58,650
And I think, as Peter
was alluding to,

250
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,430
we thought about the
traditional concept

251
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,707
of technical certification
for developers.

252
00:12:02,707 --> 00:12:05,290
Now, in other industries, there
may be performance-based exams

253
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,300
that work well.

254
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,950
But specifically,
when we're looking

255
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:11,190
at technical certification
for app developers,

256
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,830
it was something that we
really need to think about.

257
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,080
So we thought first we need
to make it job-focused,

258
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,745
as Peter alluded to.

259
00:12:17,745 --> 00:12:20,550
When we say job-focused, we
mean that every certification

260
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,280
that we develop
is actually mapped

261
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,645
to a job that's in the
industry, as determined

262
00:12:24,645 --> 00:12:28,170
and vetted by a
job task analysis.

263
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,600
Peter also mentioned
performance-based exams.

264
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,660
So we take an exam
that we will develop.

265
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,740
Let's just take one.

266
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,110
In that, you'll be
asked to build, extend,

267
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:39,010
add functionality
to an existing app,

268
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:42,666
or determine and correct
defects in the code.

269
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:45,290
So we feel like this is similar
to the task the developer would

270
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,170
do in the real world, for
an entry level developer.

271
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,440
And as opposed to a
knowledge-based exam,

272
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,990
it's going to evaluate the
ability to perform tasks.

273
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,040
Can you do the task
required in the job?

274
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,875
Not recall facts or concepts.

275
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,930
Probably one of the
things that's probably

276
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,820
most important for this
program is how we're

277
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,685
going to be using rubrics.

278
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:07,560
Now typically, rubrics,
you just kind of say,

279
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,940
OK I have to know these things,
and if I know these things,

280
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,000
I'll do well.

281
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,590
Well, there is some
aspect of that, of course,

282
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,710
for us and with grading.

283
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,350
The rubrics will be
transparent, published,

284
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,516
you'll have them as soon
as you sign up for an exam.

285
00:13:19,516 --> 00:13:22,860
You'll know what you need to
do in order to pass that exam.

286
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,450
But it also would
reduce ambiguity.

287
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,450
It's going to make it
very clear, very empirical

288
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:29,420
and objective how you will
earn the certification.

289
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,789
So if you're prepared,
if you can build an app,

290
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:34,080
and you know these rubrics,
you should be in good shape

291
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,480
to pass and earn one of
these certifications.

292
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,437
We like to say there's
no tricks, no guile, just

293
00:13:40,437 --> 00:13:41,395
measurable performance.

294
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,870
PETER: So JP showed
you a little bit

295
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,931
about our overall
certification program.

296
00:13:47,931 --> 00:13:49,430
And we're really
excited about that.

297
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,930
And today, we're
launching the first

298
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,660
in the series, Associate
Android Developer.

299
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,560
Now, this certification
maps to what

300
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:03,250
you would need to know as an
entry level Android developer.

301
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:11,964
Now, the exams for this,
they will open up in July.

302
00:14:11,964 --> 00:14:13,880
And so today, it's all
about getting prepared.

303
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,350
Now, a lot of you,
in this audience,

304
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,808
you're probably
Android developers,

305
00:14:16,808 --> 00:14:20,230
and you may already be
ready to pass this exam.

306
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,980
But if you're not, and
you need to brush up

307
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,270
on some of these skills, we
have a great training page.

308
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:30,040
You can find out all about
our certification and training

309
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,720
offerings that we have
to help you get ready.

310
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,010
So you can find our
new certification page

311
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,720
that we just launched
earlier today that

312
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,010
has more details on it.

313
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,560
You can find there
what these rubrics

314
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,540
are that we talked about,
what the program is all about.

315
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,740
And today, you can sign up,
literally just put your email

316
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:53,080
in, so we can notify you as
soon as the exams open up.

317
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,580
So the key takeaway here is
you can start your journey

318
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,940
toward certification.

319
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,360
Now, how do you prepare?

320
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,440
So coming back to that
landscape of Android

321
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,050
training that we developed
over the last few years.

322
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:09,330
Really what this is about is
more on the advanced side--

323
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,430
on the intermediate to
advanced side-- which

324
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,910
is based on, if we
zoom into, let's say,

325
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:18,660
that advanced
Udacity nanodegree.

326
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,310
Then you can take
Android fundamentals,

327
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:26,690
which is really the course
to dive into that maps

328
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,840
to the task analysis.

329
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,930
Can we get the next slide?

330
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:32,990
Great.

331
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:36,580
So Android fundamentals
maps closest to the job task

332
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,440
analysis that we performed.

333
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,390
And so by taking
that course, you

334
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:44,120
can really get ready
to get the exam.

335
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,682
Now, taking that
course also means

336
00:15:47,682 --> 00:15:49,640
you have to do all the
practical parts of that.

337
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,140
Right?

338
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,540
It's not just
watching the video,

339
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:55,302
but it's actually really
getting your hands dirty,

340
00:15:55,302 --> 00:15:57,010
building the projects
that come with that

341
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:00,710
and really mastering
that material.

342
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:04,960
So that's, in essence, what I
think the best place to start

343
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,787
with to get started today.

344
00:16:08,787 --> 00:16:09,620
JP: So that's great.

345
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,640
Thank you, Peter.

346
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,640
That's how you go about
preparing for this exam.

347
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,080
And you can do that,
again, starting today.

348
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,100
So what about July?

349
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,625
Let's fast forward a little bit.

350
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,570
When July comes, what
you'll do is you'll

351
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:22,120
complete your sign-up process.

352
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,790
You'll be presented
with some projects.

353
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,450
Basically, the
projects will represent

354
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,400
what you need to know in
order to pass the exam

355
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,262
and then earn the certification.

356
00:16:31,262 --> 00:16:32,720
When you get these
projects, you'll

357
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,530
work on them
independently, submit them.

358
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:38,970
They'll be graded, and ding!

359
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,170
You'll be certified.

360
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:43,000
Then you can take your
mark, show recruiters, show

361
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,397
employers, show your friends.

362
00:16:45,397 --> 00:16:47,980
I don't know, hand it in front
of your dog and let him see it.

363
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,970
Something like that.

364
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,590
Show your mark,
so you can proudly

365
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:53,210
show everyone what
you've earned.

366
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:57,030
And not only that, we
looked at grading too.

367
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:00,130
Sometimes in certifications,
it becomes just something

368
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,859
earned to just get through.

369
00:17:01,859 --> 00:17:03,900
We really wanted this to
be part of your learning

370
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,230
path towards mastery as well.

371
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,599
So when we think about
grading for this,

372
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,569
it's not pass or fail.

373
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:12,750
It's really you get
three chances to pass.

374
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,060
You can retake the exam.

375
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,609
And there's a combination of
machine and human grading.

376
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:18,770
So with the human
grading, Android experts

377
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,089
will give you feedback.

378
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:22,611
So again, it's not just about
earning the certification,

379
00:17:22,611 --> 00:17:24,819
it's also about learning as
you're doing and building

380
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:25,443
these projects.

381
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,395
And well, that's it.

382
00:17:29,395 --> 00:17:31,906
That's what we had
to talk about today.

383
00:17:31,906 --> 00:17:33,280
Thank you for
attending the talk.

384
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,890
