00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,560
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:06,210
All right, so today we continue on our tour through multiple views and

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,840
views, and today we're going to talk about homographies,

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:13,260
which we learned a little bit about last time, and a cool thing, mosaics.

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,140
In particular last time we talked about a variety of

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,960
projected transformations that said there were some special cases like

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,500
translation similarity that did not divide out by that last time.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,930
But then the general case had eight degrees of freedom.

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,231
Eight coefficients and

10
00:00:26,231 --> 00:00:30,220
you did do that division to go from homogeneous to inhomogeneous.

11
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,240
And that last one, the one that used all eight, was called a homography.

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,470
And we're going to use that extensively today.
