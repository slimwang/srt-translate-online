1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,325
Aw, yes!

2
00:00:01,325 --> 00:00:04,000
You're now able to create
many shopping lists.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,630
And get an ever expanding list of lists.

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,460
Now when you open a list,

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,680
I've provided in the drop down menu this
little menu item that says Remove list.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,329
It opens a dialogue for
us to be able to delete the list.

7
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:18,370
But I haven't connected
it to Firebase yet.

8
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,190
Could you do that next?

9
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,130
Before you implement remove,
I got a quick question.

10
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,560
Given what you know about how
the FirebaseListAdapter works, and

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,470
that this is a class that helps keep
an array on your phone, in sync with

12
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:34,670
an array from Firebase, what should
happen when you click Remove?

13
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:35,530
So, your options are,

14
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,360
you manually remove the ShoppingList
from the FirebaseArray, and

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,400
this triggers an update in
the Firebase database via a listener.

16
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,444
Option B, is that you manually
remove the shopping list from

17
00:00:46,444 --> 00:00:49,490
the Firebase database instead
of from the FirebaseArray and

18
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,350
then that in turn updates the array.

19
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,810
So this is basically
the opposite of option A.

20
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,588
Option C is that you actually have
to go and write the code to manually

21
00:00:57,588 --> 00:01:02,185
remove the shopping list from both the
Firebase database and the FirebaseArray.

22
00:01:02,185 --> 00:01:04,980
And D is that you actually
don't have to do anything.

23
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,940
The data is actually automatically
removed from both the Firebase database

24
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,690
and the FirebaseArray via a listener.

25
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,250
Once you've answered this question,
I'll send over a spec for

26
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,250
the remove functionality.
