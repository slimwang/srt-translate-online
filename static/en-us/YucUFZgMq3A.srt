1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now, we could determine the equilibrium point by examining all 9 of the outcomes

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and checking each one to see if both parties do no better by switching.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But instead, I'm going to show an alternative method to analyze games,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
which is to look for dominated strategies.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
There are no dominant strategies here, but there are dominated strategies.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
For example, for the politician, the strategy of contracting is domininated

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
by the strategy of doing nothing.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
To the politician, 2 is greater than 1, 5 is greater than 4, and 9 is greater than 6.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We can say that this strategy is dominated,

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and we can take it out of consideration.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Now, how does that help?

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Well, now in the other direction, we do have a dominant strategy that we didn't have before.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Now for the Fed, the option of contracting gives them 8, which is better than 5 or 4,

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
or 3 which is better than 2 and 1.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This a dominant strategy for the Fed, and we can mark that off.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Now for the politicians, they know they're going to be in this column,

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and they have a choice of getting a 2 or a 3,

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The 3 would be the strategy for the politicians.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That leads us to this Nash equilibrium point,

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and the values of that outcome are 3 for each party.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Is that Pareto optimal?

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Actually, it's more like Pareto pessimal in that this is worst total.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Out of all these outcomes the total is only 6

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
as opposed to every other one is better.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
To answer the question specifically is it Pareto optimal,

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
the answer is no, because any of these four would be better for both parties.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That may tell you something about our political system.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Next time you get an outcome that you don't like,

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
don't assume that the players are irrational.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Just assume that that's the way the game was set up.
