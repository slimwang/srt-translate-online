00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,944
>> The bottom line is in order for you to pick a threshold if you wanted to do

2
00:00:04,944 --> 00:00:08,809
this sort of analytically, what you need is a noise model.

3
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:11,885
And unfortunately, this noise model is not the same model as the thing we

4
00:00:11,885 --> 00:00:12,749
were going before.

5
00:00:12,749 --> 00:00:15,316
It's not our line, it's our dist, it's our belief.

6
00:00:15,316 --> 00:00:19,820
I'll use the word belief, maybe, instead of model of no, because it's model.

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,757
It's a model of how that the, the noise behaves.

8
00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:25,760
So let's go back to our line example, you remember this?

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,566
So if we were just looking at a line so let's assume that we,

10
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:31,680
you know, we have this real line and

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,703
that our points are perturbed by a Gaussian by Gaussian noise.

12
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:38,406
This is the thing we looked at last time.

13
00:00:38,406 --> 00:00:43,144
So the distance in a Gaussian is sometimes a complicated thing.

14
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:47,051
So you've got multi-dimensional Gaussian, you may know about Chi squared and

15
00:00:47,051 --> 00:00:50,751
that the, and the square root of that is the distribution of, of the distances.

16
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:54,056
In one d, it's actually much easier.

17
00:00:54,056 --> 00:00:57,185
It's essentially what's called a half normal.

18
00:00:57,185 --> 00:01:02,342
Because basically, you know, the probability that you're d, o, a is, it's,

19
00:01:02,342 --> 00:01:06,933
you could either be d this way or d that way, but d is only a positive value.

20
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,937
So it's just twice the regular Gaussian distribution.

21
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:13,074
That's what this dis distribution here looks like.

22
00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:15,142
Because it says, d greater than zero.

23
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:19,109
But all that matters is given a noise model,

24
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:22,550
you could generate a distance model.

25
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,853
And given a distance model, you could pick a threshold.

26
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:29,764
So in fact, if you have this 1D Gaussian, let's say and

27
00:01:29,764 --> 00:01:34,819
let's suppose it has a distribution of, of parameter of sigma squared,

28
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:38,833
then you could set the threshold t, based upon t squared.

29
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:41,969
Is this number 3.84 sigma squared?

30
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:44,405
Where the heck does 3.84 come from?

31
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:49,484
Well, I just arbitrarily said, lets pick a threshold such that

32
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:54,014
95% of the inliers would fall within that threshold.

33
00:01:54,014 --> 00:02:00,654
So 95%, if you got sigma squared then I said, t squared at 3.84 sigma squared.

34
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:05,160
If you wanted 99%, you'd have to make it bigger threshold.

35
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,728
If you're willing to remove some points, you'd make it a smaller one.

36
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:09,830
But the idea is that you have some threshold.

37
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,603
And then you're going to accept the point if the distance D

38
00:02:12,603 --> 00:02:16,037
is less than that threshold, you'll count that point as an inlier.

39
00:02:16,037 --> 00:02:16,604
Okay?

40
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:17,839
Cool. All right.

41
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:19,540
So let's see, we've got our number of points.

42
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,344
We have our distance threshold t, it says what we did here before.

43
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:25,746
We've go one more.

44
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:28,215
The number of samples we're going to compute.

45
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:31,919
Now this is not s, the number of points within a sample.

46
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,990
Right? A sample is a set of points that it takes to compute a model.

47
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,593
This is how many times are we going to draw a sample.

48
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:43,430
How many models are we going to try and check.

49
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:50,104
So what we'd like to do is we'd like to choose N to be big enough.

50
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:55,409
That we can't actually guarantee that we're always going to get inliers, can we?

51
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:56,344
Right?

52
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:59,251
Because if we're randomly picking points, et cetera and

53
00:02:59,251 --> 00:03:02,349
unless we were to exhaustively pick all, say, N choose two.

54
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:06,198
If we're just randomly picking things, it's only with probability that we

55
00:03:06,198 --> 00:03:09,523
can say that, what's the likelihood that we got a good solution?

56
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:14,073
So what's we're going to do is let's pick a probability p and

57
00:03:14,073 --> 00:03:17,484
what we want to know is how big does N have to be,

58
00:03:17,484 --> 00:03:22,403
such that the probability is p, let's say, 0.99, 99%.

59
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:26,099
That at least one of our samples will just be made up of

60
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:29,044
points that come from the correct model?

61
00:03:29,044 --> 00:03:29,677
Right?

62
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:31,363
So, that's a way of saying if,

63
00:03:31,363 --> 00:03:35,115
if this line, I actually get two points that really came from the line.

64
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:37,383
Or another way of saying it is, I've got this,

65
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:41,155
all these putative matches that are compute and I want to compute a homography.

66
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:44,703
I want at least one set of four matches that I

67
00:03:44,703 --> 00:03:48,462
test to actually be the correct homography.

68
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:49,430
All right.

69
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,966
So the question there is can we figure that out?

70
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:54,802
And in particular, it should be pretty clear.

71
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:57,338
What if all the points were right?

72
00:03:57,338 --> 00:04:00,241
That is all the matches were right.

73
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:03,041
Well, then as soon as you pick some set of four, you would have four

74
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,746
points that's correct and you would get the right homography.

75
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,716
What if none of the point matches were correct?

76
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:10,800
Well, then you could be there all day and

77
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,954
you're never going to get four that match.

78
00:04:12,954 --> 00:04:17,791
In between those is that there's some percentage of points that are not correct.

79
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,844
So if the ones that are correct are called inliers,

80
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:22,196
what do you thing the ones that are not correct are called?

81
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:23,365
>> Outliers.

82
00:04:23,365 --> 00:04:24,732
>> Outliers.

83
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:30,197
So the question is for a given percentage of bad points, for

84
00:04:30,197 --> 00:04:32,506
a given outlier ratio E.

85
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,808
So let's, E is 20, is 20%.

86
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:37,445
Means that 20% of your points are bad.

87
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:41,050
For a given ratio, how many samples do we have to check?
