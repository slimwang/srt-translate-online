1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,280
All right, you're done.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,740
Let's take a look at my solution.

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:09,250
We start by adding a string that we're
going to display when the list is empty.

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,820
For now, we're just going to
make this a generic string,

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,180
just to inform the user that
we don't have weather data.

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,880
Next, we'll create a layout to be
displayed when the list is empty.

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,060
The TextView can just be added to
the FrameLayout that is currently in

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,830
the main fragment layout.

9
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,220
Since we will either be displaying it,
or the list content.

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,600
For consistency, we specify
the padding using the dimensions we've

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,980
already defined in Sunshine.

12
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,250
Finally, we need to tell the list
view that we have a layout for

13
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,690
it to display when it is empty.

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,790
We'll add it inside of onCreateView
right before we set the adapter,

15
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:46,890
and that's it.

16
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,340
We've made our app slightly more
friendly, but we can do more.

17
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,390
Let's test this to make sure
everything's working well.

18
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,840
We'll do this by uninstalling Sunshine,
putting the emulator in airplane mode,

19
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,420
and then launching.

20
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,300
So let's go to our emulator now.

21
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,700
We'll test this by first
uninstalling Sunshine.

22
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,310
Then we'll put the emulator
in airplane mode.

23
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,530
Now we'll launch the app, and
as you can see, we've an empty list.

24
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,420
Now when we leave airplane mode
our sync adaptor will run, and

25
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,350
bam, we get our list content again.

26
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,170
Getting out of schedule the way
network becomes available is

27
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,000
one reason sync adaptors are awesome.
