1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,400
If you collect more data you're going to
need more storage and processing power.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,170
Luckily, you can simply add more Nodes.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,200
It's super easy to do it on Ambari,
I'll show you how.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,840
Launch a new Node instance.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,480
Be sure to set the security rules
correctly with all the ports

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,109
open on the subnet.

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,070
Copy the internal host name when it is
up and running because you'll need that.

8
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:24,070
Go to the host page from the Ambari
dashboard, select Actions,

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,270
then Add New Hosts.

10
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,920
So, add the internal host name
of the new instance here.

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,290
And configure the rest
the same as before.

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,889
Here install the instance as a new
Data Node with the Node manager.

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,790
And all this the same and deploy it.

14
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,870
There we go, three Data Nodes
