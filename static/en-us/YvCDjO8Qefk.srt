1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,586
So here we're saying, password has six
characters, it must include an upper,

2
00:00:05,586 --> 00:00:09,149
lower letters, digits and
some special characters.

3
00:00:09,149 --> 00:00:10,647
We're adding those.

4
00:00:10,647 --> 00:00:13,805
Plus or semicolon or
something like that.

5
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:18,019
In the worst case, how many attempts
must a brute force method make to

6
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:21,444
determine a password when
its hash value is available?

7
00:00:21,444 --> 00:00:25,394
You have the hash value of the password,
you know the password is six

8
00:00:25,394 --> 00:00:29,070
characters long and
you know the structure of the passwords.

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,760
They can have upper, lowercase letters,
digits and some special characters.

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,870
So how many total such
passwords are possible that

11
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,780
we may have to try in the worst case?
