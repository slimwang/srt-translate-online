00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,394
This one's a compile time error. Let's see how this works in BlueJ. I'll make a

2
00:00:06,394 --> 00:00:12,725
program and I'll put this line into it. Now I compile it and it says, cannot

3
00:00:12,725 --> 00:00:18,195
find symbol, variable Hello. What do you think went wrong here? You can pause

4
00:00:18,195 --> 00:00:21,567
the video and try and think about it for a second if you want. How would you

5
00:00:21,567 --> 00:00:26,592
fix this error? The computer doesn't know what we mean by hello. And what we

6
00:00:26,592 --> 00:00:31,127
wanted was hello Sarah to be literal text. In order to do that we need the

7
00:00:31,127 --> 00:00:38,109
quatation marks. Let's see if it works now. Okay. Now there are no compile-time

8
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:43,439
errors. Let's try running it. Oops. It spelled my name wrong. There's no h in

9
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,985
my name. This would be considered a run-time error. This is a logic error, not

10
00:00:48,985 --> 00:00:50,479
a syntax error.
