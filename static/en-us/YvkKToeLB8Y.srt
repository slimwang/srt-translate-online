1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,025
So now we'll take a look and see if our

2
00:00:02,025 --> 00:00:05,130
changes got propagated to the API's Explorer. You may find that

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,130
you need to refresh the API's Explorer to get the latest

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,180
changes. So you drill down to the conference API and again

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,510
with the safe profile, look at the safe profile and

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,500
here you'll see now, here you'll see now, that we have

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,780
the request body property showing up or the request property field

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,360
showing up. If you click in it, and this is really

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,860
cool, you'll see the add a property menu. You

10
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,650
go ahead and click that to bring the menu up,

11
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,160
and it'll show you the properties that you're allowed to

12
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,120
add. So we're going to add a display name. Let's say

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,020
we'll se it to Lauren. Now we're going to go

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,200
ahead and add another property, we'll add a T-shirt size.

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,110
Set that to M for medium and we execute it

16
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,400
and you see the request that got sent? The display

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,350
name was Lauren, T-shirt size M and we also

18
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,720
see the response. Which is the profile that got

19
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,818
created. The display name is Lauren, T-shirt size is

20
00:00:59,818 --> 00:01:02,480
M. So these are the same fields that are defined

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,890
in the profile form class. Which is the input

22
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,200
of the parameter to the save profile method. So hopefully

23
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,000
you've learned how you can restrict the input to

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,120
the, API by passing the argument in the API function.

25
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,320
Now it's your turn to update the save

26
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,350
profile function in conference API to take the profile

27
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:28,558
form param as an input argument. You'll be implementing

28
00:01:28,558 --> 00:01:32,280
the code marked with TODO1, look for the one.

29
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,040
The method has a couple different places where

30
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,960
you'll need to be adding code, but this time

31
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,340
we're just doing the places marked TODO1. Go ahead

32
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,480
and add the profile form argument to the save

33
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,820
profile method in the conference API class. And

34
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,905
go ahead and do the other sections marked

35
00:01:48,905 --> 00:01:51,760
TODO1 to get the arguments out of the

36
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,290
profile form argument that gets passed in. When

37
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,670
you've made your changes, run your app on

38
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:01,540
localhost and visit it in API's Explorer, and

39
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,010
then go ahead and explore. See what happens

40
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,832
when you execute the save conference function. Try executing

41
00:02:07,832 --> 00:02:10,257
it with and without providing the display

42
00:02:10,257 --> 00:02:12,770
name and the T-shirt size parameters. When

43
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:16,810
you've tested it out on localhost and it's working like you think it should,

44
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,910
go ahead and deploy your app to app spot. And when you're ready you

45
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:25,950
can enter your app ID here and press submit so Udacity can test your code.
