At this point, we've seen how to create
a data model, data model objects,

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,830
how to instantiate those objects,
and how to search through them.

00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,750
But there's still a lot more to be done.

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:14,850
>> Such yeah, like actually save them.

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,670
Continue on to the next lesson to
implement core data persistence.
