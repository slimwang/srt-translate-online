1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,500
If I look at the value for me as A, between cooperating and defecting

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,080
in this first column. It's minus one versus zero, right? Which number is bigger?

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,150
>> [LAUGH], zero.

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:11,900
>> Right.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,500
>> If I look at it in this column,

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,810
it's minus 9 or minus 6. Which number's bigger?

7
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:17,920
>> Negative six.

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,060
>> Right. In both cases, defecting is better

9
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,750
than cooperating. So in fact this choice, this strategy,

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,300
dominates the other. In other words it is always better for me to defect than

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,020
cooperate. So I will never cooperate, ever.

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,760
Because it's always better for me to defect.

13
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,770
>> So fine. So I'll never cooperate ever. That'll show you.

14
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,467
>> By exactly the same argument, minus

15
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:43,512
one versus zero, minus nine versus minus

16
00:00:43,512 --> 00:00:46,420
six. Defecting is always better. B will

17
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,080
never cooperate. What's the only thing that's left?

18
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:49,930
>> Pain.

19
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:54,090
>> Pain. This is called the Prisoner's Dilemma.

20
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,670
>> Huh. You said it was simple, but it seems kind of evil.

21
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,700
>> I didn't say it wasn't evil. Those

22
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,920
things aren't opposite of one another. It's not like

23
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,040
perfect versus hidden. Or pure versus mixed. It's

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,930
not easy versus evil [LAUGH]. Evil's often actually easier.

25
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,000
>> It's easy and evil.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,060
>> So we're in a little depressing place

27
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,180
here, Michael. You claimed in the beginning, and

28
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,570
I agreed with you, that this is sort of the best option,

29
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,290
you want everyone to cooperate, because that's sort of what's best for the

30
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:26,830
group. But because defecting dominates cooperating both for A and B you're going

31
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,130
to end up here. At least if you reason about it that way.

32
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,550
>> Yeah, I see that.

33
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,360
>> Hence prisoner's dilemma. The only way

34
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,210
to break this is if somehow we could

35
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,120
communicate and collude with one another. So

36
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,370
that we could guarantee that we would both

37
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,780
choose to cooperate at the same time.

38
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,700
>> So that wall? What about that wall? What if

39
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,050
you put a like a Skype connection or a Google hangout?

40
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,980
>> Well, if you were forced to say what you were going to say at the same

41
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,270
time, or somehow be able to punish someone

42
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,800
maybe for, you know not doing the right thing,

43
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,750
then you might be able to make a

44
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,240
different decision. But for this very simple version where

45
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,390
I'm going to do it once, even if I could hear what you had to say, if one

46
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,820
of us, whichever one of us went first, the second

47
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,490
one would always be able to take advantage of that.

48
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,790
>> I do find this kind of depressing.

49
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,240
>> Yes, it's a dilemma. It's a true dilemma. So, this brings us to a more

50
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,530
general sort of strategy. This whole notion of

51
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,850
strict dominance, works in this case. But, you could

52
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,120
imagine very complicated large matrces where it may

53
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,360
not work. But it turns out there's a

54
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,880
generalization of this notion of dominance. That works

55
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,150
remarkably well. And that's what people tend to use

56
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,250
to try to solve these kinds of games, to find out what the

57
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,850
true value of a game is. So letme describe that for you, ok?

58
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:38,910
>> Okay.
