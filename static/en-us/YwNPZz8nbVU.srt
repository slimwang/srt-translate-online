1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,188
So I'm going to show you how I build out
my model to determine those two answers.

2
00:00:05,188 --> 00:00:09,225
We've already built out how to connect
to the hotel loyalty data using

3
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:13,468
the select tool and the create samples
tool but let me build out logistical

4
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:18,006
regression the step wise tool and then
show you how I interpreted the results.

5
00:00:18,006 --> 00:00:22,988
The first thing I want to do is bring
out the logistic regression yet again

6
00:00:22,988 --> 00:00:29,080
and we'll call this whatever we really
want to but I'll call it quiz logistic.

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,970
And then I'm going to select my
target field and the redeemer field.

8
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,470
And then choose all of my different
possible predicted variables,

9
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:42,300
not including the customer key, first
name, last name, and redeemer fields.

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,980
After this instead of bringing out
a browse after the logistic regression,

11
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,530
I'm going to pump this right
into the step wise tool.

12
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:55,530
I'm going to name this
model quiz _stepwise.

13
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,850
Then I'm going to keep both
the search direction and

14
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:03,530
the adjusted fit measure by default and
lastly, let me go out and

15
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,770
browse these results and
run the workflow.

16
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,450
Now looking at these results,

17
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,800
we can answer the two different
questions I asked you in the quiz.

18
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,630
The first one is which variables did
we actually remove from our logistic

19
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,070
regression model?

20
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:23,210
And as you can see, the customer segment
field income, years of loyalty and

21
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:27,860
income you we're all removed from
our logistic regression model

22
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,770
by our step wise tool.

23
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:34,063
And as you can see,
our R squared value is 0.6096.

24
00:01:34,063 --> 00:01:37,546
So that's how I looked at the different
results from our step wise

25
00:01:37,546 --> 00:01:38,570
regression tool.
