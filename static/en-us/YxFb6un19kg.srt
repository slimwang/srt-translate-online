00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,197
Now we want to figure out how many columns there are in each row, and the land

2
00:00:03,197 --> 00:00:07,112
is 1900 meters wide. But it looks like depending on where we cut this off, some

3
00:00:07,112 --> 00:00:11,385
of the rows might have different lengths than others. I've done a little math

4
00:00:11,385 --> 00:00:15,977
for you here. This first field in the second row starts 400 meters away from

5
00:00:15,977 --> 00:00:20,655
this edge. Let's give names to these two different kinds of rows. The first and

6
00:00:20,655 --> 00:00:25,379
third are odd rows. The second and fourth and so on would be even rows. How

7
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:29,729
many columns are in each odd row? How many columns are in each even row?
