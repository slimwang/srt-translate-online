1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,580
Sometimes apps have no data to display.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,840
For example, there may be no new
messages in someone's email inbox, so

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,380
as developers we need to handle
this situation gracefully.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,280
Well designed apps will even try to
make the experience a little bit more

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,370
pleasant with say a cute graphic for
example.

6
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,000
Even better would be to fill the empty
space with some starter content or

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,610
advice on how to get started.

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,420
This will vary based on what's
appropriate for your app.

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,860
For now,
let's focus on a very simple Empty State

10
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,110
that clearly communicates that
there were no earthquakes found.

11
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,690
This is much better then
having a blank screen.

12
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,360
Now, you're welcome to expand on
this and make the Empty State more

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,640
sophisticated in the future,
but the question of whether or

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,010
not the USGS web server will ever return
zero earthquakes, is a different story.

15
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,560
And in any case, it's ideal for

16
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,380
our app to contain logic to handle
the scenario if it ever happens.

17
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,610
Fortunately, the Android framework team
already expected that this would be

18
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,290
a commonly used case.

19
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,970
So they exposed a way for
developers to set an Empty View for

20
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:02,240
a ListView which will only be displayed
whenever there's no data on the list,

21
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,940
meaning the adapter's dataset is empty.

22
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,180
In this coding task,

23
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,260
you're going to implement this
behavior in the Quake Report App.

24
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,170
The first thing you should
do is modify the xml layout

25
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,460
to the earthquake activity to have
a view group that contains two children,

26
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,980
the ListView and
the TextView for the empty view.

27
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,900
Now, the Empty View and the ListView
should be sibling within the parent

28
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,748
view group,
both siblings should overlap.

29
00:01:26,748 --> 00:01:29,540
And the ListView should take up
the full height and width of the screen

30
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,720
while the TextView should be
centered within the full screen.

31
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,490
Once you've updated the layout,
next I want you to modify

32
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,720
the EarthquakeActivity java class, so
that in the on create method, you set

33
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,410
the Empty View method on the ListView
object, and pass in the Empty View.

34
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,160
Here's the documentation for
the setEmptyView method.

35
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,070
What's its said when there
are no items in the list,

36
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,390
the entry framework will hide the list
view and make this EmptyView visible.

37
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,150
If there are items, however,
the ListView will be made visible and

38
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,150
this EmptyView will be hidden.

39
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,150
All these changes and view visibility
are automatically handle for

40
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,480
you which is pretty sweet.

41
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,139
One more caveat I want to point out is
that when you first launch the app,

42
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:12,060
there is data yet
because we haven't finished loading it.

43
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,170
To avoid having the no earthquakes
found message blink on the screen

44
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,182
briefly while the data is being loaded
for the first time, only assign

45
00:02:18,182 --> 00:02:23,290
the text in the empty state TextView
after the first load is completed.

46
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,020
So here, in the onLoadFinished method.

47
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,070
Now, can you think of a way to
verify that the Empty View works?

48
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,350
Here's a little hint.

49
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,820
You want to temporarily
comment out some code.

50
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,010
Check these boxes when you're done.

51
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,200
Then you can try the bonus challenge.

52
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,379
Do you know of an Android app that
tries to make the empty state

53
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,210
be a pleasant user experience?

54
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,880
