1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,710
You're going to be learning
a lot about different rules for

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:06,810
performance in this course, but it's
important to keep a few things in mind.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,910
First off, the tools that you'll be
learning are way more important than

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,190
the rules that you'll be learning.

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,900
Rules are helpful, but
they change over time.

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,660
It's much more important that you become
comfortable with the tools at your

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,520
disposal because they'll provide
the real insight into your app's

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,730
performance.

9
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,790
Along the same lines,
numbers change and bugs get fixed.

10
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,189
In fact, the numbers change part
even happened to us while we were

11
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:33,670
working on this course.

12
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,650
There's a quiz in the fifth lesson
where we ask about CSS selectors and

13
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,450
we mentioned that one of them is one
hundred times slower than the others.

14
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,630
The reason it was slower,
we found out, was a bug.

15
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,130
In fact, as we were working on this
course, the developers working on

16
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:52,640
Blink and WebKit actually fixed the bug,
and our comment was no longer true.

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,450
What this experience really
reinforced for me is that it is so

18
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:59,300
important to focus on the tools
not the rules, themselves.

19
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,290
Understanding the tools allows you to
measure first and measure often, and

20
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:06,130
measurements are the key to
understanding performance.

21
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,970
You should measure to understand what
performance issues you're actually

22
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,280
facing, and then later you should
keep measuring to decide whether or

23
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,570
not your changes
are actually fixing them.

24
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,870
So remember, focus on the tools,
not the rules.
