If we want to add log base 10 of 2, and log base 10 of 5. Then we're going to

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,945
get log base 10 of 10. Since we need to multiply 2 and 5, just like the product

3
00:00:09,945 --> 00:00:15,520
property says. However, we know that log base 10 of 10 is just equal to 1.

Pretty cool, huh? 1 is definitely a lot simpler than all of this.
