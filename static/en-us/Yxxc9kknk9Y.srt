00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,380
The only correct answer is Virtual Box,
but let's talk about why.

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:10,520
First you must recognize that the goals
of the system or platform virtualization

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:14,460
are different than what's intended
by the 'ava Virtual Machine or

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,950
hardware emulator,
as in the case of Virtual GameBoy.

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,770
Remember that according to Popek and
Goldberg,

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:25,440
a virtual machine is an efficient
isolated duplicate of the real machine.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,460
GDM is a language run time which
provides system services and

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,470
portability to Java applications,

9
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:36,670
that it is very different than
the underlying physical machine.

10
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,440
Also, emulators like virtual GameBoy,

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,590
they emulate some hardware platform,
the GameBoy platform, but again,

12
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,790
this is very different than the hardware
platform where this emulator is running.

13
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:52,950
With system virtualization, this is,
in the case of Virtual Box,

14
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:57,960
the physical hardware that's visible
to the virtual machine is identical,

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,460
or at least very, very similar,
to the physical platform

16
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,150
that actually is supporting
the execution of the virtual box, yes.
