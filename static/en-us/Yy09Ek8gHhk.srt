1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,380
The techniques and behavior patterns
of intruders are constantly shifting

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:10,280
in order to exploit newly discovered
weaknesses, and to evade detection and

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,160
counter measures.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,880
However, intruders typically use steps
from a common attack methodology.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,230
Here are the common attack steps.

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,410
The first step is target acquisition and
information gathering.

7
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:29,502
That is, the attacker identifies
the target systems using publicly

8
00:00:29,502 --> 00:00:34,330
available information,
both technical and non-technical and

9
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,944
use network tools to
analyze target resources.

10
00:00:37,944 --> 00:00:41,934
For example, the attackers can
find out what network services

11
00:00:41,934 --> 00:00:44,820
are accessible from the Internet.

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,700
And the attacker may find
out some email accounts

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,900
of high level company executives.

14
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,340
The second step is initial access.

15
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,270
This is accomplished by exploiting
a remote network vulnerability.

16
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:01,240
For example, a network service has
a buffer overflow vulnerability that

17
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:06,302
allows a remote attack to take over
the service and gain access to a system.

18
00:01:06,302 --> 00:01:11,293
Or this can be accomplished by social
engineering, whereby, for example,

19
00:01:11,293 --> 00:01:15,976
an attacker can send an email to a
company executive with an attachment so

20
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:21,730
that when the attachment is clicked,
a malware is installed on the system.

21
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,260
The third step is privilege escalation.

22
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,852
This is taken after the initial access.

23
00:01:27,852 --> 00:01:33,436
And the attacker would try to use local
exploit to escalate the privilege from,

24
00:01:33,436 --> 00:01:39,130
for example, the normal user to root
privilege on the target system.

25
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:43,660
The fourth step is information
gathering or system exploit.

26
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:49,340
That is, after an attacker has gained
sufficient privilege on a system,

27
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,310
he can then find out more about
the network and the organization.

28
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,661
And even move to another target system
to further the exploit on the network.

29
00:01:58,661 --> 00:02:01,400
The fifth step is maintaining access.

30
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,980
This is important because an attack
may not be a one-time action.

31
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,960
That is, the attacker may choose
to come back from time to time, or

32
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,770
continue the exploit for awhile.

33
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:16,900
Therefore, the attacker may install
backdoors or other malicious software on

34
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,930
a target system so that he can
continue to access this target system.

35
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,950
Lastly, the attacked wants
to cover his tracks.

36
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,560
For example, the attacker can disable or

37
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,380
even edit the system audit logs to
remove evidence of attack activities.

38
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,270
Or the attacker may install root
kits to hide the installed malware.
