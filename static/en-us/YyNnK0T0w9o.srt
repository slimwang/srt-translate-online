1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,460
So, here's our x-y coordinate system and let's just forget about z for now.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:09,666
Let's start with a normalized vector 1,0 pointing along the x-axis. If I draw a

3
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:17,505
normalized vector here at 0.8,0.6, the dot product between these two vectors is

4
00:00:17,505 --> 00:00:24,993
simply the x component, 0.8, with the vector 0.707,0.707, a 45-degree angle

5
00:00:24,993 --> 00:00:31,692
here. The dot product is again, the x component, 0.707, with the vector of

6
00:00:31,692 --> 00:00:37,868
0.6,0.8, the x component is 6, and that's the dot product. It's always the x

7
00:00:37,868 --> 00:00:42,754
component. Continuing on with the vector 0,1, the dot product between this

8
00:00:42,754 --> 00:00:47,476
vector and this vector is 0. Vectors at right angles to each other always have a

9
00:00:47,476 --> 00:00:51,283
dot product of 0. If you work your way around with more vectors, you'll form a

10
00:00:51,283 --> 00:00:56,475
circle. As you may recall from Geometry, the cosine is often defined as the

11
00:00:56,475 --> 00:01:01,801
distance in x of a point on the circle. So, as this vector angle increases, the

12
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:06,715
cosine of this angle is computed by taking the dot product. I've known this fact

13
00:01:06,715 --> 00:01:10,940
for 30 years, but it's still slightly magical to me that taking a dot product of

14
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,360
two normalized vectors, which just multiplies and adds them together, gives you

15
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,286
a trigonometric function. If you're still not convinced, what you can do is plot

16
00:01:19,286 --> 00:01:23,163
out the various angles and what dot product you get out of them. And you'll see,

17
00:01:23,163 --> 00:01:27,309
you actually get a cosine curve. So, here are two normalized vectors. When you

18
00:01:27,309 --> 00:01:31,664
take the dot product geometrically, what is happening is that one normalized

19
00:01:31,664 --> 00:01:36,342
vector is being projected onto the other. That is, the dot product shows how far

20
00:01:36,342 --> 00:01:41,779
one vector extends with respect to some given vector. So, for 0.6,0.8, the

21
00:01:41,779 --> 00:01:48,526
vector extends 0.6 along our initial vector. Another way to say this is that one

22
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:53,095
vector projects onto the other vector to give this distance. This works both

23
00:01:53,095 --> 00:01:57,424
ways. Our initial vector can also be projected on to the second vector and get

24
00:01:57,424 --> 00:02:01,168
you the same length, 0.6. In other words, the dot product operation is

25
00:02:01,168 --> 00:02:05,849
commutative. A dot B gives the same answer as B dot A. Projecting one way gives

26
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:09,268
the same answer as projecting the other. That's it in a nut shell. The dot

27
00:02:09,268 --> 00:02:13,452
product projects one vector onto another vector. If both vectors are normalized,

28
00:02:13,452 --> 00:02:17,019
the dot product gives the cosine between them. We'll see in the next unit on

29
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:21,305
transforms, what happens when one or both vectors are not normalized. For

30
00:02:21,305 --> 00:02:24,880
computing the shade of the material, however, we have the tool that we need, so

31
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,543
let's use it.
