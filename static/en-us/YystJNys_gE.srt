1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
To compute the total harvest is simply take care of by how much it changes in the current step

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
then add this to the total amount.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This is the result and you can see that there is not a single combination of start and end time,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
but rather a line of combinations, all of which work similarly well.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So if you transform this 2-dimensional view into a 3-dimensional view, it would look like

6
00:00:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
the reach of a mountain, not a single peak of a mountain.
