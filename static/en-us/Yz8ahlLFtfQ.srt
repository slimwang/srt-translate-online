1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
So, in order that you save a little time compared to Alice, Bob, and Carol,

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,820
our first quiz this unit is going to be what should you do when you can't find

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,110
and polynomial time algorithm for some important problem that you're working on.

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,660
Here are your options when you can't find a polynomial time algorithm

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,180
for a problem you're working on.

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,890
You can do some research on the problem.

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,620
You can try to show that your problem is NP complete.

8
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,790
You can give up right away.

9
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,050
You can discuss the problem with friends and possibly also experts

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:34,140
if they are available to you, and you might also think about settling for a suboptimal algorithm--

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,050
some algorithm that works but probably doesn't produce the best possible solution,

12
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,230
at least if the stakes aren't high.

13
00:00:41,230 --> 99:59:59,999
So, which of these options do you think could be recommended in general?
