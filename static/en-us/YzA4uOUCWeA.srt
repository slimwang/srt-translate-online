1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,080
So let's see if we can
work this through.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,000
In the case of gamma equals 1 and

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,330
probability of left is a half and
probability of right is a half.

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,430
Turns out it will be nice to solve for
the value function, so let's have

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,180
three variables that represent the value
function, one from each of those states.

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,138
From the z state, what happens?

7
00:00:18,138 --> 00:00:21,530
Well, with probability a half, we go
to the right, which ends up giving us

8
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,540
an immediate reward of 0 and then we get
a discounted value of being back in z.

9
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:30,390
>> Or with a half probability,
we go to the left and

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,200
we get a reward of 1 and we're done.

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,020
So z is two-thirds.

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,108
>> Yeah, so just boring old algebra.

13
00:00:36,108 --> 00:00:39,528
I see, you magically put one-half in
where gamma used to be because gamma is

14
00:00:39,528 --> 00:00:40,160
one-half.

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:40,980
That makes sense.

16
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,270
Okay, fair, fair enough.

17
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:42,936
>> I thought that would
make things easier.

18
00:00:42,936 --> 00:00:48,090
All right, so z is two-thirds,
and let's work out x and y.

19
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,430
>> Okay, so
I guess you will do a similar thing.

20
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,400
>> Yeah, so the value at x from x with
probability a half, we go to the left

21
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,530
which gets us a 0 reward, and then
a discounted value of being back in x.

22
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,704
Or with probability a half,
we get no reward, and

23
00:01:02,704 --> 00:01:05,436
then we have a discounted
value being in y.

24
00:01:05,436 --> 00:01:09,770
Meanwhile y, the value from y is,
well, with probability a half,

25
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,620
we get the discounted
value of being in x.

26
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,820
And with probability a half, we get
a value of 1, and then we're done.

27
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,998
>> That's two equations and
two unknowns.

28
00:01:17,998 --> 00:01:19,660
>> Yes, linear equations.

29
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,350
>> That's even better.

30
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,240
>> So convenient.

31
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:21,780
>> Cool.
>> And

32
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,690
some normal algebra-ish
kind of things later,

33
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:29,670
I have x is two-elevenths and
y is six-elevenths, better to be in y.

34
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,663
So when we average our discounted
expected reward from each of

35
00:01:33,663 --> 00:01:38,574
these possible starting states, we get
a third of this and a third of that and

36
00:01:38,574 --> 00:01:43,505
a third or 0.4646 as our value for
taking this stochastic policy.

37
00:01:43,505 --> 00:01:45,840
>> That's not even 50/50, ha.

38
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,769
>> [LAUGH] Okay, and
we said that we could do better.

39
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:51,751
So, we said we could do better by
choosing probability of left to

40
00:01:51,751 --> 00:01:55,940
be a third and probability of
right being two-thirds, right?

41
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,530
>> Yeah.
>> All right, so

42
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,140
let's see if that actually
gives us a better number.

43
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,060
>> Okay.
>> So we need to work out

44
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,910
what the value of z is in this case
where we're going two-thirds, one-third.

45
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,460
So once we solve through for
z we find out that z is a half.

46
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,550
Before, z was two-thirds and so we
actually are doing worse in this state

47
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,300
because we're spending more of our time
bashing against the wall to the right.

48
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,110
>> Yeah, that's cool.

49
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,860
>> And we're going to write down what
happens from these other two states.

50
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,442
So the value at x which simplifies to 5x
= 2y, and the value of y, because again

51
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:27,460
we're going to go to the left one-third
of the time, getting us the value at x.

52
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,924
And we're going to go to the right
two-thirds of the time getting us our

53
00:02:30,924 --> 00:02:31,590
value of 1.

54
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,430
All right, so

55
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:37,337
once we solve all that through, we get y
is five-sevenths and x is two-sevenths.

56
00:02:37,337 --> 00:02:40,822
And so when we averaged these
three values out, we actually get

57
00:02:40,822 --> 00:02:44,897
a half which is a little surprising to
me that those 7s kind of cancel out,

58
00:02:44,897 --> 00:02:49,463
but a half is bigger than 0.464646,
so we actually have a better policy.

59
00:02:49,463 --> 00:02:52,144
>> Right, and
coincidentally it does give us 50/50.

60
00:02:52,144 --> 00:02:53,468
>> What do you mean it gives us 50\50?

61
00:02:53,468 --> 00:02:56,428
>> Well, you said you wanted to do
better than 50/50, 0.5 that's 50/50.

62
00:02:56,428 --> 00:02:56,963
>> No, no, no.

63
00:02:56,963 --> 00:03:01,887
The 50/50 policy which gets us 0.464646,
we did better than that policy by trying

64
00:03:01,887 --> 00:03:04,360
a different policy
that actually gets 0.5.

65
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,828
>> I know Michael,
I was using word play.

66
00:03:07,828 --> 00:03:08,768
>> Brilliant.
>> Thank you, so

67
00:03:08,768 --> 00:03:11,752
I suppose using all of that algebra,
we could actually figure out what

68
00:03:11,752 --> 00:03:14,710
the optimal numbers are if they
aren't one-third, two-thirds.

69
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:18,595
Maybe they are,
just by replacing all the one-thirds and

70
00:03:18,595 --> 00:03:20,901
the two-thirds with P and 1- P.

71
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:21,945
Then we'd figure out what P is.

72
00:03:21,945 --> 00:03:22,675
>> Yeah.

73
00:03:22,675 --> 00:03:25,585
>> And I'm sure that would
be a wonderful exercise for

74
00:03:25,585 --> 00:03:26,447
the students to do.

75
00:03:26,447 --> 00:03:27,805
>> All right so,
we'll leave it for that then.

76
00:03:27,805 --> 00:03:28,305
>> Excellent.
