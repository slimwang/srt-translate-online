00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,791
You've seen how many bacteria are left after one hour and after two hours but

2
00:00:03,791 --> 00:00:07,154
now I would like you to work out how many hours it will be before there are

3
00:00:07,154 --> 00:00:12,360
fewer than 5 bacteria left. Now, we haven't directly covered this but think

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,810
about different things you could do to get an approximate answer. This zoomed

5
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:21,160
in version of our graph might help you or maybe you could try another method.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,849
Also, please round your answer to the nearest hour.
