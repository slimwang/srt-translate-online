00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,870
Welcome to the course on jQuery.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:07,650
I'm excited to be able to take you through a quick tour of the jQuery library.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:12,180
Over 60% of the top 100,000 most visited websites take advantage of

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,700
jQuery's simple syntax and powerful DOM manipulation methods.

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,740
In this course, you'll experience firsthand why jQuery's so

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,760
popular as you explore the features that it has to offer.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,190
You'll start by breaking down how the jQuery library is built with

8
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,500
JavaScript and what that means for your code.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,770
Then you'll dive into jQuery selectors and DOM navigation methods.

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,040
This is probably the trickiest and most important part of learning jQuery.

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,660
But once you've mastered selectors, you'll be parsing the jQuery documentation

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,370
to write simple and straightforward DOM manipulation code.

13
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,825
There are a lot of quizzes in this course, so

14
00:00:48,825 --> 00:00:52,881
you'll have plenty of practice manipulating the DOM with jQuery as you go.

15
00:00:52,881 --> 00:00:54,160
Are you ready to get started?
