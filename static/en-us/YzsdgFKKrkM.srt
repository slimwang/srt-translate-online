1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,630
So let's take a look at our
responses to this exercise.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,680
So here are the first three questions.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,670
So in this first scenario,
with a travel app and items to pack for

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,010
traveling, most of the time when we're
dealing with some group of items that we

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,850
want to be able to read later, we'll
want to start with an array of strings.

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,230
So that's an easy way to
group bits of text and

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,890
would certainly work in this case.

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:25,190
So here, each item in the array could be
something like a toothbrush or pants and

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,630
these would be strings.

10
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,710
For a second scenario
with the YouTube app,

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,510
we'd like to store the number
of people who viewed a video.

12
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,530
So here in the situation since
we're hoping to store a number for

13
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,430
how many times a video is viewed
we can use an integer variable.

14
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,920
So in this scenario
with the Settings app.

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,270
We would like to store the languages
supported on Android device.

16
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,000
Here we're looking for
a group of items that can be read.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,120
So we should use an array of strings.

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,910
So here is each item would
be the name of a language.

19
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,150
So something like Japanese or Arabic.

20
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,940
Now in this fourth scenario with
the shopping app and storing whether

21
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,400
a product is in stock or not,
since we're hoping the store some yes or

22
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,599
no information we can use
a single boolean variable.

23
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,630
The value of the boolean would be
true if the product is in stock and

24
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:08,670
false if it's not.

25
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,530
Now for the fifth scenario of
the lottery app and we'd like to store

26
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,130
the winning combination of 5 numbers for
a single round of the lottery.

27
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:15,810
Since we're looking for

28
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,180
a group of numbers we want to
use an array of integers.

29
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,042
So in this case since there are 5
numbers in the winning combination,

30
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:24,818
the array would be of length 5.

31
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:28,242
Now in this last case of the health
tracking app and storing the number of

32
00:01:28,242 --> 00:01:31,040
miles or kilometers walked for
each day this week.

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,500
In this case we're dealing
with a group of numbers.

34
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,350
So again we want to use an array.

35
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,060
So it's likely that we'll be
dealing with non-integer numbers.

36
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,920
Now because of that we should use
an array of floats or doubles.

37
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,740
So data types that allow for decimals.
