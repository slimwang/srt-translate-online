00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,984
We've discussed everything you need to
know about creating notifications and

2
00:00:03,984 --> 00:00:05,080
apps for Android Wear.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,240
But one thing we haven't
discussed until now,

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,260
is how to show the time to the user.

5
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,650
Well, watch faces are such
an important feature of Android Wear

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,175
that we have a whole
lesson dedicated to it.

7
00:00:14,175 --> 00:00:16,930
What's an Android Wear watch face?

8
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,890
A watch face is what's shown
when the screen is on, and

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,180
no other apps are running.

10
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,290
It's what you'll spend
the most time looking at.

11
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,570
And the first thing that others will
see, when they glance at your watch.

12
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,380
It's visible all the time, so you can
discreetly glance at the watch face,

13
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,700
without touching or
activating the device.

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,700
it goes without saying that
a watch face should show the time.

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,860
Watch faces can also be a highly
functional way to share concise,

16
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,180
timely information.

17
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:45,000
For example, a watch face can show
your next upcoming calendar event, or

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,370
the weather, or
the current price of a stock.

19
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,830
Watch faces are also
a personal statement of style.

20
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,010
We like to say that Android Wear
lets you wear what you want, and

21
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,970
no where is that more
true than a watch face.

22
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,470
The design guidelines we discussed for

23
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:01,500
wear are a framework on which to build
your creations, giving you room and

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,239
support for creative expression and
artistic freedom.
