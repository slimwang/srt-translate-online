1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,050
So now, I want us to start looking deeper.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,090
And start looking at these images and

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,520
start seeing what are the numeric values at each and every pixel.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,100
And what in different may, ways, what representation do they have?

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,890
And how can you actually start doing these simple types of computations on it?

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,810
Here I'm showing a simple image of the mandrill image, the original image here.

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,630
And to help us kind of look into it,

8
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,830
I'm going to actually start zooming into it very closely.

9
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:31,150
And start showing you exactly the details that actually would be seen if you

10
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,180
were actually that close up to that image, but

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,930
also start showing you the numerical values associated with an image like this.

12
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:42,280
So here you note, I've actually put a small red box inside this image.

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,370
This is a small red box about, eight pixels by eight pixels or

14
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,830
something like that.

15
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,900
again, I'm showing you pictorial representations of it.

16
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,490
Look at it more of an exercise of looking at how these types of images, and

17
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:01,110
what kind of information that we have in these images, less of the exact values.

18
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:05,099
This is just now me showing a zoomed in version with the red region is.

19
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,740
The next one I'll show you exactly what the red region looks like,

20
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,960
namely this one.

21
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,390
Now if you notice here there is a lot of white area and

22
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:18,090
a little bit of a grayish area and kind of a, a dividing line between them,

23
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,370
which is kind of where you would see the details of this.

24
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,750
And you can see this in much more closeup here now.

25
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:27,640
Of course, what you also should be seeing if the your display supports it,

26
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,730
a little bit of blockiness in generated pixel.

27
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,720
Again, because these are pixels that we have zoomed in and

28
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,400
gotten really close to.

29
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,580
If i had some magic, and

30
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,768
of course I do when I actually look at it computationally.

31
00:01:38,768 --> 00:01:41,610
I would been able to look at this image and not actually be able to look at

32
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,780
this image but the values that exist in each and every pixel.

33
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,590
Let me zoom into exactly the level of the red pixel region that we have.

34
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,434
And now if you notice, you should be seeing some numbers.

35
00:01:51,434 --> 00:01:55,641
And you notice the numbers are like 159, 168 and

36
00:01:55,641 --> 00:01:59,317
then lower numbers like 131, 132 here.

37
00:01:59,317 --> 00:02:03,266
And approximately there is a little bit of a you know, the same kind of

38
00:02:03,266 --> 00:02:07,490
thing here, where I have white values and a little bit of more gray values.

39
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,240
Now again, this is just simply a pictorial way of looking at it.

40
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,930
These numbers are not exact, even though I've attempted to match it as

41
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,150
closely as possible to this sub image here.

42
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,940
A couple of things we can start doing now.

43
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,960
And that is, start looking at this image a little bit more carefully and

44
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:25,810
see what we can learn about different intensities and different directions.

45
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,930
So here what I've done is, I've actually now drawn a line.

46
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:36,310
Basically what I've done is remembering these are our different columns,

47
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,300
and in this there are different rows.

48
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,360
I found one row, I've drawn this, and

49
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,560
I've actually drawn a plot, of the values at that slice.

50
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,825
And if you now traverse it, so

51
00:02:46,825 --> 00:02:49,658
I'm going to start kind of moving it from this way, and if you notice,

52
00:02:49,658 --> 00:02:52,997
there are lots of darker values, of course, there is a lot of change going on,

53
00:02:52,997 --> 00:02:56,354
and all of a sudden, when you come up here, there's a lot more higher values.

54
00:02:56,354 --> 00:03:01,196
Remember, that lower values kind of designate more of the darker shades of

55
00:03:01,196 --> 00:03:02,352
gray or black, and

56
00:03:02,352 --> 00:03:07,290
the brighter values are much more lighter shades of gray towards white.

57
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,100
So white comes in, and here again you see a little bit of change, but now this

58
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,810
actually starts telling us a lot more about this image, just for that one slice.

59
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,940
I also wanted to show that the same slicing can be done in the y axis.

60
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:24,810
So, here, for example, we have looked at the one row, just one row.

61
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,460
And if you look at it again, the same kind of stuff if you come in from the top

62
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,670
there's a lot of kind of various dark values.

63
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,240
All of a sudden we see a lot more white values.

64
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,360
And again, coming down to a lot more gray values.

65
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,330
So this basically now starts saying we can start looking at these numbers.

66
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,480
Even though the image is shown to us in this form or

67
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,870
this form, there are, underneath it, these values.

68
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,730
And these are extremely important values for us, and

69
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:53,520
we can actually kind of start doing various types of visualizations of this, and

70
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,000
these basically are just looking at the slices.

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,400
So looking at this now, you should be seeing that basically we've kind of

72
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,310
looked at an image, been able to visualize it x and y slices.

73
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,450
This should start suggesting, and especially looking at this this is basically.

74
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:12,070
This is a two-dimensional representation where each and

75
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:16,930
every point is basically a pixel, which has its own intensity value.

76
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,420
So the best way to represent this would be a matrix.

77
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,470
This already kind of looks like a matrix.

78
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,200
It's a two dimensional array.

79
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,960
And each and every element of this matrix is a pixel and

80
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,260
the value of that is basically the intensity value there.

81
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,830
So an image can be therefore represented as a matrix.

82
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:38,840
And the variance of all the vary, the values vary from zero, which is for

83
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,540
black, to 255 which is white.

84
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,570
So this is a scale that goes from 255 to 0, 0 being pure black,

85
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:51,150
that is no pixel is actually now showing any intensity whatsoever.

86
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,360
And white, where the entire pixel is basically showing

87
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,370
the maximum intensity that is pure white.

88
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,890
Of course, anywhere in between would be different shades of gray
