1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,190
So now that we have talked about the
importance of isolation of user code and

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,010
the hardware support with
the process execution mode,

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,720
memory protection, and so on.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,670
I think it should be clear that
if you're the bad guy, and

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,090
I did say that the operating system
has the keys to the kingdom,

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,320
the best thing you can do is actually
compromise the operating system.

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,830
We said well if using user code,
it's hard for you to do that,

8
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:32,240
because if you tried to touch something
that belongs to the operating system,

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,120
the hardware is going to stop you.

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,539
So attackers actually have
been really creative,

11
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:42,360
because the operating system of the
trusted computing base being such a big

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,130
target, they have been really creative
in terms of how can they gain access

13
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,930
to the operating system and
the information that it keeps or

14
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,510
maintains to control
access to resources.

15
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:58,560
Now, I want you to explore these three
different options that we have here and

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,290
then we'll talk a little bit about them.
