00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,410
So if you look these up using your
favorite search engine or online

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:07,230
encyclopedia or other reference work,
these are the answers you should find.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,450
A CNAME record is what's used to make
an alias from one name to another.

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,940
And it actually stands for
canonical name.

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,370
It means that the canonical, or

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:19,350
official name for this name is actually
something else, it's an alias.

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,710
Now a quad A record is the IPv6
equivalent of an A record.

8
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,410
It's an address,
it's just an IPv6 address.

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,370
The name is kind of a joke since v6
addresses are four times longer than v4

10
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,120
addresses, that's how I
always think of this.

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,140
And lastly,
the NS record type is a DNS name server.

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,430
An NS record for
a particular domain says

13
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,360
what DNS servers have the records for
that domain.
