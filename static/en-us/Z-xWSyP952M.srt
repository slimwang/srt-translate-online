00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,683
Culture plays an important role in the foods to which we're exposed and

2
00:00:03,683 --> 00:00:09,034
therefore the foods that we eat. If you ever seen TV shows such as the Amazing

3
00:00:09,034 --> 00:00:12,382
Race or cooking competitions, you may have seen people cook foods that you

4
00:00:12,382 --> 00:00:18,556
normally wouldn't eat. For example, on one episode of the Amazing Race, the

5
00:00:18,556 --> 00:00:23,685
contestants had to eat frog Fallopian tubes. Now that was a delicacy for the

6
00:00:23,685 --> 00:00:28,213
people of that area, but it certainty wasn't so for the Americans. On cooking

7
00:00:28,213 --> 00:00:31,861
competition shows, I've seen people cook testicles, chicken feet, and even

8
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:36,782
brains. Now again, some people may find that a delicacy and actually enjoy the

9
00:00:36,782 --> 00:00:41,646
flavor and taste, but many of us would not. However, if you found yourself in a

10
00:00:41,646 --> 00:00:45,540
starving or near-starving situation, the chances of you eating those types of

11
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:51,035
food greatly increases. Now, we know that culture plays an important role in

12
00:00:51,035 --> 00:00:55,170
the types of food we eat. But did you know that culture also plays a role in

13
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,180
our attitudes toward casual sex? We're going to talk about that next.
