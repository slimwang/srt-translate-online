1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,740
Comparison among labels,
just look at a quick example.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:09,720
L1 is TS and itss compartment has
these three categories, A, B and C.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:15,119
L2 is secret with A, B and L3 is secret
also with B, C, D as their categories.

4
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:17,431
So does L1 dominate L2?

5
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:22,420
TS is dominate S and
A, B, C contains A, B.

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,690
So, we said that each,
for L1 to dominate L2,

7
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:30,750
the sensitivity level has to be greater,
which is the case,

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,120
and its compartment has to contain the
compartment of L2, which is the case.

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,820
So this is, yes.

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,700
Does L2 is less than L1?

11
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,970
Yes, the same reasoning we did.

12
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,690
It's less because this is less than
TS and this is containing that.

13
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,220
How about L1 and L3?

14
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,300
As we know, TS is higher than S.

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,970
So when you look at the first part,
just the sensitivity level,

16
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,690
that's the total orders, so
this is greater than this.

17
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,045
But B, C, D is not contained in A,
B, C, okay?

18
00:01:00,045 --> 00:01:03,342
So there's this element D
that's not contained here and

19
00:01:03,342 --> 00:01:07,264
because this is not contained here
then L1 is not greater than L3.

20
00:01:07,264 --> 00:01:11,232
Similarly, L3 is not greater than L1,
and the two are not equal because

21
00:01:11,232 --> 00:01:15,172
the compartments are different and
the sensitude level is different.

22
00:01:15,172 --> 00:01:18,430
So, when neither one dominates
the other one and they are not equal,

23
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:22,060
then they can not be compared, which is
the third case that we're talking about.
