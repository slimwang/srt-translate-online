1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,330
That actually means that, and this was more important a little while ago,

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,610
but people still use it today.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,870
If I wanted to let's say, do a convolution of a function with some

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:15,950
really big mask, which is generally expensive operation, I actually could do it

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:19,690
a slightly different way, all right, and that's shown here, right.

6
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:25,850
Suppose I want, g to be f convolved with h, let's suppose f and h are both very

7
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:30,980
large things, so you remember convolution is ugly cause it's N squared M squared

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:36,720
where N is the size of the image N by N and M by M, well so what we can do is,

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:43,440
we could actually take the Fourier transform of F, and a Fourier transform of H.

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,800
And, there are fast ways of doing Fourier transform called the FFT for

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,580
fast Fourier transform which we won't talk about, but

12
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:56,310
I can do those Fourier transforms quickly then I can multiply,

13
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:00,070
those two Fourier transforms together to get the new Fourier transform, and

14
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:04,700
then I can do the inverse Fourier transform to get back the answer.

15
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,350
Like I said, this was really important when machines were slower,

16
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,680
these days people tend to work in the spacial domain, but even today,

17
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,410
if you have a large mask or some large function you're trying to convolve

18
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:18,300
against a large image, it's not uncommon to use the Fourier trick to do that.
