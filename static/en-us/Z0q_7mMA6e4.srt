1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, how did you solve the problem?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The naive or straightforward or brute force way of solving this problem

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
is to actually take all of these numbers, multiply them together, divide that answer by 5,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and see what the remainder is. If the remainder is 0, then it is divisible by 5.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Otherwise, it's not. But you would be very silly to go through that.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What you should do is realize that a product is going to be divisible by 5

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
if and only if one of the number that you're multiplying into the product is divisible by 5.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And a number is divisible by 5 if and only if its last digit is a 0 or a 5.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What you can do now, instead of actually doing any multiplying,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
you just scan your eyes down the columns here and notice that most of them are not 0s or 5s,

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
but if you're eagle-eyed, you would have noticed this.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
There's one number in there that's divisible by 5--945--

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and that's all it takes. The whole product is now going to be divisible by 5.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The answer we're looking for is yes. The product is divisible by 5. Ta da!
