2
00:00:14,026 --> 00:00:15,040
Welcome back.

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,150
I hope you enjoyed the previous lesson
on the common features of frameworks.

4
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,440
In many cases,
frameworks seem like magic.

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,110
I want to strip away
some of the magic so

6
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:28,670
that you'll better understand how your
code and framework code fit together.

7
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,870
In this lesson we'll be
diving into backbone and

8
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,170
the utility library underscore.

9
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,540
Backbone is a highly opinionated
framework in the NBC family.

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,260
It uses underscore for its templating,
and has its own event management and

11
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,640
routing systems.

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,800
We'll uncover how these features work.

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,400
I want you to follow along with
me in your own browser and

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,270
code editor this lesson.

15
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,960
I'll be doing the majority of my
work with the Chrome dev tools so

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,330
that I can take advantage
of break points.

17
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,660
It'll make it easier to open up
the frameworks internals and

18
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,120
get a clear idea of what's happening.

19
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,750
Keep in mind that the point of this
lesson is not to write backbone,

20
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,590
the goal is to demystify how
frameworks do things and

21
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:08,330
for you to realize that frameworks,
they're just JavaScript.

22
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,340
If you want to build backbone apps,
check the instructor notes for

23
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,890
a link to our learn backbone course.

24
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,080
So let's pop the hood and
see what templating has for us.
