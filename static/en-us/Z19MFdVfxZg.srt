1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,340
Now it's your turn to add the functionality to

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,360
create conferences, to your application. First though, you need to

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,130
copy over some files into your project. In the

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:13,240
lesson four folder, you'll find Conference.java, and you're going to need

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,800
to copy it into the domain package, in your

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,340
project. And you can just drag and drop it from

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,230
wherever you downloaded it, right into the domain package

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,260
in Eclipse. Also, go ahead and copy over the ConferenceForm.java

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,340
file and put it in the form

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:32,780
package. Conference.java and ConferenceForm.java files contain completed code,

11
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,630
but don't worry, we haven't done everything for

12
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,020
you. You're going to need to copy the skeleton

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,200
version of createConferences into the conference API class,

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,710
and it's going to be your job to finish

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,000
implementing, the createConference function. After you drag and

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,310
drop your files into Eclipse, you're going to

17
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,790
need to refresh your project. Go ahead and right-click on

18
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,050
the project name and then you choose Refresh, and then your

19
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,520
project will refresh, and it'll show the files that you just

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,460
copied over. If you forget to refresh it, you might not

21
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,519
see the files, and then you might be in a

22
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:08,880
panic where they are. So, remember to refresh. When you've copied

23
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,190
the files and the function into your project, go ahead and

24
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:17,270
have a look at the Conference.java file and the ConferenceForm.java. So

25
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,680
now, here's a quick question for

26
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,710
you. Does ConferenceForm have properties that map

27
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,381
to these properties in Conference? Does

28
00:01:24,381 --> 00:01:26,720
ConferenceForm have a property, that maps to

29
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,659
the name property in Conference? Does it have a property that maps to

30
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,970
the topics property in Conference? And so on. So, just check all that apply.
