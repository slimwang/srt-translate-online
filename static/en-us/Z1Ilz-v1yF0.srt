1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,740
Just like activity content transitions,

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:06,280
shared element transitions use
the same plumbing to power them.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,450
That is the transitions framework.

4
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:12,913
Let's go back to our photo grid example,
and add a shared element transition, so

5
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:16,539
that the selected photo transitions
smoothly between the grid and

6
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:18,540
the details page.

7
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,320
Here's what it's going to look like.

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,870
Hopefully you agree that this is a much
smoother, more continuous experience.

9
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,610
Now to build this, it helps to
understand a little bit about how

10
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,960
the system works under the hood.

11
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:35,020
When we say we're doing a shared element
transition between two activities,

12
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,650
we aren't actually sharing
any views in their hierarchy.

13
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,270
Each activity has
an independent view tree.

14
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:46,010
What we're doing, is passing
information about the shared view.

15
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,230
Such as, its position and
its size between the two.

16
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,420
When the second activity launches,
it sets a transparent background and

17
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,240
hides all of its own view so
that you can, so to speak,

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,190
see through to the previous
activity behind it.

19
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:04,560
It then locates the shared view
within its own hierarchy and

20
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,000
alters its attributes to match those
passed in from the launching activity

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,710
and makes that single view visible.

22
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,840
It then runs animations to transition
the shared view from this state

23
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,270
to its natural position in the layout.

24
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,030
As the transition progresses,
the window background and

25
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,730
the rest of the non-shared amids slowly
fade in until they're totally opaque.

26
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:30,180
So, while the views aren't technically
shared, it's clever trick of smoke and

27
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,250
mirrors as it were,
makes it appear that they are.

28
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,810
So now that we understand
how the process works,

29
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,300
let's take a look at how we mark
elements as being shared, and

30
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,221
how we control
the animations that are run.
