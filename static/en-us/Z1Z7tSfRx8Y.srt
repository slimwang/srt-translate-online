00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,140
As you can see, the spreadsheet table

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,939
corresponds to one object. Then, the columns represent

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:09,000
various fields on that object. And finally, the

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,500
rows relate to individual records of that object.
