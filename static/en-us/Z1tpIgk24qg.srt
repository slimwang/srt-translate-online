1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
All right. The answer in this case is actually a bit easier than in the previous example.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What happens here is put in some value a and b.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It turns out the running time doesn't depend on b--the number of steps doesn't depend on b--

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
but it does depend on a, and what happens is a gets assigned to x.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Then x gets counted down, so the number of times the body of this loop is executed

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
is exactly whatever a is, and there's two statements in the loop.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's going to be 2 times a--this statement, this statement, this statement, for a total of 3.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So 2a + 3 is the function that I was looking for.
