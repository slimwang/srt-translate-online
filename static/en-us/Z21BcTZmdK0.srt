1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,070
So now that I've got the pen back,

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,190
we're going to wrap this up by talking
about something we promised to talk

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,610
about at the end of the last class,
which is Mechanism Design.

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,240
>> Cool.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,470
>> Right, this seems reasonable right?

6
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,040
>> It's like mechanical engineering.

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,836
>> It is not like mechanical engineering
except in a very abstract and

8
00:00:16,836 --> 00:00:17,798
analogy sense.

9
00:00:17,798 --> 00:00:18,420
>> Okay.
>> So

10
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,990
what mechanism design is it's kind of
the art the science and engineering,

11
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,490
dare I say it, of creating games to
elicit certain kind of behavior.

12
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,045
So, so far what we've been talking
about with our solution concepts and

13
00:00:31,045 --> 00:00:34,422
all the things we be doing in game
theory one, two, and three so far,

14
00:00:34,422 --> 00:00:37,181
is we've talked about what
happens when we play games.

15
00:00:37,181 --> 00:00:41,100
And at least stepping back a little
bit what we get when we play games is

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,530
we get certain predictable behaviors and
those behaviors are natural.

17
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,404
They're natural equilibria or
maybe they're correlated equilibria or

18
00:00:49,404 --> 00:00:52,277
maybe they're cocoa whatever
you call equilibria and

19
00:00:52,277 --> 00:00:54,408
other things we haven't talked about.

20
00:00:54,408 --> 00:00:58,786
But here what we want to do in Mechanism
Design is we want to make a game so

21
00:00:58,786 --> 00:00:59,974
just play a game but

22
00:00:59,974 --> 00:01:04,280
again with the end goal of getting
some specific behaviors, okay?

23
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,019
Does it make sense?

24
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:07,970
>> It feels kind of like inverse
reinforcement learning in that we're

25
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:11,440
going from the behavior that we want
to a game that would make that behavior

26
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,040
whereas in regular game theory we
go from the game to the behavior.

27
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,389
>> Okay, I like that if I going to get
so much, I will draw the arrow that way.

28
00:01:19,389 --> 00:01:21,102
So here, we have a behavior we want and

29
00:01:21,102 --> 00:01:24,870
we're going to come up with a game that
would actually lead to that behavior.

30
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:25,520
I like that.

31
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,610
And then, once we've made a game, what
will happen is we'll get people to play

32
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,930
that game, and then that will
generate the right behavior.

33
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:31,590
>> Nice.

34
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,617
>> Okay cool, so
it's like a sort of cycle of life thing.

35
00:01:34,617 --> 00:01:38,165
>> [LAUGH] Yeah it's not
a cycle though but sure.

36
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:38,963
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Yeah, but

37
00:01:38,963 --> 00:01:40,608
I don't think that arrow means anything.

38
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:43,020
>> It means it's the identity function.

39
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,880
>> Lead to behaviors which
lead to a game, sure.

40
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,620
>> So there are lots of ways we could
talk about this but I think for

41
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,770
the purpose of this class, I think
the most interesting way to kind of get

42
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,030
across mechanisms design is
just to give a few examples.

43
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,450
So I'm going to give two, or
maybe three examples, and

44
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,050
sort of work through what is sort of
easy and hard about mechanism design.

45
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:05,737
I try to give you a feel for
why this is actually important and how,

46
00:02:05,737 --> 00:02:09,762
by making little sort of specific
decisions you can have a huge impact on

47
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,591
the behavior that people have.

48
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:15,374
And in fact, you could argue that
everything that happens in politics,

49
00:02:15,374 --> 00:02:18,480
the laws that we make,
they're all about mechanisms.

50
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,780
They're all about figuring out
how to influence behavior.

51
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,290
They're all about incentivizing
peculiar behavior.

52
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:29,500
So the big sample that people talk
about every four years when there's

53
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,960
a presidential election and
worry about, you know,

54
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,990
the budget is one of the biggest
sort of mechanism design things

55
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,180
implemented in the last several hundred
years, which is the mortgage deduction.

56
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:45,070
So, if you buy a house and you take on a
mortgage, you get a huge deduction, and

57
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,130
why is that a good thing?

58
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,770
Well because it makes
buying house cheaper,

59
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,920
is what actually encourages
you to buy a house.

60
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,790
And we think that's a good idea for
a bunch of reasons but

61
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,790
it doesn't even really matter
why we think it's a good idea.

62
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:58,580
We have actually constructed something
to encourage people to buy houses.

63
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,550
>> Okay.
>> So,

64
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,690
let's see if we can kind
of do this in the small and

65
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:05,160
kind of think about how you might go
about thinking about how you would

66
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,440
generate certain behavior in people.

67
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,440
>> Okay, sure.

68
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:07,940
>> Good.
