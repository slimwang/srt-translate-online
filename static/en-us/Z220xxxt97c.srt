1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,770
Well the class model diagram is the components and their structural properties.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,760
The composite structure diagram is the internal structure and

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,080
the possible interactions among them.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,940
The component diagram is the organization of the physical

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,240
software components in the system.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,220
Deployment diagram, that's the physical system resources and

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,690
how they map the hardware.

8
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:24,110
The object diagram, that's the static structure at a particular point in time.

9
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,770
The package diagram, well,

10
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,850
that's the one with the logical groupings and dependencies.

11
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:33,570
And finally, the profile diagram, that's extensions to the UML meta model.

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,864
Notice that there's a lot of overlap among these terms, which say,

13
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:40,800
that the different diagram types have a lot of overlapping themselves.
