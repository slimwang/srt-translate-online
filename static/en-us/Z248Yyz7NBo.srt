00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,469
Well, let's compare our answers. Here, we're checking whether the statement

2
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:10,228
equals the string No comment note the use of equals. When you compare two

3
00:00:10,228 --> 00:00:15,390
strings, you should use equals. Here, we checked where the mayor said nothing

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:20,770
at all. Nothing at all is the empty string, the string that has no contents.

5
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:25,375
And again, we use equals. Alternatively, you could use this test here, where we

6
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:29,960
check whether the length of the statement is 0. That's the same thing as

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,685
checking whether it equals the empty string. The third test is different. Here,

8
00:00:34,685 --> 00:00:38,867
we don't invoke a method. We're checking whether the statement is the null

9
00:00:38,867 --> 00:00:42,730
reference. Whether nothing has ever been assigned to the statement.
