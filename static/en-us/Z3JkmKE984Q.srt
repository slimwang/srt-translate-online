00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,850
Let's look at another attack called the DNS

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,300
amplification attack. This attack exploits the asymmetry in

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:11,010
size between DNS queries and their responses. So

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,650
an attacker might send a DNS query for a

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,320
particular domain, and that query might only be

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,230
60 bytes. In sending the query, however, the

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,820
attacker might indicate that the source. For this

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,320
query is some victim IP address. Thus the resolver

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,640
might send a reply which is nearly two

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,860
orders of magnitude larger to a victim. So the

11
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,510
name of the attack amplification comes from the

12
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,050
fact that the query is only 60 bytes and

13
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:40,180
a reply is considerably larger. So, by simply

14
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,750
generating a small amount of initial traffic, the attacker

15
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,030
can cause the DNS resolver. To generate a

16
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,370
significantly larger amount of attack traffic. If we start

17
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,110
adding other attackers, all of which specify

18
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:56,000
the victim as the source, then all of

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,330
these giant replies start heading towards the victim,

20
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,450
and we have a denial of service attack

21
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,080
on the victim. Two possible defenses against

22
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,770
this attack are to prevent IP address spoofing

23
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,550
in the first place using, for example, the

24
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,630
appropriate filtering rule or to disable the ability

25
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:21,450
for a DNS resolver to resolve queries from arbitrary locations on the Internet.
