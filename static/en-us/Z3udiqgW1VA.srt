1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now--what happened is--we set our form action to be google.com/search--

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
we can see here in our URL--and the form added the value

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
that we typed in on our form to the q parameter.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Remember--q came from our HTML.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's the name of the input element--it's the name of that text field.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And that's why we keep seeing it in the URL.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's go back to our form.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Okay--I'd like you to type something else in the form,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and you're going to tell me what happens.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This time we're going to type in better flight search--and click submit.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Okay--so--what I'd like you to do is go to your form,

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
type the phrase "better flight search" into the form, and click submit.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,169
What I'd like you to tell me is what is the value of the q parameter in the final URL?
