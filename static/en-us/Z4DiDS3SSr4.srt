1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now we're going to turn our attention to a different type of puzzle.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is called a cryptarithmetic problem.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
"Crypt-" for cryptography--secret writing---and arithmetic for arithmetic--

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
doing addition and other types of problems,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and the idea here is that each of these letters of the alphabet stands for

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
some digit from 0 to 9.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The problem is to figure out which digit stands for which

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
such that the equation will be correct.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Some people call these alphametics--is another name for them.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
They're a puzzle for humans to work out because there are so many possibilities,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and humans are limited in the speed in which they can mark them out.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But there are some types of inferences that they can make.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
For example, in this addition problem here we have an addition problem of

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
of two 3-digit numbers, and the result is a 4-digit number.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
E is that fourth digit, so what does that tell us about what the letter E must stand for?

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What digit it must stand for?

17
00:01:06,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Do you think E should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 9?
