00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:04,950
Here's an example of how not to do it. Say you have a nice address book

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,330
application with an address book class in it, and that class has a sort method

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,595
in it. And now you're writing some financial application that or, or

4
00:00:14,595 --> 00:00:20,140
a financial part of an overall application, in which you'd like to do sorting.

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,220
And the piece you are working on has to do with ledgers, for

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,465
keeping track of credits and debits, and so on. So you'd like to,

7
00:00:27,465 --> 00:00:33,090
to use the sort that's part of the address book in your ledger class. So

8
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,620
one strategy for doing that might merely be to have ledger be a subclass that is

9
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:44,100
inherent from address book. But this would not be an example of generalization.

10
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,230
An address book is not a general version of a ledger.

11
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,920
This would be an abuse of power. So what can you do instead?
