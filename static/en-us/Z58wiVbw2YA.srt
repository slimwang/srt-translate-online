Congratulations on completing lesson three.

00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,546
In lesson four, you'll be working on your final project,

00:00:05,546 --> 00:00:09,180
after watching an Udacity intro to Hackathon.

00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,990
connecting to the same Twitter garden hose.

00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,540

00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,890
aim much higher.

00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,190
Good luck, and we can't wait to see what you create.
