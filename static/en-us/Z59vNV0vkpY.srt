1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,830
So let's do another superscalar versus VLIW comparison

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,080
as a quiz. Let's say we have an

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,960
out of order superscalar processor and a VLIW

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,790
processor. Let's say the out of order superscalar processor

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,920
executes thirty two bit instructions while the VLIW

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,330
executes one hundred twenty eight bit instructions. Where

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,950
each VLIW instruction specifies four operations. Each of

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,220
these operations is similar to what one of these

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,060
instructions on a superscalar browser can do. If we

10
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,540
have a program for the other superscalar that is 4000

11
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,670
bytes in length, we can say the the VLIW program

12
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,620
size will be between how many, and how many bytes.
