00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,420
Just to refresh your memory about micro

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:06,330
kernel based operating system structure, the idea is

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,730
micro kernel the micro kernel is providing a

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,900
small number of simple abstractions. Such as address

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,800
based and inter process communication and all

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,020
the system services that you normally expect from

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,440
an operating system. Such as the file system

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,870
Memory manager, CPU scheduling, and so on are

9
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:30,130
implemented as processes above microkernal. In

10
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,140
other words, these operating system services

11
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:39,690
run at the same privilege level as user-level applications. All of them

12
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:45,680
in their own individual address spaces. And only the microkernel runs at

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,020
a different level of privilege provided by the processor architecture. Since all

14
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,670
the operating system services are implemented as server's

15
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,960
processes on top of the microkernel, they may

16
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,970
have to cooperate with one another in order

17
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,440
to satisfy a particular user's request. And in

18
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,150
that case, they may have to talk to one another, and in order to do that,

19
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,985
they need IPC that is provided by the

20
00:01:10,985 --> 00:01:16,270
microkernel in order to accomplish what is needed by

21
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,480
a particular system call emanating from an application.
