1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,070
Layout is happening at 980 pixels wide and then just

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,720
getting rescaled to fit the screen. If we rotate the screen

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,280
it's scaling it up to fit the width, so in

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,660
short this isn't a fluid layout at all. It's a fixed

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,690
width with the font size being set in pixels and

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,310
then getting scaled along with everything else. The worst part of

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,750
this, is that I'm going to have to zoom in to

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,210
read this text. It's far too small for me to read.

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,150
And in fact, when it's all the way across

10
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,270
the screen, it's still a little small to read.
