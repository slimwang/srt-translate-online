00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,250
As far as relationships are concerned,

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,270
there's three main categories of relationships in UML.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:09,725
There are dependencies, depicted by dashed lines with an arrowhead,

4
00:00:09,725 --> 00:00:14,380
indicating that the class at one end uses the class as the other end.

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,800
The solid lines without arrowheads are associations.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,970
And that says that class at one end affects or

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,630
has a instance of the class at the other end.

8
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,020
The solid line can be adorned with a diamond.

9
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,049
The diamond is used indicate this has a or

10
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:35,770
aggregation embellishment to the association.

11
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,030
Third main category relationship is the generalization relationship.

12
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,800
The class at one end is a kind of a class at the other end.

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,950
In this case there is a solid line but it has that triangle at the end of it.
