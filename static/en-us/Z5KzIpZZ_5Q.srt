00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,211
Now, in order to understand how we obtain input from the user, it's best

2
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:07,708
represented in a simple analogy. Newspaper subscription. For instance,

3
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:10,648
newspapers are printed every day with a rich set of data that I don't have

4
00:00:10,648 --> 00:00:15,165
access to unless I willingly subscribe to, or receive, that paper. Input

5
00:00:15,165 --> 00:00:19,360
handling in HTML5 is a lot like that. In JavaScript we have the ability to

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,762
subscribe to this input data, such that when an event occurs, a block of code

7
00:00:22,762 --> 00:00:27,860
will be called. To get started with this process you need to tell the browser

8
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,100
that you'd like to subscribe to a certain event such as On Click, On Mouse

9
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,610
Move, or On Key Down alongside what function you'd like to call when that event

10
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:40,040
happens. Let's take a look at the code. You can see here that we grab an

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,760
element from the dom named pLubbz, for life, and add an EventListener to it

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,478
from mousemove. What occurs is that when the mousemove event happens on the dom

13
00:00:49,478 --> 00:00:53,096
object the onMouseMove function will be called where we've previously defined

14
00:00:53,096 --> 00:00:56,320
onMouseMove before this declaration.
