00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,256
So, just like when adding fractions, we start out by finding the LCD or the

2
00:00:04,256 --> 00:00:08,576
lowest common denominator. Next, we multiplied each of these fractions by the

3
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:12,490
missing factors of the lowest common denominator. That was the same for our

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,226
actual numbers. Now, we're ready for the last step. Let's find the actual

5
00:00:16,226 --> 00:00:20,188
fractions that are equivalent and then find the sum. So, what are these two

6
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:24,358
equivalent fractions? And then, what I want you to do is to find the sum of the

7
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:27,463
two fractions and put that here. Good luck.
