1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,830
Okay, the first one is very likely.

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,050
Second and third?

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,790
Eh, not so much.

4
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:06,670
Last one?

5
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:07,960
Eh, maybe.

6
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,540
Okay, so
the distribution of P bright star,

7
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,780
given sky region,
looks something like this.

8
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,890
Remember that this is not
enough to give me a definitive

9
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,300
answer of which region I am looking at.

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,730
I need to combine this with my
prior probability of where I

11
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:25,900
think I'm looking.

12
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,550
This would come from my
previous estimation step, or

13
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,620
just be a random distribution
in the beginning.
