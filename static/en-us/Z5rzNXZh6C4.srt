When we encounter a stressful event there are two ways we can assess the event.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,986
The first is called Primary Appraisal. Here we're talking about a quick

3
00:00:08,986 --> 00:00:13,931
assessment of the meaning of a given environmental event for an individual. For

4
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:17,636
example you may become very stressed about the fact that your shower's broken

5
00:00:17,636 --> 00:00:22,192
and you have to call somebody to get it fixed. And everything that it's

6
00:00:22,192 --> 00:00:25,312
going to take to get the shower fixed, planning someone to fix it, having to

7
00:00:25,312 --> 00:00:30,136
pay for it cleaning up the house so someone can come in. These things are

8
00:00:30,136 --> 00:00:34,310
really stressful. So that might be the first reaction or assessment of what the

9
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:38,648
situation means to you. So the shower handle broke, so that means you're

10
00:00:38,648 --> 00:00:43,886
going to have to do all of this other stuff just to fix it. So, this was an

11
00:00:43,886 --> 00:00:47,054
example of primary appraisal, our first reaction or assessment of a situation

12
00:00:47,054 --> 00:00:51,596
and what it means to us. Now, it's important to note, if we appraise the

13
00:00:51,596 --> 00:00:55,160
situation as being contrary to our well-being, then it will produce a negative

14
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,100
emotion and the negative emotion can cause stress.
