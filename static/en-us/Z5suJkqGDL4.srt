00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,840
My name is Don Dini. I'm a principle data scientist here at the AT&T big

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,130
data group. My background is in computer

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,170
science in artificial intelligence specifically multi agent systems.

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:17,190
Before that, I did physics but then I got, I got struck over the head

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,390
with the magic of computer science. And I

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,020
moved into there, and into our visual intelligence.

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:30,220
And then I taught for a while at USC, and then

8
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:35,900
moving up here to the Bay area and worked for a couple of start ups. Doing a lot

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:41,700
of work on real time system for collecting data

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,950
and doing real time analysis on them. And and now I am here.
