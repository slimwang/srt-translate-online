00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,000
You now have the ability to control the
flow of your JavaScript programs using

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,870
conditional statements and loops.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:07,140
With just these simple tools,

4
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:09,300
you can already build some
pretty impressive programs.

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,796
>> However, as the problems you
face get more and more complex, so

6
00:00:13,795 --> 00:00:15,367
too will the code you write.

7
00:00:15,368 --> 00:00:17,608
But there's an easy way to fix this.

8
00:00:17,608 --> 00:00:19,443
>> As the code gets longer and
inevitably,

9
00:00:19,443 --> 00:00:22,419
there will a code that repeats
the same number of steps.

10
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,650
Instead of repeating the same steps
multiple times, we can package

11
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:29,599
up those processes into reusable
chunks of code called functions.

12
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,140
>> To understand why functions are so

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,230
useful, let's think about something
you might use in your day-to-day life.

14
00:00:35,229 --> 00:00:36,570
>> How about a microwave?

15
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,490
We've got one right here.

16
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,539
>> Yeah, that works.

17
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:42,700
When you use a microwave
to heat things up.

18
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,600
>> Like pizza?

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,200
Because I hate cold pizza and we just so

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,910
happen to have some
cold pizza right here.

21
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,789
>> Yeah, like pizza.

22
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:56,229
When you use a microwave to heat things
up like pizza, you first need to

23
00:00:56,229 --> 00:01:00,489
tell the microwave how long to heat it
up for based on the number of slices.

24
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,630
Let's say it takes about a minute and
a half per slice.

25
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,710
Then you need to set
the microwave to 50% power.

26
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:09,679
Since you are reheating the pizza,
not cooking it.

27
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,066
And after all that, you hit start and
you wait, and then there's your pizza.

28
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:17,588
[MUSIC]

29
00:01:17,588 --> 00:01:19,734
This method for
heating up pizza works, but

30
00:01:19,734 --> 00:01:23,280
it could be quite time consuming having
to set the microwave every time.

31
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,670
Thankfully at least in our microwave,

32
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,870
there's a pizza reheat button that
sets the power level in heating time.

33
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,359
>> James just needs to tell
it how many slices he has.

34
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,709
>> This pizza reheat button
works like a function.

35
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:41,500
Functions are just lines of code all
packaged together that we can use and

36
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,450
reuse when we need them.

37
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,030
In most cases,
a function is given some data,

38
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:50,070
performs operations on the data,
and then returns the altered data.

39
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:52,949
>> The input you give the function or
argument as it's usually

40
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,420
called in programming is
the number of pizza slices.

41
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:00,870
The operation it performs is setting
the power and time to reheat the pizza.

42
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,590
And it's returned output
is the reheated pizza.

43
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,710
>> It's like a shortcut.

44
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:05,609
>> Exactly.

45
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:08,990
The pizza reheat button hides
the steps for reheating pizza and

46
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,629
makes it easier to reheat as
many slices of pizza as we want

47
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:16,120
without having to redo all
the settings from scratch each time.

48
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,300
>> That's assuming all the pieces
will fit in the microwave.

49
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:18,510
>> Right.
