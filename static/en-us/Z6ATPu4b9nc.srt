1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,440
Reinforcement learning is different
enough from the other ideas in machine

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,150
learning that Georgia Tech
actually has a separate class on

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,890
it as well as covering it in
the original machine learning class.

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,640
So those are the two classes we're
mostly going to draw from in this unit.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,755
We're going to draw from
the reinforcement learning section

6
00:00:14,755 --> 00:00:18,065
of the original machine learning
class and then from the stand alone

7
00:00:18,065 --> 00:00:21,125
reinforcement learning class that's
also offered at Georgia Tech.

8
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:22,525
Try and keep those straight.

9
00:00:22,525 --> 00:00:24,752
So the main things we'll cover in
this are the different methods for

10
00:00:24,752 --> 00:00:25,855
doing reinforcement learning.

11
00:00:25,855 --> 00:00:28,834
We'll cover Markov Decision Processes,
which are one of the major

12
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:32,590
knowledge representations for
understanding reinforcement learning.

13
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,160
We'll cover how reinforcement
learning includes some elements of

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,880
game theory and
multi agent interactions.

15
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,180
And we'll cover other methods for
actually doing reinforcement learning.

16
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,310
Along the way, we really want
you to focus on three things.

17
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,890
Again, we want you to focus on
how reinforcement learning fills

18
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,305
in the model building phase
of the original workflow.

19
00:00:48,305 --> 00:00:51,880
We want you to focus on how you
evaluate different models produced

20
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,050
by reinforcement learning for
the relative strengths or disadvantages.

21
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,700
We also what you to focus on
how reinforcement learning

22
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,490
differs in the kinds
of models it produces

23
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,940
compared to the other form of machine
learning that we've talked about so far.
