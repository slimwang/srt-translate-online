1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,378
So now that we have this equation for the
total amount of money that Grant's going

2
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:06,871
to make from people who bought his
products the first day and the second day,

3
00:00:06,871 --> 00:00:10,942
it would be great if we could simplify it
further, however we don't know how to do

4
00:00:10,942 --> 00:00:14,723
that yet. So, before we dive into this
particular example, let's look at a

5
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:18,960
slightly less complicated but similar
problem. Let's say we just have some

6
00:00:18,972 --> 00:00:26,325
expression. I picked 3x - 5y + 6x + 9y.
Now how can we simplify this expression?

7
00:00:26,325 --> 00:00:31,296
Well, I think we need to remember what
each of these terms really means. So 3x

8
00:00:31,296 --> 00:00:40,095
for example is actually equal to x + x + x
and 6x is actually equal to 6 x's added

9
00:00:40,095 --> 00:00:43,763
together. Right now, writing this out
might not seem particularly helpful. But I

10
00:00:43,775 --> 00:00:47,991
think the reason that I chose to write
these terms this way will becomes clear if

11
00:00:48,003 --> 00:00:52,244
we just rearrange the order of the terms
in this expression. So now we switch the

12
00:00:52,256 --> 00:00:56,207
order of the terms around so that terms
with x are next to each other and the

13
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,221
terms of y are next to each other. Now we
can see that the first thing we want to do

14
00:01:00,221 --> 00:01:05,047
is add 3x and 6x together. With all of the
x's written out, that doesn't seem that

15
00:01:05,047 --> 00:01:08,778
hard. I just need to figure out how many
x's, total I have down here. And if I

16
00:01:08,778 --> 00:01:15,226
count them I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 9 x's. So I guess that means that 3x +

17
00:01:15,226 --> 00:01:21,260
6x = 9x. Now, one thing we can notice is
that, in order to get the sum of 3x and 6x

18
00:01:21,272 --> 00:01:25,973
here We don't actually have to count all
the x's. All we really have to do is add

19
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:31,468
the coefficients of the variables
together, since 3 + 6 = 9. Once we have

20
00:01:31,468 --> 00:01:35,719
the coefficient, we just make sure that we
multiply that by the variable that both of

21
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:40,201
these terms have. We usually call this
adding like terms, or combining like

22
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:42,421
terms, as I've written at the top of the slide.
