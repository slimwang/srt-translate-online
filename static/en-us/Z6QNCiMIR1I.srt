1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The answer is the right movement is stochastic,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
so it may fail, so that means we may stay on the left, and we may move to the right.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And the world is dynamic, which means dirt may appear

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
in either the left or the right location,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and we didn't know for sure if there was dirt or not in the right,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
so that means any of the 8 possible states belong to the belief state

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
for the prediction of moving right.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That means any of the 8 states belong to the belief state

9
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
for the prediction of moving right.
