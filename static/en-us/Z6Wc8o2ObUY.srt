1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,620
Let's suppose that two autonomous systems connect

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,440
in two different cities, San Francisco and

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:13,860
New York. Let's further suppose that AS1 wants traffic to destination d to enter

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,870
via New York City, rather than via the peering link in San Francisco. Well

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,710
remember that all things being equal, routers

6
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,350
inside AS2 will select the BGP route with

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,770
the shortest IGP path cost to the next

8
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,510
hop, resulting in hot potato routing. So some

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,720
routers will select the San Francisco egress, and

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,940
other routers might select the New York egress.

11
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:41,480
To override this default hot potato routing behavior,

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,290
AS1 might advertise its BGP routes to AS2

13
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,000
with MED values. For example, if the MED

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,350
value on the route learned, at the border router

15
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,510
in New York, was 10, and the MED value

16
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,730
from the route learned from the router in San Francisco

17
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,800
was 20, than instead of performing hot potato routing, all

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,150
of these routers that would ordinarily be closer to the

19
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:05,430
San Francisco egress, would instead pick the route learned via

20
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,150
the New York egress. Because the preference for a lower

21
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,990
MED value comes before the preference for a next hop

22
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,470
with the lower IGP path process. So all of these

23
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,680
routes would instead be carried over AS2's

24
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,580
backbone network and exit via New York.

25
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,090
Thus MED overrides hot potato routing behavior

26
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,630
allowing NAS to explicitly specify that it

27
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,250
wants another neighboring AS to carry the

28
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,460
traffic on its own backbone network, rather

29
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,280
than dumping the traffic at the closest

30
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,320
egress and forcing traffic across the neighbor's backbone.

31
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,310
MEDs are typically not used in conventional

32
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,010
business relationships, but they're sometimes used, for example,

33
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:51,670
if AS1 does not want AS2 free riding

34
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,030
on AS1's backbone network. So effectively MED allows

35
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:59,280
AS1 to say, yes, I will connect or peer with you, but it is your

36
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,650
job to carry the traffic long distances across

37
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,990
the country. This mechanism is sometimes used when

38
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,880
a transit provider peers with a content

39
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,880
provider, and the transit provider doesn't want the

40
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,550
content provider essentially getting free transit through

41
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,180
the neighboring AS. In the absence of MED

42
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,030
overriding any behavior, typically what will happen

43
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,670
is a router inside the AS2 would learn

44
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,930
multiple routes via internal BGP to different egress

45
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,120
points for the same destination d, and it

46
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,590
would simply pick the next hop or, the egress router, with the lowest IGP path

47
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:42,970
cost. In this case, 5. It's very common practice to set these IGP costs in

48
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,710
accordance with distance, or propagation delay, thus

49
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,370
resulting in routers inside the AS picking shorter

50
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,300
paths. Now one problem with this notion of

51
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,380
hot potato routing is that a very small

52
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,470
change in IGP path cost can result in

53
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,250
a lot of BGP routing changes. Remember that

54
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,140
it's probably not just one destination that's being

55
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,870
routed through the San Francisco egress, but maybe tens

56
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,080
of thousands of routes. So a single IGP

57
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,600
path cost change can result in rerouting of tens

58
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,840
of thousands of IP prefixes in BGP. People

59
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,240
have looked at various ways to improve the stability

60
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,960
of BGP routing, by decoupling the IGP and the

61
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,290
BGP, in this part of the route selection process.
