00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,620
Another possible solution to the IP address space

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,540
exhaustion problem is to simply add more bits. This

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,480
is the gist of the contribution of the

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,590
IPv6 protocol. Here's a picture of the IPv4 protocol

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,510
header, and all of the fields shown in

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,750
red have basically been removed in IPv6, resulting in

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,590
both a much simpler header and addresses that

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,030
are much larger. By contrast, here's the IPv6 header.

9
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:30,110
The IPv6 header provides 128 bits for

10
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,840
both the source and destination IP addresses. Now

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,160
the format of these addresses are as follows. Of the 128 bits, the top 48

12
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,450
bits are for the public routing topology,

13
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,520
and we have a 16-bit site identifier. And

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,990
finally, a 64-bit interface ID, which effectively

15
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:51,940
has the 48-bit ethernet address of the interface

16
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:57,621
plus 16 more bits. Now, the top 48 bits can be broken down further. They include

17
00:00:57,621 --> 00:01:01,570
3 bits for aggregation, 13 bits for a

18
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,820
top level provider, something like a tier one

19
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:09,810
ISP, 8 reserve bits, and 24 additional bits. Now, note that there are 13 bits in

20
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,480
the top 48 that directly map to the

21
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,130
tier one ISP, meaning that addresses are purely provider-based,

22
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,770
thus changing ISPs would require renumbering.

23
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,200
IPv4 has many claimed benefits. There are

24
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,510
more addresses, the header is simpler,

25
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:29,020
multihoming is supposedly easier, various aspects of

26
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:34,840
security are built in, such as the IPv6 crypto extensions. Now despite

27
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,980
all of these benefits, we have yet to see the huge deployment of IPv6 yet.
