00:00:03,391 --> 00:00:06,446
shadow system works in this case is that it dims down all kinds of contribution

4
00:00:06,446 --> 00:00:11,274
including ambient. The reason the spotlight itself disappears is that the

5
00:00:11,274 --> 00:00:15,876
Lambert material is normally evaluated per vertex for illumination. The ground

6
00:00:15,876 --> 00:00:18,648
plane has just four corners all of which are outside the spotlight's area of

7
00:00:18,648 --> 00:00:23,782
influence. So, just the ambient light is applied. The shadow in the scene isn't

8
00:00:23,782 --> 00:00:27,824
baked on. It's in fact evaluated per pixel. But that's a separate part of the

9
00:00:27,824 --> 00:00:31,498
illumination process in this case. A spotlight is not a specular highlight, it

10
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:35,992
effects diffuse and shiny objects, alike. Finally, you can think of the area

11
00:00:35,992 --> 00:00:39,284
outside of a spotlight as being in shadow. But that doesn't explain why the

12
00:00:39,284 --> 00:00:43,605
Lambert material effects it. If you use the Lambert material and were to test

13
00:00:43,605 --> 00:00:46,440
like the ground plane into a grid of squares, you'd start to see the effect of

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,194
the spotlight as you can see in these images. Going from left to right, the

15
00:00:51,194 --> 00:00:51,741
ground plane is

[INAUDIBLE]

17
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:55,673
more and more, catching the spotlights effect better and better. However,

18
00:00:55,673 --> 00:00:59,313
evaluating the spotlights effect per pixel instead of per vertex, means many

19
00:00:59,313 --> 00:01:03,050
fewer triangles needed to be generated and processed.
