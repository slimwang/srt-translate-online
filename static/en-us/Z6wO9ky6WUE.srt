1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,010
The slopes we end up with are 10 for brand 1, 8 for brand 2, and 10, again, for

2
00:00:06,022 --> 00:00:12,309
brand 3. This is really interesting. For both brand 1 and brand 3, when we move

3
00:00:12,321 --> 00:00:18,285
over 10 in the x-direction, we have to move up 100 in the y-direction. And, of

4
00:00:18,297 --> 00:00:22,749
course, 100 divided by 10 is just 10. I drew this right triangle on the gray

5
00:00:22,749 --> 00:00:27,409
line, which corresponds to brand 1, but this same exact triangle can be drawn

6
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:32,363
for the line for brand 3. This has exactly the same proportions. It doesn't

7
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:37,540
however work for brand 2. What's even more interesting, however, is how this

8
00:00:37,552 --> 00:00:42,235
ties in with our equations. We said before that brand 1 and brand 3 seem the

9
00:00:42,247 --> 00:00:47,045
most similar because they both had coefficients of 10 in their x terms. 10 is

10
00:00:47,057 --> 00:00:51,835
what we found for the slope of each of them as well. So, seems like this number,

11
00:00:51,942 --> 00:00:57,376
the coefficient of the x term in our equation corresponds to the slope of the

12
00:00:57,388 --> 00:01:03,857
line. This is also true for brand number 2, we see a coefficient of 8 in the

13
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:06,059
term 8x, and a slope of 8.
