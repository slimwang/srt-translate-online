1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,960
So if you've seen any of the other
interviews that I've done

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,830
here at Udacity, you'll notice
that I'm now in the other chair.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,670
And the reason is that what we're
talking about today is a subject near

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:08,300
and dear to my heart.

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,410
It's my dissertation topic,
which is intelligent tutoring systems.

6
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,370
So, Jason has graciously offered
to interview me on this one.

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,030
So.

8
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:15,870
>> So, all right, David.

9
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,500
Let's get started.

10
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,660
So what got you interested in working
in intelligent tutoring systems?

11
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,520
>> So from the time I was
16 until throughout my PhD,

12
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,070
I actually worked as a private tutor.

13
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,990
So I tutored mostly
high school subjects.

14
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,430
Math, physics, things like that.

15
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,168
And it was late in my Master's degree
when I became acquainted with a field

16
00:00:33,168 --> 00:00:35,400
called intelligent tutoring systems.

17
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,075
And it was basically, let's build
AI agents that can do the tutoring.

18
00:00:38,075 --> 00:00:41,680
And the opportunities offered by
them were absolutely enormous for

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,180
accessibility, availability,
cutting costs and

20
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,332
being able to distribute these things
to a large number of students.

21
00:00:47,332 --> 00:00:49,910
And so I really wanted to jump on board,
plus I always joke that

22
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,315
if anyone was going to replace me with
an AI agent, it may as well be me.

23
00:00:53,315 --> 00:00:53,870
>> [LAUGH]
>> So

24
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:58,340
my initial interest was really wanting
to bring the benefits of tutoring,

25
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,960
one on one tutoring where you have
real individualized feedback and

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,830
individualized attention to a much
broader audience of students that

27
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,470
wouldn't be able to
access it other wise.

28
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:06,840
>> Okay.
All right.

29
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,080
What is the most exciting possibility
of intelligent tutoring systems?

30
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,690
>> So, we've already seen intelligent
tutoring systems do some really exciting

31
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,480
things, things like
Carnegie Learning's Cognitive Tutor for

32
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,680
algebra in high school and
things like that.

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,880
But what I think is the most
exciting opportunity is

34
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,630
what the Internet can do to
actually scale these things up.

35
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,910
So right now, we have students
using them in classrooms and

36
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,330
they use them as complements
to their lessons, but

37
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,865
some new initiatives are looking at
actually putting that online, which is

38
00:01:30,865 --> 00:01:34,030
really powerful because it takes that
and it makes it available to everyone.

39
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,510
So things like IXL that do some
rudimentary kind of intelligent tutoring

40
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:40,720
system principles for the masses.

41
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,870
But what's really, really exciting, and
this is a little bit further out though,

42
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,030
is the idea that, in the future, we
might not just have intelligent tutoring

43
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,040
systems that can kind of
monitor what you do, and

44
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,105
give you feedback that it
already kind of knows about.

45
00:01:51,105 --> 00:01:51,690
>> Mm-hm.

46
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:54,220
>> But intelligent tutoring systems
that, themselves, can learn.

47
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,980
So if I have a intelligent tutoring
system equipped with some machine

48
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,370
learning that can look
at 100,000 students, and

49
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,620
look at what feedback it
gave to what mistakes and

50
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:05,470
what actually led to future improvement,
it can actually then improve itself.

51
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:08,449
It can learn what teaching strategies,
or what feedback,

52
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:12,710
or what responses are most useful to
students for certain kinds of errors.

53
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,580
>> And then it might be able to start to
unlock some principles of feedback or

54
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,790
some principles of teaching that
we don't even know about yet.

55
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,790
When I was tutoring back
in my earlier life,

56
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,890
I worked with maybe ten
students at a time.

57
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,650
I've probably worked with 50 or 60
students over the course of my career.

58
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,420
And I drew from that a lot.

59
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,620
But 50 or 60 students,
it's a decent knowledge base.

60
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,770
But if we had an AI agent that could
do it based on a 100,000 students or

61
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,000
a million students,
and experiences across

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,170
the entire course of their curriculum,
that would be incredibly powerful.

63
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:43,710
>> Absolutely.
>> And

64
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,663
the other thing is that when I'm
working with students, usually I'd get

65
00:02:46,663 --> 00:02:51,350
them maybe in ninth or tenth grade, and
very often what I would find is that

66
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,850
the difficulties they were having with
a certain concept in math in tenth grade

67
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,800
really went back to difficulties they
had with fractions in fifth grade.

68
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,390
>> Okay.
>> And

69
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,920
really, the ideal would be,
a system like this would prevent

70
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,670
those difficulties from
arising in the first place.

71
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,400
It would teach them well in fifth grade.

72
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,030
But even if it didn't do that, if we
had a intelligent tutoring system that

73
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,720
worked with them throughout their
entire education, it would be able to

74
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,220
look back and say what did I
teach you back in fifth grade?

75
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,750
What difficulties did you have there?

76
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,000
And kind of leverage those right now.

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,920
I know that this student has always had
a little bit of trouble with fractions.

78
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,245
So when I come to a new lesson I know
that I can anticipate giving a little

79
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,570
bit more feedback on that.

80
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,460
And couching it in terms of what
I've told them in the past.

81
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:33,060
So, that kind of long term memory, that
kind of massive data bank really opens

82
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,660
up some really exciting possibilities if
we can figure out a way to harness it.

83
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,160
>> Oh, wow.

84
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,110
Absolutely.

85
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,269
>> What are some of the biggest
challenges facing intelligent

86
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:41,010
tutoring systems?

87
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,676
>> So, I think there's really two big
challenges that are presently facing

88
00:03:43,676 --> 00:03:44,880
intelligent tutoring systems.

89
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,503
One is the idea of
invisible information.

90
00:03:47,503 --> 00:03:49,440
>> Mm-hm.
>> So when I'm working with a student

91
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,160
and they're working on a particular
problem, I can see the steps they're

92
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,800
writing out, that that is their first
step, that is their second step.

93
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,630
But when they make an error,

94
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,120
I don't necessarily know what
was going on inside their mind.

95
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,240
I can kind of use what they said and
use what they wrote to try and

96
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,870
extrapolate it, but
I don't have a real notion of that.

97
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,094
That comes up in things like algebra,
but it's even more important in things

98
00:04:08,094 --> 00:04:10,290
like science or
some of the more high level classes.

99
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:13,110
Ideally, we like to build intelligent
tutoring systems that deal with those

100
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,410
levels as well.

101
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:18,690
When the nature of the problems
themselves becomes much less formal and

102
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,529
much less structured.

103
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:21,980
And in an algebra problem,
I know that there's,

104
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,480
you know, five steps to get to
the answer to this problem.

105
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,180
But if my problem is,
design a good user interface for

106
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,100
facilitating learning sign language,
I don't know what the problems are.

107
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,100
I don't know what the steps are.

108
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,270
I don't know how to evaluate that.

109
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:38,160
And so, for those big, open-ended
projects or those big things that aren't

110
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,320
really constrained environments, that's
where we have a lot of information

111
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,270
that's invisible, because it's
inside the student's own head.

112
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,880
And that makes it very difficult for
humans to operate on,

113
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,020
let alone computers.

114
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,530
If they can't see it,
they can't operate on it.

115
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,660
>> Right.
>> And then the other issue is that

116
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,900
there's information that we as
humans can process that right now,

117
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,690
it's difficult for agents to process.

118
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,310
>> For sure.

119
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,590
>> So when I'm working with a student,

120
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,940
I can tell based on their facial
expression, are they bored,

121
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,190
are they tired, are they really excited,
are they really confused,

122
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,570
are they really frustrated.

123
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,430
And those all inform
how I react to them.

124
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,130
If they're frustrated,
I'm going to be a little more patient.

125
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,720
If they're excited, I'm going to
maybe push a little bit further or

126
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,530
connect to some bigger topics.

127
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,690
Right now, computers are starting to
have a little bit of ability to do that

128
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,200
kind of facial recognition, but
it's not quite there yet and

129
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,000
it's not fast enough
to equip a tutor with.

130
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,450
And so the other challenge that those
systems are really going to face is

131
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:28,200
processing the full range of information
that we humans can process or

132
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,300
reading the student, understanding that,
understanding a little bit about their

133
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,000
background and
the context in which they're working.

134
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,028
So I think those are the two main
challenges that they'll need to

135
00:05:38,028 --> 00:05:38,640
overcome.

136
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,800
>> Okay.

137
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,100
>> So, thank you again, Jason for

138
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,020
peppering me with
questions on my own topic.

139
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,925
>> Absolutely David,
anything for you, you know that.

140
00:05:45,925 --> 00:05:47,192
[LAUGH]
>> [LAUGH] And thank you all.
