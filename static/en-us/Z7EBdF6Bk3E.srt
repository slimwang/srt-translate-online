1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You're changing the way you're
doing locking, however. >>Right.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
For the same reason a single node failing means
that we lose the entire site because of the locking.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Moving locking into something called Zookeeper,
which implements a tree system

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
with guaranteed order of operations on
those and with that, you build locking.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,169
And the main advantage of Zookeeper
is that it has much higher availabilities.

6
00:00:26,169 --> 00:00:31,000
If we lose a Zookeeper node, we should be
able to come back within 200 milliseconds,

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
as opposed to whenever somebody notices
the cache is down and replaces it.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes. In generally, an engineer cannot
respond at 200 milliseconds. >>Yes.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Even the best. Zookeeper is a new system,
and this is a separate system? >>Right.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yeah. It's an Apache project, like Cassandra is.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Is there one Zookeeper box, is there
a bunch of Zookeeper boxes?

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So they form an ensemble and the way it works
is there's a master and the others are sort of

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
read replicants and if the master fails,

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
it'll automatically elect a new
leader among the ensemble.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Okay. So do all the request go
to one machine? >>No.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You write to any of them so your client could
reconnect to any one of them. >>Okay.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And they automatically figure out
who to talk to. >>Cool.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Now is Zookeeper just for locking or does it do--

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We're also going to be moving dynamic
configuration type stuff in the Zookeeper

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and the Zookeeper provides watches on the
nodes so the apps can actually get notification

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,169
when something changes in the Zookeeper. We can
say we're going to change the add on the front page.

22
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:46,569
We just set something in Zookeeper
and all the apps update themselves.

23
00:01:46,584 --> 00:01:50,584
That reminds me of one thing that was
always a challenge, and I don't know

24
00:01:50,584 --> 00:01:54,000
the answer to this one already is
when we had all these app servers,

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
the app servers had all the configuration. A lot of
the configuration was basically part of the code.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
One example would be how many memcache
boxes you have, because the memcache

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
library would exist on the app servers and that's
where the hashing would happen, for example.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,461
If you're deploying a new configuration, once
you have more than a couple app servers

29
00:02:13,461 --> 00:02:17,000
often deploys take time--where I think
still happen at the same time.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,523
Right! >>And so all of a sudden, you've got half
your app servers with a different configuration.

31
00:02:21,538 --> 00:02:25,646
That gets weird--let's say you're adding a new
memcache and all of a sudden you've got

32
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:30,000
half your machines accessing one set of machines
and half of the machines accessing another

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
set of machines, static files hashed--
like everything is weird.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Have you guys improved that at all?
>>No. That will be the Zookeeper.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Zookeeper will help? >>Yeah. You can put like what database is there and all that kind of stuff.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And the reason you don't want to just
do that in like memcache, for example,

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
is that you would need to fetch that
from memcache on every request

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,107
because there's no way to know that it changed.

39
00:02:50,107 --> 00:02:54,000
Because memcache is--all the queries
are initiated from the apps. >>Yes.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Set this, get this--Zookeeper will actually
push that ability. >>Yes. >>That's cool.

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I never look at Zookeeper, so may be it's
something I should get smart about.
