00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,390
Before we finish the lesson,

2
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:04,240
you should know that there are many
Android samples that show off how to use

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,870
the notification features
we've just discussed.

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,880
Let's go to File > Import Sample,
and bring up the selector.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,560
The first is Basic Notifications.

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,500
This is the sample we
first stepped through.

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,670
This performs generic notifications for
Android only, and

8
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,530
is a good starting point for testing out
the addition of wearable extensions.

9
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,240
The next is Wearable Notifications.

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,895
This sample allows you to generate
every possible notification type for

11
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:30,200
Android Wear and
see what they look like.

12
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,490
This allows you to prototype
everything before you write the code.

13
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,390
Finally, there is Eliza Chat,
which allows you to have a conversation

14
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,730
using speech recognition with
an artificially intelligent robot,

15
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,600
using your Android Wear
device via notifications.

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,460
So give this sample a try to find out
what is possible with Android Wear

17
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,320
notifications.
