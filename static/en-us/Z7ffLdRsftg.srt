1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:04,560
The reason we're covering dirty data is
to get you to think about what to look

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,470
for in your data sets.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,150
Then we're going to
cover how to clean or

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,590
deal with the data before
running your analytics.

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:17,800
When I think of all the issues I've seen
with dirty data, I think of data that

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,730
isn't parsed properly, so it appears all
in one field instead of multiple fields.

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,610
Extra characters in data fields
that make it difficult to

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,380
use the data readily.

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,790
Because those extra characters need to
be removed before analytics can be run.

10
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:34,840
Misspelled data or

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,150
typos which can easily happen
when typing data in manually.

12
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:43,730
Duplicate data records which can happen
because of multiple data entries for

13
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,690
the same information.

14
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,720
Incorrect data, like dates that
are from, say, January 1, 1900.

15
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:55,720
This can happen when a user is working
with a system that requires a value but

16
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,630
none is available at the time.

17
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,440
So the business practice may be to enter
a certain static date that sticks out so

18
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,530
that its noticeably long,
like January 1,1900.

19
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,530
Data that doe not fit with
the expected pattern.

20
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,470
For instance, we might have a field
containing email addresses.

21
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,348
But not all of the email addresses
are in the proper format.

22
00:01:18,348 --> 00:01:21,073
Like name@domain.

23
00:01:21,073 --> 00:01:23,220
We could probably think of others.

24
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,910
But for the benefit of understanding
how to recognize dirty data and

25
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,460
fix it, we're going to work
on these three problems.

26
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:35,240
Data parsing, extra characters and
fields, and duplicate data.

27
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,450
Let's now explore the first problem,
improperly parsed data, in more detail
