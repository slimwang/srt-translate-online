00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,000
jQuery is an extremely popular JavaScript library meant to make a number of

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,770
common JavaScript tasks simpler, via a consistent API across all browsers.

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,279
In other words, jQuery makes your life easier.

4
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:17,915
As of 2014, almost 62% of the top 100,000 websites all use jQuery,

5
00:00:17,915 --> 00:00:20,230
which is pretty incredible.

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,250
Performing AJAX requests that work properly in every browser is,

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,860
well it's a big pain in the butt.

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,520
Luckily we can use jQuery's AJAX methods and

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,130
leave some of the drudgery of supporting old browsers to jQuery.

10
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,940
It's important to know that it's extremely common for

11
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,390
developers to use libraries to write AJAX calls.

12
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,070
There's no problem with using libraries to simplify the code you have to write,

13
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,300
especially with something like AJAX.

14
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,220
In order to use jQuery we need to use jQuery objects, and

15
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,470
to do that we'll be using syntax like you see here within script.js.

16
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,550
We're creating a few variables over here each of

17
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,600
which has a dollar sign in front of em.

18
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,480
Now this dollar sign doesn't mean anything, it's just a character that

19
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:07,130
we're going to to use to identify the fact that this object is a jQuery object.

20
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,880
To select an object with jQuery, we'll start off with this dollar sign.

21
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,280
Which is a pointer to a jQuery object.

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,990
And then, within the parentheses, we'll pass in a string of the element that we

23
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,960
want, where this pound sign represents an ID.

24
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,780
So in this case, if we want the Wikipedia element we simply use

25
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,620
the dollar sign to represent the jQuery object and

26
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,960
then pass in a string starting with this pound sign or hashtag or

27
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,558
whatever you want to call it, representing the ID of wikipedia-links.

28
00:01:34,558 --> 00:01:39,650
Now wiki element represents a jQuery object of the Wikipedia links element

29
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:40,550
on the page.

30
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,000
We'll be using two different methods for

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,660
AJAX requests, the .ajax method and the .getJSON method.

32
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,470
Both methods take in a URL and then some optional parameters.

33
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,990

34
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,730
