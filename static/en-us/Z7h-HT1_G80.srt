00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,280
Now let's see if we can figure out what the unlock needs to do.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:09,360
So the unlock function here does what? Option one, use a normal store to write

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,820
zero to lockvar. Option two, load link, see if we loaded one and then store

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,688
conditional. And option three, we need additional

5
00:00:19,688 --> 00:00:22,750
atomic instructions in our ISA to do this.
