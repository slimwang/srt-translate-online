1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,700
That ends the first lesson on frequency analysis, it gives you some relation

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:08,080
between sort of what's in the image, and the frequency components in it.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,910
Next time, what we're going to do is we're going to talk about how filtering and

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:15,240
convolution are expressed in the frequency domain and

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,096
that's how it allows us to get to aliasing.

6
00:00:17,096 --> 00:00:21,180
I'll also say if you didn't follow everything that just went through,

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,630
that's okay, I really just want you to sort of

8
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:29,710
stay focused on this idea of frequency, and the con, and the Fourier transform.

9
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,970
And then, as a way of, of getting the different elements.

10
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:37,870
And then I'm going to show you how the frequency transform relates to sampling,

11
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:38,730
which, or I should say,

12
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,770
frequency domain relates to sampling, which will get us to aliasing.
