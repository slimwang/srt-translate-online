1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,000
Now I do want us to look at the film a little bit more carefully.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,060
Basically a film is the whole process of how

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:15,180
a chemical process is used to convert light.

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,850
And the, basically it is the energy of the light itself that changes

5
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,080
the chemicals.

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,310
And then of course we have to frill, figure out how to preserve that changed in

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,040
chemical process to then basically be able to store light into film.

8
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:35,320
Here I have just laid out a, a simple 35 millimeter film, pretty much like

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,770
the same one that I'm showing here and I basically kind of now unwrapped it.

10
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:45,390
In the schematic to show different parts of a film.

11
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,200
So in this instance, light is coming in.

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,720
And if you notice any one in this one,

13
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,220
the light was coming in from that side, and

14
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,740
that was the one that was pointing to the optics, the the lens of the camera.

15
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,210
The light comes in and, of course, there are many different layers.

16
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,940
Let's just go quickly over them and see what what each one of them does.

17
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,350
First layer is the protective layer.

18
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,530
We need to be able to protect all of these light sensitive layers that

19
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,130
are actually going to exist.

20
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,130
Of course, in most types of cameras and

21
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,570
films like this we also put in a UV filter.

22
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,820
The UV filter is there to just make sure that the right kinds of light, and

23
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,010
not damaging lights, are hitting the different types of sensors.

24
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,650
Ignore the colors of these types of things.

25
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,990
Each one of them has a different feature.

26
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,080
So the first one that the light hits is a blue light layer,

27
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,740
then a yellow filter is added to kind of get the yellow light out,

28
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,980
green light layer, red light layer.

29
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:42,570
So, again, we have green, red, and blue lights, then there is

30
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,370
an adhesive which is put in there, so these are all very thin layers.

31
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:52,020
And, of course, thickest one is the film base, which gives it the structure and

32
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,280
keeps it stable.

33
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,050
So in essence, all of this is tied up in something this thin.

34
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:04,050
So it's important to note that not only in the, in the present days,

35
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,950
people can pack things up in small things,

36
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,979
a lot of this packed up into a very small thing there.

37
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:12,070
So in essence, a film is a sheet of plastic.

38
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,410
And that's what I've shown you so far.

39
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:19,490
It's coated with an emulsion that is basically full of light sensitive,

40
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:23,270
silver halite salts, which have been bonded by a gelatin.

41
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,549
So in essence there are silver halite salts inside the layers.

42
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,160
These are the light sensitive ones that actually store the light changes.

43
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,620
And then there are variable crystals all over the film also, that basically

44
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,500
determine the sensitivity, the contrast, and the resolution of the film.

45
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:44,190
This is where some issues like ISO come in, because this is where all of

46
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,110
that practicability of how sensitive that film is comes in.
