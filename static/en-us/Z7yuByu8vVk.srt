1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,438
This expression is the odd one out. The other ones equal positive 1. This

2
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:08,143
expression equals 1 since we have the same expression in the numerator and the

3
00:00:08,143 --> 00:00:11,996
denominator. We've seen something similar like this before if we just switch the

4
00:00:11,996 --> 00:00:15,692
terms in the denominator we can see that numerator and the denominator have the

5
00:00:15,692 --> 00:00:20,224
same factors. Notice that I'm not cancelling an individual term. I'm cancelling

6
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:25,256
an entire numerator with an entire denominator. So I have one divided by one or

7
00:00:25,256 --> 00:00:29,048
just one. This one might have been a little bit tricky. Here we have a negative

8
00:00:29,048 --> 00:00:33,595
one times our rational expression. Well we can just distribute this negative

9
00:00:33,595 --> 00:00:38,330
sign or this negative one to each term and the numerator. This would give us x

10
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:43,559
plus 3 Divided by 3 plus x. This fraction is identical to this rational

11
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,810
expression, so we know it equals 1. For this rational expression, we know that

12
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:53,685
these factors can reduce to 1, but we're left with a negative sign out in front,

13
00:00:53,685 --> 00:00:56,774
or a negative 1 times 1, which is just negative 1.
