00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,099
In the last examples, I showed you
that offsetWidth triggered the forced

2
00:00:04,099 --> 00:00:07,650
synchronous layout when
interleaved with style changes.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,240
There are other properties
that will cause similar issues

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,210
when called at the wrong time.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,850
And you can check
the instructor notes for

6
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:18,310
this blog post from Tony Gentilcore
which has more information.

7
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,870
Essentially it's any property for
which a browser must run layout.

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,090
So anything to do with geometric
information like positions and

9
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,540
dimensions, that can cause a forced
synchronous layout to happen.

10
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,560
And here's something
else about this example.

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,800
Every single paragraph causes layout and
then recalc style.

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,460
Layout, recalc style.

13
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,400
This puts the browser into a cycle where
you read and write a lot of values and

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,620
we call this layout thrashing.

15
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,950
It's where you do a forced synchronous
layout, many times in quick succession.

16
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:56,280
And you would not believe how many
times I see this one out in the wild.

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,029
For instance, check out this.

18
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,460
Insane demo.

19
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,090
Yeah.
Let's record with timeline.

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,430
Do some scrolling.

21
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,100
And then stop.

22
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,310
We're going to switch
on frames with this.

23
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,510
And you can see immediately we're going
way over 30 frames a second line here.

24
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,280
Let's look in here.

25
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,520
Pick any one of these, and

26
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,070
we'll zoom in a little bit more,
with the W key on the keyboard.

27
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,670
And there we go.

28
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,500
A forced synchronous layout there.

29
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,440
We can also look at this
in the Waterfall view.

30
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,420
And notice how,
when we expand the scroll event.

31
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:46,810
You can start to see here, all the
individual forced synchronous layouts.

32
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,000
Each one of these is going to
make us run really slowly.
