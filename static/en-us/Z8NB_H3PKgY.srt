00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,590
Let's talk about how we got that tricky 
last answer.

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:07,390
For composite functions, the domain of f 
composed with g is all the x values in

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:13,930
the domain of g that lead to g of x 
values that are in the domain of f.

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,575
Well, what on earth does that mean? 
That's definitely a mouthful.

5
00:00:17,575 --> 00:00:21,235
But basically it means that in order for 
a number to be in the domain of this

6
00:00:21,235 --> 00:00:24,955
composite function, it must be in the 
domain of the inner function g in this

7
00:00:24,955 --> 00:00:30,340
case, and in the domain of the composite 
function itself.

8
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,470
If we have f of x equals one over x 
squared and g of x equals the square root

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:40,840
of x, then what is f composed with g. 
And what is the domain of that composite function.

10
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,509
Please write this in inequality notation.
