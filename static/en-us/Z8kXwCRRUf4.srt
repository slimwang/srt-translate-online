1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,010
Now you're ready to write
your own delegates.

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:03,860
The challenge up for

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,370
this lesson has three text
fields with customized behavior.

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:12,210
A zip code text field that only allows
digits with a maximum of five digits.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,530
A dollar sign text field that
begins with the text for $0.00, and

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,520
then fills in the dollar
figures as digits are added.

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:24,010
And finally a text field that can only
be edited when this switch is set to on.

8
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:27,530
Here in the first field once I get
to five digits I can't type anymore.

9
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,360
Here in the second field the digits
fill in from right to left.

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,248
And there are always two
digits beyond the decimal.

11
00:00:35,248 --> 00:00:39,500
By the way, don't forget that
Cmd+K toggles the keyboard.

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,140
In the third field, the user has to
flip this switch in order to add text.

13
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,420
You can see that tapping inside the
first two fields brings up the number

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,650
pad instead of the QWERTY keyboard.

15
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,110
You can set this in the attribute
inspector in Storyboard.

16
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,270
Actually, let's open up
the utilities pane and

17
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,070
take a minute to explore
the attribute inspector.

18
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,190
This is a super convenient way to
configure UI kit view components.

19
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,260
Here you can set your placeholder text.

20
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,857
So you might want to to put something
like, Type your zip code here.

21
00:01:07,857 --> 00:01:12,237
Here you can configure the clear button
like the one you saw on the Safari

22
00:01:12,237 --> 00:01:13,740
search bar.

23
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,720
Here you can set capitalization.

24
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,600
If you add something
like a confirmation code,

25
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,390
you might want all characters
to be capitalized.

26
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:24,870
And here's the keyboard type, which for
the zip code we want set to number pad.

27
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,696
And just two more tips before
you move on to the challenge.

28
00:01:27,696 --> 00:01:31,008
You're going to need to set
the delegates for your text fields.

29
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:34,330
If you want to do this in Storyboard
remember your delegate is just

30
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,160
a property.

31
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,131
So you're going to look for it in
Storyboard where you always look for

32
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:40,660
properties, in the pop-up
connections menu.

33
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,920
And here under Outlets you
can see your delegate.

34
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,320
Also, for manipulating text
you might want to revisit

35
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,750
these two lines of code from
the emoji textField delegate.

36
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,795
The end of the string
class has a method named

37
00:01:52,795 --> 00:01:55,250
stringByReplacingCharactersInRange.

38
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,844
It's perfect to use in
a UI text field delegate.

39
00:01:57,844 --> 00:02:01,604
This method is helpful when you need
to build new strings from typed input.

40
00:02:01,604 --> 00:02:06,614
In order to use this method, Swift
strings are usually cast to NSStrings.

41
00:02:06,614 --> 00:02:09,704
In this case the variable newText
represents the text that will

42
00:02:09,704 --> 00:02:10,324
be displayed.
