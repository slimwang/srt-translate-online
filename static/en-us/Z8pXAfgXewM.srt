00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,091
Now, we've already talked about x as the independent variable, and y as the

2
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:08,543
dependent variable, in equations that are written like this. So, we know we can

3
00:00:08,543 --> 00:00:12,764
think about the relationship between x and y, in terms of y depending on x or,

4
00:00:12,764 --> 00:00:17,112
alternatively, x being the cause and y being its effect. But we can also think

5
00:00:17,112 --> 00:00:21,351
about this in terms of input and output. In the soda machine example we looked

6
00:00:21,351 --> 00:00:25,443
at earlier, the input was the amount of money that Athena put in this sort of

7
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:29,800
machine, and the output was the number of soda's that came out of the machine.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,293
So, for an equation like this, which quantity do you think represents the input,

9
00:00:34,293 --> 00:00:37,069
and which one do you think represents the output?
