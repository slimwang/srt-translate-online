1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,830
We've created an initial version of
the Miwok app for you to start off with.

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,340
But don't worry,
there's still plenty left for you to do.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,450
When a professional Android developer
is joining a new project, it's very

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,080
common for the team to already have
an existing app that they're working on.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,360
And it's good practice to learn
how to read an existing code base,

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,240
because often times you won't be
creating a brand new app from scratch.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,670
So follow along with these instructions
to learn how to import the Miwok project

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,520
into the Android Studio
on your computer.

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,650
So first head over to this
GitHub repository link,

10
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:30,200
then click the Download ZIP
button to download the app code.

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,330
Unzip the downloaded
file on your computer so

12
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,260
that you have a Miwok folder.

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,420
Now go ahead and open Android Studio.

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,030
Now choose Import Project and
we downloaded it into

15
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,850
the Downloads folder here and
then click on the project.

16
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,350
It may take some time for the project
to be imported, if you have any issues,

17
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,580
remember to check
the troubleshooting document.

18
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,300
Once your app has successfully imported,
run the app on your Android device,

19
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,140
whether that be a phone,
tablet, or an emulator.

20
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,960
And it sure looks like this screenshot.

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,260
So currently, nothing happens when you
click on any of these categories and

22
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,170
that's expected.

23
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,349
To take a look at the project,
first open the project tab and

24
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,725
here you'll see the file directory.

25
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:07,560
When you're ready and

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,090
maybe done some exploring on your own,
move on to the next quiz.

27
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,980
Let's take a close look at
the code base of the app.

28
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,990
And by code base,
I mean all these files in the app.

29
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,170
Getting comfortable with this will help
us understand why the code looks and

30
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,050
behaves the way it currently does.

31
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:21,675
At this point,

32
00:01:21,675 --> 00:01:25,110
it's totally normal if you feel nervous
about looking at a completely brand new

33
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,500
code base because everything looks
really foreign and there's a lot of it.

34
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,700
So now's a great time for you to
practice the skill of looking through

35
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,630
a new code base with
some guidance from us.
