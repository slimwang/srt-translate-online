1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:06,185
The sample size for the Placebo group is 5. And we'll multiply that by 1.5

2
00:00:06,185 --> 00:00:13,382
minus 1.835, and then square it. Then we'll add the sample size for Drug 1

3
00:00:13,382 --> 00:00:19,770
times the mean for Drug 1 minus the grand means squared. Drug 2 has 7 in the

4
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:26,690
sample, which we'll multiply by the squared deviation. And drug 3 has 4. After

5
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,259
we do all this, we get 5.45.
