1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,755
This is fairly straightforward. We can see that the vertex is at negative 3,

2
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:11,411
negative 1. And if we look at how wide the parabola is, we see that it follows

3
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:17,401
the normal parent parabola. The equation is y plus 1 equals the quantity x plus

4
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:18,267
3 squared.
