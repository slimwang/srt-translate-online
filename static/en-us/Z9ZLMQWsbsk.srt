1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,890
By the time you graduate from
your nanodegree program,

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:06,550
you'll have mastered relevant skills and
learned to work independently, and

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,460
we want to help you get there
as efficiently as possible.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,670
That's why we focus
on learning by doing.

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,320
To graduate,
you'll complete a series of milestones,

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,770
most of which will take
the form of projects.

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,210
You can prepare for
these projects by taking your courses,

8
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,880
although reviewing all of the course
material isn't a graduation requirement.

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,990
If you come in with a ton
of prior experience,

10
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,400
feel free to try jumping
right into the projects.

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,300
However, most students go through
the course material thoroughly

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,460
to make sure they have the skills and

13
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,210
knowledge they need to be successful
in their projects and beyond.
