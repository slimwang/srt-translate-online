1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,340
Now, we're going to talk about
a very different kind of an attack.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:07,550
This is called inference attacks and
that can be performed or

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,810
mounted against databases.

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,340
So the definition of an inference attack
is actually fairly straight-forward.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,420
Inference attacks occur when
somebody's able to use queries

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,040
that they're authorized for, they're
allowed to execute those queries.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:27,020
But by executing those queries, they're
able to gain access to information for

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,190
which they're not authorized.

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,150
They're not allowed to access
that information directly.

10
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,220
So the way they gain access
to that information is by

11
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:39,180
executing a set of queries that are
authorized, and then making an inference

12
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,690
based on the results that
are returned by those queries.

13
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,250
So a concrete example here, since
we're talking to students in a course,

14
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,850
is let's say a database that
contains all your grades.

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,405
So schema, maybe we have an attribute,
that is the studentid,

16
00:00:55,405 --> 00:01:00,625
maybe the student_standing, whether
a junior or senior and then scores.

17
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:03,120
These might be numerical
values between zero and 100,

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,030
let's say, on exam1, exam2 and
then the final_grade.

19
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,860
The tuple, if you look at it, it's
going to have a studentid, either junior

20
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,520
or senior, their standing, the two
exams, course and the final_grade.

21
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,150
So if we consider this database, where
we have a tuple for each student in

22
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:24,210
the class, tuple as we just discussed,
what kind of query can you allow on it

23
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,360
which any user should be allowed to
submit and get the result from it?
