1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,180
The ssh-keygen application can
generate key pairs of various types.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,640
The key you just
generated was an RSA key,

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,330
which is the default type if you don't
specifically define a different type.

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,970
Read through the ssh-keygen man page and

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:21,250
determine what other key types are
supported by the SSH version 2 protocol.
