1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,329
Even if Grant makes 0 glasses wipers, we know that he's going to have to pay

2
00:00:04,341 --> 00:00:08,697
$1,200 for rent each month. So, his expenses are going to start at $1,200 and

3
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:13,207
they continue to increase incrementally for each wiper set he produces. So, we

4
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:17,806
need to include both of these pieces of information in our equation. That means,

5
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:22,411
that this answer choice, 6.5 times number of glasses wiper sets made, can't be

6
00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:27,208
right because it doesn't account for the monthly rent. The first choice here is

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,888
actually not right either because this is saying that for every glasses wiper

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,459
set that Grant makes, he'll pay $1,200. That would be pretty unfortunate for

9
00:00:36,471 --> 00:00:41,264
him, that would be a very, very expensive wiper business. And we also know that

10
00:00:41,276 --> 00:00:45,521
it costs $6.50 not $1,200 to make each wiper set. That leaves us with two more

11
00:00:45,533 --> 00:00:49,678
choices, both of which include 1,200 and 6.5 times the number of glasses wipers

12
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:54,007
made. The difference between these is the sign here. If we pick this third

13
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:58,125
answer choice right here, we'll be seeing that Grant's monthly expenses decrease

14
00:00:58,137 --> 00:01:02,562
because of this negative sign right here. Decrease for every glasses wiper sets

15
00:01:02,574 --> 00:01:07,035
he makes. This would mean that he would actually be making money off of paying

16
00:01:07,047 --> 00:01:11,345
for materials, which doesn't really make sense. That means this answer choice

17
00:01:11,357 --> 00:01:15,550
isn't right either. The last one is correct. Grant will spend a fixed amount of

18
00:01:15,562 --> 00:01:19,430
$1,200 and then, on top of that, he will spend $6.50 for every wiper set he

19
00:01:19,297 --> 00:01:19,297
made.
