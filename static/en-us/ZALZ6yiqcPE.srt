00:00:00,233 --> 00:00:05,032
So this time I would like you to consider the direct implications, again, of the other case.

2
00:00:05,033 --> 00:00:11,899
So what if inverse halt, when run on inverse halt, does not halt? Does that mean that halt of inverse halt and inverse halt

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,499
is yes? Or does it mean that halt of inverse halt and inverse halt is no?

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,400
And again, please just think about the direct implication for the moment here.
