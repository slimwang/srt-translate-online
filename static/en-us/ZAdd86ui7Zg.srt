1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,200
All right. So why projective geometry?

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,880
I'm going to show you some of the math.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,520
All right.

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:12,280
So, what is the geometric intuition of using homogeneous coordinates?

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,700
Well basically, the idea is that we're going from a per ray

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,440
in space is mapped to a point in the image.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,900
So here you see a ray that intersects the image plane at z equals 1.

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,402
And the idea is that every point x, y, so every point x,

9
00:00:32,402 --> 00:00:37,160
y on that image plane at z equals 1, is represented by this ray.

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,720
So you see this ray here, right?

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,650
And it intersects the image plane at x, y, 1.

12
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:47,832
But any point on this ray, sx, sy, s,

13
00:00:47,832 --> 00:00:51,800
would in, intersect the when projected through the center projection,

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,140
would intersect the image plane at the same location.

15
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,710
And that's what it means to be projectively similar.

16
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,200
Okay? And that, that's the, the relationship between, sort of,

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,160
these rays and the points in the image.

18
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:09,040
So, we already know about sort of going between homogeneous coordinates and

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,210
regular coordinates.

20
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:14,250
So in 2D, for example, we take a 2D point, x, y, to make it homogeneous,

21
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,800
we just add a 1 to it and become a homogeneous coordinate.

22
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,940
That last coordinate can be thought of as the thing that tells you

23
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,020
about the scale.

24
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,880
So when you go from homogenous coordinates to regular you just divide by

25
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,940
that scale value, that's what's shown here.

26
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,190
But homogeneous coordinates actually allow us to do a lot more in particular,

27
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,630
they're going to give us natural way of thinking about lines, and

28
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,070
this time we mean two dimensional lines.

29
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,080
So here we have our standard equation for a two dimensional line,

30
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,310
ax plus by plus c equals 0.

31
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:49,140
And what's nice is, in homogeneous coordinates,

32
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,670
it can be thought of as just this dot product, essentially, right?

33
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:58,470
It's a, b, c transpose times x, y, 1, or I should say multiply by x, y, 1.

34
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,260
And, when you think of the line that way, a, b and

35
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,710
c can just be thought of as being the component of the,

36
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:11,250
the unit vector in the direction of the normal between the origin and the line.

37
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,980
And then every point on that line when you dot it with that normal,

38
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,600
has to be a distance d away so that, so that would be minus d.

39
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,970
But the thing to think about also is, it's saying that the normal, a b c

40
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:31,860
is perpendicular to the point x y 1, or to the ray that defines x y 1.

41
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,650
So what's this deal having to do with perpendicu, perpendicularity?

42
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,225
Get that out one word, right?

43
00:02:37,225 --> 00:02:40,780
And in fact this perpendicular relationship is key to,

44
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,970
to using projected geometry to define our, our points and lines.
