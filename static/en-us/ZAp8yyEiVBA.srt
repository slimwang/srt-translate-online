00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,030
So, we just talked about goals and the goal state of the goals.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,800
In order to specify the goal fully, we need to not only specify the goal state,

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,020
but also to specify the initial state.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,030
So, let's do that. Let us suppose that the initial state in this world is,

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,640
that the robot is on the floor. Note, how I'm writing this. On is a predicate,

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,310
that says this is a two [UNKNOWN] and I'm reading this as Robot On Floor. So

7
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:30,900
Robot on Floor, and the Ladder is Dry, and the Ceiling is Dry.

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,460
So, this is the Initial state, this is the Goal State. Now we have

9
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:39,110
fully specified the goal. Let's now ask, how can the robot come up with a plan?
