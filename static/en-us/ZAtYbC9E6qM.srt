00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Up to this point in the unit, we've been talking about very, very structured graphs,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
very clean and organized graphs--things like chains or rings or grids, hypercubes--

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
that have a great deal of structure, and they look very different from the kids of actual

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
social network graphs that you see in the wild.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Regular graphs tend to have little bits of clustering in them

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and some people who are more sparsely connected to some other cluster,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and they start to look a little bit more randomly generated

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
or at least not generated according to a very simple, straightforward rule.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's worthwhile to think about some different ways of randomly generating graphs.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The classic kind of randomly generated graph that's been studied in the mathematics literature

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
is generated according to what's called the ErdĹsâRĂŠnyi model.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let me say a little bit about that now.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We start off and we imagine we have some graph with n nodes

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
or we have some set of n nodes, and we have some probability p,

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
which we'll call the connectivity probability

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and the generation process works like this.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We start off by generating a set of n nodes with no edges at all.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then we loop through all possible pairs of nodes--i, j--

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and we connect i, j, but we only connect them after we flip a coin

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
that comes up heads with probability p.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
If it does come up heads, we connect the pair. Otherwise, we don't.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We can do this for four nodes.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We have to decide whether to connect the first two nodes.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We flip a coin, comes up heads, so we connect them.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Now, we look at the second pair--this one and this one--that also came up heads.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The third pair-- this on and this one--also came up heads.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The next pair is this one and this one--tails. No edge.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This one and this one--heads.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Finally, this one and this one--heads. I think I have a broken coin.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
But anyway, you get the idea that you end up with a graph

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
with some of the edges including and some of the edges not included.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Now, there's lots of interesting mathematical properties that you can derive

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
given the simplicity of this generation process.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You can say--well, what should the probability p be

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
so that the graph is very likely to be connected?

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
There's no disconnected nodes floating off into space

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
or that there's relatively short paths from one node to the next.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
This has been fairly well studied.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Researchers have found, however, that these kinds of randomly generated graphs

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
don't seem to match very well the kinds of social network graphs

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
that you see in practice in the real world.
