1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,920
To test your understanding of this, consider the following snippets taken from

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:08,600
the Oracle documentation of the format method in the Java PrintStream class.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,180
Classify each of these snippets as to the guarantee level.

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:17,320
The first snippet states data formats are not synchronized.

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,690
It is recommended that you create separate format instances for each thread.

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,930
If multiple threads access a format concurrently,

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,480
it must be synchronized externally.

8
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:32,665
The second snippet is a snippet taken directly from the Java code for

9
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:37,420
PrintStream format method, including its arguments and the name of the method.

10
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:42,550
The third snippet comes from the context of the throw's IllegalFormatException.

11
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,320
It states that if a format string contains illegal syntax,

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,820
a format specifier that is incompatible with the given arguments,

13
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,630
insufficient arguments given the format string, or

14
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:57,321
other illegal conditions, then the IllegalFormatException is thrown.
