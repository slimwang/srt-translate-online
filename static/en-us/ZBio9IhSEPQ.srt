1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And only the first answer is correct.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
They are usually easy to implement compared to any other filter.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
They do not scale quadratically, in fact, normally they scale exponetially

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
with the dimensionality of the state space because you need

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
exponentially many particles to fill up the state space.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The filter that scales quadratically is called a Kalman filter,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
but we didn't really talk about it in this class.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
They can only be applied to discrete state spaces is clearly wrong.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We saw how to apply the robot localization

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
which is a continuous real-valued state space,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and because this first one is true, the last one, none of the above, is clearly false.
