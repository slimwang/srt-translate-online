There are actually a ton of different right answers for what h of x could be.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:10,350
The actual equation I graphed over here is h of x equals three halves x cubed.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,918
Instead of this three halves though, you could have any coefficient. Maybe lets

4
00:00:14,918 --> 00:00:20,616
call that coefficient A for now. That's between the values of 1 and 3. We want

5
00:00:20,616 --> 00:00:25,689
h of x to be stretched taller than f of x but not quite as tall as g of x.
