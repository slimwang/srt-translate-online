00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,254
Instead of writing f of x equals the absolute value of x, we could write f of x

2
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:08,274
equals negative x for x is less than 0, and x, for x is greater than or equal

3
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:14,570
to 0. Notice that writing the function in this piecewise form actually tells us

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:19,688
what it means to take the absolute value of a number. The absolute value signs

5
00:00:19,688 --> 00:00:25,290
switch the sign of negative numbers and preserve a value of positive numbers.

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,959
That's pretty cool.
