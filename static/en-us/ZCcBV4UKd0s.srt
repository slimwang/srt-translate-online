00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,705
Lastly, this problem will be a bit more challenging than the others we've done

2
00:00:03,705 --> 00:00:08,210
today. As we're going to use the intermediate value theorem to approximate the

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:13,173
zeros of the following function. Please note that we are calling the

4
00:00:13,173 --> 00:00:20,260
independent variable here p instead of x. Remember that we can use any letters

5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,836
we want.
