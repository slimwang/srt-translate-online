00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,970
So today we've talked about constraint propagation,

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:04,950
which is a method of inference where we assign values to variables to

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,850
satisfy certain external constraints. By doing so, we arrive at

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,030
strong inferences about the problem, like which shapes represent objects, or

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,020
how the words in a sentence interact. After defining constraint propagation,

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,850
we talked about how it can be useful in interpreting images by using prior

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:22,700
knowledge of constraints to anticipate predictable shapes out in the world.

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,830
Then we talked about natural language understanding,

9
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,710
where prior knowledge of the rules of grammar and

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,930
parts of speech allow us to make sense of new sentences. Now,

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,160
constraint propagation is actually an incredibly complex process. We

12
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,250
have numerous constraints for visual scenes and verbal sentences that we haven't

13
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:40,530
discussed here. We all see this constraint propagation in other areas as well,

14
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,500
such as in making sense of auditory and tactile information. Reading braille for

15
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,490
instance, can be seen as an instance of constraint propagation. We'll pick up on

16
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,220
this discussion later when we talk about visual and spatial reasoning.

17
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,200
But this will also come up in our discussion of configuration, which can be

18
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,640
seen as a specific instance of constraint propagation in the context of design.
