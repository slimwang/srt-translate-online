I think it needs to know the persons name, and the persons friends. If it

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,950
stores the names of all the friends, it'll be able to give us back that

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,080
information. A person should also store its own name. We can add other

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,480
interesting facts to the Person object like where they work, or their favorite

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,040
restaurants. But for now just to do these methods, we're going to keep it

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,380
simple. If you feel like customizing your Person class once we've got the

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,793
basics working, go wild.
