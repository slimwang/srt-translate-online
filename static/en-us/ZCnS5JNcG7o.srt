1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay, so what we're going to do intuitively is

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
we're going to add a new vertex to the graph, and then we're going to add an edge

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
from all of the current vertices in the graph to the new vertex.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And then we're simply going to return the result

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
of graph is 4colorable of this new graph.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So we construct a new graph, which is just an empty list in this case,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and then for every node in the original graph, we add in an additional 1.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Since this is an adjacency matrix, that means that there is an additional vertex

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
that every single node in this graph is connected to, like I just said.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We're going to append this new node to each row in the adjacency matrix.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Then, we're going to append a column of 1's at the end of this graph

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
of the adjacency matrix, and this represents the vertex that is connected to

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
every other vertex, which is what we've just constructed.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And then we take this new graph, and we simply run it through graph is 4colorable.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So we've reduced the 3colorable problem to the 4colorable problem.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,500
And, by the definition of NP completeness, that means that the 4colorable problem

17
00:01:08,500 --> 99:59:59,999
is also NP-complete.
