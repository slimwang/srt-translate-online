Before we get to our next word problem, let's learn about perimeter. You might

2
00:00:03,922 --> 00:00:07,816
already know what this word means, but if you don't, I'm sure you'll be able to

3
00:00:07,828 --> 00:00:11,643
figure it out. For example, for this triangle, I know that the perimeter is 15

4
00:00:11,655 --> 00:00:15,674
centimeters. For this rectangle, I have sides of 2 units in length, and a width

5
00:00:15,686 --> 00:00:19,956
of w. I don't know the width. The expression for this perimeter is 4 plus 2 w.

6
00:00:20,054 --> 00:00:24,102
And I don't know the units for this perimeter, so I'm going to write the word

7
00:00:24,114 --> 00:00:28,273
units. It could be meters, centimers, or even inches. So, what do you think

8
00:00:28,285 --> 00:00:32,649
perimeter means? Try and find the expressions for the perimeters for these two

9
00:00:32,661 --> 00:00:35,278
shapes. You can write your answers in the boxes.
