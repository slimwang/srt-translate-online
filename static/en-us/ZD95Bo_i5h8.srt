1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's write out one way to do it together.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We're definitely going to need an if statement to tell the difference

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
between whether state is already in chart sub index and whether it's not.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Let me do the hard case first.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'll check to see if that state is in the list returned by chart bracket index.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
If it's not, we have to add it.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
One way to add an element to a list is to make a list out of it

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and use list concatenation or list append.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Here, whatever chart[index] used to contain, we add that to the list containing just state,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and we store the result.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In this case we return true.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Otherwise it's already there, so I should not do any updates.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'll just return false immediately.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The key tricks--I have to check to see if state is in chart sub index,

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and if it's not, I have to make a bigger list that contains all the old stuff we used to have

16
00:00:53,000 --> 99:59:59,999
plus the new state we're being asked to add.
