1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And yes, you'll steer in proportion to the crosstrack error,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,000
which means the larger the error, the more you're willing to turn towards the target trajectory.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You can see that this works. As you get closer to trajectory, your steering will be slower and slower.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You will reach the trajectory.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Clearly the other two answers are really bad.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
A constant steering will put you in a circle and not in a straight line.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Random steering, if you ever implement this, is a really bad idea.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Believe me. We accidentally did this once.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It's a really bad idea.
