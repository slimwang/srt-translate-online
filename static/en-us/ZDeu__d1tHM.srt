00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,000
You now know the basics of finding,
installing and enabling a plugin.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,607
I've provided you a link in the notes,
but the search for

3
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:10,247
autoprefixer plus gulp on Google would
have reveled the MPM plugin right away,

4
00:00:10,247 --> 00:00:12,064
and installation process is the same.

5
00:00:12,064 --> 00:00:15,360
MPM installer gulp-autoprefixer
in the terminal.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,050
And in a requirement of the gulp file.

7
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,400
Here's the key part.

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,250
The autoprefixer object is just
another receiver of a pipe dream.

9
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:23,980
Pipe stream.

10
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,070
I was just testing if
you're listening closely.

11
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,200
And since we already have
a pipe coming from Sass,

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,390
we simply add a new line right before
it arrives at its destination.

13
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,680
Like so.

14
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,620
Almost there.

15
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,156
We finally insert a configuration object
to specify the browser's option of

16
00:00:37,156 --> 00:00:41,770
autoprefixer, which tells autoprefixer
for which browser versions to prefix.

17
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:42,390
In this case,

18
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,760
we'll just instruct it to use the last
two versions of every popular browser.

19
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:52,320
And as step two of three, see the filter
property used on the image in main.scss?

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,130
Remove the prefix,
then rerun gulp styles in the terminal.

21
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:00,120
And here's the generated CSS file
with all the right prefixes.

22
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:00,620
Excellent.
