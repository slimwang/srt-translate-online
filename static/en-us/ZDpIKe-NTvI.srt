00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,120
This was another trick question because looking at this code alone,

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,650
it would be hard to answer the question of how our callback will get

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,350
called since we can't see the function indication here.

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,010
In order to answer this question, we actually need to look at

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,660
either the source code or the documentation for setTimeout.
