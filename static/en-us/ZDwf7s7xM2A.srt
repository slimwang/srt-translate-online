00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,201
Our equation for profit is looking really good. Except, right now, I have no

2
00:00:04,201 --> 00:00:08,526
idea what m is equal to. Remember that m is just the money that Grant has spent.

3
00:00:08,526 --> 00:00:12,942
Now, we've talked many times before about how the money that Grant spends is

4
00:00:12,942 --> 00:00:17,492
going to be a combination of fixed costs, like his rent, for example, and costs

5
00:00:17,492 --> 00:00:22,219
that scaled the number of items that he makes or the manufacturing costs. Let's

6
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:27,029
say that each glasses wiper set costs $10 to make, and that Grant makes exactly

7
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:31,556
as many wiper sets as he sells. In addition, all these fixed costs together,

8
00:00:31,556 --> 00:00:35,937
equal $20,000 per month. If all of this is the case, then how shall we change

9
00:00:35,937 --> 00:00:40,365
the equation for Grant's profit each month? I'd like you to first calculate m,

10
00:00:40,365 --> 00:00:44,397
the money that Grant spends each month, and then plug this value for n into the

11
00:00:44,397 --> 00:00:48,410
equation that we had for p before. Then, simplify to get your final answer. I

12
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:52,253
know this is a lot to think about in one problem and there are several steps

13
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:56,782
here. So, just make sure you go through things slowly, take everything one step

14
00:00:56,782 --> 00:01:00,212
at a time, and write all of your work down on a piece of paper.
