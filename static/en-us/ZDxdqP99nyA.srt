1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:00,600
[INAUDIBLE].

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,670
So we have the details screen up and
running, sort of.

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:09,010
And, well, basically what I want to be
able to do is edit shopping list names.

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,440
I mistype texts all the time.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,290
If I accidentally type something like,
I don't know, grassery list or

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,020
shipping list, I should be able to
change it before all of my friends see.

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,320
>> I know what you mean,
I'm all thumbs sometimes.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,130
>> So, could I ask a favor?

9
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,120
>> Go for it.

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,450
>> So while I'm busy creating
the different screens for

11
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,210
the app maybe you could
chat with the developer.

12
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,570
Kind of get them up to speed on all
the ways you can write data in Firebase.

13
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,920
>> Sounds good let me pull up my screen.

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,490
There are five write and
remove methods for Firebase,

15
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,800
depending upon what you want to do.

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,310
The four write methods are, setValue,
which is the most basic write operation.

17
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:49,180
It writes or replaces data at
the specified database location,

18
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,270
replacing any existing
data at that path.

19
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,080
Update children, which is a method used
when you want to write to specific

20
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,400
children of a parent node but
without overriding other child nodes.

21
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,720
Push, the push method
adds to a list of data.

22
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,210
A unique ID is generated by
push based on the timestamp

23
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:11,260
each time a new child is added to
a specified database reference.

24
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,830
This allows multiple clients to
add children to the same location

25
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,165
at the same time without
any write conflicts.

26
00:01:18,165 --> 00:01:21,130
Run transaction is used for
complicated data.

27
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,515
For example, when there
are multiple concurrent operations.

28
00:01:24,515 --> 00:01:27,644
Using this method keeps data from
being corrupted when you have

29
00:01:27,644 --> 00:01:30,550
multiple people updating
a single object like a counter.

30
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,640
In addition to the four write
methods the remove value method

31
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,317
allows you to delete data
at a specified location.

32
00:01:42,317 --> 00:01:43,144
In addition to the four write methods
the remove value method allows

33
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:43,649
you to delete data at
a specific location.
