1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,500
We've been doing mostly our projected geometry here thinking about images, so

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,320
we're talking about 2D projective geometry, so

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,010
our homogenous coordinates are three long.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,450
Well you can naturally extend this to 3D as well.

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:18,950
Remember the equation of a plane AX plus BY plus CZ eq, plus D equals 0.

6
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:24,600
So the homogenous coordinate is now just a four vector, wx, wy, wz, w.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,780
But of course we've already seen that right?

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,420
When I, when we first introduced extrinsic coordinates and

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,010
we talked about combining rotation and

10
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,750
translation, we introduced this notion of the four vector.

11
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:42,470
And so in the two dimensional case we had a duality between points and

12
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:47,230
lines, because they were both represented by four dimensional vectors.

13
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:54,220
In 3D, we have a duality between a plane, whose normal is a, b, c, d.

14
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,980
Okay, that's the dot product.

15
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,850
Is represented by a four vector and a point.

16
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:05,160
So instead of points and lines like it is in 2D, it's points and plains in 3D.

17
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,620
And the projective transforms, instead of 3 by 3 are just 4 by 4.

18
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,480
So I wrote here that P prime equals TP, okay.

19
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,790
Well, that's just the 4 by 4 transformations that we had seen before.

20
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,830
So we've, since we've already seen that,

21
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,100
we're not going to talk much more about it.

22
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,360
Going forward, like I said, we'll talk about fundamental, fundamental matrix,

23
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,760
we'll talk about projective geometry in the 2D case using the three vectors.
