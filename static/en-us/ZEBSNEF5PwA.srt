1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now it's quiz time just to show that a lot of your knowledge about Python's grammar

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and the grammar fragment I showed you before, will translate into you being able

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
to write JavaScript expression.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I've written here four JavaScript expressions--a, b, c, and d--

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and each one contains a blank.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'd like you to fill in each blank with a single token, a single terminal,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
that causes the entire expressions to evaluate to True. Try it out.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This is a bit of a puzzle, and you'll sort of have to work backwards.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
What would this blank have to be for 1 plus a blank to be equal to 2?
