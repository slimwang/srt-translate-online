1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,926
And I'd prefer number 2. Any of these could be correct, especially depending on

2
00:00:03,926 --> 00:00:06,960
how close you live to a beach and how nice the weather is today, but I'm going

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,583
to suggest that we do number 2. And the reason that we do number 2, rather than,

4
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:14,416
refining next day, is I like to procrastinate. The grungy work of dealing with

5
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:18,126
all the complexity of real months. Let's put that off till later. The advantage

6
00:00:18,126 --> 00:00:21,722
of doing 2 first is we'll have a lot of confidence we're on the right track if

7
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:25,090
this works. We'll be very close. We'll be getting approximate answers. We'll see

8
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,372
that we're on the right track. And then, we can figure out those details but we

9
00:00:28,372 --> 00:00:32,162
won't need to change this code later. So, let's go ahead and see if we can write

10
00:00:32,162 --> 00:00:35,974
days between dates using the next day procedure. We won't get exact answers that

11
00:00:35,974 --> 00:00:39,429
are correct here because our next day procedure is not quite correct.
