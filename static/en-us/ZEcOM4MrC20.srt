1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,370
We set our goals in the beginning
because they will effect the rest of

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,880
the decisions we make.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,610
For example, if our goal is related
to brand awareness, we may choose to

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,790
advertise on bill boards and the online
equivalent of bill boards, display ads.

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,690
If you goal is driving more traffic
to your website, you'll probably

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,290
focus your advertising with online
ads with clear call to action.

If your goals are very specific
to one segment or audience or

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,680
location, then you may choose some
local channels to advertise on.

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,159
It might hanging posters
in the local dog park.

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,900
Or having your online ad on
the homepage of a local popular

12
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,530
business in your town.

13
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,255
For us one of the goals we have set for

14
00:00:38,255 --> 00:00:43,368
Abarkment is to increase traffic of
dogs owners to our website 5% monthly.

15
00:00:43,368 --> 00:00:45,920
That means that we're going to
focus our marketing plan on

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,960
online ads that target
our niche audience.

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,860
We might also produce a funny video,
fancy dogs, and a call to action at

18
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,910
the end that says, receive our
promotional offer or a launch special.

19
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,180
And then we're just going to
hope the video goes viral and

20
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,070
we get even more customers.

21
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,570
Now, for our goal or brand awareness,

22
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,170
we'd probably prefer to use display
ads on dog related websites.

23
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,910
Or run a Facebook, Pinterest, or

24
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,550
a Google+ campaign inside
dog owner communities.
