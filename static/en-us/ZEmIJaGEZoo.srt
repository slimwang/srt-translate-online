1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,969
With effort to expectation
generation just a while back

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:05,550
let's look into it more deeply.

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,160
So when we actually
interact with the world

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,230
sometimes things do not happen
the way we expect them to happen.

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,550
And sometimes things happen
that people are not expecting.

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,110
But how do we know what to expect and
what not to expect?

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,940
So consider a situation like this.

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,530
This is an instance of a script.

9
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,400
In this particular case,
I have gone to Olive Garden.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,310
And the waiter is Andrew.

11
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,500
So I move to a table and
I sit down at the table.

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,460
And now Andrew sees me.

13
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:39,460
So from my perspective, I am expecting
Andrew to come to me and give me a menu.

14
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,659
But supposing this never happens.

15
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,690
I am sitting there waiting for
Andrew, or someone else, to come, and

16
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,750
no one comes.

17
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,560
That's an expectation violation.

18
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,630
So I know something has gone awry.

19
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,760
The reason I know that is because
I continued expectations using

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,300
the scripts,
expectations that are never fulfilled.

21
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,790
Now consider an alternate situation.

22
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:02,160
Instead of Andrew coming to my table and
giving me a menu, Andrew comes to me and

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,190
gives me a bill right away.

24
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,320
Well I should think that I
would be surprised by that.

25
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,380
That was an unexpected
event that occurred.

26
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,830
Well several questions arise here.

27
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,380
First, could this be the beginning
of theory of surprise?

28
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,060
In both cases, we were surprised.

29
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,640
In one case where Andrew did
not come and give a menu.

30
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,440
In the second case, when Andrew came and
gave a bill instead of giving the menu.

31
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,590
On second notice, a surprise,
it has two sides to it.

32
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,640
One, when things do not happen
the way we expect them to happen.

33
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,480
And the other,

34
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,840
when things happen the way in which
we were not expecting them to happen.

35
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,390
This example shows, that scripts not
only tell us what to make sense of

36
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,980
the world around us, they also tell us
what to expect and what not to expect.

37
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,220
And that's a powerful idea.

38
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,630
>> So it seems like another example
where this happens really strongly,

39
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:53,090
that we encounter fairly frequently,
is if you've ever seen a horror movie.

40
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,760
One thing that horror
movies really do really,

41
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,650
really well is they lure you into
expecting one thing to happen

42
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,810
only to throw something
completely different at you.

43
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,830
So they lure you into kind of a false
sense of security in expecting that

44
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,550
nothing bad is going to happen in a
particular scene, and then suddenly they

45
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,960
throw a ghost at you from offscreen and
it kind of startles you.

46
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,410
And the reason it startles you is
because it violates your expectations

47
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,300
for what were going to happen next.

48
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,390
>> David, that's a good point,

49
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,690
that it happens in many
different kinds of movies.

50
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,210
So when I go and
see a science fiction movie, or

51
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,840
even a romance movie,
I'm expecting certain things to happen.

52
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,930
And sometimes I think a movie is
really good if it is new and novel and

53
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,088
different and
it offers some surprising things.

54
00:02:30,088 --> 00:02:33,400
Notice that this could also be
the beginning of a theory of creativity.

55
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,030
In the last lesson we were
talking about balance and humor.

56
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,242
No we're talking about surprises.

57
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:44,350
Some current theories of creativity say
that a situation is creative if it is A,

58
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:48,930
novel, B, if it is useful or
valuable in some way, and

59
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,000
C, if it is unexpected or surprising.

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,760
Now, this begins to capture at
least one of those three dimensions

61
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,070
of unexpectedness or surprise,
and that's an important part.

62
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,710
We'll return to computational
creativity at the end of this course,

63
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,600
when we'll talk a lot
more about these issues.
