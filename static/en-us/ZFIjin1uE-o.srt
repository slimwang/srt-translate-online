00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's probe your knowledge of interpreting HTML

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and JavaScript and evaluating expressions.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here I've written four claims.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We can interpret an expression by recursivly walking its abstract syntax tree.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
To interpret the HTML we covered in class,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
we need an environment.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
To interpret the JavaScript we covered in class,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
we need an environment.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And finally, interpreting always produces a value or an error.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Mark each one that's true.
