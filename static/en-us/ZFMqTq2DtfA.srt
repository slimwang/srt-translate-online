1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,510
All right,
now you're done with lesson two.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:06,120
In this lesson, you added
a SQLiteDatabase to your Android app.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,890
You learned how to enter data into
the database, and also query for

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:12,960
it so that you could
display the data in the UI.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,160
You created a Pet DBHelper class to
create and maintain the database.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,747
And you also interacted with Android
framework classes like SQLiteDatabase

7
00:00:20,747 --> 00:00:21,740
and cursor.

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,400
So, great job.
