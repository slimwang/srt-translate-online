00:00:01,449 --> 00:00:02,028
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,028 --> 00:00:04,990
In the last lesson,
you got a basic understanding for

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,609
how data is represented and
stored in the variables.

4
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:11,989
But what good is that data
if you can't put it to use?

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,080
>> When you're writing code,
the main goal is to solve a problem.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,490
The steps your code takes to solve
a problem is known as an algorithm.

7
00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:23,309
Ultimately, for any code that you write,
you will be breaking down a problem

8
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:26,629
into an algorithm that is
executed by a computer.

9
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:28,849
>> Let me try explaining it another way.

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:29,860
Let's imagine you're the computer.

11
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:34,200
Do you remember the last time you had to
decide whether to purchase something?

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,050
How did you solve that problem?

13
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:39,149
Besides figuring out if you
really wanted or needed the item,

14
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:41,979
your decision to purchase the item was
ultimately dependent on whether or

15
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:44,500
not you had enough money to purchase it.

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,130
So you ask yourself, self, do I have
enough money to purchase this item?

17
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,950
If you answered, yes,
then you purchase the item.

18
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,650
But if you answered, no,
then you didn't purchased the item.

19
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:57,229
The process you went through in
your head to solve that problem,

20
00:00:57,229 --> 00:00:59,579
and the steps you took
in order to do so,

21
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,879
is really what's at
the heart of writing code.

22
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,339
And that's what you'll be
learning in this lesson.

23
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:06,480
>> Up next, you'll see a flowchart.

24
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,170
A flowchart is just a diagram for
how to solve a problem.

25
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,400
Take a look at it, and
try to answer the next question.
