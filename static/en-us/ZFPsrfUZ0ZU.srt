1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,689
So as a reminder, we are specifically concerned about whether or not sleep

2
00:00:04,702 --> 00:00:09,610
influences memory. But we've identified all these other variables that could

3
00:00:09,622 --> 00:00:14,540
influence memory. Now it's time for a quiz. So, would you trust this data more

4
00:00:14,622 --> 00:00:19,445
If you knew that everyone had taken this test at the same time of day, meaning

5
00:00:19,457 --> 00:00:24,160
the same time of day for everyone's respective time zones. So, for example,

6
00:00:24,267 --> 00:00:29,205
someone in India took it at 5 o'clock their time, same as someone in California

7
00:00:29,217 --> 00:00:32,025
who took it at 5 o'clock their time. Yes or no?
