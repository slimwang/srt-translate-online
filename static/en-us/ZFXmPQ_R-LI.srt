1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,710
Another part of it is the size
of the patch we've used.

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:05,110
We've looked at patches, and scale and
all that kind of stuff here.

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:09,150
If I have a smaller patch here
would result in much lower,

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,510
disparity calculations,

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,500
much smoother disparity when you
actually move to a bigger patch.

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,880
And you can see that more
information is available and

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,940
smooth information available.

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,320
In some areas but that might not
be the case across the board.

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,220
So here for example you see
a lot more finer detail, and

10
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,110
here you see a lot of
smoothness going on.

11
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,990
So, patches, and again refer, I refer
you back to all of the lectures we've

12
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,090
looked at on trying to deal with
frequencies and stuff like that, that

13
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,500
could be used, and scaling and using
pyramids and stuff could help with this.

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,648
And again, there are lots of other
methods that I'm not covering today

15
00:00:39,648 --> 00:00:42,770
actually you can lookup that tell you
more about how to do this kind of

16
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,203
disparity calculation
from surrogate pairs.
