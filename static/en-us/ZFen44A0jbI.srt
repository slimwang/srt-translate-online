We just talked about how the Pythagorean theoem says that if you have a right

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:08,234
triangle, and you square the shortest side, and add to that the square of the

3
00:00:08,246 --> 00:00:12,435
second shortest side, then what you get as the sum is the square of the longest

4
00:00:12,447 --> 00:00:16,636
side of the triangle. The longest side of a right triangle is also known as the

5
00:00:16,648 --> 00:00:20,837
hypoteneuse, that's a word you may have heard before. What I would like you to

6
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:26,587
tell me is how long the hypoteneus of this triangle is. Should this question

7
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:33,064
mark be replaced by 225, 15, 12, 9 root 3, 9 root 2, or 9?
