00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,480
Earlier, I told you that database
tables were a lot like the tables you

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,570
might see in an infographic or
a reference book.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,390
There are some differences though.

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,190
One of these is important when there
are multiple answers to a question,

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,230
which will often be the case just before
we use a count or another aggregation.

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,260
This table is about animals and
what they eat.

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,130
Unlike some tables we've seen before,
this one sometimes has

8
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:25,790
the same value in some of the cells
with different values over here.

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:30,530
This is how we say things like
brown bears eat fish and meat and

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,540
plants in a database table.

11
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,780
We split that sentence out
into multiple sentences,

12
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,200
which make multiple rows in the table.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,630
Why don't we just make
multiple columns or

14
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,790
put several values in one column
separated with commas or something?

15
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,010
There are lots of
reasons not to do that.

16
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,620
If we tried using multiple columns for
the different foods each animal eats,

17
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,570
we wouldn't know how many
columns to make in advance.

18
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,370
Some animals do eat a lot more kinds
of foods than others after all.

19
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:01,120
And what's more, we want to be able
to use counts and other aggregations.

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,090
And those will only work if we have
our data separated out into rows,

21
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:04,809
not jammed together.

22
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,606
Now let's take a look at a real
database query against this table.

23
00:01:08,606 --> 00:01:14,700
Select food from diet where
species equals orangutan.

24
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,640
This looks almost like ordinary English,
but

25
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,190
this is actually an SQL database query.

26
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:23,370
It's asking the database to return
particular data from the diet table.

27
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,480
In a moment, we'll run this
query using an actual database.

28
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,910
But before we do,
can you figure out which rows and

29
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,630
which columns from this
table it will return?
