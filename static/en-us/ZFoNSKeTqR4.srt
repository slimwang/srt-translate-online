1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,180
Let's begin working on the final project. Now, there is

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,380
a link in the instructor notes that describes the final project

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,200
in detail and if you go through it, you will realize

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,930
that there are three main steps in accomplishing the final project.

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,378
The first thing you have to do is come up with

6
00:00:15,378 --> 00:00:18,905
an idea or a problem statement for your project. Here, you

7
00:00:18,905 --> 00:00:22,087
can choose to enhance any one of the projects that we

8
00:00:22,087 --> 00:00:25,343
built in class together or you can choose to work with

9
00:00:25,343 --> 00:00:28,451
any one of the modules, or external packages that

10
00:00:28,451 --> 00:00:31,707
are available within Python,or you can come up with

11
00:00:31,707 --> 00:00:35,282
an original idea for the project, yourself. The second

12
00:00:35,282 --> 00:00:38,355
step is for you to create a solution design.

13
00:00:38,355 --> 00:00:41,930
Now,here you will identify all of the steps that

14
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,100
will take you to create the final projects. These

15
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,500
steps can be in plain and simple English for

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,520
now. The final step is for you to begin

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,780
programming, so you can realize your project.

18
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,740
By the way, all of these instructions that

19
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,140
I am giving here are also available

20
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,410
in the project description document, which is in

21
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,740
the instructor notes,so I invite you to

22
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,099
go to that document now, please make sure

23
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,140
you check this box, to let us

24
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,930
know that you've read through the project description.
