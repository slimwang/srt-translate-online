1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:02,422
Okay, thanks Ankur.

2
00:00:02,422 --> 00:00:06,349
Yes, I'll try to use less global
variables in the course code.

3
00:00:06,349 --> 00:00:08,609
I understand, thank you so much, bye.

4
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:11,589
Sorry, guys,

5
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:15,199
I just got off the phone with my friend
Ankur on the developer relations team.

6
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:18,149
He's one of the gurus that makes our
developer documentation useful for,

7
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:19,179
you among other things.

8
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,420
He's in Australia.

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,088
And he says tomorrow's
going to be a sunny day.

10
00:00:24,088 --> 00:00:26,541
Get it?
Because Australia's like 17 hours ahead

11
00:00:26,542 --> 00:00:27,530
of California?

12
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:28,190
Like in the future?

13
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,250
Okay, let's practice
using the timezone API.

14
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,746
Assuming we are making
the requests on April 1st,

15
00:00:35,746 --> 00:00:39,580
2016, find out the timezone for
these coordinates.

16
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:41,969
What was the timezone?
