1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,840
Having figured this out, of course, Bob and Carol are both very, very happy--

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,020
not because they've actually solve their problem but now they know at least they can collaborate.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:14,070
They've basically double their chances, so if any one of them finds a bit algorithm for their problem,

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,240
they will know they have a good polynomial time algorithm for both of their problems.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,380
Alice also arrives to the meeting, and of course, Alice is very excited

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,100
to hear about their discovery that Bob and Carol have made.

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,790
Alice, of course, is hoping that maybe she can also find a connection of her problem

8
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:33,500
to Bob and Carol's problem or at least that they can help her find

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,220
a good algorithm for her problem by brainstorming.

10
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:40,540
Alice explains her problem using the graph terminology as well, so Alice's problem

11
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:50,010
as you will remember is to find a set of vertices so that all of the edges are covered in a network here.

12
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,030
For example if you take these three, then each edge has at least one endpoint

13
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,510
in those set of green vertices here.

14
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,820
The input for Alice's problem is again a graph with n vertices and the output is the smallest

15
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:09,620
set of vertices such that all edges are covered, and of course, you know what I mean by covered.

16
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,740
By covered I mean that each edge has at least one n point in the set of vertices.

17
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,630
Then we should give that problem a name to refer to it such as Bob was working on clique

18
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,120
and Carol was working on independent set.

19
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,980
We have Alice working on her problem, and since she is using the vertices to cover the edges,

20
00:01:26,980 --> 99:59:59,999
we'll call her problem vertex cover.
