00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,690
Check out this CSS code
from Coca Cola's website.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:04,612
Looks intense.

3
00:00:04,612 --> 00:00:09,130
Before you'll be able to write CSS
code like this, you first need to

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:13,790
understand the basic building blocks
that make up a single CSS statement.

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,070
All CSS begins with what
is known as a rule set.

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,000
A rule set is made up of two parts,
a selector, which is the code that

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,610
selects the HTML elements that you want
to style, and a declaration block,

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:31,590
which is the code that describes the
styles you want to apply to said HTML.

9
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,639
Declarations are the lines of code
written inside the curly braces.

10
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:41,040
As an example, let's look at
this simple unstyled web page.

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,570
On the left, I have my web page, and
on the right, I have my code for

12
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,840
the web page.

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,820
Remember how the head of
the page is used used for

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,070
the meta-information about the site?

15
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:55,300
Style is one of the pieces of
information that goes inside the head.

16
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,940
Anything that goes inside
these style tags is CSS.

17
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:03,480
For this example, I'll start by
typing p, followed by some braces,

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,740
then color: blue, and ending with a ;.

19
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,420
This p is our selector.

20
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,384
It is telling the browser,
I want to select all the p tags, or

21
00:01:15,384 --> 00:01:17,458
paragraph tags, on the page.

22
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:20,515
The code inside the curly
braces is our declaration.

23
00:01:20,515 --> 00:01:27,190
It reads, color: blue;.

24
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:30,940
In this line color is the property
we want to change and

25
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,050
blue is the value we want to pass to it.

26
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,250
This is how CSS works for
every property.

27
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:41,810
You pass it a value, like blue, and the
value describes how the browser should

28
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,930
render the property for the element.

29
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,790
Properties are always
written in plain English.

30
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:51,360
And they identify a feature of an HTML
element that you want to change.

31
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,440
So let's see what this page
looks like after I add this CSS.

32
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:01,260
I'll just Save, and let me go refresh
my page and voila, there you go.

33
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,840
When I added the CSS to the web page,
the color of the font and

34
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,750
the paragraph tags changed to blue.
