1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
In all of this, changes in size, changes in language,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
changes in speed, or changes in the program itself

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
are all obstacles for record, replay, reproduction

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
of graphical user elements.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
A better option is to have the GUI elements themselves do the recording.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That is, when I'm clicking in here

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
the search button knows it has been pressed, and what I am recording

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
right now is not the fact that I clicked in this particular area of the screen,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
but what is recorded right now is that the search button has been pressed.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Likewise, if we enter text in this field, what will be recorded is that

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
in the URL GUI element, the text foo was entered.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This way, if anything in the resolution changes or if the position changes,

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
the events will still be tied to the GUI elements,

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and therefore, our recording becomes independent

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
of the actual rendering on the screen.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This of course is also true for rearrangements as long as

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
the identifiers of the GUI elements stay the same,

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
we'll still be able to replay earlier logs even though many details,

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
in terms of the rendering, have changed.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The best capture replay tools offer facilities to record

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and replay at the low levels.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
That is, mouse clicks and keystrokes,

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
but also facilities to replay at higher levels.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That is, directing some input specifically toward

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
some element of the graphical user interface.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
For web pages, the Selenium Toolkit offers

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
a nice mix of multiple abstraction layers.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Check out what kind of tools are available for your specific environment

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and test them thoroughly before making a purchase.
