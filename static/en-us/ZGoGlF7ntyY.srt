1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,650
We're not quite done however, so far we've been in the,

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,160
we've been engaged in building the state chart model. Once the modeling is over,

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,930
the resulting stays sharp but still be validated.

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,760
There are various ways we could, we could perform this check.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,980
We could hold a review that is get a team of people involved in.

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:22,680
I'll walk through the use cases and make sure that each of the concurrent

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,040
machines is doing what you would expect it to do. You could do model checking.

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:32,970
Model checking is a, is an automated technique where you can

9
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:40,710
encode all of the concurrent state machines and any

10
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,790
questions or tests. You'd like to determine whether or

11
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:51,365
not the state machine can ever happen in the state machines and then you can run

12
00:00:51,365 --> 00:00:56,940
what's called a model checker to determine whether those things can ever happen.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,910
And we could even and this is similar to but he could have a separate,

14
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:06,682
we could build a simulator of the execution using some kind of

15
00:01:06,682 --> 00:01:11,230
state chart interpreter, which probably others as, as well, including going

16
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:16,030
back to the users with any questions that arise during this validation process.
