1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,010
Remember to think about touch points
when thinking about partnerships.

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,760
What are the touch points you
have with your customers?

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,840
When is it that you're going to be
in contact with your customers?

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,620
You're going to need to use your deep
understanding of your customers to help

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,820
you figure this out.

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,540
Think about their lifestyle or other
general information you have about them.

7
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,920
Now for us with The Bark Vet, we know
that our customers need us when they

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,560
travel and obviously when
they're looking for dog sitters.

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,190
So traveling and being out of town
are good touch points for us.

10
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,890
So we need to look at
partnerships related to travel.

11
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,810
This could be vacations or
business travel, travel by plane,

12
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:41,980
travel by train, travel by car or
booking hotels and other accommodations.

13
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,930
These are all potential
touchpoints with our customers.

14
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,260
So, for our Landing Page Content,

15
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,940
we're going to need to show a clear
value proposition that interests people.

16
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:51,820
Let's break this down.

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,540
Think about what problems
you're solving for them.

18
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,670
Now, you should already know this
after going through value proposition

19
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,120
in lesson one.

20
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,030
Our main value for
Obarkment is our quality.

21
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,570
So, the quality in this sitter and

22
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,270
the quality in the location
your dog will be staying.

23
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,650
With a high end dog sitting service.

24
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,490
You also need a notification form or
call to action.

25
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,850
It needs to be really obvious
where call to action is or

26
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,050
where the notification form is.

27
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:20,920
It has to be clear and simple where
they can subscribe, give their email, or

28
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,710
download your app.
