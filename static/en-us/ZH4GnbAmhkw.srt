1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is 0.64.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The reason is that 0.04 is the product of two Ps of two independent flips,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
so we have to take the square root of 0.04, which is 0.02, to find out what P is.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Now heads has a probability of 0.2 and tails has a probability of 0.8.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Doing this twice is 0.8 times 0.8, which gives us 0.64.
