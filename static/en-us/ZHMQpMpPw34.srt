1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,380
So this is the Foot Finder in action.

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:05,860
We have the title up here, a placeholder
for where the image will go, and

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,680
then the fields for searching by phrase,
latitude, and longitude.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,440
And there are search
buttons here on the right.

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,200
So I'm going to start
with a phrase search.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,070
I want to see an image for

7
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:20,460
my favorite baseball team,
which are the Atlanta Braves.

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,970
And here's a shot against
the San Diego Padres of the stadium.

9
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,180
So that's nice.

10
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,730
Pretty good seats.

11
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,725
And there is I'm not even
going to pronounce his name.

12
00:00:29,725 --> 00:00:32,009
That's probably one of
our minor league players.

13
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,810
So now, let's search by longitude and
latitude.

14
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,180
I'm going to use 37 for the latitude.

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,230
And negative 119 for the longitude.

16
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,940
Those are roughly the coordinates
of Yosemite National Park.

17
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,800
I looked those up ahead of time.

18
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,870
So I'm going to play around with this.

19
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,740
See if we can't get,
looks like a squirrel here.

20
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,430
See if we can get a picture
of the mountain range and

21
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,300
all the other pretty scenery out there.

22
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,140
Just something big,
kind of landscape shot.

23
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,710
Hm, so it does say Yosemite.

24
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,360
I'm not sure how that's related.

25
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,060
There we go.
So, upper Yosemite Falls trail,

26
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,880
Yosemite National Park,
California, June 2014.

27
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,560
So, as you can see our fray search and
our latitude and

28
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,750
longitude search appear to be working
well, so this is flip finder and

29
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,430
this is simple, compact, fun, you know.

30
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,290
So let's build it.
