1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So Google Search was a very simple multi-sided market--just two sides.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
There were users, and there were payers.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
But can the canvas actually work

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
with something more complicated, like in the life sciences?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So here's an example of a business model canvas from a life sciences company

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
that was going to provide E. coli cell lines for simplified downstream processing.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And they said, "Oh, our customer segment is segmented in niche marketing."

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Now, in hindsight, after the end of the class, they were the ones

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
who actually went in and said, "Well, yeah, that was kind of a definition of what

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,500
a customer segment was," but they didn't really describe who.

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,000
And their value proposition, as even they realized later, was pretty unclear.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And their channels, when they said web sales, trade shows, and direct sales,

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
you know, in hindsight, looked pretty unrealistic.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And for partners, they just said, "Well, you know, when we look at it now,

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
it really kind of looks like a random list of hopefuls."

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,500
So let's see how they got from something that started over here--

17
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,500
which you shouldn't laugh because your first canvas might have looked like this--

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,000
and what happened after they got out of the building.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And so now you could see, instead of segmented and niche market only,

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,500
they started to understand, "Oh, maybe the market is somebody in something specific

21
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,000
by a farmer, by a technology, or food"--still kind of vague,

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
but they're getting a little better, and then they're still a little vague on their feature set,

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
gains and pains, and value proposition.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
They're getting a little more refined about partners.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And then, as they went down, they kind of understood.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
"Oh, we understand what a value proposition is; it's not like

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
what our technology is--it's what gain and pain we're providing."

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So simplify protein purification, increase yield, increase throughput, decrease cost.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Now we're making a lot more sense, and now, if you look at the customer segments--

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,500
oh, now they're actually getting down to very specific groups.

31
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,000
Not yet the people in there, but they're now actually going, "Oh, these are the

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
people we should be talking to; and our partners are now also getting specific,

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and they're getting some very interesting traction

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
on what potential revenue streams work."

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And, if we look at their next rev, the things in red are the changes.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So now they're looking at industrial enzyme manufacturers,

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
their key activities are R&D, and production support is their next change.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,500
And then, finally, they now kind of verified--"Yep, these look like

39
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,000
our customer segments; here are our customer relationships.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
More than likely we'll make money from royalties and commercial licensing, etc."

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And so you could see multiple customer segments, multiple value props,

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
multiple revenue streams--this is a somewhat complex multi-sided market.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,500
Just by the way, as a note, some of the most complex are actually in the medical device

44
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,500
business where you have users, payers, hospitals,

45
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,500
insurance companies, and regulators, etc.,

46
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,000
and each one needs a value proposition; each one needs to--you need to understand

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
the revenue model, and so some business model canvases can be quite complex.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Now what's interesting, by the way, about this life sciences company is

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,500
here's something that you would think, "Who could I call? I'm just a scientist."

50
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,000
I mean you might be an entrepreneur building an iOS app,

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and at least you could ask your friends.

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Who do you ask about, you know, E. coli-based purification platforms?

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Well, basically, they decided to go through the Rolodex of all the trade shows,

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
all the conferences, and all the people they've met in their careers,

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
and, instead of physically driving out to them, they used Skype,

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
they used phone calls, and they started a cold-calling strategy

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
which set a stage for a conversation.

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And they had two or three of their team on the call.

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So they would send the message to contact, they'd set an appointment,

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
they'd send out a short summary electronically,

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
they'd have a conversation, and follow up.

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And they also used survey tools; they used LinkedIn and Surveymonkey,

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
but when we were counting how many contacts they made,

64
00:04:01,000 --> 99:59:59,999
we didn't actually count them in their progress.
