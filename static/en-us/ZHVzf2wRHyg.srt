1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,132
So you know how to solve for a variable using numbers. First we multiplied those

2
00:00:05,132 --> 00:00:10,636
sides by the quantity 5 plus y, we distributed the positive 3 here, and then we

3
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:15,582
subtracted 15 and divided by 3. But what if we had an equation like this one and

4
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:19,814
we wanted to solve for y? Notice the setup of these two equations are nearly

5
00:00:19,814 --> 00:00:24,574
identical. It turns out that we can solve for y by following nearly the same

6
00:00:24,574 --> 00:00:29,435
exact steps here. Instead of using numbers, though, we'll have variables. First

7
00:00:29,435 --> 00:00:35,350
we'll multiply each side of our equations by x plus y. Then we'll distribute z

8
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:41,300
to both of these terms, to get zx plus zy equals one x. When we're at this step,

9
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,445
we want to isolate y. Remember we wanted to solve for y or this variable and get

10
00:00:46,445 --> 00:00:50,966
it by itself. So we should isolate this on one side of the equation by

11
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:57,473
subtracting zx from both sides. We'll get zy is equal to x minus z times x.

12
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:01,490
These are not like terms so we can't combine them. The variables are different.

13
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:06,777
And finally to isolate y we divide both sides by z. This gives us with one y

14
00:01:06,777 --> 00:01:12,810
equal to x minus z times x all divided by z. This is pretty amazing, we actually

15
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,827
solved an equation for a variable in terms of other variables. So, in this work

16
00:01:18,827 --> 00:01:24,097
we really multiplied by x plus y first Then we distributed the positive z to

17
00:01:24,097 --> 00:01:29,516
each of these terms. Next we subtracted zx from both sides of our equation to

18
00:01:29,516 --> 00:01:34,378
get the y alone on one side. And to solve for y, or to get one y, we divided by

19
00:01:34,378 --> 00:01:38,974
z, which gave us our final answer. See if you can look back at this work and

20
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:44,350
this work, to draw comparisons between the two. They're not that much different.

21
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,366
We're really just trying to get 1 variable solved in terms of others. When

22
00:01:48,366 --> 00:01:54,182
you're doing the comparison, think about z as being 3. And think about x as

23
00:01:54,182 --> 00:01:58,560
being 5. This is a skill that might come in handy with other courses. Especially

24
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,016
when you're trying to solve for certain variables. Maybe you don't want to find

25
00:02:02,016 --> 00:02:07,682
this variable, z. Maybe you want to find x or y. These 2 equations are actually

26
00:02:07,682 --> 00:02:12,306
the same. They just look different. This equation and this equation are actually

27
00:02:12,306 --> 00:02:16,438
equivalent. They just look different in from. This one is solve for z, and this

28
00:02:16,438 --> 00:02:21,549
one is solve for y. If I knew the values of x and y, I could quickly compute the

29
00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:26,211
value of z. But, maybe, instead, I really want to find the value of y. If I know

30
00:02:26,211 --> 00:02:31,274
the values of x and z, I can quickly find the value of y by plugging into this

31
00:02:31,274 --> 00:02:32,053
equation.
