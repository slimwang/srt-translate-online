Now let's move on to another form of psychotherapy. But first, let me ask you a

2
00:00:04,148 --> 00:00:08,112
question. Let's say you're a therapist and you had a client with very little

3
00:00:08,112 --> 00:00:11,832
self esteem. Who wouldn't apply for any jobs because they didn't think they

4
00:00:11,832 --> 00:00:15,398
were good enough. And wouldn't go out on any dates because they didn't think

5
00:00:15,398 --> 00:00:19,555
anyone would ever like them because they're just a worthless individual. How

6
00:00:19,555 --> 00:00:23,862
would you treat your patient? Write your response here. Don't worry, I'm not

7
00:00:23,862 --> 00:00:27,556
looking for exact wording or anything like that. Just let me know how you'd

8
00:00:27,556 --> 00:00:28,580
handle this situation.
