Whenever we solved radical equations, we want to isolate this radical first. So

2
00:00:04,828 --> 00:00:09,898
notice here that we have plus 5 next to this radical. We'll want to undo this

3
00:00:09,898 --> 00:00:14,656
by subtracting 5 from both sides in order to get this by itself. Once we

4
00:00:14,656 --> 00:00:18,550
subtract 5 from both sides, we'll have the cubed root of x plus 1 equal to

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:23,394
negative 2. Now, you don't want to square this equation to solve it. What do

6
00:00:23,394 --> 00:00:27,862
you think we need to raise both sides by? We do need to raise it to a power,

7
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:32,090
but it's not 2 in this case. Think about what you need to do and then solve for

8
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:36,702
x. Be sure to check your answer and then, write your final answer over here. If

9
00:00:36,702 --> 00:00:40,373
there's no solution, then type, ns.
