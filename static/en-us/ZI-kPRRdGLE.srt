1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is we have b choice at the top level,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and for each of those b we have another b at the next level.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That would be b squared, b cubed and so on,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and all the way to b to the mth power.
