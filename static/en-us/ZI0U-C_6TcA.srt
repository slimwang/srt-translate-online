I think you're on a roll. Let's do one more example. Same page as before,

00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,450
but with one small optimization. We have

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,640
an asynchronous script. Let's see if figure out

00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,980
the critical rendering path metrics just by

00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,300
looking at the HTML. Of course, you're welcome

00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,420
to draw the diagram yourself, but I'm guessing you won't need it. Give it a try.
