00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,922
This problem could be fixed in the body and head code by changing every child,

2
00:00:02,922 --> 00:00:07,535
such as the eyes, nose, et cetera to be at the right height initially. That's a

3
00:00:07,535 --> 00:00:11,786
lot of work. Instead I use the body and head objects themselves. I move the

4
00:00:11,786 --> 00:00:15,526
body and head down to the origin by the crossbar's height. This puts the

5
00:00:15,526 --> 00:00:19,331
crossbar at the origin. The body head object holds both of these parts, body

6
00:00:19,331 --> 00:00:24,294
and head as children. If I rotate this object around its z axis, it'll properly

7
00:00:24,294 --> 00:00:28,738
go around its crossbar. Since translation happens after rotation, I then

8
00:00:28,738 --> 00:00:32,940
translate this parent object to its proper location. Now the animation works

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:33,390
fine.
