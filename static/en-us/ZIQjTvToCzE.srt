1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,400
And, here's the solution.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:05,540
You need to retrieve a profile entity,
so the class here is Profile.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:10,020
And then,
you use the user key to get the entity.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,760
Over here in our code,

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,480
probably see something very
much like this, and like that.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,480
So now, your app's profile, saving,
getting, and updating functionality,

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,840
should be complete, as well.

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,340
Good job.
