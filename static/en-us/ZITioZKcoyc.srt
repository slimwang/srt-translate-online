00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,870
Notice that Clifton didn't answer Katheline's questions directly, but

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,570
instead he asked a question in response. Well, this is

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,460
because the designer will not be there to answer

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,820
the questions in real life. The designer is not part

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,120
of the system image. Note also, that he talks

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,850
much less that Katheline. That is the best way for

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,842
him to learn something new. Now you try it. It

8
00:00:20,842 --> 00:00:25,770
could be anyone, your mailman, grandma, neighbor, honest friend anyone.

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,488
Talk to a few. Let say three people

10
00:00:28,488 --> 00:00:31,860
and then revise your design based on the feedback.
