1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,330
So, the characteristic of ensemble learning is first this, that

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,820
you take a bunch of simple rules, all of which kind

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,400
of make sense and you can see as sort of helping.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,470
But on their own, individually, do not give you a good

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,830
answer. And then you magically combine them in some way to

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,620
create a more complex rule, that in fact, works really well.

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,450
And ensemble learning algorithms have a sort of basic form to

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,100
them, that can be described in just one or two lines.

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,520
So let me do that and then we can start wondering a little bit

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,370
how we're going to make that real. So here's the basic form of an ensemble

11
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,689
learning algorithm. Basically you learn over a

12
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:34,690
subset of the data, and that generates

13
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:37,400
some kind of a rule. And then you learn over another subset of the data

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,500
and that generates a different rule. And then you learn over another subset of

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,190
the data and that generates yet a third rule, and yet a fourth rule, and

16
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,760
yet a fifth rule, and so on and so forth. And then eventually you

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,490
take all of those rules and you combine them into one of these complex rules.

18
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,920
So, we might imagine in the email case that I might

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,310
look at a small subset of email that I know is already

20
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,000
spam and discover that the word manly shows up in all of

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,660
them and therefore pick that up as a rule. That's going to be

22
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,790
good at that subset of mail, but not necessarily be good

23
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,350
at the other subset of mail. And do the same thing and

24
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,500
discover that a lot of the spam mails are in fact short

25
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,970
or a lot of them are just images or just urls and

26
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,530
so on and so forth. And that's how I

27
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,550
learn these rules by looking at different subsets. Which

28
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,630
is why you end up with rules that are very good at a small set of the data, but

29
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,710
aren't necessarily good at a large set of the

30
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,410
data. And then after you've collected these rules, you combine

31
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,320
them in some way, and there you go. And

32
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,080
that's really the beginning and the end of ensemble learning.

33
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,740
>> So wait. So, when you say manly was in a lot of the positive

34
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,370
examples. Do you mean like it distinguishes the

35
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,040
positive and the negative example? So it should

36
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,740
also not be in the negative examples.

37
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,840
>> That's right. That's exactly right. So think of

38
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,360
this as any other classification learning problem that you

39
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,660
would have where you're trying to come up with

40
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,869
some way to distinguish between the positives and the negatives.

41
00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:53,890
>> And, and now why does it, why are we are looking at subsets of

42
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,710
the data? I don't understand why we can't just look at all, the whole data.

43
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,060
>> Well, if we look at all of the data,

44
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,940
then it's going to be hard to come up with these, these

45
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,270
simple rules. That's the basic answer. Actually, ask me that

46
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,260
question a little bit later, when we talk about overfitting,

47
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,530
and I think I'll have a good answer for you. Okay,

48
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,979
so here we go Michael. This is Ensemble Learning. You learn

49
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,440
over a subset of the data over and over again picking

50
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,280
up new rules and then you combine them and you're done.
