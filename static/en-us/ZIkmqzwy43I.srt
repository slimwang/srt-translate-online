1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
In this scheduling problem, we have a network of actions

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
with the precedence relations between them and the duration of each action

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
shown in each box.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What I want you to do is, for each action fill in the earliest start time in the upper left

5
00:00:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and the latest start time in the upper right.
