1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,070
So, stochastic games, originally due to Shappley, have a bunch

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,790
of different quantities. State, actions,

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,310
transitions, rewards, and discount factors. And

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,860
here's how we're going to do it. We're going to, we're going to

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,760
say that s, little s, is, is one of the states.

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,650
And actions could be like little a, but actually, since

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,180
we're going to focus mostly on two player games for the moment,

8
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,370
I'm going to write actions as a and b. Where a

9
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,230
is an action for player one and b is an action

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,600
for player two. Sound okay?

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,310
>> Sure.

12
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:30,410
>> Alright. So next we have the transition function.

13
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,990
So, the transition function says: If you're in some

14
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,900
state, s, and there's some joint action that's taken,

15
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,890
like all the players choose their action simultaneously, a comma

16
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,490
b, then what's the probability of reaching some next

17
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,970
state s prime? And we can write rewards the same

18
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:48,070
way. So there's reward for player one, given that

19
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,120
we're in state s and there's a joint action ab.

20
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,410
And there's the reward for the other player, the second player.

21
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,190
And a discount factor is you know, like a discount factor.

22
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,888
>> Totally makes sense. So oh its the same discount factor for everyone.

23
00:00:59,888 --> 00:01:03,870
>> Yes! Good a good point. One need not define things

24
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,840
that way, but in fact that is the way it's always defined.

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,450
>> Hey, not to go of on a tangent here, but sometimes I see

26
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,460
NDP's and things like stochastic games defined

27
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,180
with a discount Factor being a part

28
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,700
of the definition, and sometimes not. Like it's just a part of

29
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,190
the prob, definition of the problem or sometimes its a parameter of an

30
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,160
algorithm. Which do you prefer? Why do you, why haven't, why have

31
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,220
the discount factor actually listed as part of the definition of the game?

32
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,520
>> I have no justification other than it's nice to

33
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,420
have listed the things that might be important as oppose to

34
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,540
you know, working through algorithms for while and then saying,

35
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,480
oh yeah there's this other number that kind of matters too.

36
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,270
>> Okay

37
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,420
that's fair. I was just curious. So one of the things that I

38
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,790
actually find really interesting is that this model was laid out by Shapley.

39
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,373
>> Mm-hm.

40
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:50,590
>> One of the, like a former Nobel prize winner. I guess

41
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,750
once you're a Nobel prize winner, you're a Nobel prize winner forever.

42
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,080
>> Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

43
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,840
>> So, Shapley, the Nobel prize winner, and

44
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,200
as we're going to see in a moment, this

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,070
model is actually a generalization of MDPs, but

46
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,230
Shapley published it before Bellman published about MDPs.

47
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,070
>> Oh. This is pre-Bellman.

48
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,060
So MDPs, to some extent, can be thought of

49
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,639
as a narrowing of the definition of a stochastic game.

50
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,614
>> Huh.

51
00:02:11,614 --> 00:02:17,400
>> So, all right. Let's do a little quiz. And see that we

52
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,510
really understand the relationship between this model

53
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,580
and other things that we've talked about.

54
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,330
>> Okay.
