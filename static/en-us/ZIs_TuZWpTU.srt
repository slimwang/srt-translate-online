1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,570
As you can see, I have the same sample
app on both my phone and my tablet.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:08,600
When I run the app and sign in for the
first time say on my phone, I'm going to

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,980
first get the dialog asking for
which account I want to sign in with.

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,329
I have multiple accounts on my phone, I
only have a single account on my tablet.

5
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:17,400
So I'm going to get this on here and

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm going to say I'm going to sign
in as lmoroney@gmail.com and say OK.

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,220
Now I'm going to get the confirmation
dialogue as we've seen before.

8
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,150
It just wants to know who I am
on Google, so I say OK to that.

9
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,600
And then I go ahead and sign in, and

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,270
we can see that I'm signed
in as lmoroney@gmail.com.

11
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,870
So now what happens when I
try to sign in on my tablet,

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,160
I just go to click Sign In and
I sign in directly.

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,360
I have confirmed for

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,740
this application already using my
phone that it's okay to use it.

15
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,840
And my tablet recognized that and
was able to sign in directly.

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,780
Now a similar technology to this
enables over the air installs.

17
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,270
If the user is signed into your
website with Google Sign In and

18
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,170
you have a free android app, the app
can be delivered to the device directly

19
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,635
if the user wants to, of course, and
they never have to leave your website.

20
00:01:05,635 --> 00:01:09,710
It's beyond the scope of this course to
show how to do this because you'll need

21
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,570
a website and an app in the Play Store
that's above a certain quality bar.

22
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,390
But there's a straightforward
step-by-step course available to you,

23
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,680
and I've put the URL for
this into the speaker's notes.
