1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,909
You can make check box preferences for
days.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:07,200
So, let's add another preference type
to our repertoire, list preferences.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,919
List preferences are preferences
that look like this.

4
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:12,259
They've a list of options
that you can pick from.

5
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:14,410
In XML, they look like this.

6
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,612
They have a default value,
a key, and a title.

7
00:00:16,612 --> 00:00:19,129
And that's all pretty straight forward.

8
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:21,339
The two new attributes are entries and

9
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:26,570
entry values which, instead of being
a single value are an array of values.

10
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,609
The entries are the labels
that you'll actually see.

11
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:32,179
For example, red, blue, green.

12
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:36,179
The values are the values that
are actually stored in the shared

13
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:39,759
preferences file when you
select one of the options.

14
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,909
I'm going to go to my strings.xml file,
and define all of these.

15
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:45,559
Here are the new strings.

16
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,960
We have the label for the entire
preference, then the labels for

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,280
each of the values, and then the key.

18
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,609
The actual values have already
been defined down here.

19
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:57,789
I've already defined them for you
because when you're using the set color

20
00:00:57,789 --> 00:01:00,210
method, you have to use
one of those values.

21
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,040
Going back to our XML, I have a default
value now, a key and a title.

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,160
But I still need to define these two and
for

23
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:10,530
that I'm going to need
a different type called arrays.

24
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,109
So, over here, within my values folder,

25
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:19,340
I'm going to make a new values
resource file of type arrays.

26
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,939
And within this file I'm
going to put two arrays.

27
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:26,909
The first array are the three labels
that we're going to be using and

28
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:28,869
the second array
are the associated valued.

29
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,281
Keep in mind that the ordering of
the label has to match the ordering

30
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:34,560
of the value.

31
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,700
So, we have red, blue,
green and here red, blue green.

32
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,040
And these arrays are using these strings
that are found in my strings.xml.

33
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,400
Also, note for the keys and the values,
I'm setting translatable to false.

34
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,350
All of this comes together in a
ListPreference xml that looks like this.

35
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:54,169
Let's see how this looks in the app.

36
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,469
Okay, let's check out
our preference screen.

37
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:58,939
Cool, and
we see our three different options.

38
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:03,649
I've selected blue but nothing changes
in the app yet, let's fix that.

39
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,630
I'm here in the Visualizer Activity,

40
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:08,888
let me remind you what actually
changing the color looks like.

41
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:12,310
If I go down here to
setupSharedPreferences I'll see that

42
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:16,028
the set color method takes one
of the color preference values.

43
00:02:16,028 --> 00:02:18,259
In this case I'm always passing it red.

44
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:21,250
So, what I'm actually going to
do is make a new method.

45
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:25,490
And I am going to call it
loadColorFromPreferences and

46
00:02:25,491 --> 00:02:29,005
it's going to take in
a sharedPreferences.

47
00:02:29,004 --> 00:02:33,213
And what this method is doing is it's
calling set color on the visualizer

48
00:02:33,213 --> 00:02:35,905
view, it's taking
the shared preferences,

49
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:40,528
getting a string from shared preferences
which has the key pref_color_key,

50
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:44,930
which is our color preferences key and
has a default value of red.

51
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,280
Okay, so,
then I'm going to call that method here.

52
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,780
And now that I've got this method, I can
also call it from our listener, okay?

53
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,421
And let's run the code, cool.

54
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:56,659
And I can already see that
it's changed to blue.

55
00:02:56,659 --> 00:03:00,865
And if I go to my preferences screen and
try to changing it to green,

56
00:03:00,866 --> 00:03:02,831
I can see that it does that too.

57
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,073
Woo-hoo!
