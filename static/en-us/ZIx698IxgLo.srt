00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,937
Here's the answer, it's just O(d) time.

2
00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:04,910
Why?
Well you

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,710
need to sweep over
the neighbors of a and b.

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,590
There will be at most d such neighbors.

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,030
To determine if
a neighbor is internal or

6
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,200
external, you just need to
check its partition label.

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,090
And that's a constant time
operation by assumption.
