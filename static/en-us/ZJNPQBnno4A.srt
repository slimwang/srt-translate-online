1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,029
Now despite all of these benefits, we've yet

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:06,040
to see a significant deployment of IPv6. Here you

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,730
can see the number of routing table entries

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,630
for IPv6 routes, as well as the growth over

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:17,090
time from 2004. To the end of 2013. What's remarkable

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:22,030
is that we only see 16,000 IPv6 routes in the global routing table. This

7
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:26,840
is not that many considering that there are about 500,000

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,410
IPv4 routes in the global routing table. The problem is that IPv6 is very

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,020
hard to deploy incrementally. Remember our discussion

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,170
of the narrow waste. Everything runs over

11
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:44,930
IPv4 and IPv4 was designed to run over a variety of physical layers. This

12
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,520
common protocol has allowed tremendous growth, but

13
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,270
because. Everything depends on the narrow waste

14
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:57,630
of IPv4 and, because IPv4 is built on top of so many

15
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,020
other types of infrastructure, changing it

16
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,209
becomes extremely tricky incremental deployment where part

17
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:09,780
of the internet is running IPv4 and other parts have been upgraded to

18
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,960
IPv6. Results in significant incompatiability. There

19
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,060
are various incremental deployment options for IPv6.
