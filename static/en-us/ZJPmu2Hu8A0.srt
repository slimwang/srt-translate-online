00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here is an example of an alternate starting point.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We could have started with the observation that, if I have a strain "foo"

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
contained within tags, contained within quotes, then the quotes are stripped

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
but the tags are still there.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And from that we could have devised the hypothesis that tags in

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
double quotes are not stripped.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If we will take a look into our code, now again in the buggy version,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
in order for the HTML markup to appear in the output, tag must be false.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
In order to have tag remain false, quote must be set.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And quote can only be set in this line, and then this would also have left us

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
with this precise condition to look at.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So although we start with a different hypothesis, we end in the same diagnosis,

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and we also end up with the same fix. And here we go.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So from our hypothesis, we can deduce the tag must be false,

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
because otherwise the markup wouldn't be in the output.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Therefore, quote must be true, and therefore we have again our

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
erroneous condition, which sets quote.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Alternate starting hypothesis, same diagnosis, and same fix.
