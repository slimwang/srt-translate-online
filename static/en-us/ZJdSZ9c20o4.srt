1
00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:04,689
Here the left one is the left image and the right one's the right image.

2
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:08,949
From the left image, we know that the person is standing in front of the tree.

3
00:00:08,949 --> 00:00:13,767
Now if you imagine the two stereo cameras, then you'll notice that the left

4
00:00:13,767 --> 00:00:18,132
camera is viewing the scene from a little bit to the left vice versa for

5
00:00:18,132 --> 00:00:19,351
the right camera.

6
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:22,015
Similarly, if we look at the right image and

7
00:00:22,015 --> 00:00:25,191
consider the two stereo cameras, same thing here.

8
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:29,763
Now if we know that the person is standing in front of the tree, then the only

9
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:34,481
combination that makes sense is that the left image is from the left camera and

10
00:00:34,481 --> 00:00:37,045
the right image is from the right camera.

11
00:00:37,045 --> 00:00:40,005
One way to think about it is the following.

12
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:44,148
If you shift your viewpoint to the right, then objects that are closer will

13
00:00:44,148 --> 00:00:47,520
move farther to the left than objects that are farther away.
