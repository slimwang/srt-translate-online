1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,002
This is a case involving two companies.

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:08,013
One company had some,
lets say, proprietary

3
00:00:08,013 --> 00:00:13,293
data that its customers
could download and see.

4
00:00:13,293 --> 00:00:17,633
Except that you can get
a trial subscription, and

5
00:00:17,633 --> 00:00:23,650
try it before you buy it kind of
a thing, and gain access to that data.

6
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:30,560
So, in this case, the person who got
a trial subscription was employee of

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,860
another company that competed with this
company whose data we are talking about.

8
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,990
This other company's employee got a
trial subscription, downloaded data, and

9
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:45,080
the data was available to anyone
who would provide information for

10
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,290
a trial subscription.

11
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:51,530
But the company whose data it was,
actually went to court.

12
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:58,014
And its attorneys said, the access
by the competition of the data,

13
00:00:58,014 --> 00:01:02,565
it was unauthorized and
covered under CFAA, so

14
00:01:02,565 --> 00:01:06,919
they should be a penalties for
this company.

15
00:01:06,919 --> 00:01:11,880
And so the question here is,
do you agree with the attorney of

16
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,870
the company who wanted to
sue this competitor for

17
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:21,240
its employee having a trial
subscription to download this data?

18
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,290
Or do you think this is authorized
because anyone could actually

19
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,000
try the trial subscription and
gain access anyways?
