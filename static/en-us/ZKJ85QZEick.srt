00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,020
Once we've established the running
time for an algorithm,

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,830
we can analyze other algorithms that use
it as a subroutine much more easily.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,440
Consider this question.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,770
Suppose that an algorithm
A has running time of order n.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,480
And suppose that algorithm B
calls algorithm A logn times.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,470
And then algorithm B spends
an additional order og

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,490
squared time afterwards.

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,430
And my question to you is.

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,690
What is the tightest bound that we
can put on the running time of B?
