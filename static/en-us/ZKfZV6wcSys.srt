1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,960
And here we see a more
complete representation

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,620
of a problem solving domain in
the language of classical planning.

3
00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:12,629
And here's the Fly action schema, I
made it a little bit more explicit with

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,770
from and to airports rather than x or y.

5
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:20,410
And we want to deal with
transporting cargo.

6
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,070
So in addition to flying,

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:27,460
we have an operator to load a cargo
c onto a plane p at airport a.

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,350
And you can see the preconditions and
effects there.

9
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,730
And an action to unload the cargo
from the plane, the preconditions and

10
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:36,849
effects.

11
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,920
We have a representation of the initial
state, there's two pieces of Cargo,

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,789
there's two planes and two airports.

13
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:49,669
This representation is rich enough and
the algorithms on it are good enough,

14
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:56,820
that we could have, hundreds or
thousands of Cargo Planes and so on,

15
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,939
representing millions of ground
actions if we had ten airports.

16
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:07,144
And, 100 planes, that would be 100,

17
00:01:07,144 --> 00:01:12,019
1,000, 10,000 different flying actions.

18
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:16,399
And if we had thousands of pieces of
cargo, there'd be even more load and

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,700
unload actions.

20
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,780
But they can all be represented
by these succinct schema.

21
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:27,159
The initial state tells us what's what,
where everything is and

22
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:30,079
then we can represent the goal state,

23
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,980
that we want to have this piece of cargo
has to be delivered to this airport.

24
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,400
Another piece piece of cargo has
to be delivered to this airport.

25
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,719
So, now we know what actions and
problems of initial and goal

26
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,250
state looks like in this representation,
but how do we do planning using this?
