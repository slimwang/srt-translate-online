1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,460
So, the ANTS toolkit, ANTS stands for

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,510
Active Node Transfer System, took a different

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,110
approach to show the utility of the

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:13,140
vision. Since modifying the protocol stack is nontrivial,

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,845
instead, the ANTS toolkit is really an

6
00:00:15,845 --> 00:00:20,230
application-level package. And this toolkit is available for

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,810
the application programmer to say, here is

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,710
my pay load and quality of service constraints.

9
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,680
And what the ANTS toolkit does is to create

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,300
an ANTS header to this payload. So, the new payload

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,720
looks like this. And this is what is called a

12
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,870
capsule. And a capsule consists of an ANTS header and

13
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,520
the actual payload. And this is what is given

14
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,570
to a normal operation system protocol stack. And so, this

15
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,280
normal operating system protocol stack looks at this as the

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,130
payload that has been given to it and it knows

17
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:55,710
the destination address, where this has to go sticks on

18
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,670
the IP header for it. So, the new packet that

19
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,550
is generated by the protocol stack, looks like this. It

20
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,700
has the IP header, and the rest is payload so

21
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,300
long as This protocol stack is concerned, but we know

22
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,220
this payload consists of two parts. One is the normal

23
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,850
payload that the application generated, and in addition to that

24
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,370
there is the ANTS header that have been slapped on by

25
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,010
the ANTS tool kit and this is what traverses the

26
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,620
network and when it traverses the network if a node in

27
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,870
the network is a normal node, meaning it is not a

28
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,520
smart node, but it is a normal IP router. Then it

29
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,670
simply uses the IP header to say, well, here is

30
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,140
what I have to do in terms of sending the packet

31
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,520
to the next hop, towards the destination. On the other hand,

32
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,550
if a node that receives this packet is an active node.

33
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,110
Then, it can actually process this ANTS header, and

34
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,270
say, oh, this particular packet needs to be. Demuliplexed, and

35
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,950
sent to two different routes. And it might take that

36
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,360
intelligent routing decision based on the nature of that node.

37
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,070
So that's the idea, that we can push one

38
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,770
of the paint points out of the operating system, into

39
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,290
an enhanced toolkit that lives above the operating system. So

40
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:09,199
that's sort of the ANTS toolkit vision. That's one part.

41
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,450
Now, the second part, and of course the fact

42
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,640
that the internet may not be open to opening

43
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,790
up all of the routers to to be processing

44
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,390
the specialized code that comes in the capsule. So, what

45
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:25,660
we do is we keep the active nodes only

46
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,280
at the edge of the network. In other words,

47
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,160
the core IP network is unchanged, and all of

48
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,330
the magic happens only at the edge of the network.

49
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,550
So, once again, if I go back to my

50
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:40,570
example of sending greetings to my siblings, then only the

51
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,840
edge nodes have to do the magic in order to

52
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,790
take my original message and process the code to deliver

53
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,080
it to multiple destinations. So the rest of the network

54
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,350
can remain unchanged. So the core of the IP network

55
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,930
can, can be unchanged, and intelligence can be at the

56
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,194
edge of the network. So this is, sort of, allowing,

57
00:02:59,194 --> 00:03:02,158
sort of, matting this active network vision

58
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:04,984
with the core IP network being unchanged.
