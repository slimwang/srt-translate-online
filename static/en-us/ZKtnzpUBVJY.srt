00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,080
Let's consider a slight
generalization of a reduction

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,880
called a vector reduction.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,990
In it, we'll assume that every node
has not a single word of data, but

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:09,700
a vector of data.

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,430
A vector reduction will be the
elementwise reduction of these vectors.

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,000
So if we're doing a sum reduction,
then we'll take vectors, and

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,490
we'll sum them elementwise.

8
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:24,680
The result will be a single vector of
length n, whose elements are the sums

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,450
of the corresponding elements
from the other nodes.

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,230
Now the corresponding algorithm
would change only very slightly.

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,060
In our scalar pseudocode,
anywhere we sent a scalar,

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,910
we could instead send the vector.
