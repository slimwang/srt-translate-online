1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,510
Image pyramids.

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:04,140
The phrase was popular back
the late 70s, early 80s.

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,480
Paper that made it really famous was the
Burt and Adelson, same Ted Adelson that

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,210
I showed you an example of from before,
in terms of some visual illusions.

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:16,050
And they built something called a
Gaussian Pyramid is just this reduction

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,010
just like I told you before.

7
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:22,190
One of things we can do with Gaussian
images, or these reduced images,

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,030
is that we can also create
something called band-pass images.

9
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:30,550
And having this ability to do both
Gaussian and band-pass let's you deal

10
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,560
with scale very well, which is why I
want to show you this a little bit here.

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,530
So, what you have here is,
it says Gaussian pyramid and

12
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,620
it is a Gaussian pyramid, but
it's blown back up again.

13
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,490
All right, in fact, go,
remember these pictures,

14
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,170
where I'm showing you
the different Van Gogh's and

15
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,180
it says half resolution, quarter and
eighth, but they're the same size?

16
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,570
That's because I blew up
the eighth-sized one,

17
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,010
back up to the original size,
so you could see it, right?

18
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,870
So it would look the same way,
all right.

19
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,800
So here, I did the same thing.

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,140
This our Lena picture that
we talked of be-, before.

21
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:06,170
And these are, this is the original,
then blurred, and sub-sampled,

22
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,930
and blown back up again blurred,
sub-sampled, blown, again, again.

23
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,830
So these are the lower
lower resolution images.

24
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,500
What I can do is,

25
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:21,730
I can subtract one picture from
another to get this difference.

26
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,650
Right?
So this is a difference image.

27
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:30,480
Two things, first of all this is called
the Laplacian and you should know why.

28
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,550
If you remember when we
did the detections, and

29
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:39,410
we first did Harris corners, and
then we talked about the SIFT detectors.

30
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,020
David Lowe was talking about using
extrema points in scale space.

31
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,790
And we said, well, one of the things you
could do is you could run a Laplacian

32
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:48,850
over different scales.

33
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:52,590
Or you could take different
Gaussians and subtract them.

34
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,970
Those were the difference of Gaussians.

35
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:58,000
And difference of Gaussians
was approximately the same as

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,730
a Laplacian That's why these images
are called Laplacian images, okay?

37
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,110
They're also approximately band-pass,
and

38
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:09,470
we talked about this just a little bit
when we talked about Fourier analysis.

39
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,330
But the idea is that
the lowest frequency,

40
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,745
if this is frequen, i, frequency
here has them fall off like that.

41
00:02:16,745 --> 00:02:21,020
So the next one, if it had higher
frequency, might look like that.

42
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,250
And if I subtract these two,

43
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,660
basically I'm mostly going to
be looking at that space.

44
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,480
So this is the power of the frequency.

45
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:35,400
And so when you take a Gaussian blurred
image and you subtract from that another

46
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,970
Gaussian blurred image that's close but
not the same amount of blurring.

47
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:45,230
You get this section of frequency that
you're mostly, that you're looking at.

48
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,060
It's not totally band-pass,
cause stuff leaks out this side and

49
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,510
stuff leaks out that side.

50
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,470
But that's why they're called,
in quotes, band-pass filtering.

51
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,640
So these images here,
these are called the Laplacian images.

52
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,820
What's kind of cool about the Laplacian
images is you can actually use them

53
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:08,570
to reconstruct the original
image if you have one thing.

54
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,250
So what's that one
thing you have to have?

55
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,430
You have to have the power.

56
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,170
No.

57
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:20,250
What you have to have is the smallest
of the original blurred Gaussian,

58
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,670
the top of the Gaussian pyramid.

59
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:25,410
The reason I have to have that is,
if I take this and

60
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,250
I add back in this, I'll get this one.

61
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,360
Here let me draw in Lena here like that.

62
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,600
Put in her hat and her eyes and
her nos Yeah, there she is.

63
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,080
All right.
Well once I have that,

64
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,149
I can add that to this and
get a finer version of Lena,

65
00:03:39,149 --> 00:03:42,365
and then I can add this and
get back the original Okay?

66
00:03:42,365 --> 00:03:45,895
So the Laplacian pyramid
plus the coarsest of

67
00:03:45,895 --> 00:03:50,575
the level from the Gaussian pyramid
allows me to do reconstruction.

68
00:03:50,575 --> 00:03:51,095
All right.

69
00:03:51,095 --> 00:03:52,495
Keep going on this a little bit.

70
00:03:52,495 --> 00:03:55,975
To show you how to do the construction
of a Laplacian pyramid.

71
00:03:55,975 --> 00:04:00,070
because you're going to use exactly
the same steps for building a Laplacian

72
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:05,640
pyramid, you're going to use to
run hierarchical Lukas and Kanade.

73
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,120
That's why we're doing this,
so we can get over here.

74
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,900
You got that?

75
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,400
Good.
