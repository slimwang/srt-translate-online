1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:00,990
In these lessons,

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,950
you're going to be learning about how
models can be used to summarize data.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,320
You'll learn about some
statistical analyses for

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,390
describing incoming data sets.

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,583
You'll learn how to compare different
models against one another to see which

6
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:15,010
one's stronger or
which one's a better fit for some data.

7
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,412
And you'll learn about how models can
then be used to predict future data,

8
00:00:18,412 --> 00:00:19,880
predict future observations.

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,553
What we really want you to focus
on here is that model building and

10
00:00:22,553 --> 00:00:23,600
validation component.

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,338
We want you to focus on the role of
model building in machine learning, and

12
00:00:27,338 --> 00:00:30,960
how validation lets us compare
different models against one another,

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,700
to see which one's a better
fit to use going forward.
