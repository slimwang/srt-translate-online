00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,110
Alright, we've shown you how to load some data

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:05,230
into pandas from a CSV file. Now, let's see if

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,930
you can load a csv into python and manipulate the

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:11,220
data in a basic way. What we've provided here is

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,720
the skeleton of a function called add full name, which

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:19,760
takes in two arguments, path_to_csv and path_to_new_csv. Assume you'll be

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,030
reading in a CSV file with the same columns as

8
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:25,590
the Lahman baseball data set. Most importantly, there are columns

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,460
called, nameFirst and nameLast. Write a function that

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,470
reads the CSV located at path_to_csv into a

11
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,130
pandas dataframe, and then adds a new column

12
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,470
called nameFull, with that player's full name. For example,

13
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,940
in the row corresponding to Hank Aaron, nameFull

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,070
would be Hank Aaron. After that, write the

15
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,970
data in the Pandas dataFrame to a new

16
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:51,090
CSV, located at path_to_new_csv. Your code should go here.
