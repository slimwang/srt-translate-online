Here's my five character solution. First, we're going to use the square

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,980
brackets. Well, what this does is creates an empty list object. So then, when we

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,270
index it looking for element 0, that's going to raise an IndexError exception.

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:17,628
Indexerror is an instance of look up error. So, that will be handled by this

5
00:00:17,628 --> 00:00:21,618
handler, which prints out the nice quote from Einstein. And you have to

6
00:00:21,618 --> 00:00:24,950
remember, Einstein lived back in the days before smartphones and Kindles and all

7
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:28,534
those good things. So, carrying around a lot of books must have been pretty hard

8
00:00:28,534 --> 00:00:29,074
back then.
