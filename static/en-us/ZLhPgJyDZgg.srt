00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,840
Let's take a quick look at how we would use

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,750
Device Motion to implement another common mechanism, the shape to send

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,630
feedback feature. Detecting a shape is actually pretty easy, we

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,930
just register an event listener for device motion and inside are

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,090
event handler. We calculate the squares of all of the

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,660
accelarations in all three directions And then test to see how

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,840
big that absolute sum is. If we get a large value

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,350
here, we know we've hit a shake, so we can demonstrate

9
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,400
that on the screen. If we wanted to be fancy, we might want to

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,130
sum these values over an interval of time, so slower motion that goes on

11
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:38,010
for longer would still trigger it, or we might want to add rotation into

12
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,200
the sum. But in practice this will work pretty well. Let's take a look.
