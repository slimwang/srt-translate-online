1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,532
And the answer is a search with an up arrow constrains the pattern to match right at the beginning.

2
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:09,266
So that's the same as just doing a match with the rest of the pattern.

3
00:00:09,267 --> 00:00:15,399
And the rest of the pattern is just the pattern from position one, onward.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,266
Now, if the pattern doesn't start with an up arrow and we're doing a search,

5
00:00:19,267 --> 00:00:22,799
that means the search could be anywhere within the text.

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:30,732
But that's the same as asking for a pattern that has any number of characters at the beginning,

7
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:39,667
match of any character any number of times, and that's the same as adding a dot star to the start of the pattern.
