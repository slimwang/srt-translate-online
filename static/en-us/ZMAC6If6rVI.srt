00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,930
String interpolation is
another incredibly convenient

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,050
feature of switch strings.

3
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:08,599
Here's an example, let's say you're
moving into a new apartment and

4
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:13,080
you need to pay the first and last
months rent' plus the security deposit.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,059
Let's use string interpolation
to replace the word Total

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,240
with the correct total.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,550
Will start with the dollar sign and
assume this might be in US dollars, and

8
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,760
through string interpolation,

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,480
we can insert that expression
right into the string.

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,120
And the result is here in the sidebar.

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,399
We looked at some common
string manipulations,

12
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:35,119
including string concatenation.

13
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,119
For example,
we can combine our monkeyString and our

14
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,979
thiefString to make a very short story
about a monkey with sticky fingers.

15
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,250
We also learn that strings come
with a host of useful functions

16
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,369
including the contains function and many
more, let's see those one more time.

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,450
Let's call the contains function
on our silly monkey string.

18
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:01,579
Here, we ask if the sillyMonkeyString
contains the string key.

19
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:03,570
In the sidebar we can
see that this is true.

20
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,890
Here is another one.

21
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,320
Let's say our Wi-Fi password
is Meet me in St Louis but

22
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,419
we need to switch it up a bit.

23
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:16,030
Let's replace all the es with 3s
using the string function replacing

24
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:21,310
the currency of with and over here in
the sidebar we can see the result.
