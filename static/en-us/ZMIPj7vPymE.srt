00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,561
This next practice problem should be a little bit easier than the last one. We

2
00:00:04,561 --> 00:00:09,097
want the equation of the line through the point 0,2 and this time the slope is

3
00:00:09,097 --> 00:00:13,552
given to us and the slope is 3 4ths. Once again, write your answer in standard

4
00:00:13,552 --> 00:00:14,765
form and in this box.
