00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,008
Now that we've talked explicitly about
what it means to combine like terms, or

2
00:00:04,008 --> 00:00:08,096
combine terms that have the same variables
with the same powers in the them, I'd like

3
00:00:08,096 --> 00:00:12,252
you to try an example of how to do this.
Please simplify this expression,

4
00:00:12,252 --> 00:00:17,895
7x+5y-10x+3y.
Start by figuring out which terms in this

5
00:00:17,895 --> 00:00:21,856
expression are like terms, and then figure
out how to combine them. Good luck.
