1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:01,483
And I hope you said three,

2
00:00:01,483 --> 00:00:03,976
it's pretty obvious that there should be three centroids here.

3
00:00:03,976 --> 00:00:07,788
So let's add three, one, two, three.

4
00:00:07,788 --> 00:00:10,240
So they're all starting out right next to each other, but

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,460
we'll see how as the algorithm progresses, they end up in the right place.
