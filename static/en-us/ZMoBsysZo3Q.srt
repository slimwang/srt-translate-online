1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,280
Now that we talked about risk, and

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,260
we said risk is actually
probably multiplied by impact.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:12,000
Impact is the loss you incur or
suffer as a result of the breach.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,150
So, this questions is about,
how do you figure out that loss?

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,580
So, the company,
we talked with Anthem for

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,820
example, or Target,
stores sensitive data, customer data.

7
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,304
Data that could be used by
identity theft for example, or

8
00:00:24,304 --> 00:00:26,310
credit card numbers and
things like that.

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,250
So stores sensitive customer data.

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,443
Impact of a breach of such data.

11
00:00:30,443 --> 00:00:34,490
And remember the risk was
probability times impact.

12
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:38,850
So this is saying, what are we
going to include in the impact?
