00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,700
So here you can see how I've
added to the MainActivity.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,355
I've set it so that it implements
GoogleAPIClient.ConnectionCallbacks and

3
00:00:07,355 --> 00:00:10,850
GoogleAPIClient.OnConnectionFailedListe-
ner.

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,110
I've then implemented
the onConnection function,

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,280
which takes a bundle connectionHint and
overridden it.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,670
I've implemented onConnectionFailed,
which takes the ConnectionResult

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,730
that I call result and I've
implemented onConnectionSuspended and

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,910
this takes an integer
which is the cause.

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,490
You should log each of these events
as they happen, but just for

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,540
brevity I'm leaving them blank.

11
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,370
In the onConnectionSuspended when
you have a Google API client,

12
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,590
you should connect it but I haven't
defined my GoogleAPIClient yet.

13
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,020
And so I've just commented it out.

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,520
So then you're going to
do this in the next step.

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,900
And we'll get our onCreate
function going so

16
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,180
that we can set up the GoogleAPIClient
and the UI and the other goodies.
