00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
After we have fixed the program we need to check two things.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
First, we need to check whether the same error has been made elsewhere.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
In our case, if there is a programmer who has confused the precedence

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
of ors and ands, it may be a good thing to check the code for other places,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and to make sure that all of these have proper parentheses around them,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
which anyway is a good programming practice.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Second, we want to make sure that the error does not occur again.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and we can do so either by writing appropriate tests, see the other Udacity

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
course for how to do that.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Or, we can include appropriate assertion in the code that makes sure the error will not occur again.
