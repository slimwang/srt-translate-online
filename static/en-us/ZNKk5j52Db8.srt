1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,630
Okay, Charles, how we going to
reduce this to a single number?

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,830
>> We're going to follow those
steps that you have outlined.

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,510
I don't know the answer, but
I think I know how to get to the answer.

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,840
>> All right, let's do it.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:16,090
>> Okay so, well first off,
are we doing finite or infinite here?

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:16,767
>> T = 5 it says.

7
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:19,460
>> T = 5, so we're definitely doing
T equals, that's what I thought,

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,300
just want to be sure.

9
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:25,200
Okay well, so all I have to do is
actually turn everything that I see

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,620
into, turn the state transition into
immediate reward, so I can do that.

11
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,910
Would you mind writing some stuff for
me?

12
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:32,500
>> Not at all.

13
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,810
>> Yeah there you go.

14
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:39,071
So let's do ones over the greens and
minus 0.2 over the reds.

15
00:00:39,071 --> 00:00:43,861
But actually I don't really care about
the one you just wrote down because it's

16
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:45,750
more than T = 5 away.

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,410
>> All right.

18
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,670
Well that's going to
come up in the next step.

19
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:48,890
Truncate according to horizons.

20
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,400
So one, two, three, four, five, cut.

21
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:53,990
>> Mm-hm.

22
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:57,276
>> One, two, three, four, five, cut.

23
00:00:57,276 --> 00:00:59,479
One, two, three, four, five, cut.

24
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:03,150
Now [LAUGH] I was a little bit
sloppy with how I defined the five.

25
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,470
It could be that you actually
put it one step deeper.

26
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,020
But I was careful to
pick a horizon link.

27
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,810
So that it wouldn't matter
which way you interpreted it.

28
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,350
This would just add zeros to it.

29
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,660
It wouldn't change anything.

30
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,010
So anyway here we
are cutting it at five.

31
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,620
>> Okay, pretty smart, Michael.

32
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,280
All right, cool.

33
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,150
So now that we've done the truncating,

34
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,840
I just need to summarize each
of the sequences in turn.

35
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,540
So I know that whatever I would give for
the first value,

36
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:31,100
would be 0.8 to the zero or to the one.

37
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,140
Where are we starting from?

38
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,880
>> That's another good question.

39
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,420
So that's going to actually change
the answer depending on how

40
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,970
people interpret that.

41
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,697
I would say, to take this literally,

42
00:01:43,697 --> 00:01:49,169
that we're talking about
the first reward being r1 and

43
00:01:49,169 --> 00:01:53,725
then the next one being r2, r3, r4, r5.

44
00:01:53,725 --> 00:01:56,169
And the gamma corresponds
to the index number here.

45
00:01:58,206 --> 00:01:59,615
>> That doesn't seem right.

46
00:01:59,615 --> 00:02:01,755
>> Yeah, but it is what it is.

47
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:04,605
>> Okay, seems like it should be zero,
one, two, three, four.

48
00:02:04,605 --> 00:02:05,105
>> Oh, I see!

49
00:02:05,105 --> 00:02:06,135
If you call the first one zero.

50
00:02:06,135 --> 00:02:07,535
Oh, I like that better!

51
00:02:07,535 --> 00:02:09,663
>> Mm-hm.
>> [LAUGH] But probably for

52
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:11,585
the quiz, we should accept either way.

53
00:02:11,585 --> 00:02:12,735
>> Sure.

54
00:02:12,735 --> 00:02:13,235
>> Or either way.

55
00:02:14,565 --> 00:02:15,965
>> Or either way.

56
00:02:15,965 --> 00:02:18,335
Okay, so now that we know what
all the words for the rule was,

57
00:02:18,335 --> 00:02:19,055
that's pretty easy.

58
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:22,420
Actually, I think that's going to
work out pretty well for us.

59
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:27,380
So then for the first sequence I
know it's going to be 1 times 0

60
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,010
plus 0.8 times 1.

61
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,430
And actually everything else is 0.

62
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:32,930
So.
>> Yep.

63
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,158
>> As I explained it.

64
00:02:34,158 --> 00:02:35,608
>> So this first sequence actually

65
00:02:35,608 --> 00:02:37,480
has a return of 0.8.
>> Right.

66
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,690
So the second sequence
is pretty similar.

67
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:45,112
It's going to be 1 times 0 plus, blah
blah blah, so that's 8 to the third,

68
00:02:45,112 --> 00:02:49,960
or pointing to the third,
times 1, which is some number.

69
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,251
Okay, so the return for
the second sequence is 0.512.

70
00:02:54,251 --> 00:02:57,208
So for the third sequence,
we're going to do the same thing,

71
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,880
it's going to be 0.8 to
the second power, times 1.

72
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,090
>> First power
>> To the first power,

73
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:02,680
thank you very much.

74
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,913
0.8 to the first power times 1 which is,

75
00:03:07,913 --> 00:03:15,559
in fact, 0.8,
+ 0.8 to the fourth power x minus 0.2.

76
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:21,744
All right, so we got 0.8,
0.512, and 0.71808.

77
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:22,600
>> Mm-hm.

78
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,793
>> And so, we just have to add
those together, get an average, but

79
00:03:26,793 --> 00:03:29,000
a weighted average.

80
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,508
>> Mm.
>> So it's going to be 0.8 times

81
00:03:33,508 --> 00:03:38,355
0.6 plus 0.512 times 0.1

82
00:03:38,355 --> 00:03:43,209
plus 0.71808 times 0.3.

83
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:45,990
Which is obviously.

84
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,280
>> All right, so

85
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,889
when you've just worked out, then you
get something that's very close to 0.75.

86
00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:57,400
So that's the summary of this particular
outcomes of this particular policy

87
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,780
according to these various
parameters that we've chosen.
