00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,391
For the number of seconds in 40 years, I know that I need to start the number

2
00:00:05,403 --> 00:00:10,782
with a 1. So here's my decimal point. I need to move this decimal place over

3
00:00:10,794 --> 00:00:16,229
here. So if I thought about moving this decimal place, I would need to move it

4
00:00:16,241 --> 00:00:20,845
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 places. So I have 10 to the 9th. This should make

5
00:00:20,857 --> 00:00:26,175
sense. My exponent is a positive 9, so I just move this decimal place to the

6
00:00:26,187 --> 00:00:31,660
right 9 spaces. Okay for the red blood cell I know I have 6, so 6 needs to start

7
00:00:31,672 --> 00:00:38,355
my answer. I'm moving this decimal place to the left. because I have 0 still

8
00:00:38,367 --> 00:00:44,046
left of 6. So I will move it 1 2 3 4 5 6, 6 places left. So I have 6 times 10 to

9
00:00:44,058 --> 00:00:45,792
the negative 6. Okay.

10
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:51,825
Scientific notation is also pretty helpful, because when I compare 2 numbers

11
00:00:51,837 --> 00:00:57,265
like the dominoes toppled or. 4 million, I can compare it to 1 billion. I notice

12
00:00:57,277 --> 00:01:01,825
that the difference in the powers is 10 to the third. That means there's 1,000

13
00:01:01,837 --> 00:01:06,295
times the number of dominoes. When I look at these two numbers in scientific

14
00:01:06,307 --> 00:01:10,945
notation, I can tell how many times larger a number is than another number. For

15
00:01:10,957 --> 00:01:15,635
example, the number of seconds in 40 years is 1,000 times the number of dominoes

16
00:01:15,647 --> 00:01:20,958
toppled. I know this because the difference in the powers is ten to the third.

17
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:25,409
So the number of seconds in 40 years is 1000 times the number of dominoes.

18
00:01:25,512 --> 00:01:28,365
Alright, let's get back to our original problem.
