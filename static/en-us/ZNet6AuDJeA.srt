00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,710
Well the red values seem to be scattered relatively far compared to the blue,

00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:10,860
around the regression line. The blue data set seems to be pretty consistent.

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,960
Have a pretty strong relationship. So therefore, we're more confident that the

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,310
actual value when x equals 12, will be closer to the predicted value.
