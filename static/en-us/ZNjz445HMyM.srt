00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:03,307
We know that when we add to x, we're multiplying the value of f of x, but by

2
00:00:03,307 --> 00:00:08,666
how much? Well, let's consider the functions we've already looked at. In the

3
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:13,118
case of f of x equals 2 to the x, f of x was multiplied by 2 whenever x

4
00:00:13,118 --> 00:00:20,416
increased by 1. Here, 2 is called the growth rate of the function. So what can

5
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:24,207
we say about the growth rate of exponential functions in general? Considering

6
00:00:24,207 --> 00:00:28,093
that general function, f of x, equals a to the x, when we increase x by 1,

7
00:00:28,093 --> 00:00:31,590
what's going to happen to f of x?
