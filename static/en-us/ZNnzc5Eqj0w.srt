So we're going to find a home where we can add the readBetween method. Now, it

00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:10,630
can't be the System or the Scanner class, because you and I can't

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,580
add methods to these classes. They're classes

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,710
that belong to the standard Java library,

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,660
and we can't add just add our own methods to them. What about ElevatorDemo?
