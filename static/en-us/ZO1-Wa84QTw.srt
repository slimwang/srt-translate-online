1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,936
These variables have a stronger relationship, but there's no right answer for

2
00:00:03,936 --> 00:00:09,650
how we would prove this. You might have come up with your own creative way. For

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:20,210
example, what if we drew the smallest ellipse possible around all our data, and

4
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:30,130
then looked at the ratio of the major axis of this ellipse, to the minor axis

5
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:42,720
were bigger ratio mean a stronger relationship.
