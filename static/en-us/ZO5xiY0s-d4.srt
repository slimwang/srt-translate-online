Here's another equation for you to solve. Log base 10 of 5 x plus log base 10

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:13,180
of x minus 1 equals 2. To start off please condense the left hand side here to

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:17,250
be the logarithm of just a single quantity. So in other words use the

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,120
properties of logs that you learned to combine these two log expressions.
