00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,510
Since the general pattern continues to hold after conditioning on

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,340
each of the buckets of year joined, we might increase our

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,450
confidence that this observation isn't just an artifact of the

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,570
time users have had to accumulate friends. Let's look at this

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,170
relationship in another way. We could also look at tenure

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,450
and friend count as a rate instead. For example, we could

7
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,880
see how many friends does a user have for each

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,190
day since they've started using the service. Let's see if you

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,160
can create a summary of this rate, that shows how many friends a user

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,680
has for each day since the user started using Facebook. Subset the data so

11
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,530
you only consider users with at least one day of tenure. Once you have

12
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,330
that summary answer these two questions. What's

13
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,900
the median rate? And, what's the maximum rate?
