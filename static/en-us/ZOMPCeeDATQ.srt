Here's one rendering of the answer.

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:03,830
You have the structure and

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:08,330
behavior diagrams as child classes of the diagram class.

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,270
And then we have seven different structure diagrams as children of

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,380
the structure diagram class.

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,800
And the other seven behavior diagram types as subclasses of behavior diagram.
