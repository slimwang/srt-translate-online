1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,059
To find the h1 element,
I simply used the siblings method and

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:05,580
passed in the filter h1.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,770
For the kids, I used find and
a passed in a *.

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:11,800
I'll come back to this in a second.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,720
And then for the parents, I used the
.parents method and passed in the string

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,770
div, otherwise I would select all
the parents, including the body.

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:26,080
To test this, I press Test Run, saw the
page come up, and then open dev tools.

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,880
I see that I've gotten h1,
like I expected.

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,330
I see the children of article-list.

10
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,440
And I also see the two divs
that we were expecting.

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,770
Now why did I pass a * to find?

12
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,830
Looking at the documentation for it,
we see that the selector isn't optional.

13
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,310
We've got to included it.

14
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:47,990
But if we scroll down, we find this
message, which says that if we want to

15
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:52,299
select all of the descendant elements,
or all of the children, we can simply

16
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:57,179
pass in the universal selector, which
in this case is a string of a star.

17
00:00:57,179 --> 00:00:57,719
See?

18
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,699
Reading documentation
is super important.

19
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:02,579
Okay, enough with these selections.

20
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,388
Now I want you to start manipulating the
