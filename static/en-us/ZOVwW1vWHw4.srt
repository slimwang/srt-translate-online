1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The cost is 20.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The reason being that in this match over here, we get a perfect color match.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Black matches to black. Red matches to red.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But we have to assume this this pixel over here and the pixel over here,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
are both the result of occlusion. Each costs us 10.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So the result is we pay 20 as the total cost.
