1
00:00:03,828 --> 00:00:05,880
We've covered a lot of
ground in the session.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,210
From a quick intro to protocols and
delegation, to learning and

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,510
implementing AV audio recorder.

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,680
We're almost the last step in having
a finished pitch perfect app.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,620
Your app can now record sounds and

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,210
pass them over to the play
sounds View Controller.

7
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,180
In the next lesson,

8
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,490
we're going to cover how to play back
audio, what changes the pitch, and

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,250
how to more easily position
interface elements using stock fuse.

10
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,770
When you're ready, I'll be waiting for
you at the next lesson.
