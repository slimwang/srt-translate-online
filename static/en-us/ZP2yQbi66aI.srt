For this quiz.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,670
I want you to pretend that you're
developing an app that displays

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,230
a loading jiff like this one while
video resources are being buffered.

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,205
Do you think it's a good idea to request
this jiff just during the animation

5
00:00:11,205 --> 00:00:11,930
phase?

6
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,580
It's also worth noting that if
you're requesting the jiff during

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,820
the animation phase.

8
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,270
You also have to insert it into
the page during the animation phase.
