1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,160
Another important distinction, is that any file you put

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,420
in the cache, has to actually be downloadable. If

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,160
I put something in here that doesn't actually exist,

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,370
and then try to update the cache again, you'll notice

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,650
that I get a resource fetch failed event. And

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,410
the problem is, this means that the cache is

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,300
not being updated. It doesn't just fail to cache

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,770
that one file. It doesn't update the cache at all.

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,210
This is to make sure that sets of

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,770
resources can be managed together. But be sure to

11
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,020
watch the console log and make sure that

12
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,340
you're getting the right things. The important poitn here

13
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,630
is that the app cached contents are used

14
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,300
immediately, even when you're online. The design of Appcash

15
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,120
is offline first. The user gets content immediatly, rather

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,980
than having to wait for the network to respond.
