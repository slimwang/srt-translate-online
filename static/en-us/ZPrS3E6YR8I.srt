1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,010
Last one.

2
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:03,350
>> So, the last one we have
our expectation again,

3
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:07,470
which I like, and
now we are going to do minimax.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,080
What you said, before we
started going through the quiz,

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,780
is that you are kind of treating
this as a joint action space.

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,750
It's sort of you taking an action and

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,310
then your opponent taking an action and
so on and so forth.

8
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,336
Really, I don't know what
I would call this, but

9
00:00:23,336 --> 00:00:27,889
it looks a lot like just regular old
game search when you have zero sum game.

10
00:00:27,889 --> 00:00:30,070
>> Yeah, zero sum game,
that's exactly what I would call it.

11
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,890
And we're going to talk a lot more
about variations of algorithms

12
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,260
that act like this that deal with
the case when there's multiple agents.

13
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,330
But this was sort of a nice
setting to bring it up because

14
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,890
the basic result says that if
we've got a generalized MDP.

15
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,260
We've got this operator and

16
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:48,570
this operator defined in such
a way that it's a non-expansion.

17
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:54,772
And it turns out all these things,
mini-max, this rank-weighted idea,

18
00:00:54,772 --> 00:01:00,140
max, the linear combination,
expectation, min.

19
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,910
All these things are all non-expansion.

20
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,730
So all these things value iteration
will do something reasonable.

21
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,410
It'll actually come out with
a fixed point in the limit.

22
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,590
>> So actually min, max,
all of these things and

23
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,910
ord, row of ord,
they're all convex sums.

24
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,330
So does this mean that all convex
combinations are non-expansive?

25
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,780
>> So that's a great question.

26
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,970
They are all convex combinations,
that's true.

27
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:27,401
It is not the case that arbitrary convex
combinations result in non-expansions.

28
00:01:27,401 --> 00:01:31,950
In particular,
if the weights of the convex combination

29
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,290
depend on the values, the actual
magnitude of the values in some way,

30
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:39,690
then we need not get anything
that is a non-expansion.

31
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:40,880
>> Okay.
So, that's good to know.

32
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,550
>> Yeah.
And that actually comes up in a really

33
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:45,420
important setting,
which is if you're doing not, say,

34
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,110
epsilon greedy, exploration which
corresponds to the third line here.

35
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,920
But instead we're doing something
like Boltzmann exploration

36
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,350
we could run into trouble.

37
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,610
So, I think that it's for this kind of
introduction to generalized MDPs and

38
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,470
I think that actually finishes
the section on convergence.

39
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,280
So you're ready for some recap?

40
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,280
>> Yes I love recapping.
