00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,180
Now, one way to draw a whole bunch of squares,

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,420
is to start by drawing just the one square. So,

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,250
here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to step away from

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,600
my computer for a little bit. Put this hat on.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,510
And I will draw on this red carpet, which will be my canvas. So, when

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,970
I move around on it, you will notice that I can draw. There it is.

7
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,240
And in this case, I drew a triangle. So, here's

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,130
a task for you. If you were ask me to draw

9
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,630
a square on this red carpet, what step by step instructions

10
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,380
would you give me? Write your answers in the box provided.
