1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,970
In the next Cycle, in Cycle 10, this instruction will be able to dispatch.

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:09,280
This is our ADD. And it's going to execute in Cycles 10 and 11.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,430
So in Cycle 12 is going to try to write it's result. So in Cycle 11 nothing

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:17,860
really happens, other than the execution of these two instructions. But in Cycle

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,440
12 what's going to happen is this instruction is going to broadcast it's result.

6
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:27,160
So, we will mark that it grows as the result. We will find the register that

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:33,090
matches AD2 which is F6. And override the value of F6 with a new value.

8
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,995
Which is the minus 9.6 plus minus 2.5. So

9
00:00:37,995 --> 00:00:43,530
it's going to be minus 12.1. So this is the value of AD2.

10
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:50,710
And now we're going to un-rename, this to, make future accesses read the new F6.

11
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,200
And no instructions was waiting for, know that this was the last instruction in

12
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,230
the statement so nobody was really waiting for this result.

13
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:02,440
But, this instruction is done now. So we can free this reservation station.

14
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,810
Now nothing will really happen until cycle 17.

15
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:09,340
In cycle 17, this multiply is finally going to broadcast its result.

16
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:15,390
We're multiplying 2.5 times 2.5, and then, you know, minus. And

17
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,760
that value goes into F0. So F0 is going to become whatever that result is,

18
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,980
we're not even going to even try to compute that.

19
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:28,070
It's going to be un renamed here. It's going to put that value over here. And

20
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,127
now the, divide is finally ready to go. And

21
00:01:31,127 --> 00:01:36,660
we're going to free this reservation station. So finally, in cycle 18.

22
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:42,070
To divide is ready to go, it's been dispatched, at 40 cycles so

23
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:46,620
its going to be in cycle 58 that we finally produced that result. So

24
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:52,750
nothing really happens until cycle 58 at which point, this value is broadcast,

25
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:57,790
register F10 gets to grab that value, we unrenamed this,

26
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,720
we free this reservation station. We'll look at who is waiting for it,

27
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,790
but nobody is. And that concludes our example.
