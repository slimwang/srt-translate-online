1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,870
You've done a lot of preparation for
a job and review by now.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,910
You know what to expect and

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,628
have strategies to help prepare for
whichever questions come your way.

4
00:00:08,628 --> 00:00:11,750
Remember that what works for someone
else may not be what works for you.

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,300
And that's okay, it is you going
into the interview room that day, so

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,600
you get to decide how
you want to prepare.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,900
Our advice is to practice a little
every day for interviewing,

8
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:24,489
such as thinking over a potential
question or researching the company.

9
00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:26,929
If you come across a topic you
don't feel comfortable with,

10
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:29,609
continue practicing until
you get comfortable.

11
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,339
The career resource center has a lot
of tips and resources for you.

12
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,100
The day of the interview,
walk in calm and confident.

13
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,100
Remember, you're already one of the most
qualified candidates for the role.

14
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:39,770
You'll ace the interview.

15
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:40,959
