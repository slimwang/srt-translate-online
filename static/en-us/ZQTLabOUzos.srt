Sometimes problems are not always
as simple as buying something from

2
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:07,799
the store, in fact,
most problems are a lot more complex.

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:08,980
>> With most problems,

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,950
there's more things to consider before
you can actually solve the problem.

5
00:00:12,949 --> 00:00:16,030
For example, me deciding what
I want to do this weekend.

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,039
>> What were you planning
on doing this weekend?

7
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:21,131
>> Well, I was thinking I would
hang out with my friend Colt.

8
00:00:21,131 --> 00:00:22,285
And, if he's not busy and

9
00:00:22,285 --> 00:00:25,510
the weather is nice so
I was thinking we could go to the park.

10
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,219
>> That sounds like fun.

11
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:28,908
I think, this is the perfect time for

12
00:00:28,908 --> 00:00:32,149
us to transition into more
complex logical expressions.

13
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:32,990
>> It is?

14
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,440
>> Well yeah, think about it.

15
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:38,399
For your plans to happen, there are two
conditions that need to be true.

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,710
Call tests not be busy and
the weather needs to be nice.

17
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,530
If both of those things happen, then,
you and Colt are going to the park.

18
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,460
>> Okay, I see where you're going.

19
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,259
In JavaScript, we can represent more
complex problems by combining logical

20
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:54,879
expressions with special operators
called logical operators.

21
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,300
