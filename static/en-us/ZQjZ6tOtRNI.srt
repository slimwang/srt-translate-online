00:00:00,073 --> 00:00:04,776
To wrap up, today we learned about not only that the world is becoming parallel but why.

2
00:00:04,776 --> 00:00:09,980
The GPU is a processor that takes advantage of some of the most important technical trends in computing.

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,917
We looked at our first CUDA program,

4
00:00:11,917 --> 00:00:15,254
learned how it worked, and changed the program to do something new.

5
00:00:15,254 --> 00:00:19,525
Now for our first project, we're going to use CUDA to input a color image,

6
00:00:19,525 --> 00:00:21,493
and output that image in grayscale.

7
00:00:21,493 --> 00:00:25,202
This will involve a map operation over every pixel in the image,

8
00:00:25,202 --> 00:00:28,290
where the operation on each pixel is converting the input color

9
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,258
in red, green, and blue to a single intensity value.

10
00:00:31,258 --> 00:00:33,695
When you're done, you'll have the chance to show your grandparents

11
00:00:33,695 --> 00:00:37,793
what your new photos would've looked like back in the day, or at least that's what I'm going to do.

12
00:00:37,793 --> 00:00:42,478
Enjoy the assignment, and I hope you enjoy an excellent presentation from Dave for Unit 2.
