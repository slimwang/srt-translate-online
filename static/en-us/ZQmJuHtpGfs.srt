[PROBLEM SOLVING]

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In this unit we're going to talk about problem solving.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The theory and technology of building agents

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
that can plan ahead to solve problems.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
In particular, we're talking about problem solving

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
where the complexity of the problem comes from the idea that there are many states.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
As in this problem here.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
A navigation problem where there are many choices to start with.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And the complexity comes from picking the right choice now and picking the right choice at the

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
next intersection and the intersection after that.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Streaming together a sequence of actions.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
This is in contrast to the type of complexity shown in this picture,

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
where the complexity comes from the partial observability

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
that we can't see through the fog where the possible paths are.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We can't see the results of our actions

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and even the actions themselves are not known.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This type of complexity will be covered in a later unit.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Here's an example of a problem.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This is a route-finding problem where we're given a start city,

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
in this case, Arad, and a destination, Bucharest, the capital of Romania,

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
from which this is a corner of the map.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And the problem then is to find a route from Arad to Bucharest.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The actions that the agent can execute when driving

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
from one city to the next along one of the roads shown on the map.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The question is, is there a solution that the agent can come up with

26
00:01:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
given the knowledge shown here to the problem of driving from Arad to Bucharest?
