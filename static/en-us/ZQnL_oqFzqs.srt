1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,850
So we said we're going to
focus on what we do online.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,939
So let's dig deeper into it.

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:09,430
What that we do online should
be considered private?

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:10,625
Okay, so what is private?

5
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:16,035
And I think we're really talking
about either data that is going to be

6
00:00:16,035 --> 00:00:21,541
stored in digital form in computers,
or some activity that we do and

7
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:26,007
record of that activity is
what we're talking about.

8
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:29,516
So financial statements,
we do online banking,

9
00:00:29,516 --> 00:00:33,526
credit card statements,
all these financial records,

10
00:00:33,526 --> 00:00:37,550
we would say, that should be private,
for two reasons.

11
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,440
It's no one's business how I spend my
money or how much of it I have, but

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,040
if they gain access to these,
of course, they can do identity theft.

13
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,333
Health medical conditions,
health information is obviously

14
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:53,390
highly sensitive and
we don't want that to be made public.

15
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,570
Legal matters they're attorney client
privileges, and things like that.

16
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,807
Well, most people would view that as
something that is private information.

17
00:01:01,807 --> 00:01:06,858
If it's online in email messages or
certain files that are stored in

18
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:12,100
a computer, of course, you would
view them as private information.

19
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,540
Biometrics, fingerprints for

20
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:18,130
example, which could be used for
gaining access to certain information.

21
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:22,390
You would think your fingerprints
shouldn't be arbitrarily collected,

22
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,720
shared, be made public and
things like that.

23
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,460
So you would say this
is private as well.

24
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,810
Your political beliefs,
what party you belong to.

25
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,510
Well, you can always find out from
what button someone's wearing or

26
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,770
what party they contribute to but

27
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,830
it's no one's business if I
don't want to make it public.

28
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,460
Remember, it's your ability to control,
and

29
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:47,540
when you making a contribution or when
you are putting a button of supports

30
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,260
on a certain candidate, to do that.

31
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:54,070
So the ability to control is
what is privacy is all about.

32
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,720
So my political belief,
unless I want to disclose it,

33
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,710
there's no reason why someone
should find out about it.

34
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,290
Although we didn't talk about
privacy related laws, but

35
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,500
in the US there are laws
that cover some of these.

36
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,220
Health, for example, HIPAA.

37
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,910
Financial, there is Sarbanes-Oxley and
things like that.

38
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:14,990
So, the privacy laws, not only this
information is private, considered

39
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:19,790
private, but those who thwarted privacy,
there could be sanctions against them.

40
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:25,240
Well, if we go on school records,
your employment record is private.

41
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,590
Most of us would want to
keep our annual evaluations,

42
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,610
won't want them out in the public.

43
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:35,000
School records, how you do your
grades are actually covered again

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,100
as regulation, and things like that.

45
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,400
And more interestingly,
our web browsing habits.

46
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,870
What do we search?

47
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,910
What websites do we visit?

48
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,570
What kind of websites?

49
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:50,410
If somebody knew, then maybe they'd know
your political beliefs, for example.

50
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:55,010
So what we do online,
you would think that's private.

51
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,940
Communication that's not public.

52
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,430
Emails that you send or
phone calls that you make and so

53
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,260
on, you would think that is private.

54
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,640
Our [INAUDIBLE] and we've been talking a
lot about metadata and stuff like that.

55
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,560
And a lot of people are upset and
surprised and some maybe not because

56
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,420
we did think phone calls,
we had control in a sense that

57
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,740
we knew that the government wouldn't
collect information about those.

58
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,230
So communication is certainly a thing
that you would consider private.

59
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:27,040
And if you sort of keep going down
this line, what we do in cyberspace,

60
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,948
what about stuff that's about us
that can be seen by others online.

61
00:03:31,948 --> 00:03:34,000
Going back to whenever.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,370
What about past history?

63
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,654
So the interesting are the right to be
forgotten this thing in the EU now that

64
00:03:39,654 --> 00:03:42,105
we have, and
we'll explore it a bit more.

65
00:03:42,105 --> 00:03:47,260
It says if there's information about me
that's irrelevant I don't want Google

66
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,822
to actually return that as a result
of a search that somebody performs.

67
00:03:51,822 --> 00:03:56,502
So if there's information out there
that was collected and made public or

68
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:58,390
made available to somebody,

69
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,400
is that forever or do I have
the right to remove it at some point.
