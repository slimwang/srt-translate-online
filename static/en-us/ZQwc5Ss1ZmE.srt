00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,760
Here, have a couple questions for you. First, if you haven't ridden a bike in

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,790
years, but when you get on it you remember exactly how to ride it, what types

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:13,160
of memory are activated? But then you remember the first time you ever rode a

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,549
bike. What type of memory is activated here? Finally, little random but, where

5
00:00:18,549 --> 00:00:23,540
are the Great Pyramids? What type of memory is activated when you recall this?

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,594
Take your time, but for the question, if you have not ridden a bike in years.

7
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:30,714
But when you get on one, you remember exactly how to ride it, what types of

8
00:00:30,714 --> 00:00:35,945
memory are activated? Type in two answers. And then for the next question, you

9
00:00:35,945 --> 00:00:40,404
remember the first time you ever rode a bike. What type of memory is this? Just

10
00:00:40,404 --> 00:00:44,586
choose one type of memory. And finally, where are the Great Pyramids? What type

11
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:48,884
of memory is activated here? Again, choose one. Here are four options to type

12
00:00:48,884 --> 00:00:53,715
in the boxes. Episodic, implicit, declarative, and procedural.
