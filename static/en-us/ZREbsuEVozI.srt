1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,630
While you are working to decrease
the time it takes to complete the form,

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,280
you've got a few options at
your disposal to help out.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,050
First off,
you could use your user's existing data.

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:16,660
For example, if the user is logged into
your site, and you already know their

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:21,310
postal code because they submitted it in
a earlier form, it will be nice of you

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:26,610
to pre-fill the postal code field with
a known one like you could see here.

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,500
Another option is to access
the geolocation in order to

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,530
determine the postal code.

9
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,110
This works even if
the user isn't logged in.

10
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,900
Check the instructor notes for
more details.

11
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,660
This is great because
with almost no efforts,

12
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:45,350
you saved your users time and
you're one field closer to completion.

13
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:48,680
In the date example,
here it's three fields closer.

14
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,369
Great, no?

15
00:00:49,369 --> 00:00:54,364
Another easy option is to enable
users automatically fill fields

16
00:00:54,364 --> 00:00:56,201
by enabling autofill.

17
00:00:56,201 --> 00:01:01,330
You will dive deep into autofill

18
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:05,019
attribute by enabling
Auto Complete in the next lesson.

19
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:08,280
But before thinking about our
attributes on your inputs,

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,210
I want you to think about
the input elements themselves.

21
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,930
Just look how powerful autofill can be.

22
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,920
I'm just start typing here and

23
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,910
when I'm choosing,
it's automatically fill the form.
