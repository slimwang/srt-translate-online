00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,700
Here our solution is plus or minus 4. We start by taking the square root of

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,730
both sides of our equation. When we take the square root, we need to indicate

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,748
plus or minus, since we could have the positive value or the negative value. We

4
00:00:13,748 --> 00:00:18,125
take the square root of 16 to get positive 4 or negative 4. These should also

5
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:23,840
make sense because if we square 4, we get 16. And if we square negative 4, we

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,930
get 16. Great thinking for finding those answers.
