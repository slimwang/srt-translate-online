1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,830
This is Marla, a 59 year-old woman
who has become obese as she aged.

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,980
She has also smoked cigarettes for
many years.

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:14,050
As a result, she's developed
several chronic diseases.

4
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,910
Through Marla and her story we'll
learn about chronic disease and

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,260
the problem it creates for
the US healthcare system.

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,470
We'll also gain the background to
appreciate the key role health

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,580
informatics can play in
helping solve those problems.

8
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,670
First, Marla is not unusual.

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,730
The Federal government's Medicare
program provides healthcare for

10
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,630
some 40 million people
over the age of 65, and

11
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,150
pays for
nearly half of all US hospital care.

12
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:48,084
It is projected to be a major
contributor to future increases in

13
00:00:48,084 --> 00:00:49,577
healthcare spending.

14
00:00:49,577 --> 00:00:55,861
83% of Medicare beneficiaries have
at least one chronic disease, but

15
00:00:55,861 --> 00:01:02,769
the 23% that have five or more, account
for two thirds of Medicare's costs.

16
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,990
Here is a list of relatively
common chronic diseases, so

17
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,230
now you know what some of them are.

18
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,490
I could have added cancer,
since many people were surviving it and

19
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,520
being treated for years, but
we'll use this list for now.

20
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,620
If you, anyone in your family,
or anyone you know closely,

21
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:28,090
have had hypertension, diabetes,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,

22
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:32,130
heart disease or
chronic kidney disease, check that now
