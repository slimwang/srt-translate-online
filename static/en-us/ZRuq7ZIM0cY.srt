[Norvig] The answer is no, I didn't try to confuse you.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In fact, I'm trying to show you a very useful tool in generator expressions.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yes, I thought the indentation was important.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
With all those fors and ifs, I would have run out of space across the page.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yes, I wanted to stop early, and so a list comprehension would have been a bad idea

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
because a list comprehension would have had to do all the work,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
whereas a generator expression can stop as soon as it's done.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Having statements rather than expressions also would allow me to stop early.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And yes, it's easier to edit.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
If I wanted to move around the order of the clauses,

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
instead of having the indented structure that I would have with statements

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I have a flat structure and it's easy for me to pick out 1 of the constraints

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and move it somewhere else in the list

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
without having to worry about getting the indentation right.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So editing expressions is easier than editing statements in Python.
