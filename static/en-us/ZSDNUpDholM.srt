>> Last time we got to know a little bit about the relationship between lines

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:07,737
and their equations. Specifically we talked about this idea of intercepts, which

3
00:00:07,737 --> 00:00:11,431
are where our line intersects either the x axis or the y axis. Let's look at

4
00:00:11,431 --> 00:00:15,351
this relationship a bit more. Here's the graph of the equation y equals 2x plus

5
00:00:15,351 --> 00:00:19,179
2. Now I know we don't much about the relationship between this equation and

6
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:23,232
this graph, but we're going to find out a little bit. So, from what you remember

7
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:27,189
from the last lesson, what's the y-intercept for this graph? Enter the numbers

8
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:28,490
for the coordinates here.
