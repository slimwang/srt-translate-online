00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,140
So how'd you get along with this one,
Jake?

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,730
>> Everything cached and accounted for.

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:04,315
Here's how I did it.

4
00:00:04,315 --> 00:00:09,630
Event.waitUntil takes a promise and
cache.open returns one.

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:10,520
So I'm going to start with that.

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,405
Then once I've got the cache,

7
00:00:13,405 --> 00:00:16,775
I'm going to call cache.addAll
to cache all the URLs.

8
00:00:18,655 --> 00:00:20,505
I could just reference the array here,
but

9
00:00:20,505 --> 00:00:22,105
I'm going to move
the items across instead.

10
00:00:23,475 --> 00:00:26,750
AddAll also returns a promise,
so I return it.

11
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,550
So wait until it receives a promise for
both actions combined.

12
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,130
Now if I refresh the page,
that new service worker will run and

13
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:38,030
I can go to the resources panel in
DevTools and there in cache storage,

14
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,390
is the new cache recreated and
the resources we added to it.

15
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,480
Success, but it's no good having cached
items if we're not going to use them.

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,390
So let's use them in responses.

17
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,100
To do that, wait, Mike,
why are you still here?

18
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,170
>> Come on,
you've already covered responses and

19
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,150
getting responses out of caches.

20
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,405
I think the student can take this on.

21
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:01,660
>> Well fine, makes my life easier.
