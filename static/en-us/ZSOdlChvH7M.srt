00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:02,482
I'm going to get you started on this
problem, and then I want you to finish it

2
00:00:02,482 --> 00:00:07,398
out. I have 2/5 of a candy bar. I need to
share it with three others and myself, so

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,839
I'm really sharing it among four people.
So I take 2/5 and divide it by 4.

4
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:14,773
Remember, you need to change something
here. When we divide by a number we could

5
00:00:14,785 --> 00:00:18,136
do the same thing as multiply by the
reciprocal. So we're going to have 2/5

6
00:00:18,136 --> 00:00:21,791
times 1/4. Okay. You finish this one now.
