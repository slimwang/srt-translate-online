1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,650
So why are we working on
the recognition problem?

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:06,090
Well, recognition,
it's a fundamental part of perception.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,200
Whether you're talking about robots,
autonomous agents, whatever.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,140
The idea is that the ability
to know what things are and

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,916
therefore how you want to interact
with them, is it really important?

6
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:17,010
It, it's gives you
a way of organizing and

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,420
thinking about the visual
content of the world.

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,370
And perhaps even more importantly,

9
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,200
it's a very human way of
thinking about things, right?

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,830
I, I give objects labels, and
if I tell you to go pick up the cup and

11
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,820
put it away,
you know what I'm talking about.

12
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,400
So we want our machines and
systems to be able to do that too.

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,300
So for example, autonomous agents,
and here's a pair.

14
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,610
The one on the left is a robot.

15
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:44,890
This is from Karlsruhe, and RÃ¼diger
Dillmann's work on, domestic robot.

16
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,990
And this robot has to be able to go
pick up cups out of dishwashers.

17
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,310
It has to know that
there is a dishwasher.

18
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,804
It has to see that, oh,
I put that cup down, it didn't make it,

19
00:00:52,804 --> 00:00:54,110
I'm going to go get it.

20
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,890
It has to be able to be told
that the cups go over there.

21
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,010
All right?

22
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:01,910
So if I'm going to communicate
about these things to that robot,

23
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,810
I'm going to use labels that
talk about these objects.

24
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,150
Even in autonomous systems.

25
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,960
So here, I think this was, Stanley.

26
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,440
I think that was one of the Urban Grand
Challenge vehicles, one of the winners.

27
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,790
It has to understand
that this is a thing and

28
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,510
this thing we know
that it's called a car.

29
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,560
All it needs to know is it's this thing
that it's learned a lot of things about.

30
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,663
And that this kind of thing which
are cars do things like continue moving,

31
00:01:25,663 --> 00:01:29,966
might stop, have certain behaviors,
likewise that this object there might

32
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:33,750
move in your way and it uses a lot
of machine learning to do that.

33
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,130
Maybe not quite the traditional
labeling in the way.

34
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:40,818
But the idea is that these autonomous
agents understand the nature of,

35
00:01:40,818 --> 00:01:43,510
of the world being carved up in objects.

36
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:47,580
And I can communicate about them and
it can autonomously detect them.

37
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,470
Labeling people.

38
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,670
That's a recognition task.

39
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,290
This is something we do all the time.

40
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:55,150
You know, every time you tag folks
on Facebook, and it both finds that

41
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,700
it is a face, and we'll talk
about detection in a little bit.

42
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,730
But also,
you might want to know who it is.

43
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,750
Peter Belhumeur and folks did these
digital field guides where you'd like to

44
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,119
be able to like maybe take a picture
of a leaf and say you know,

45
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:07,290
what kind of leaf is that?

46
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,508
If you're into that nature
kind of thing which I'm not.

47
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:12,070
But it's this idea of being able to,
to recognize things.

48
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,540
And maybe you've found some
really expensive stuff online and

49
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,410
you say please find me more
shoes that look like this.

50
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:22,330
For any relatives of mine that I'm
still continuing to subsidize.

51
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,800
So, you could use computer vision to
help you find less expensive shoes.

52
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,740
Just saying.

53
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,860
All right.
The idea of, you know,

54
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,800
can I find something that
looks kind of like that, so

55
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,080
I have to recognize that it's a shoe.

56
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,950
Maybe it's already labeled as a shoe,
recognize the type, that kind of thing.
