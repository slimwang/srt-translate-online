00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,160
We have a certain intuition about
what objects will feel like, and

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,750
what we can do with them,
just by looking at them.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,470
We call these affordances.

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:12,680
Take for example,
this piece of paper, and this apple.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,440
I know from my previous experience with
paper that I can easily pick it up.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,990
I can twist it.

7
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,890
I can tear it, and so on.

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,780
I know that the apple has greater mass.

9
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,970
It'll be harder to pick up,
but that I can throw it up or

10
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,690
even take a bite out of it.

11
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,850
Now these learned expectations
help us to quickly recognize

12
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,900
how we can interact with objects.

13
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,420
Now completely recreating real world
objects in our UIs can be limiting and

14
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,500
have some adverse affects.

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,220
We can, however, take advantage of some
of these basic principles of affordances

16
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,160
and tangibility to make
our UIs more intuitive.
