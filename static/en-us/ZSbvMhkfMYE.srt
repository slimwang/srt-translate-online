1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,810
And here is the illustration
of this example.

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,390
The user logs into bank.com and
keeps a session alive.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,100
So the browser has
the cookie to bank.com.

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,355
Meanwhile, the user is phished
to visit attacker.com.

5
00:00:12,355 --> 00:00:16,743
And in return, the web browser
gets this malicious content.

6
00:00:16,743 --> 00:00:20,732
When this malicious page is
displayed on the user's browser,

7
00:00:20,732 --> 00:00:25,190
the browser will make the request
on the user's behalf to bank.com.

8
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,740
And since the user is still
logged into bank.com,

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,930
the user's cookie is also sent to
bank.com along with the request.

10
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:37,275
And so the bank website believes that
the request is from the user, and

11
00:00:37,275 --> 00:00:39,470
therefore, the payment
request is fulfilled.
