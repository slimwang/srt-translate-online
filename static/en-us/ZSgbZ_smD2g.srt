00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,040
To answer this,

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,750
you can ask yourself what would
happen if everyone acted like this.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,910
If everyone started sending
double copies of their traffic,

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,160
congestion would just get worse and
nobody's traffic would get through.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,130
But on the other hand,

6
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,890
if we just dropped the connection at
the first sign of imperial trouble,

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,560
somebody would probably want to
have us frozen in carbonite.

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,650
And let's not talk about the goats.

9
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,350
But on the other hand.

10
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,600
If every end point slows down
when there is congestion,

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,370
the congestion will be relieved.

12
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:31,330
And even though end points can't send
as fast as they might want to, but

13
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,900
these traffic will get
through eventually.
