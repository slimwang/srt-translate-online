1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,840
We start by adding a string for
our SharedPreference.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,300
In the Sunshine sync adapter, we add
a function to set the location's status.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:15,475
Since setLocationStatus will be used
on a background thread, I use commit.

4
00:00:15,475 --> 00:00:18,620
One would use apply if it
were on a foreground thread.

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:23,780
In onPerformSync, if the server
returns an empty string, or

6
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,880
I get an IOException.

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,580
I set the status of server down.

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:33,370
I set the status of server invalid if
there is an exception parsing the Json.

9
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:38,660
We also set LOCATION_STATUS_OK
at the end of a successful sync.

10
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,810
Let's put some breakpoints
in to check to see if these

11
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,950
are actually getting set correctly.

12
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,000
For a URL that I know is going to
produce an error not expected by our

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,540
app, I'm going to use this one.

14
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,070
Let's debug it and see what happens.

15
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,740
As before,
I've uninstalled the app first.

16
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,320
And as you can see, we nicely get
a location status of, server invalid.

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,120
Which of course leads us to no
weather information available.

18
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,920
Which is what we do in the case
of not knowing why something has

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,120
happened as of yet.

20
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,540
We'll fix this later.

21
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,480
Let's try a URL that
we expect to be empty.

22
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,880
Once again,
I'll uninstall the app first.

23
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,729
Now let's debug it and see what happens.

24
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,410
As you can see, we now get SERVER_DOWN
rather than INVALID, as expected.

25
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:30,210
This will help us a lot when we move
to the next part of our implementation.

26
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,490
Let's set everything back to normal to
make sure we didn't break anything, and

27
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,390
there we are.

28
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,240
Everything's working
just as we would expect.
