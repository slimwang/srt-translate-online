00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Consider a ball that is kicked by a mean of 10 feet in this direction

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and with a standard deviation of 1 foot.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It is then kicked back in the opposite direction towards where it started by 5 feet,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
but this time with a standard deviation of 0.5.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What are the mean and standard deviation of this distribution of the distance

6
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
between the initial position and the final position?
