1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,480
So remember the darker the color, the stronger

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,540
the imbalance. So the dark blue Russian region and

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,800
the dark red Saudi Arabian regions would have the

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,600
strongest imbalances. Other areas like China do have a

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,090
slight imbalance, too. You can see because it's pinkish

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,210
not, not as dark red as Saudi Arabia, but

7
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,950
they do have more males than females. And other

8
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,340
regions like Australia, Brazil, and Canada also have a

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,440
slight imbalance, because you can see they're light blue, meaning that they have

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,010
more females than males. But they're not as blue as the Russian region is.
