00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,352
Now, we've looked at the overall shape of a graph, talking about what happens

2
00:00:03,352 --> 00:00:07,525
at either end of it. So now we're going to focus back in again on the middle,

3
00:00:07,525 --> 00:00:11,776
mainly on the x-intercepts. So here's a graph that you are definitely familiar

4
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:14,940
with, the graph of a parabola. You know three different ways to write the

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,432
equation of a parabola. But the one we're going to focus on today is its

6
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:23,518
factored form. The function we're concerned with is f of x equals the quantity,

7
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:28,232
x minus 5 times the quantity x plus 3. Just to make sure we're on the same

8
00:00:28,232 --> 00:00:31,221
page, what are the x-coordinates of the x- intercepts of the graph of this

9
00:00:31,221 --> 00:00:34,699
function? Please fill them in here.
