00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,650
So, what do we need to know to make our decision about this guide company,

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:08,345
Summit Up? Well let's start with what we would expect, based on what

3
00:00:08,345 --> 00:00:13,810
Summitpost.org told us about the number of successful attempts. Let's pretend

4
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:18,828
that we don't know how many successful climbs Summit Up has had. Based on

5
00:00:18,828 --> 00:00:25,470
summitpost.org's statistics, how many attempts would we expect to be successful

6
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:31,220
for Summit Up out of 100 attempts? And how many attempts would we expect to be

7
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,200
unsuccessful?
