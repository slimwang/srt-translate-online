00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:00,930
Hi Michael!

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,480
>> Hey Charles! How's it going?

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,510
>> It's going pretty well. How's it going with you?

4
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,950
>> It is a beautiful fall day here in Providence Rhode Island.

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,140
>> Oh that's right it's fall, when you are.

6
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,750
>> [LAUGH] Yeah, I think, that's right.

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,490
>> So, what we're going to do today, Michael.

8
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,070
If you will indulge me. Is ,we're going to

9
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,050
talk about a different class of ,uh, learning

10
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,110
algorithms and approaches than we've been talking about before.

11
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,360
>> So now the other ones were low class, this is going to

12
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,000
be high class?

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,710
>> Exactly. And we call them instance based learning. Which

14
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,520
sounds very hoity toity and high voluting. Don't you agree?

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,490
>> Yeah, sure, why not?

16
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:33,632
>> [LAUGH]

17
00:00:33,632 --> 00:00:35,630
>> It sounds like it maybe has good posture.

18
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,400
>> It does, in fact, have good posture.

19
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,240
>> Well let's, let's learn about it. I'm, I'm, I'm intrigued.

20
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,200
>> Yeah, so I think that ,uh, what we're going to

21
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,090
end up talking about to day is kind of interesting, I

22
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,520
hope. But it's sort of different, and what I'm hoping is

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,430
through this discussion Is that, we will be able to reveal

24
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,670
some of the unspoken assumptions that we've been making so far, okay?

25
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,780
>> Unspoken assumptions, it sounds, yeah, okay, that sounds

26
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,330
like we should get to the bottom of that.

27
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,410
>> Yes, so let's do that. So, just to remind you of what we have

28
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:06,770
been doing in the ,um, past, this is what was going on with all of

29
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,250
our little supervised learning tasks, right. We

30
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,070
were given a bunch of training data ,labeled

31
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:15,610
here as you know, x, y One, xy two, xy three, dot, dot, dot, xy zen.

32
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,150
And ,uh, we would then learn some function.

33
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,130
So, for example, if we have a bunch of

34
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,520
points in a plane, we might learn a

35
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,970
line to represent them, which is what this little

36
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:28,830
blue line is. And what was happening here is we take all this data. We come up

37
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,180
with some function that represents the data. And

38
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,820
then we would throw the data away effectively, right?

39
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,770
>> Okay. Yeah, so like, black is the input here and then

40
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,980
the two blue things are what get derived by the learning algorithm.

41
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,630
>> Right. And then in

42
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,740
the future when we get some data point, let's

43
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,550
call it x, we would pass it through this function

44
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,410
whatever it is. In this case, probably line. And

45
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,940
that would, be how we would determine answers going forward.

46
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,870
>> Yeah. That's, that's what we've been talking about.

47
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,400
>> Right. And in particular without reference

48
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,600
to the original data. So. I want

49
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:02,050
to propose an alternative and the alternative is basically going to not do this.

50
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:02,354
>> [LAUGH]

51
00:02:02,354 --> 00:02:04,889
>> So let me give you a, let me, let me tell u exactly what I mean by that.
