00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,110
To shade a diffuse surface, we need the cosine of the angle between the

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,932
direction to the light and the surface's normal. We can perform a vector

3
00:00:07,932 --> 00:00:11,741
operation called the dot product to directly compute this cosine. First, you

4
00:00:11,741 --> 00:00:15,774
must normalize the surface normal and the vector to the light. Normalizing means

5
00:00:15,774 --> 00:00:19,790
rescaling a vector so that it has a length of 1. Normalized vectors are the norm

6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,816
in reflection models. As we'll see, if a dot product of two normalized vectors

7
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:28,172
gives a value between negative 1 and 1, which will prove useful in computing the

8
00:00:28,172 --> 00:00:33,870
effect of lighting. For example, say, I have the vector 3, negative 4, 0. To

9
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,654
normalize it, I find the length of the vector. This is simply the Pythagorean

10
00:00:37,654 --> 00:00:41,808
theorem. Take each component of the vector and square it. 3 squared is 9,

11
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:47,366
negative 4 squared is 16, and 0 squared is 0. Take the square root of 25 and you

12
00:00:47,366 --> 00:00:52,062
get the length of the vector, 5. It's lucky that turned out so easily. By

13
00:00:52,062 --> 00:00:58,304
dividing the vector by its length, you get to normalize vector. So, 3, negative

14
00:00:58,304 --> 00:01:05,725
4, 0 normalized is 0.6, negative 0.8, 0. Looking at this vector, it goes the

15
00:01:05,725 --> 00:01:09,892
same direction, but only travels one unit. Note that normalizing a vector that's

16
00:01:09,892 --> 00:01:13,498
already normalized leaves it unchanged. Try normalizing this vector again and

17
00:01:13,498 --> 00:01:17,322
you'll find the length is 1. Dividing the vector by a length of 1, of course,

18
00:01:17,322 --> 00:01:21,320
does nothing. It's very handy to normalize vectors in this way. Usually, we

19
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,981
store the surface normals as normalized vectors. We'll see exactly why in the

20
00:01:24,981 --> 00:01:27,753
next lesson. For now, a quick quiz.
