1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,850
One of the most important tips
I can give what they saw is

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:06,030
think like a search engine.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,290
You want to give signals
to the search engine.

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,100
If it's Play, if it's iTunes,
if it's whatever search

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,960
engine there is that you're
app is relevant and useful.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,540
So for example anchor text.

7
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,460
Anchor text is huge SEO.

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,170
If you'll think about most of the,
let's say,

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,066
articles that we know in the Internet.

10
00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:30,756
Google Play, iTunes,

11
00:00:30,756 --> 00:00:35,800
Download, the anchor text has
nothing to do with the actual app.

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,240
We're losing SEO juice.

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,420
We're losing ASO juice.

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,080
Make sure that the anchor text has
something to do with your app.

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,524
The best closing app or
a game that's worth downloading or

16
00:00:47,524 --> 00:00:50,550
a game about fish, whatever.

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,420
Make sure that the anchor
text makes sense.

18
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,860
Also make sure to be that relevant.

19
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,360
Make sure there's people that are not
uninstalling your app immediately.

20
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:07,510
On that note, another great technique
to get users is paid campaigns.

21
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,820
There's many ways to do it.

22
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,010
There's many affiliate networks and
there's a lot of display campaigns.

23
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:16,430
But because one of the best signals
that the app stores are getting

24
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,970
is a lot of downloads,
a lot of installs.

25
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,570
Sometimes we want to invest in
getting more paid downloads.

26
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,870
Because that will eventually
get you more organic downloads.

27
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,350
Another thing is the comments.

28
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,040
People that are giving bad reviews
are giving them mostly for a reason.

29
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,620
And mostly because they didn't get
what they were expecting to get.

30
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,400
So if you're using
a name that makes sense.

31
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,730
If the images that you're
using actually elaborate and

32
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,830
explain what this
product is all about and

33
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:51,350
is not some kind of illustration that
has nothing to do with your website.

34
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,410
If the description is accurate and

35
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:59,050
describes exactly what you're going
to get the metatext makes sense.

36
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,380
Everything makes sense and

37
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,040
correlates with your product,
that's the best approach.

38
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,280
So, ASO tricks.

39
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,786
The best thing that you can
do is optimize your web page.

40
00:02:08,786 --> 00:02:15,350
You can A/B test everything from
the icon that is representing your app,

41
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:20,770
to the description to the metatext to
the images to video that you're using.

42
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,300
You can optimize everything.

43
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,950
Another thing is if you have something
in the app store if you have an option

44
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,620
to do something targeted, use it.

45
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,420
If there's special display for
tablets, do it.

46
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,130
If you can translate,
localization is so important.

47
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,490
If you can use Portuguese for

48
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:46,300
Brazilian, translate your app
because that will be much better.

49
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,280
Translate the images.

50
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,190
Be professional.

51
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:53,905
Invest time in creating the presentation
because that's the only

52
00:02:53,905 --> 00:02:55,510
asset you can control.

53
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,020
You can't control how people
will react to your app but

54
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,660
you can control about
what they understand.

55
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,670
You can test it.

56
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,420
You can test it.

57
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,460
You can iterate about it.

58
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,980
You can iterate on it.

59
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,470
And that's the best advice I can get.
