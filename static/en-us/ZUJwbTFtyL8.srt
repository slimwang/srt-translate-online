1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,980
Now back to Marla,
who already has four chronic diseases.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,740
She developed diabetes 15 years ago,
and is now showing early signs of lung

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:17,540
problems, called chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, or COPD for short.

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:22,020
In recent years, her blood
pressure has become elevated, and

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,450
she's also taking medications for that.

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,840
She was also recently diagnosed
with a heart problem,

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,800
called coronary artery disease,
and needs even more medications.

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,680
We already know one thing about
chronic diseases, they can't be cured.

9
00:00:40,765 --> 00:00:43,940
Marla illustrates two other key points.

10
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,760
They are often caused by behavior.

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,770
Marla's obesity is caused
by her poor diet, rich and

12
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,690
processed foods with too
many calories from fats and

13
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,430
carbohydrates, combined with far
too little physical activity.

14
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:04,790
This weight gain contributed
to her developing diabetes and

15
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,390
high blood pressure.

16
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,870
Her lung disease was
caused by her smoking.

17
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,080
The second key point
about chronic diseases,

18
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,770
is they can cause other
chronic diseases.

19
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,470
Marla's diabetes and high blood pressure
contributed to the development of her

20
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:28,550
heart disease, and puts her at greater
risk for a heart attack, or stroke.

21
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:32,640
If her diabetes and high blood
pressure are not well controlled, she

22
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,980
could develop chronic kidney disease,
and other more serious problems.
