00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,302
There's only one that's true here, and that's that the song seems to have had an

2
00:00:04,302 --> 00:00:09,659
effect on engagement, but not learning. Think of it this way. Let's assume that

3
00:00:09,659 --> 00:00:15,084
the song had no effect. Let's say we picked a random sample of size 20 from the

4
00:00:15,084 --> 00:00:20,820
population of learning scores. It's quite possible. You calculated about an 18%

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,703
chance to randomly select a sample with a mean learning score of 8.35. This is a

6
00:00:26,703 --> 00:00:31,408
pretty high probability. However, again, let's assume that the song had no

7
00:00:31,408 --> 00:00:35,341
effect and we picked a random sample of size 20 from the population of

8
00:00:35,341 --> 00:00:41,567
engagement scores. We get that the mean engagement score is way out here, with a

9
00:00:41,567 --> 00:00:46,093
z score of over 10. That's not likely to happen if we pick a random sample.

10
00:00:46,094 --> 00:00:51,402
Therefore, there's evidence to suggest that the song had an effect on engagement

11
00:00:51,402 --> 00:00:56,396
but not learning. However, we still can't be totally sure that the song caused

12
00:00:56,396 --> 00:01:01,716
higher engagement without setting up a proper experiment and implementing proper

13
00:01:01,716 --> 00:01:04,063
control conditions. Great job.
