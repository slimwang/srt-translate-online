1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,420
Okay, let's step through
these one at a time.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,070
Buy and sell are actions.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:09,700
So, those are directives
we give to the market or

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:14,390
the environment to change it,
and potentially change our state.

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,340
Holding long is a part of the state,

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,720
it tells us whether we
are holding the stock or not.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,470
We might also be holding short
if we had shorted of the stock.

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,240
So holding long is a part of the state.

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,930
Bollinger value,
that's a feature, a factor

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,980
that we can measure about a stock,
and that's part of the state as well.

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,030
That would inform us whether we wanted
to act on it in some way with an action.

12
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,940
Return from trade,
when we finally exit a position.

13
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,310
That is our reward.

14
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,680
We might lose money, so it would be
a negative reward if we lost money.

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,580
We might make money and that'd be
a positive reward, so that's R a reward.

16
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,300
Daily return,
that could be either a state,

17
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:00,510
in other words a factor we consider for
deciding what to do,

18
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,879
but it could also be a reward,
we'll get into that more later and

19
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,470
you'll see how it could be one or
the other.
