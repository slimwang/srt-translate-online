1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:07,490
My name is Kirill Grouchnikov, I've
been at Google for the last five years,

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:13,470
and I do client work,
UI work, on the Play store.

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,550
>> Okay, awesome, and
what do you like about it?

4
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:21,760
>> Well, I always liked writing code and
seeing pixels light up on the screen.

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,300
So this is the Play App,
Google Play App.

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,420
Starting from top to bottom, we have
the search box, and we have these,

7
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:36,505
what we call quick links,
to go to various subsections of the app,

8
00:00:36,505 --> 00:00:38,150
and of the store.

9
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:42,570
And then we have different content here,
so we have clusters of cards.

10
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,080
We have this,

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,650
we call a banner, that gets you
into some other place in the app.

12
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,280
You can go into the details
page of a certain item,

13
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:58,040
let's say Angry Birds Telepods, and
this is what we're showing here,

14
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,890
kind of the mix of information
that the developer has provided.

15
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,470
We have the video of the app.

16
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,510
Then we have the short description
of the app's screenshots.

17
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,600
Then we have the user provided content,
reviews and ratings of that app.

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,470
A little bit more related content.

19
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,559
And then here, a couple of links.

20
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,100
And you can go also
from the details page.

21
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,549
You can start the install process.

22
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:27,732
This is the permissions.

23
00:01:27,732 --> 00:01:29,340
And then you go and accept them.

24
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,260
And it starts.

25
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,087
So you can see over here,
it starts installing it.

26
00:01:36,908 --> 00:01:40,310
So the students have been learning
about text views, image views, buttons.

27
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,370
Can you point out a couple
of those in apps?

28
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:46,900
>> Yeah, so back to the cards,
if we look at this Star Wars Rebels.

29
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,660
So the card itself is
an extension of a view group.

30
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:56,720
But it can be as simple as a extension
of our elegant layout, and

31
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,970
then we have this
thumbnail is an image view.

32
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,760
Then we have this,

33
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,870
Star Wars Rebel is a text view that
goes to a maximum of two lines.

34
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,410
Rating bar is, well, rating bar.

35
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:16,650
The free is text view, and
the overflow dots is an image view with

36
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:22,070
a source set to a certain PNG
that looks like three dots,

37
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:25,920
and then the same for
the quick links, so

38
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,530
it is a relative layout with
the image view on the left.

39
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:36,690
And then the text view in single line
mode going to right of that image view,

40
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,330
and extending however much it needs.

41
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,800
And it has its background

42
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,640
set to a certain drawable that has
a green background with rounded corners.

43
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,730
So essentially, as you say, it boils
down to taking these very basic building

44
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:57,271
blocks, text views, image views,
sometimes rating bar,

45
00:02:57,271 --> 00:03:01,660
progress bar, spinner,
check box, radio button.

46
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:07,320
And combining them based on what your
design shows on a particular screen.

47
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,485
>> Yeah, that's so cool because the
students are learning this in their very

48
00:03:10,485 --> 00:03:13,864
first lesson of Android and you're using
this every day in the Google Play app.

49
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,325
You mentioned working with a designer.

50
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:22,105
So can you describe what
that process is like?

51
00:03:22,105 --> 00:03:24,595
>> So,
it starts from the product people, and

52
00:03:24,595 --> 00:03:27,445
then it goes into
discussions with design and

53
00:03:27,445 --> 00:03:33,525
engineering on what are the screen
surf we are talking about and

54
00:03:33,525 --> 00:03:37,670
how, hopefully, already at
that point of the design site,

55
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:44,180
we start thinking about how we'd adapt
to smaller screens, to larger screens.

56
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:49,480
And after that,
we do these kind of iterations

57
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,070
on putting something on the screen, and
start validating the overall approach.

58
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:59,050
Because sometimes you have a static
mark or maybe a motion mark

59
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,970
from after effects or
whatever tools the designers are using.

60
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:08,690
And you see it on your desktop screen,

61
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:12,440
and then you put it on the phone and
it feels quite different.

62
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,060
Because you have a smaller screen.

63
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,500
Or because it's a tight interaction,
or maybe because you

64
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,560
are depending on all these great big
images, but the network is slow.

65
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,720
And so, you start with this screen that
five seconds doesn't display anything.

66
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,490
And so, hopefully throw out
this iteratic process, where.

67
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,704
We put something on the screen,
not necessarily pixel perfect,

68
00:04:35,704 --> 00:04:39,152
then we can go back into the product
level discussions and see, okay,

69
00:04:39,152 --> 00:04:40,391
what do we need to tweak?

70
00:04:44,152 --> 00:04:47,593
>> So, for developers who don't
have a designer to work with,

71
00:04:47,593 --> 00:04:52,250
do you have suggestions on what they
can do to make their app look better?

72
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,860
>> I would suggest to
going to the website for

73
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,780
material design and get acquainted.

74
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:04,590
Not necessarily with the finer
parts of motion arcs or

75
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:08,895
all those interpolators, but
focus on the bigger picture.

76
00:05:08,895 --> 00:05:14,460
So to have consistent grade
across the entire app,

77
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,820
what we call key lines or
what the design calls key lines.

78
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,660
Vertical and horizontal, where elements
align to certain visual rhythm

79
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,180
and they don't feel just
randomly thrown onto the screen.

80
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,300
And so you have your toolbar.

81
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,880
You have,
maybe other parts of your Chrome,

82
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,470
like the navigation
elements on your screen.

83
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:40,330
And then you have the content itself,
so it's great when it all aligns to

84
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:44,750
the same grid, and you have a little
bit of margins on the sides.

85
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,230
And things are not too
close to each other.

86
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,468
Then you have typography.

87
00:05:49,468 --> 00:05:56,910
Which is a great way to visually

88
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:02,915
convey the relative importance
of different things.

89
00:06:02,915 --> 00:06:08,045
So if you talk about something like
inbox, or Gmail, or an email app.

90
00:06:08,045 --> 00:06:10,995
So if everything has the same
typographical language.

91
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:14,760
If everything is the same color,
the same size and the same style,

92
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,780
then it's not really easy to scan it.

93
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,548
So maybe you would want
the RQ make the sender.

94
00:06:23,548 --> 00:06:27,690
A little bit bigger, like the sender
name, or maybe the title,

95
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:32,850
or the first few words of
the subject to be bold.

96
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,630
And that would allow the user
to more quickly scan.

97
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,860
It depends, once again, on your content.

98
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,140
But I wouldn't recommend necessarily
going with too many styles,

99
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,210
or too many sizes.

100
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:51,220
Three, four styles used
consistently across

101
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:57,100
multiple screens allow the user to kind
of get, even on a subconscious level.

102
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:02,970
To get kind of a picture of how
to get things done in your app,

103
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:06,680
and necessarily fight to understand
where the information is that he or

104
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,410
she is looking for.

105
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,820
And the last thing, colors.

106
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:15,780
Use a little bit of,
especially with material.

107
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:24,140
It kind of leans toward using big
splashes of saturated colors,

108
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:28,490
which looks great, especially if it goes
into the status bar on Lollipop devices.

109
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:34,620
Identify what we call the accent
colors and primary colors.

110
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,320
Identify a couple of colors.

111
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,350
And use them to, kind of, you know,
to style the chrome of your app,

112
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:46,410
so like status bar, action bar, maybe
a little bit in the navigation drawer.

113
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:50,540
And use and highlight so X sends for
the floating action button or

114
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,962
maybe to draw attention to
a certain,very important element,

115
00:07:54,962 --> 00:07:57,240
what you consider a very
important element.

116
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,620
And I think these three
go along way towards

117
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:08,980
emphasizing a little bit more
the visual style of the app.

118
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,140
And of course,

119
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:15,200
if you have an opportunity to team up
with a designer, that's always great.
