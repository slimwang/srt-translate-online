1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,589
So we're going to keep going.

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:02,690
Started with law.

3
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,090
Spent a little bit of
time talking on ethics.

4
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,560
But then going to move on to privacy.

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,520
And privacy's something that we all
have some idea of what it is and

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,770
the fact that we want it.

7
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:19,640
It actually goes all the way
back to Justice Brandeis.

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,176
Famous thing about
the right to be left alone,

9
00:00:22,176 --> 00:00:26,640
but we want to examine it in the context
of, again, the online world.

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,800
So how do we define
privacy in this context?

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,860
Privacy is obviously related
to information about us.

12
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:38,970
In this context it'll be information
related to what we do online, and

13
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,920
data that we have in the visible form.

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,560
So definition basically is
a user's ability to control.

15
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,700
So that's the key thing here, control.

16
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,560
How data pertaining to us or
our activities Can be collected.

17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,450
Who can actually collect such data?

18
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,520
You do your things, you visit a website,

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,770
you send an email, you make
a phone call, whatever it takes,

20
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,580
but who can collect information
about these activities?

21
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,530
How can this information be used,
and can they,

22
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:10,050
the entity that collects it,
share it with somebody else?

23
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,770
Here are the company, agency, whatever.

24
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:17,910
So it really the focus is on our
ability to control all of these,

25
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,940
and that's what privacy is.

26
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:25,190
It's our ability to control information
about us and in this case we're going to

27
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:29,560
focus on information that is collected,
shared, used in the online world.
