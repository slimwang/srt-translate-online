00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,395
>> That was right, David. So note what happened.

2
00:00:32,395 --> 00:00:35,860
There were the contents of the working memory. Here were all the rules of

3
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:42,510
a level in the procedural part of the long-term memory. And so then,

4
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,800
match the contents of the working memory with the antecedents of the various

5
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,890
productions. Depending on the match between the contents of the working memory,

6
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,235
and the antecedents of the rules, some rules got activated,

7
00:00:54,235 --> 00:00:59,290
fired as some people say. Depending upon what rule got fired,

8
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:05,510
that resulted in, perhaps, firing of additional rules. So as David said,

9
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:10,260
if the rule number one got activated because the goal became intentionally walk

10
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,810
the batter, that then lead to the activation of rule number three,

11
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:19,350
which was to select the intentional-walk operator. In this way,

12
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,610
given the set of contents of the working memory and

13
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:27,440
a mapping between those contents and the antecedents of the various production

14
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:32,370
rules that capture the procedure knowledge. Some rules get activated, and

15
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:37,920
this activation continues until sort cannot activate any additional rules.

16
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,540
At that point, sort has given an answer, based on the consequence of a rule

17
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,060
that matches a motor action. Note that sort just provided an account of

18
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,680
how the picture decided on a specific page, on a specific action.

19
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,943
Note that, we're started with the goal of providing an account of

20
00:01:59,943 --> 00:02:06,120
how the pitcher selects on an action or how an AI agent selects on an action.

21
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:11,140
So what is the account? Based on the goal and the percents, match them

22
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,610
with the antecedence of the rules that captured the procedural knowledge.

23
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:20,750
And then, accept the consequent of some production that matches some motor

24
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,850
action from some precepts we have gone to some action.
