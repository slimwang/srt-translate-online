1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,660
To test your application,
we provide a messaging simulator

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,010
that looks very similar to
the Car Experience from Android Auto.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,650
It's actually downloaded as part of the
SDK Manager, so let's get that going so

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,690
we can download it.

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,020
So we go to Tools.

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,670
Android SDK Manager.

7
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,870
And if you scroll right to the bottom,

8
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,030
you'll see it here as
Android Auto API Simulators.

9
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,090
So check that.

10
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,300
Hit Install.

11
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,940
Agree to the License.

12
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,580
And it's downloading it now.

13
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,530
Close the SDK Manager.

14
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,180
Once you've downloaded the APK,

15
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,160
we now need to use the terminal
to install it to the device.

16
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,821
The Messaging Simulator is located in
the SDK's extras/google/simulators/

17
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:39,360
directory.

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,220
You need to ADB install the Messaging
Simulator to your Emulator.

19
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,000
So let's now go back to the Emulator and
run it.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,990
You'll notice that the application
needs to run in Landscape Mode.

21
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,710
So, let's rotate the Emulator.

22
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,670
Typically, you can press Control F11 or

23
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,970
Control Fn F11 to make
this happen like so.

24
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,710
Let's just move the window
up a little bit.

25
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,460
Next, it'll ask for

26
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,150
permissions to be able to get
access to your notifications.

27
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,840
Click continue, check on the box here,
and hit OK to agree to it.

28
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,700
To allow it to see your messages.

29
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,740
Now press back to get back to
the messaging simulator again.

30
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,950
The simulator interfaces to
the Android notification system, and

31
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,380
implements the car extender extensions.

32
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,520
So you can see here how the car
will interpret your messages.

33
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,140
This is great for
testing at your desk during development,

34
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,700
when you don't want to be
sitting in a car for testing.

35
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,470
So now that we've got the simulator
working, let's start up our app and

36
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,750
see how it works.

37
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,490
So let's build it and
install it to the Emulator.

38
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,200
OK.
Go to the Emulator.

39
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,510
Can you see here our sample is running?

40
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,100
So press the DO IT button and
generate the notification.

41
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,260
You then slide it down,
you can see the notification is there.

42
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,110
So now let's switch over to
the simulator to see what it's showing.

43
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:48,070
So, we click on the square icon which
shows all the apps running, and

44
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,390
we click on the messaging simulator.

45
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,160
And so, if you look here you can
see that we've got our message, so

46
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,060
that worked great.

47
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,120
So, let's click on the message
now to hear the audio.

48
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,960
>> New message from Lane P,, received.

49
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,530
Hello there.
How are you?

50
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,570
>> You'll also notice in the logout
output that you've seen acknowledgment

51
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,040
that conversation ID
number 42 has been read.

52
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,970
Let's click the Reply button now.

53
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,200
Note that we can't actually
talk to the simulator here.

54
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,340
That's actually not
supported by the simulator.

55
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,140
But you can't see the string, This is
a reply, was passed to our broadcast

56
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,530
receiver, which handles replies for
conversation ID number 42.

57
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,120
So that's everything.

58
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,760
You now know how to make a fully
Android Auto-enabled messaging app.

59
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,150
Test and install your application,
as well as the simulator, and

60
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,510
verify that you can hear a message and
also reply to it.

61
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,660
Check all the boxes once
you've completed each part.
