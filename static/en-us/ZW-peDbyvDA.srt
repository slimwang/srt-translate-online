00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,616
As anybody who's gone through adolescence knows, the body undergoes great

2
00:00:03,616 --> 00:00:08,870
changes during that time. In fact, during puberty our bodies and brains change

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:14,966
more than at any other time in development except for early childhood. Puberty

4
00:00:14,966 --> 00:00:20,388
is the onset of sexual maturity. We experience a growth spurt. Both sexes begin

5
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:24,553
to grow hair around their genitals and underarms. And men will begin to grow

6
00:00:24,553 --> 00:00:30,567
facial hair. Women also start to develop breasts, and begin menstruating. The

7
00:00:30,567 --> 00:00:34,750
technical term for the onset of menstruation is menart. Whereas the term for

8
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,539
the development of sperm through ejaculation is termed sperm mark. The

9
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:43,095
pituatary gland is critcial in the onset of puberty because it release hormones

10
00:00:43,095 --> 00:00:49,164
including our sex hormones. For women the main sex hormone is estrogen where as

11
00:00:49,164 --> 00:00:54,490
for men it's testosterone. It's important to note that both men and women have

12
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,845
estrogen and testosterone but women have more estrogen and men have more

13
00:00:57,845 --> 00:01:03,580
testosterone. As we'll see when we get to the section on motivation, our sex

14
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:09,052
drive, both men and women's, is largely a function of testosterone. Now let's

15
00:01:09,052 --> 00:01:12,184
go back to Lauren, and see the last part of our psychological domain in

16
00:01:12,184 --> 00:01:13,710
adolescence.
