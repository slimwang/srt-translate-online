The answer is that magenta matches c, yellow matches b, white matches d and

2
00:00:05,226 --> 00:00:11,295
cyan matches a. But how did I figure that out? I went into BlueJ and created a

3
00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:17,410
rectangle, and filled it. So I got something like this. Then when I set the

4
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,089
color, it changed to this sort of red-blue color. Cyan is this sort of

5
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:26,790
green-blue color. I'm pretty sure I know what yellow and white look like, so

6
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:31,286
I'll skip those ones. When I set the color to that color described by a, well,

7
00:00:31,286 --> 00:00:35,950
that looks exactly like the cyan that we just saw. And if I set it to color b,

8
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:43,515
that looks like yellow to me. Color c looks like that blue red magenta color.

9
00:00:43,515 --> 00:00:48,988
And color d. Well, that's just white. It doesn't show up very well on a white

10
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:54,305
background. If you're curious about this system of marking different colors,

11
00:00:54,305 --> 00:00:58,664
you could try making brown or orange. But that's all we'll do with colors for

12
00:00:58,664 --> 00:01:02,136
now. You've got a little more practice with graphics and a pretty cool project

13
00:01:02,136 --> 00:01:03,229
coming up.
