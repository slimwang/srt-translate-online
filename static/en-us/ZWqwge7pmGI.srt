1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,227
The first thing I'm going to do is
actually make a new package, and

2
00:00:03,227 --> 00:00:06,915
I'm going to make it here on this level,
the main shopping list plus, plus level.

3
00:00:06,915 --> 00:00:12,270
[BLANK_AUDIO]

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,700
And I'm going to call
this package model.

5
00:00:16,488 --> 00:00:19,780
And it's going to have all the POJO
that I end up having in my app.

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,080
So inside the model package,
I'm going to go ahead and

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,160
make a new class, and I'll go ahead and
call that class shopping list.

8
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,550
All right, let's start by
making the member variables

9
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,880
that'll be the properties of my object.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,240
There's only two and
they're both strings.

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,840
To satisfy the second rule,

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,760
we're going to need to
make an empty constructor.

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,940
Now I find that using keyboard shortcuts
when making these objects is a complete

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,850
life saver.

15
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,130
The keyboard shortcut that I use
is control return on a Mac or

16
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,370
alt insert on a Windows machine.

17
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,750
I've included these in
the instructor notes.

18
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:55,170
Okay, so this opens up the generate menu
and I'm going to go to constructor and

19
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,220
I'm just going to hit select none,
which generates an constructor.

20
00:00:59,220 --> 00:00:59,988
And while I'm at it,

21
00:00:59,988 --> 00:01:02,266
I'm also going to make a constructor
that has all of the variables

22
00:01:02,266 --> 00:01:05,805
[BLANK_AUDIO]

23
00:01:05,805 --> 00:01:08,800
I'll just select both of these and
hit okay.

24
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,140
Now rule two doesn't prevent you from
creating a constructor like this.

25
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,180
It just requires that
you have this empty one.

26
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,800
Okay, so for
rule three I need some public getters.

27
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,770
I'm going to use the same generate
shortcut to make getters.

28
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,970
And I can just select all of these and
click okay, and

29
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,710
then I have my public getter methods.

30
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,550
Now we only have two variables right
now, but when you have a bunch of

31
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,810
member variables, it's really important
to make sure you make getters for

32
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,840
all of them and
you don't miss any of them.

33
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,950
All right, so that's actually it.

34
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,630
Your POJO is done and ready to be used.

35
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,370
So I'm going to integrate
it with the rest of my app.

36
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,710
We'll start with updating
the right portion.

37
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,800
Now remember the right happens
in the add list dialog fragment.

38
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,310
So I'm going to open this.

39
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:50,669
Okay so I'm going to scroll down to add
shopping list which is where I actually

40
00:01:50,669 --> 00:01:54,611
do the right, and I'm going to make
a new instance of our shopping list

41
00:01:54,611 --> 00:01:58,785
object, and I'm going to go ahead and
pass it the user entry for the name.

42
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:02,015
[BLANK_AUDIO]

43
00:02:02,015 --> 00:02:04,170
And then we need an owner.

44
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,167
Since we don't have user accounts yet,

45
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,937
I'm just going to put a string
that says anonymous owner.

46
00:02:08,937 --> 00:02:12,775
[SOUND] And we'll update that
as soon as we get user accounts.

47
00:02:12,775 --> 00:02:16,006
Okay, and now instead of just
setting this value here,

48
00:02:16,006 --> 00:02:21,050
ListName to a single thing, I'm
going to go ahead and comment this out.

49
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:26,208
Instead what I'm going to do is do ref,
going to get a child.

50
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:29,000
So I'm going to call the root
known active list and

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,280
that's just an arbitrary key for
this object that I'm adding.

52
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,298
And then I'm going to set value and

53
00:02:33,298 --> 00:02:36,390
I'm going to just pass
in that shopping list.

54
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,110
Okay.
So, we also need to change the code

55
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,310
where we grab the data from Fire base.

56
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,400
And that is in the fragment class
over here, shopping list fragment.

57
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,490
Okay now we actually need
to change the read code.

58
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:53,360
First things first, so here, instead of
having a listener attached to list name,

59
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,210
I'm going to attach it to active list.

60
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:57,710
Okay.

61
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,240
Then we can actually keep
using the get value method.

62
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,020
But we have to tell it.

63
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,614
That we're expecting
a shopping list class,

64
00:03:13,614 --> 00:03:17,994
so we pass the object class in here.

65
00:03:17,994 --> 00:03:21,190
And we actually don't
need this cast anymore.

66
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,330
And this is no longer a string.

67
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,080
It becomes a shopping list, and
we're going to go ahead and

68
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,000
call it ShoppingList.

69
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,990
All right let's line that up.

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,880
Then here I don't have a list
name to reference anymore but

71
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,730
I do have a shopping list which
has a get list name method.

72
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,500
Cool.
Now I actually need to reference

73
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,430
to another text view that I
could put the owner text in.

74
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,877
So I'm going to go down to
the bottom of this class and

75
00:03:50,877 --> 00:03:52,811
here's where I initialize all these.

76
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:57,560
Okay and I'm going to go ahead and
make a TextViewOwner.

77
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,800
Okay, and I'm going to grab the view
of the id.text_view_created_by_user,

78
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,760
which is an I.d which is found
in the layout for this fragment.

79
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:11,723
Okay, now I actually haven't declared
this so I'll go to the top of the class,

80
00:04:11,723 --> 00:04:12,539
declare it.

81
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:16,615
[BLANK_AUDIO]

82
00:04:16,615 --> 00:04:17,416
Okay.

83
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:18,696
And now back down here.

84
00:04:18,696 --> 00:04:21,777
[BLANK_AUDIO]

85
00:04:21,777 --> 00:04:26,564
In the listener, I can get this
new text view that I have and

86
00:04:26,564 --> 00:04:28,242
I could do set text.

87
00:04:28,242 --> 00:04:32,231
[BLANK_AUDIO]

88
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:33,460
Get the shopping list.

89
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:40,248
And then get the owner.

90
00:04:40,248 --> 00:04:42,990
And then here, I've gotten the owner.

91
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:46,090
OK, so now what I want you to do is
make those edits for yourself, so

92
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,330
that you could see both the shopping
list name and the shopping list owner.

93
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,770
And then, I want you to break it.

94
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:55,330
Go ahead and remove one of the getter
methods, and tell me what error

95
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,250
you start getting as soon as you don't
have one of those public getters.
