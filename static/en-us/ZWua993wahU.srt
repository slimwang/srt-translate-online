1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now we finished up with random testing, we're going to talk about some more

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
advanced testing issues, such as what to do when a false tester overloads you with bugs.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And it sounds kind of silly but it can really happen in practice.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We're also going to talk about how to take a large test case that makes software fail

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and turn it into a very small test case.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Finally, we're going to talk about how to report bugs in such a way

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
the developers are more likely to pay attention to them.
