1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,080
So to help you understand more about what makes a good feature, remember what we

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,800
discussed just previously, which is the various characteristics of what makes it

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,130
a good feature, repeatable, compact, and having kinds of information that

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:17,240
would allow us to match reliably across the image what are the features.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,250
So, just for us to play around with this, here's a simple example that we

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,030
will play with, the three musicians image from Pablo Picasso.

7
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,180
I'm going to, in this one, put up different boxes, and

8
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,050
the center of those boxes is what I'm going to suggest is what you

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,850
want to say are good features features are not.

10
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,450
So total there are eight boxes.

11
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,660
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,109
All right, the question that I have for you is, so

13
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:47,708
right in the middle of these boxes, for example here, or here, or

14
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:52,553
here, or here, or here, and again, you can consider them to be lot,

15
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:56,414
rather big, to include various types of things here.

16
00:00:56,414 --> 00:01:02,660
Or here and here and here.

17
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,700
Are those good features?

18
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,120
Okay?

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,640
So please, select the ones, on this image, which you can make for good features.

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,606
Again, remember, there are one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

21
00:01:14,606 --> 00:01:16,750
Eight regions I'm asking you to look at.
