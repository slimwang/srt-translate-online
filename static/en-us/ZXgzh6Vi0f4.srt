1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,320
You did your PhD here.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:02,900
>> Yes.
>> And,

3
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,390
I had the privilege of working with you.

4
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:09,280
And, there are certain areas that
you are very passionate about in

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,730
cyber security.

6
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,250
I remember you sent me your book,
What Google Knows About Us.

7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,800
Is that interest still to
occupy some of your time?

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,879
>> So, I'm focused really
on four varying areas.

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,510
Usable security,
which I think is of critical importance.

10
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,080
Security data visualization, the idea
of being able to present information to

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,409
humans, to find insights
that machines can't.

12
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:36,890
Online privacy, critically,
critically important.

13
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,800
And, where I'm spending a lot of
time today, is cyber conflict.

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,080
Typically, what we learn in the
classroom is more system-level security.

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,930
An individual system protecting
an operating system,

16
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,720
or protecting a specific device.

17
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,735
But, we need to think bigger,
and scale up.

18
00:00:55,735 --> 00:00:59,380
How do you protect a city from attack.

19
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,830
That's where we're putting
a lot of though into it now.
