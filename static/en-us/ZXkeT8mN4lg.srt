1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,505
In the first time slot, you can pick writing, statistics, or psychology. So you

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:08,558
have three options. Let's say you pick writing. Then you can either do

3
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:13,510
statistics or psychology. So you have two options. Let's say you do psychology.

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:19,256
This last one is forced. You only have one more option, statistics. You had a

5
00:00:19,256 --> 00:00:23,736
choice in two of the time slots, the first and the second. You could have done

6
00:00:23,736 --> 00:00:28,185
statistics first, then you can choose between writing and psychology. Or you

7
00:00:28,185 --> 00:00:31,902
could do writing first and then choose between statistics and psychology,

8
00:00:31,902 --> 00:00:36,704
etcetera. But once you choose your first two, the last one is forced.

9
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:41,613
Therefore, in this simple situation, there are two degrees of freedom.
