00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,280
First i created the Lego
bricks JavaScript file, and

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,400
then I included it on the page.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,250
Remember that to create
an Angular module,

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:12,410
it's angular.model, the name, and
then an array of dependencies.

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,410
Since this module doesn't depend on
anything, it's just an empty array.

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:19,090
This module needs to be added as
a dependency to the app's main module.

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,870
To do that I just added the name
of the Lego bricks module here.

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,530
It's good to understand how Angular
works without a generator and

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,390
to be able to build files manually.

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,070
Great job doing that.
