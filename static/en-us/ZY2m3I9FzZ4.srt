1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,660
I covered the core of the checklist.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,430
But there are a couple of things
I didn't walk you through.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,300
Custom view controls and
custom accessibility services.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,250
For any custom views that you create for
your app, you'll want to

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,850
implement the accessibility interfaces
to support the native features.

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:19,590
Beyond that, developers may build
their own accessibility services,

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,120
which can provide enhanced usability
features, such as audio prompting,

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,250
physical feedback, and
alternative navigation modes.

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,910
Accessibility services can
provide these enhancements for

10
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,860
all applications, a set of applications,
or just a single app.

11
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,730
This means that custom services you
build can be used by other apps, or that

12
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,400
your app might be able to use someone
else's custom accessibility feature.

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,120
So be sure to cover all of
your accessibility bases.
