1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,600
So here's the application that you're
going to build over the next few

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,230
minutes.

3
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,360
It's a simple app that gives you
your latitude and your longitude,

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,460
helping you to accurately
position yourself on the globe.

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,710
Now as you can imagine, there's lots of
great uses for this kind of information.

6
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,690
One of the first mobile apps I
personally ever built was for

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,010
dog walkers.

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,030
They would run the app when they
walked the dog for someone else so

9
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,140
that the dog's owner could
see the path of the walk.

10
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,510
It worked by taking a very
accurate latitude and

11
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,870
longitude reading every few seconds.

12
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,270
In this case, of course,
we're just taking it once.

13
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,590
But let's see how you would do that.

14
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,150
Let's see how you would get
that type of information.

15
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,990
In the previous lesson, we were getting
continuous updates on the location, but

16
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,190
in this one we're going to
do it a little differently.

17
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,690
We're going to get the latitude and
longitude only once upon connection.

18
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,070
Now I think it's important
to learn by doing, so

19
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,430
we're going to learn how to build
this application by stepping through

20
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,640
what needs to be done little by little.

21
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,940
So if you haven't already done so, open
Android Studio and create a new project.

22
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,610
Give it a name, in this case
I'm calling it Location2_1, and

23
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,620
you're going to pick it to
have a single blank activity.

24
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,660
So you can see here in this option
I'm going to say blank activity,

25
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,320
I'm going to give it
a single blank activity, and

26
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,450
I'm going to keep all the defaults.

27
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:14,020
And when Android Studio's finished doing
its thing, you'll have your project

28
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,900
created for you, and the activity,
generally by default, is opened.

29
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,290
But if it isn't,
just find the layout folder and

30
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,490
look for
activity_main within that folder.

31
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,820
Then you can see that this is
the basic hello world layout that's

32
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,180
created for you.

33
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,067
So what we're going to do is we're
going to just take a look at the tags

34
00:01:30,067 --> 00:01:30,708
for this, and

35
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:34,300
we can see in here there's a TextView
simply containing the words hello world.

36
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,730
In the next couple of steps we're
going to change this to update it for

37
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,810
the UI that we showed in
the demonstration just a moment ago.
