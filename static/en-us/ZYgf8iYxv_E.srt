00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,850
Your shell, and every other program for
that matter, has a working directory.

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,810
You can think of this as
the directory that it's looking at or

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,250
focused on, or the one that it
uses as the default location for

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,760
most commands to find files in.

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,590
For instance,

6
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:22,920
when you've run LS before, you got
a listing of files in a directory.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,870
But which directory?

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:30,140
LS with no arguments will list files in
the shell's current working directory.

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,870
If you want to know
the path of that directory,

10
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:38,040
you can use the pwd command which
stands for print working directory, and

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,360
this says that here the working
directory is /home/vagrant.

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,500
You can change the working
directory with the CD command for

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,190
change directory.

14
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,140
There are a few
different ways to use it.

15
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,030
You can give the full path
of a directory Like var/log.

16
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,720
Or you can give the name of a directory
that's inside the current one.

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,310
For instance,

18
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:03,840
if there were a directory called three,
you could say cd three, but there's not.

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,860
And you can also use cd..

20
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,490
to go up the tree to the parent of
the current directory, for instance,

21
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,370
from var/log to var.

22
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,220
So let's go back to where we started,

23
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,750
and you'll see that inside /home/vagrant
there's something called ocean.

24
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:24,430
Well, that's a directory,
and so we can cd into it.

25
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,390
And if you take a look
inside the ocean directory,

26
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,480
you'll see it has some contents.

27
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,110
So using the cd and ls commands,
map out the sub directories and

28
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,180
files you find inside
that ocean directory.

29
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,540
Put them here in these boxes.
