00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,390
The nice thing about l2 regularization
is that its very, very simple.

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,689
Because you just add it to your loss,

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:09,570
the structure of your network
doesn't have to change.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,360
You can even compute
its derivative by hand.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,540
Remember that the l2 norm stands for

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,790
the sum of the squares of
the individual elements in a vector.

7
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:22,950
Which of these formulas gives you the
derivative of the l2 norm of a vector?
