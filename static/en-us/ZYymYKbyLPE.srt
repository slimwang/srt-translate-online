1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,220
So, m equals Vy is the last column.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:08,039
And, here's something, just because of what we said before,

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,670
these singular values of A, that's d, well the singular values of

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:19,230
A are the square roots of the eigenvalues of A transpose A,

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,960
and the columns of V are the eigenvector of A transpose A.

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,580
So, I could show you this, it's actually pretty, well, I was going to say but

7
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,833
you know, if I just write out this,

8
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:37,820
since A is we know is written to UDV, transpose.

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:38,700
Okay.

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:47,290
A transpose A, is just that transpose, so that's VD transpose U transpose.

11
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,480
Well, okay, U is an orthogonal vector, so

12
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,770
U transpose is also U inverse, so that's an identity, okay, so that goes away.

13
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:01,650
D transpose D, well D is a diagonal matrix, so D transpose D is just, I'll,

14
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:06,350
I'm just going to call it D squared, it's just the squared values, okay?

15
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,825
And V transpose V.

16
00:01:07,825 --> 00:01:14,010
So, I'm just, so I'm just going to write that A transpose A is equal to VD

17
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:22,300
squared V transpose, and that is the equation of the eigen-decomposition,

18
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:27,180
where V is the, eigenvectors of A transpose A.

19
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,620
And by pulling out the very last one,

20
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:33,590
I'm pulling out the eigenvector with the smallest value of A transpose A.

21
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,470
Just to recap.

22
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:41,500
Given that, what we have is Am equal 0 for some long A, what we do is we find

23
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:48,570
the eigenvector of A transpose A with the smallest eigenvalue, and that's our m.

24
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:53,700
That is the set of values that create the calibration matrix for us.

25
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,200
Cool.
