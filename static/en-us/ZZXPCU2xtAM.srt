1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,740
In code, to create a camera position,
you use a CameraPosition.builder.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,470
This builder takes the properties that
you've just seen, such as the target,

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,390
which is the latitude and longitude.

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:14,050
The zoom that you want, how far you
want to be zoomed into the map.

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,100
The baring of the camera,
the direction that it's pointing in and

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,970
the tilt of the camera.

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,030
When you've set all of these
properties and you build it,

8
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,760
you'll then get a camera position and
I've just called it cp here.

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,870
Then if you want to instantaneously
update the map to show the location that

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:33,920
the camera is pointing at with these
values, you call map.movecamera and

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,150
you pass it, a camera update
factory.newcameraposition

12
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,660
with that camera position
that you've just defined.

13
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,620
Like I said, this will instantaneously
move the map to that location.

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,630
But you may also want to animate
the map to that position

15
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,820
where you'll see a flyover type effect
where you'll fly to the new location.

16
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,850
And to do this,
you'll use animateCamera.

17
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,241
And animateCamera takes the same
CameraUpdateFactory.newCameraPosition

18
00:00:58,241 --> 00:01:02,030
ith your camera position, but it also
has a couple of extra parameters.

19
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,820
One is the time in milliseconds
that you wanted to take to fly to

20
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,300
the new location.

21
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,560
Of course you might want to zip
over there really quickly or

22
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,860
you might want to slow pan up over
the Earth and down to the new location.

23
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,230
You'd specify the time
in milliseconds here.

24
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:20,090
So if you wanted to take five seconds,
you'd put 5,000 milliseconds in here.

25
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,150
And the callback function gets called
when the animation is complete.

26
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,910
So if you want to execute some
code once the animation is done,

27
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,960
you could put it in
that callback function.

28
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,570
If you don't want to use a callback
function, you can just put a null here.

29
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,830
Let's take a look at
an animated camera in action.
