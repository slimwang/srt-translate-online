Objects with UVs and textures can be imported into 3JS. I won't be describing

2
00:00:04,208 --> 00:00:07,319
this process, as it doesn't have all that much to do with the principles of

3
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,690
computer graphics. See the additional course materials for more information.

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,525
What's important to know is how the UVs of an object affect how the texture is

5
00:00:14,525 --> 00:00:17,970
mapped to the surface. The basic principle is that by changing the UVs, we

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,744
select a different part of the texture. Here are the textures that are attached

7
00:00:21,744 --> 00:00:25,810
to a single model. The way in which a model is associated with its texture is

8
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,440
called texture mapping. The spheres and other objects we saw before had fairly

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,405
natural projections of the texture onto their surfaces. For a more complex

10
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:36,850
object, such as this humanoid, an artist uses a modeling program to assign the

11
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:42,545
parts of the texture to the model. When a triangle mesh has a texture applied

12
00:00:42,545 --> 00:00:46,373
to it the texture is used by the whole mesh. Because of this, a single texture

13
00:00:46,373 --> 00:00:50,160
is used to hold all the different images for the various parts of the mesh.

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,123
This kind of texture is called a texture atlas or a mosaic.
