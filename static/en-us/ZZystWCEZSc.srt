1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,710
This first statement is true. PCP is generally undecidable for 7 pairs of strings or more.

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:10,540
To see that you only need 7 pairs of strings to specify any computer program,

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,410
and that includes undecidable computer programs.

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,280
If PCP was decidable for 7 pairs of strings or more,

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,620
then you would be able to answer undecidable questions.

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,620
The second statement is not true.

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,290
PCP is not generally decidable for 6 pairs of strings or less.

8
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:30,160
That's because we don't know if we can represent an undecidable computer program

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,700
with less than 7 pairs of strings.

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,700
We might well be able to. We can't say this for certain.

11
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,340
This third statement is true.

12
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,630
Any SAT problem can be transformed into a PCP using 7 strings.

13
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:46,930
We might be able to transform it into a PCP using less than 7 strings,

14
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,180
but if we can do that we can certainly use 7 strings

15
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:54,340
and just not actually use them in our list of decisions.

16
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,330
By that same reasoning, this last statement is not true.

17
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,260
No PCP instance with 7 pairs of strings or more is decidable.

18
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,040
That's actually not the case, because you can think of a decidable program

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,040
with less than 7 strings or 7 pairs of strings,

20
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,700
and then simply add in more strings that you don't end up using.

21
00:01:11,700 --> 99:59:59,999
This is perfectly acceptable. So this is not a true statement.
