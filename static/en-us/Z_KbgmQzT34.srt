00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,114
To understand how our brains develop, we need to understand a bit about how

2
00:00:03,114 --> 00:00:07,290
genetic information is used to build them. So, let's bring back Matt, our

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,695
resident genetics expert. So, Matt, how does your body know how to build you?

4
00:00:11,695 --> 00:00:15,973
>> Virtually, every cell in your body, including your brain cells has all the

5
00:00:15,973 --> 00:00:22,007
information necessary to build you. Inside every cell resides the genetic

6
00:00:22,007 --> 00:00:27,745
construction or DNA that is arranged in 23 pairs of chromosomes.

7
00:00:27,745 --> 00:00:32,395
>> Wait, so I know that DNA is the blueprint for making a living thing, but what

8
00:00:32,395 --> 00:00:35,630
role do chromosomes play?

9
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:41,758
>> chromosomes are actually long strands of DNA wrapped around proteins. You've

10
00:00:41,758 --> 00:00:45,930
probably seen pictures of them before. It's how our cells organize this

11
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,140
information structurally.

12
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,965
>> so, that's cool, but how does it translate into who I am, or who you are?

13
00:00:52,965 --> 00:00:59,824
>> Well, DNA is made up of four building blocks, called nucleotides. Adenine,

14
00:00:59,824 --> 00:01:06,062
Thymine, Guanine, and Cytosine. We usually refer to just the letters. A, T, G

15
00:01:06,062 --> 00:01:12,245
and C. You have over 3 billion of these letters in a unique sequence that makes

16
00:01:12,245 --> 00:01:19,080
up who you are. And your cells use this as a set of instructions to create you.

17
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,920
>> Wow, 3 billion sounds like a lot. I wonder how that compares to other living

18
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,709
organisms?
