1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,693
I know you're excited to run the app. 
And I'm going to show you how to do it

2
00:00:03,693 --> 00:00:06,750
without a physical device, 
because we'll be using the emulator.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,581
But first, we need to install one more 
component from the Android SDK Manager.

4
00:00:10,581 --> 00:00:13,383
Click on this button to open up 
the Android SDK Manager.

5
00:00:13,383 --> 00:00:15,697
Scroll to the bottom 
of the list to find HAXM.

6
00:00:15,697 --> 00:00:17,874
It stands for hardware 
accelerated execution manager.

7
00:00:17,874 --> 00:00:20,851
And it will speed up our emulator. 
So go ahead and deselect

8
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:23,969
the other packages, 
and just install this one.

9
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:26,537
Accept the license, and then continue. 
We have to do one more step

10
00:00:26,537 --> 00:00:28,502
after this to install HAXM.

11
00:00:28,502 --> 00:00:31,556
I'll show you the remaining steps 
on a Mac, but for the other platforms

12
00:00:31,556 --> 00:00:33,993
you can check the link below. 
First, find Android Studio

13
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:37,627
under the applications folder, 
and then hit show package contents.

14
00:00:37,627 --> 00:00:40,289
Then, in the SDK folder, 
there'll be an extras folder

15
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:43,920
containing an Intel folder 
with the HAXM folder.

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,555
Then, we click on the DMG file, 
open it up and then continue.

17
00:00:48,555 --> 00:00:51,558
Step through this installer, 
and the default values are fine.

18
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:55,000
Once installation is complete, 
you can close all the windows.
