00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,740
Here are the solutions. Great work if you got most of these right. For these

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,646
two parabolas, we know that they're going to open up or down, since they're in

3
00:00:08,646 --> 00:00:14,315
the form y equals. We look at these numbers or the a value to determine whether

4
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:19,956
or not they open up, or whether or not they open down. Since the a value is

5
00:00:19,956 --> 00:00:25,747
negative here, we know that this parabola must open down. And since the a value

6
00:00:25,747 --> 00:00:31,408
is positive here, we know that this parabola opens up. To find the vertex of

7
00:00:31,408 --> 00:00:36,870
this parabola, we simply look at the h and k value. h would be positive 4, by

8
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,443
setting this binomial equal to zero. And k would be positive 2. The number

9
00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:48,634
added on the end. For this parabola, the vertex is 1,3. Again, we set the

10
00:00:48,634 --> 00:00:53,903
binomial equal to zero. So that way, we get an x coordinate of x equals 1. The

11
00:00:53,903 --> 00:00:57,814
y coordinate of the vertex is the k value, or just positive 3. These two

12
00:00:57,814 --> 00:01:03,858
parabolas here open left or right, since they're of the form x equals. By

13
00:01:03,858 --> 00:01:07,516
looking at the a value, we can see that one of them is negative, and the other

14
00:01:07,516 --> 00:01:13,565
one is a positive 1. This means that the negative 1 must open to the left and

15
00:01:13,565 --> 00:01:18,978
that the positive 1 must open to the right. Remember, negative a values for x

16
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:23,065
equals parabolas make the parabola open to the left, whereas positive values of

17
00:01:23,065 --> 00:01:28,806
a for x equal parabolas make the parabola open to the right. And finally, to

18
00:01:28,806 --> 00:01:32,649
find the vertex for this parabola, we look at the value of h here and the value

19
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:38,928
of k here. H is simply positive 2, our x coordinate of the vertex. And our y

20
00:01:38,928 --> 00:01:44,965
coordinate of the vertex is positive 1. We set this binomial equal to 0, to get

21
00:01:44,965 --> 00:01:50,996
y equals 1. And we find this vertex in a similar way. Here's the h value for

22
00:01:50,996 --> 00:01:57,204
our vertex. The x coordinate is positive 2. And here's the y value for our

23
00:01:57,204 --> 00:02:02,001
vertex, its negative 3. Remember we set the binomial y plus 3 equal to 0 and

24
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:05,300
solve for the y coordinate of this vertex.
