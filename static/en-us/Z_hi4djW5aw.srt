1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,609
my name is actually going I'm head of

2
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:07,349
autonomous driving here at mercedes-benz

3
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:09,330
research and development north america

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,369
in sunnyvale we started the group three

5
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:13,769
years ago out of a team of seven people

6
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,359
and we have grown it now up to 16 really

7
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,629
excited to working with hot topic

8
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:23,579
we have a very long tradition an

9
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:26,009
autonomous driving a mercedes-benz we

10
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:27,839
drove out anonymously on the highway

11
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:30,390
already 20 years ago during the

12
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,179
Prometheus project the latest big

13
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:35,579
achievement was driving the historic

14
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,100
events route from my name to call time

15
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,299
in 2013 showing that driving country

16
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:44,189
roads and in the city traffic is

17
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:46,738
possible we introduce the topic 0

18
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:49,799
assistant to 13 which allows you to live

19
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,929
semi-autonomous Lee in stop-and-go

20
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:55,679
traffic and we recently launched the dr

21
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:58,079
pilot which allows you to drive simulate

22
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,988
enormously on highways so we take turns

23
00:01:00,988 --> 00:01:02,969
driving very seriously and I think we

24
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,978
have been really successful or in that

25
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:07,469
field when hiring people for the

26
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:09,329
autonomous driving team we're looking

27
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:11,640
for strong computer science skills

28
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,299
especially programming in c++ in

29
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,340
addition for prototypes were using

30
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,099
matlab and we are using Python for

31
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:23,670
scripting and deep learning tools

32
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,399
respective we are looking at the general

33
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:28,679
good understanding about autonomous

34
00:01:28,679 --> 00:01:31,379
driving and how that works and we are

35
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:34,259
looking at the solid foundation in terms

36
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,759
of math statistics probabilistic and

37
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,858
algorithms when preparing for the

38
00:01:40,858 --> 00:01:43,468
interview the applicant should brush up

39
00:01:43,468 --> 00:01:45,688
their programming skills

40
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:49,289
secondly they should think how their

41
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:52,828
experience and education fits to the job

42
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:54,840
some applicants are surprised to hear

43
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,030
questions how does not number system

44
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,799
works and so on and people should

45
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,049
prepare that in advance should have an

46
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:03,239
understanding what's going on in that

47
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:06,450
field and also what procedures has

48
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,050
already achieved in that

49
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,759
field personally I want to see the

50
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,280
interview from the applicant that he or

51
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,360
she is interested motivated curious

52
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,659
about the topic wants to learn how it

53
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:22,479
works at mercedes we have lots of

54
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:25,210
interns and we are happy to train people

55
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,330
to get the right skills and get

56
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,740
experience in the field we have

57
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,139
employees from all around the world from

58
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:34,629
China are from India from Germany from

59
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:38,139
the u.s. from France from Spain from

60
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:40,599
actually all around the world

61
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:43,300
I think the winner agrees a great thing

62
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,580
to get the right experience in that

63
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,759
field so if you have already a really

64
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:51,310
solid foundation in computer science for

65
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,039
example you and have successfully

66
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:56,860
achieved the nanodegree you are a pretty

67
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,550
good candidate for first of all I love

68
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,379
the topics are working on autonomous

69
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:04,509
driving is terrific

70
00:03:04,509 --> 00:03:05,710
probably I have the best job in the

71
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,289
world right now working in mercedes also

72
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:10,210
is highly motivating because we can

73
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:13,180
bring enormous cars to reality people

74
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,620
are coming here because they're

75
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,659
motivated to work on the best projects

76
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:18,310
in the world i think they are keen to

77
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,270
work on it

78
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,759
they're focused on getting the job done

79
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:25,810
and explore new ways of solving this

80
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,909
really challenging task of autonomous

81
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:30,939
driving in terms of T work and the

82
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:33,610
culture in the collaboration it's

83
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,069
awesome in here so we have highly

84
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:38,620
motivated team working together to solve

85
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,849
the problems

86
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:41,739
it's also man i love to come to work

87
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:43,689
every day if you want to shape the

88
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:45,400
future for autonomous cars and

89
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:51,780
