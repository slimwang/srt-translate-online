1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:06,340
It's also worth bearing in mind what this course is not about. The course is not

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,790
an introduction to networking, so there are a

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,300
number of basic topics that won't be covered in

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,060
this course. In particular, we'll assume that you're

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,270
already familiar with the basics of things like TCP,

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,710
Socket programming, and so forth. Anything that you

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,150
might have picked up in an introductory networking course.

8
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,820
We are just going to assume as a

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,800
prerequisite for this course. So before you proceed,

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,930
it may be worth revisiting some of

11
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,970
your old undergraduate networking course material. The course

12
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,630
is also not providing any introduction to

13
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,650
programming. However, many assignments in the course will

14
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,210
make use of some amount of programming. So,

15
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:51,600
some knowledge of scripting languages like Ruby, Python

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,040
or Perl will certainly be helpful in some assignments.

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,320
We'll be making a lot of use of a

18
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,750
network emulation toolkit called Mininet and to use that

19
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,330
tool most effectively, You will certainly want to learn

20
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:08,110
some Python if you don't already know it. Don't

21
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,690
worry if you don't know these languages already though.

22
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,460
There's plenty of time to learn, in the course.

23
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,671
Since the deadlines are fairly spread out, and the assignments

24
00:01:16,671 --> 00:01:20,740
aren't focused on knowledge of programming per say. But rather, the

25
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,520
concepts that you are going to realize in the programming languages.
