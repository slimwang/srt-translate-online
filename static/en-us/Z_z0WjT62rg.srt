1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,560
So let's see if we can compute
the size of the flat page table.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,710
Let's say that the page table
needs to have 8 bytes per entry.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,580
For example, because it has
a 64-bit physical address space.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,330
Let's say that the page size is 4 kB.

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,910
Let's say that the system only has
two processes that are active.

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,390
Let's say that the system only
really has 2 GB of physical memory.

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,560
Let's say that the programs
are creating 32-bit virtual addresses.

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,411
Let's say that the process number one
is using only 1 MB of it's available

9
00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:33,290
32-bit address space.

10
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:37,500
And let's say that process number two
is using 1 GB of its virtual memory.

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,760
It could use up to 4 GB but
it's only using 1 GB.

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,450
The question for you is,

13
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,860
what is the total size of all the page
tables in the system, in megabytes?
