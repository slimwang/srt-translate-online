1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,200
So here's a sort of toy or a schematic, right?

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,830
So the, the general idea is that we've got some lighting.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,970
All right? And the lighting hits objects.

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,990
And so we need physical models or models of the physics.

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:18,050
And the idea is that that causes light to impinge upon whatever your

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,480
photo sensitive system is.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,010
Whether it's a, a retina or a CCD, or CMOS, or

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,850
whatever your imaging technology is, and then, of course,

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,330
that's the picture, that we're going to take a look at in the computer.

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:34,480
So there are all sorts of physical processes that impact the image that

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,700
you're going to see.

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,570
So, you know, here's a picture, I think,

13
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,550
actually, this might be from [INAUDIBLE] don't remember.

14
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:44,070
And you know, here is a picture, two pictures and

15
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,490
it is pretty clear to you what is going on here, right?

16
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:50,650
We've got sort of this textured stuff everywhere and

17
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,150
there is differential light falling on it.

18
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,730
There are shadows.

19
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,230
And so when you look at that,

20
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:01,130
you probably don't think that that's a texture painted on the, the surface of

21
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:06,780
the road, but rather that that's a shadow on a more uniform texture.

22
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,070
But of course, it could of been painted.

23
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,010
So it's your brain has to be doing something in order to understand that.

24
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,170
And this white tape that's shown here,

25
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,580
is just a little bit showing you sort of how things appear to you, right.

26
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,790
To you it's clear that this is a thing that's on the ground, right, that,

27
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,960
that is not part of the texture of the ground, but is, is something else.

28
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,160
So you said okay, that's one thing that is reflecting one way, and I've got

29
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,670
some other object, namely the, the, the asphalt, that's reflecting another way.

30
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,880
So that's sort of lighting surfaces and shadows.

31
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,750
Of course, there are reflections, right, so in both of these window pictures,

32
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,690
you know, you're probably guessing that's there's not like,

33
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,780
this thing here that's behind the window, and

34
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,060
maybe it's just a, a reflection of what's behind you.

35
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,150
Likewise, you can see in this tree, it's all distorted a little bit,

36
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:55,600
because maybe this glass isn't so perfect, but the idea is that you can

37
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,310
see this reflection, and that reflection is impacting the image that gets made.

38
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:03,050
Going along with reflection is refraction.

39
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,590
Right, so it's most easily seen in things like water, or

40
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,510
in various kinds of deformed glass.

41
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:11,420
So here, you know, these wavy lines on the bottom of the pool,

42
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,140
well, there are no wavy lines on the bottom of the pool,

43
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:19,350
at least I hope not but instead the water itself is no longer flat there.

44
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,720
There are some waves and

45
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,900
that's causing the light rays to bend in a particular way.

46
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,930
So, again, that impacts the image that you see.

47
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,490
This beautiful picture here, has got both reflection and

48
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,110
refraction going on inside of it.

49
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,050
An interesting property which is really,

50
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:43,100
it's just about reflection is what's referred to as interreflections and

51
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,290
both of these pictures are drawn from computer graphics.

52
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,620
It's not so much about the nature of the surface but what impacts the light that

53
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,930
you see at a point, and sometimes we tend to think of well,

54
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,750
there's just some light source and it's illuminating our objects.

55
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,980
Well, there's been a lot of work done sort of since the 90's on what's

56
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,610
referred to as interreflection, both in computer vision and computer graphics.

57
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,870
So here where we have the shiny materials,

58
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,370
you can see everything being reflected within it.

59
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,300
But I think a more subtle example is oh this is

60
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,350
the famous graphics teapot being rendered in a variety of ways, now of course,

61
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:20,560
in a shiny surface you know that you're going to see a reflection of this

62
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,540
purple teapot in front of it, but also in these partially reflective things.

63
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,500
You see this purple color in there?

64
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,020
That's reflective of this purple pot that's in front of it, so the idea is,

65
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,310
you have all this light bouncing around.

66
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:38,280
And all of that light can impact what's actually observed at a particular point.

67
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,570
In computer graphics there's a method called ray tracing, which basically,

68
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,380
as rays of light come in and they bounce off, they create illumination at all

69
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:51,530
these, different facets of the model, and you can get a really rich, rendering.

70
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,440
You know, one of the things that's a little different in

71
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,450
computer vision today than before is.

72
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,310
Traditionally when I talk computer vision I could assume that everybody had

73
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:58,950
taken graphics.

74
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,250
because there was sort of this connection between graphics and vision.

75
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,650
These days it's much more likely people have taken machine learning because it's

76
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,150
as if you have computer vision is a data driven inference problem.

77
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,480
And people are less likely to have taken a graphics course and

78
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,540
understand the physics that are here.

79
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,500
Computer vision draws both from understanding what's going on from data, but

80
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,779
also having built in models that have to do with the, the nature of the physics.

81
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,600
Then there is things that happen to the light between bouncing off a surface and

82
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,090
entering your eye.

83
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,450
So here's an example referred to as scattering.

84
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,980
Where this is what the picture maybe should look like if you think of

85
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,600
it as being very clear.

86
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,640
But if you actually just took a look at the raw image you would

87
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,930
see this because of moisture and

88
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,160
other particulates in the air, and the, the wavelengths that are absorbed.

89
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,280
That the light changes as it comes through.

90
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,090
And in fact there was a really cool paper done about depth,

91
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,880
from what's called The Dark Channel.

92
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,000
Which basically says that you know, the further away something is,

93
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,610
the harder it is for something to be black in your image,

94
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,080
because there's a little bit of fog all the way through.

95
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,730
So they actually estimate the depth of the seam based upon,

96
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,200
essentially, the amount of fog induced lightness that's there.

97
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,380
And this is all from an understanding of the nature of the physics.

98
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,900
And, there are lots of other phenomena that impact, you know,

99
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,690
the light that comes in, you know, here's fog, and water dripping, and,

100
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,040
and all sorts of, different types of effects
