If we're doing a 2 tailed test. Where we know we're doing a 2 tailed test

2
00:00:04,644 --> 00:00:09,540
because of our hypotheses. Then the p value is the probability above this t

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:15,180
statistic. And below the negative version of that t statistic. So this image

00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,453
shows our p value.
