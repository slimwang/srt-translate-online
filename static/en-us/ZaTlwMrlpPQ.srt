00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Norvig] Here I've added the tests.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
For a straight flush the value is 8, the value for a straight flush,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
followed by a 10, because 10 is the high card in this particular straight flush.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
For 4 of a kind the value is 7, indicating 4 of a kind,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
then a 9, indicating that we had four 9s,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and then another 7, indicating that the remaining card was the 7 of diamonds.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And for a full house the value is 6, 6 meaning full house,

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
followed by a 10, meaning that we had three 10s,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and a 7, meaning that we had two 7s.
