1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,480
So a couple that I came up with are work ethic,

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,290
which can be kind of hard to categorize between learned and

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:10,240
innate. Cancer can sometimes be difficult to know if it's visible

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,560
or hidden, right, it depends on which level we're talking about

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,880
at the cellular or the total body level. Then you have

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,410
something like aggression, which can be hard to define as behavioral

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,480
or physical. That may be behavior you show, but the outcome

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,560
is physical, and so it might be how we quantify it.

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,270
Here's actually a word cloud of student responses

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,780
that you and your fellow classmates submitted. Remember that

11
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,400
in a word cloud, the bigger the word,

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,940
the more it was submitted by your fellow students

13
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,160
as a trait that's difficult to distinguish in

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,880
one of our three categories here. Look around the

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,150
list and see if you agree if some of

16
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,000
these traits are difficult to define in these categories.
