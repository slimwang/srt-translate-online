00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Peter] So given the speed of light in meters per second

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and a variable, nano_per_second,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
representing the number of nanoseconds in a single second,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
let's create our nanodistance.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
To initialize a variable, you simply write out the name.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And in order to get the nanodistance,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
we're going to divide the speed of light by nano per second.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
To check our code, let's print it out.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And when we run it, we get 0.2998.
