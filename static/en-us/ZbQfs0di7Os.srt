1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,830
So let's see if we are able to

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:05,140
establish what's a fault, error, and failure, in an

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,669
example when a laptop falls down. So we had

4
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:11,355
a laptop and the first thing that happens, is

5
00:00:11,355 --> 00:00:18,370
that it falls out of my bag and then what happens is that it hits the pavement.

6
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,811
As a result of that, the pavement develops a

7
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:26,600
crack and then the crack expands during the winter.

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:33,027
So the pavement breaks and needs to be replaced. So for this pavement

9
00:00:33,027 --> 00:00:39,305
failure is event, which of these six events. The fault is which

10
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:45,360
of these events? And the first error is which of these events?
