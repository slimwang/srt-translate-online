1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,690
Now in terms of running performance,
keep in mind that some overdraw might be

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:08,250
necessary and acceptable, like the
screen here from Android's action bar.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,278
But if you want to
polished app experience,

4
00:00:10,278 --> 00:00:13,045
you'll want to make sure you
reduce it as much as possible.

5
00:00:13,045 --> 00:00:13,962
All right, cool.

6
00:00:13,962 --> 00:00:16,809
Let me send it back to Colt to tell
you a little bit more about clipping,

7
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:20,040
another optimization that you
can use to reduce overdraw.

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,570
All yours, Colt.
