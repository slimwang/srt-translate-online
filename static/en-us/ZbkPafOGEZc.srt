When writing the expressions, it's best to use x for the longer leg. We know

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,410
that since the hypotenuse is 5 inches longer than the longer leg and the

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:13,490
shorter leg is 5 inches shorter than that longer leg. The longer leg is the

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,812
connecting thread that links the relationships of the sides together. So, if we

5
00:00:17,812 --> 00:00:22,372
let X equal the longer leg, then the hypotenuse will be 5 units longer or x

6
00:00:22,372 --> 00:00:30,410
plus 5 and the shorter leg will be x minus 5. 5 units less than the longer leg.

Great thinking if you found these 3 expressions this one was challenging.
