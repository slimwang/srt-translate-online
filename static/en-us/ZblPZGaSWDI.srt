1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,573
Scientific notation is written in a very specific form. So people all over the

2
00:00:04,573 --> 00:00:09,833
world can compare numbers that are really large or really small. That form is a

3
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:15,430
times 10 to the b. Note this x here denotes mulitiplication. It is not a

4
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:20,966
variable. This formula requires that this first number here is a number between

5
00:00:20,966 --> 00:00:27,022
1, which included, and 10, not included. And then this is multiplied by integer

6
00:00:27,022 --> 00:00:32,072
power of 10. So an example of something like this would be 5.6 times 10 to the

7
00:00:32,072 --> 00:00:38,129
2. Notice that 5.6 is in fact a number between 1 and 10. This is something we

8
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:41,937
need to be very careful about. And it's easy to make a mistake. For example, we

9
00:00:41,937 --> 00:00:46,058
can make one very small change. If instead, we have 56 times 10 to the 2, we

10
00:00:46,058 --> 00:00:52,910
are no longer writing in scientific notation. 56 is not between 1 and 10. Now

11
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:56,394
I'm going to write down several numbers. And I'd like you to tell me, which of

12
00:00:56,394 --> 00:01:01,168
them are not written in the proper form for scientific notation? We have 5

13
00:01:01,168 --> 00:01:06,902
times 10 to the 12th, 6.543 times 10 to the negative 4, 6 times 10 to the 6.5,

14
00:01:06,902 --> 00:01:16,033
1.2 times 100 to the 4th, 0.5 times 10 to 3rd, 4 times 2 to the 6th. And last

15
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:20,583
but not least, 325 times 10 to the negative 7.
