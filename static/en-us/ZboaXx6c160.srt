00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,713
But sometimes factoring by grouping isn't so straightforward. Let's consider an

2
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:08,667
expression like this. Notice that in these first two group of terms I have a

3
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:12,987
greatest common factor of one. The same is true in these second two terms. So I

4
00:00:12,987 --> 00:00:17,448
need to do something else. So we can switch the order of the terms. So you try

5
00:00:17,448 --> 00:00:21,164
this one. Regroup the terms and then try factoring by grouping.
