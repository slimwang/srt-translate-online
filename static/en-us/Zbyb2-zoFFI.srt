1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,388
We've already talked a lot about
finding features, detecting them,

2
00:00:03,388 --> 00:00:05,310
describing them and matching them.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,400
And so, we're not going to do much more
in terms of that feature matching for

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,000
motion, okay?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,180
Instead, what we're going to be doing
over the next couple times is focusing

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,220
on the dense methods where
we look at the derivatives,

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,860
we look at how things change.

8
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,510
And just to sort of spill
the beans all the way at the end,

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,080
the best methods currently,
use a combination of the,

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,300
the feature to get
the long-range matches and

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,740
local gradients in order to
get the dense shorter range.

12
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,590
So you already know about
the feature stuff, so

13
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,940
now we need to go over
the dense direct stuff.

14
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,480
And that's what we're going to be
doing over the next couple of lessons.
