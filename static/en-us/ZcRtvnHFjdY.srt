1
00:00:00,018 --> 00:00:02,447
The identity element for unsigned int is the element

2
00:00:02,447 --> 00:00:05,396
that will give us back the same output for any given input,

3
00:00:05,396 --> 00:00:08,557
and for us that's going to be the smallest representable value,

4
00:00:08,557 --> 00:00:11,381
and that's going to be a big, fat 0.

5
00:00:11,381 --> 00:00:15,791
Any element max 0 is going to give us back that element.

6
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:18,764
Now we're going to start computing the output here.

7
00:00:18,764 --> 00:00:21,659
So remember, we always start with the identity element here

8
00:00:21,659 --> 00:00:26,814
and then for each output element we take the max of all the elements that precede it.

9
00:00:26,814 --> 00:00:30,322
So here, that's the max of 3, so that's simply 3,

10
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:33,782
next the max of 3 and 1, that's going to give us 3,

11
00:00:33,782 --> 00:00:36,647
next max of 3, 1, and 4,

12
00:00:36,647 --> 00:00:39,548
max of 3, 1, 4, 1,

13
00:00:39,548 --> 00:00:42,139
max of 3, 1, 4, 1, 5,

14
00:00:42,139 --> 00:00:45,922
so our output array here is 0, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5.

15
00:00:45,922 --> 00:00:51,396
This is the max scan on unsigned ints of this 6-element input vector.

16
00:00:51,396 --> 00:00:55,894
You might note that the input element 9 is not used in this calculation, and that's correct.

17
00:00:55,894 --> 00:00:58,897
That's simply the nature of this formulation of scan.
