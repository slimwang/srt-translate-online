Here are some of the things that I noticed. It

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:06,600
looks like younger users have a lot of friends. These young

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,280
users seem to have thousands of more friends than most

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,970
users over the age of 30. You also might have noticed

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,430
that there are some vertical bars where people have lied

6
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:19,020
about their age, like 69 and also about 100. Those users

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,410
are also likely to be teenagers, or perhaps fake accounts, given

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,480
these really high friend counts. If there's something else that you

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,030
noticed that we didn't cover, share it in the discussions.
