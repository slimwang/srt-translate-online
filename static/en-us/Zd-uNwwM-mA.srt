00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,420
So today we've talked about configuration, a kind of routine design task. We do

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,610
configuration when we're dealing with a plan that we've used a lot in the past,

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:11,330
we need to modify to deal with some specific new constraints. So for example,

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,130
we've built thousands of buildings, and thousands of cars, and thousands of

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,910
computers, and each of them is largely the same. But there's certain parameters,

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,750
like the number of floors in a building, or the portability of the computer,

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,300
that differ from design to design. So we need to tweak individual variables to

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,310
meet those new constraints. We started this off by defining design in general,

9
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,270
and then we used that to define configuration, as a certain type of

10
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:35,600
routine design task. We then discussed the process of configuration and how it's

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,080
actually very similar to constraint propagation that we've talked about earlier.

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,065
Then we connected this to earlier topics like classification, planning and

13
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:45,810
case-based reasoning, and saw how in many ways, configuration is a task,

14
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,070
while other things we've talked about provide us the method for

15
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,210
accomplishing that task. So now we'll move on to diagnosis,

16
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,540
which is another topic related to design, where we try to uncover the cause of

17
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,720
a malfunction in something that we may have designed. In some ways,

18
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,750
we'll see that diagnosis is a lot like configuration in reverse.
