Hello.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,400
Welcome to the class on computational photography.

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:06,820
This is an exciting class and

4
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,330
I'm actually very pleased to be bringing it to you in this format.

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,190
And what I'd like to do throughout this whole semester is introduce to

6
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,760
you this amazing concept of computation and

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,210
photography, which basically is about the computational pipeline.

8
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:24,320
With the relationship to the photography discipline which has a lot of art and

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,580
aesthetics associated with it.

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,060
Again I want to remind you, this is a class on the computational and

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,509
the technical pipeline of photography.

12
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:34,970
And throughout the semester we're going to look at a variety of

13
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,930
things associated with how competition has changed the whole aspect of

14
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,750
how light is captured to generate images and photographs.
