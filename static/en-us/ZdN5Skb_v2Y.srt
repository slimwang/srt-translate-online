1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,130
Now it's time for you to use that
installed software and build the images.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,100
We've provided all the files
in a Github repository.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,980
You should go ahead and
clone it to your local workstation.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,600
The files for this exercise are in
the packer templates directory.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,219
If you look in applicationsurfer.json,

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,930
you'll see that here we're
using shell provisioners.

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,200
That's just for simplicity, so
you don't have to learn a new syntax.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,570
Even if you're not familiar with
shell scripts, don't worry.

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,950
Take a look at some of them.

10
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,510
Notice that they're just a file, and

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,700
in that file you'll just see
one command after another.

12
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,310
It's also possible in Packer to use
other provisioners, like Chef or

13
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:35,960
Puppet or Ansible or Salt.

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,150
These can provide more
advanced functionality.

15
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,940
You can see the provisioners listed
here in applicationserver.json.

16
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,320
And each one points to one or
more files in the scripts directory.

17
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,320
They'll run in the order
they are listed.

18
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,460
An interesting note is
the provisioners are used for

19
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,280
all builders unless specified otherwise.

20
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,950
As you can see, there's a couple
of scripts that are run only for

21
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,940
the virtual box iso builder.

22
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,440
Okay enough talk.

23
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,610
Go ahead and clone the repo changed
to the packer templates directory and

24
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:05,200
follow the instructions in the readme or
in the instructionettes.

25
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,720
When you run the packer build,
it will take a while,

26
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,660
after all it first has to download
the OS image, then install nvm,

27
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,830
then install all the software, then at
the end compress and save the image.

28
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,970
Once you do that a look through
the application-server.json file and

29
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,740
see if you can answer these questions.

30
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,320
First, what directory does
the post-processor save the final

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,230
artifact in?

32
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,790
There's a variable for it.

33
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,630
Enter that variable,
including the curly braces around it.

34
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,630
And second, what's the file
extension for the final artifact?

35
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,130
Put that here.
