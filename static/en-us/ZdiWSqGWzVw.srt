00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,754
Some advice that I have for people who are learning how to code for the first

2
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:06,978
time is to not get frustrated or discouraged, especially, if you feel like

3
00:00:06,978 --> 00:00:10,306
people are ahead of you or have been coating for so long and your just starting

4
00:00:10,306 --> 00:00:16,370
out and there's no way you can catch up. For me, when I first started coding,

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,815
it was fall quarter freshman year of college and there have been people who've

6
00:00:19,815 --> 00:00:23,101
been coding since they were six years old or, you know, in a variety of other

7
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:29,415
classes in their high schools. And I'd never coded before and felt pretty

8
00:00:29,415 --> 00:00:34,144
insecure about my, my coding ability. I never had that, that confidence that I

9
00:00:34,144 --> 00:00:39,000
could, you know, hack something out really quickly. But I stuck with it, and I

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,756
think that's what made the difference. I was loving everything that I was

11
00:00:42,756 --> 00:00:46,876
learning. I was motivated to go do extra credit or, you know, work on

12
00:00:46,876 --> 00:00:52,838
assignments that weren't necessarily due for a certain class I was in. And

13
00:00:52,838 --> 00:00:58,830
suddenly, two, three classes in, I felt like I was caught up. I felt like I

14
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,700
could find my niche within computer science, where I could be the best. I could

15
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:08,277
be the one who was teaching other people how to do things. And from there, it's

16
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:12,537
been an amazing transformation, in terms of how confident I in my coding

17
00:01:12,537 --> 00:01:14,330
ability.
