1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,980
At this point I'm going to move
on from the wrangling phase to

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:04,580
the exploration phase.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,560
Although of course I might find more
problems later and need to fix them.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,150
What I want to look at first is how the
numbers in the daily engagement table

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:12,900
differ for

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,190
students who eventually pass the first
project versus those who don't.

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,840
However, there are a few
things about this question as

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,560
stated that are under specified or
would be a bit weird.

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,860
First, if I look at all records
in the daily engagement table,

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,710
that will include data from
after the project was submitted.

11
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,090
That data isn't really relevant, so
I might want to only look at engagement

12
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,190
data from before the submission
of the first project.

13
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,860
Second, if I do only look at engagement
from before the first submission and

14
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,310
students submit after
different lengths of time

15
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,930
then I'm comparing engagement data
from different lengths of time, but

16
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,590
student's engagement might
have trends over time.

17
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,830
For example, engagement might tend to
drop off after the first few days.

18
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,340
If that were the case, then comparing
average engagement over one month for

19
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,610
one student versus two months for
another might be misleading.

20
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,349
And third since the daily
engagement table we've been using

21
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:07,650
includes engagement numbers for
the entire nano degree program.

22
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,820
It's including engagement for

23
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,200
courses that are not related to the
first project, which is little weird.

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,090
To handle the first two problems,
I'm only going to look at engagement

25
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,780
data from the students'
first week of enrollment and

26
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,630
I'm going to exclude students
who cancel within a week.

27
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,320
That way I'll be comparing
equal amounts of time.

28
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,230
This will also have the benefit of
excluding people who cancelled during

29
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,420
the free trial which was seven days
at the time this data was collected.

30
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,870
The third issue doesn't seem
like a showstopper to me.

31
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,950
I'm going to go ahead and
look at engagement numbers for

32
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,930
any course in the nano degree program
and just keep this decision in mind.

33
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,770
If you did want to look at engagement
data in only the first course of

34
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,780
the nano degree you could do
that using the daily engagement

35
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,500
full table available in
the downloadable section

36
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,160
which includes a breakdown
by course as well.

37
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:56,330
But since this file is pretty big,
computations on it can take longer.

38
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:00,200
So, to make things easier, or in case
your computer doesn't have that much

39
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,640
memory, I'm going use
the non-granular version, for now.

40
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,960
As a first step,

41
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,680
create a dictionary of students
who either haven't cancelled yet.

42
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,530
Or who stayed enrolled for
more than seven days before cancelling.

43
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,860
If the student hasn't cancelled yet
the days_to_cancel column will be None.

44
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,050
And if they've stayed enrolled for

45
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,761
more than 7 days,
the days_to_cancel field will be > 7.

46
00:02:22,761 --> 00:02:26,250
The keys of your dictionary
should be account keys and

47
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,545
the values should be the date that the
student enrolled, since this date will

48
00:02:29,545 --> 00:02:33,335
be useful later to find engagement
records during the first week.

49
00:02:33,335 --> 00:02:36,805
You should name your
dictionary paid_students.

50
00:02:36,805 --> 00:02:39,375
Enter the number of students who
meet these conditions in this box.
