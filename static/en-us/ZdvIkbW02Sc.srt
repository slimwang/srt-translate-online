00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:07,518
This parabola has a vertex at 2, 1. Great work if you found this. We start by

2
00:00:07,518 --> 00:00:11,204
completing the square. We want to add a certain amount in order to make this a

3
00:00:11,204 --> 00:00:16,813
perfect square. We'll need to add four in order to do that. And since we add

4
00:00:16,813 --> 00:00:22,858
four here, let's also subtract four. This keeps our equation balanced. Remember

5
00:00:22,858 --> 00:00:28,229
that to complete the square here, we always add b over 2 squared. The b value

6
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:32,631
is negative 4, so b over 2 is negative 2, and that amount squared is positive

7
00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:38,900
4. It's the amount we add in order to complete our square. Now we'll be ready

8
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,438
to write this expression as a perfect square. The positive 5 and negative 4

9
00:00:43,438 --> 00:00:48,993
will just stay on the end. Here's our perfect square. And here's our equation,

10
00:00:48,993 --> 00:00:52,760
simplified combining these two numbers. So the vertex is at positive 2 for the

11
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:59,951
x coordinate, and positive 1 for the y coordinate. Our vertex is here, and we

12
00:00:59,951 --> 00:01:04,150
get it by setting this binomial equal to 0. And the k value, or the y

13
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:10,040
coordinate of the vertex is k. It's right here, positive 1. Now that we have

14
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,140
our vertex, we can actually plot two other points. The one right next to the

15
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:19,200
vertex. Our a value is positive 1 so this means we move one unit left and right

16
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,315
at the vertex and then one unit up vertically. That will give us two additional

17
00:01:25,315 --> 00:01:29,262
points. And if we zoom in on our parabola, we can see this more clearly. We

18
00:01:29,262 --> 00:01:34,584
move left one and right one from the vertex. And then we move a units in the

19
00:01:34,584 --> 00:01:40,195
vertical direction, in this case one unit up. So left one and up one and right

20
00:01:40,195 --> 00:01:46,195
one and up one. This gives us our points at 1, 2 and 3, 2. Once we have these

21
00:01:46,195 --> 00:01:56,106
two points we can draw in the basic shape of our parabola. That's how we get

22
00:01:56,106 --> 00:01:56,920
this graph.
