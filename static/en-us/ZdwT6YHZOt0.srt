1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,810
So what I would like to tell you about is a generalization of both MDPs and

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,050
repeated games, that is, that goes by the

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,460
name of Stochastic games, also sometimes Markov games.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:09,890
>> Mm.

5
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:12,790
>> I like the name Marcov game better, but I used Stochastic game because

6
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,440
that's what people call it and sometimes

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,860
it's good to use words that other people

8
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:21,750
use. And what what Stochastic games give us is a formal model. For multiagent

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,990
reinforcement learning. In fact, I like to think of this in terms of an analogy.

10
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:30,220
Which is something like MDP is to RL

11
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:34,100
as stochastic game is to multiagent RL. It's a

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,100
formal model. That lets us express the sorts of

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,135
problems that take place in this formalized problem setting.

14
00:00:41,135 --> 00:00:43,080
>> Hm. That sounds very promising.

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,330
>> Cool. Alright so let me let me give

16
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,330
you a, I'll start off by explaining it in

17
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,700
terms of an example and then I'll give a

18
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,340
more formal definition because you know, I can't not.

19
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,520
So so this is a little game played between A and B. Oh, I should

20
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,200
have it between smooth and curly, but At

21
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,470
the traditionally it's played between A and B.

22
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,720
>> Mm, and sometimes it's good to use the words that other people use.

23
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,440
>> [LAUGH] I've heard that. I wouldn't say it quite

24
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,740
that way. So this is a three by three grid

25
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,710
each of the players can go north, south, east and

26
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:16,270
west. And can stay put if that's helpful. And the,

27
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,900
the transitions are deterministic, except for through

28
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,436
these, these walls here which are called semi-walls.

29
00:01:22,436 --> 00:01:22,712
>> Mm-hm.

30
00:01:22,712 --> 00:01:24,270
>> So these thick lines represent walls that

31
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,430
you can't go through, the thin, wall, lines

32
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,690
just represent cell boundaries, but this kind of

33
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,290
dashed line here is a semi-wall, and that means

34
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,680
If you try to go through that, say by going north from, if A goes north

35
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,650
from this position, then 50% probability A will

36
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,390
actually go to the next state, and 50% probability

37
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,930
A will stay where A is. So, the goal is to get to

38
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,630
the dollar sign. And if you get to the dollar sign you get

39
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,520
a hundred dollars. So if we ignore A for a second, what should

40
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,010
B do to minimize the number of steps necessary to get the reward.

41
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,390
>> Go left, and then go up and go up. Oh,

42
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,580
I'm sorry. Go west, and then go north and then go north.

43
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,120
>> Yeah, and what should A do ignoring B?

44
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,072
>> Go east and then go north and then north.

45
00:02:04,072 --> 00:02:05,292
>> Yeah.

46
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:10,829
Unfortunately these guys live in the world together, and

47
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:16,722
what happens is, they can't occupy the same square. And as soon as

48
00:02:16,722 --> 00:02:19,622
somebody reaches the dollar sign the game ends and the other

49
00:02:19,622 --> 00:02:23,980
player, if the other player hasn't reached the dollar sign, gets nothing.

50
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,480
>> I see.

51
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,280
>> So now there's a little bit of contention.

52
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,540
>> So what happens if A and B both try to go,

53
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,720
to the same square at the same time?

54
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,690
>> Let's say that we flip a coin and one of them gets to

55
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,050
go, first and then the other one will bounce off of the first one.

56
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,330
>> But that's not a problem when it comes to reaching the money.

57
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,330
>> But it's not a problem, yes, right, so

58
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,764
the money is kind of like a money pit.

59
00:02:45,764 --> 00:02:49,860
>> [LAUGH] I don't think that's what a money pit is, but okay.

60
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,190
>> And so they can dive in and they

61
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,480
both get the money, because they're in the money pit.

62
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,390
>> I like it.

63
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,850
>> So what do you do if you're A?

64
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,970
How do you play this game? Oh! Let's think of another thing. Is, can you think

65
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,820
of what, what it might mean to, to have a Nash Equilibrium in a game like this?

66
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,330
>> Oh, that's an interesting question. It would

67
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,760
mean, well, it would mean, well, what do you

68
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,800
mean, what would it mean? It would mean

69
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,670
that, neither one of them would want to deviate.

70
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,590
>> It would mean a pair of strategies for the two players.

71
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,310
Now the strategies are now multi-step

72
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,560
things that say, they're like policies, right?

73
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:16,824
>> So...
>> Yeah.

74
00:03:16,824 --> 00:03:21,120
>> Like it's a pair of policies, such that neither would

75
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,630
prefer to switch. So can you think of

76
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,610
a pair of policies that would have that property.

77
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,680
>> Well, no I'm not sure. I was trying

78
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,252
to think about that. I was thinking that kind

79
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:34,690
of, if I were a nice guy what I would want to do is I would want us both

80
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,410
to try to go through the, the semi walls,

81
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,020
and if we both go through the semi-walls we just

82
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,720
go up again and then we, we hit the

83
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,090
dollar sign at the same time. And that's very nice.

84
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,970
>> So okay, good. So that,

85
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,040
that seems like a cooperative kind of strategy, right?

86
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,065
Where they're both you know, 50% oh I'm sorry,

87
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,780
25% of the time both will get through,

88
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,185
both will go to the goal together. Hooray. But...

89
00:03:56,185 --> 00:03:58,050
>> 25% of the time neither one will get through and

90
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,150
then we're in the same place we were before, so that's okay.

91
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:00,590
>> That's right.

92
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,590
>> The problem is the other 50% where one

93
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,620
of them gets through and the other one doesn't.

94
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,410
>> Right, so what do, what you do if

95
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,030
you make it through and the other one doesn't?

96
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,080
>> What do I do, if I get through, and

97
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,050
the other one doesn't? Well if I am only going to

98
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,850
do this the one time then I just keep

99
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,160
going and get the dollar, and the other person loses.

100
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,410
>> Yeah, alright, so what this works out to

101
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,550
be, is that A is going to get to the

102
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:24,080
goal. 2 3rd's of the time, and B is going

103
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,500
to get to the goal 2 3rd's of the time.

104
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,690
>> Mm-hm.

105
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,600
>> So, alright, so if that's the case, if

106
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,980
I say, okay, A, that's what you should do, B,

107
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,720
that's what you should do. Then is there a

108
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,070
way that either A or B can switch strategies and

109
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,530
do better?

110
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:43,120
>> Well, if B, for example, decides to go west and then go up, what happens?

111
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,170
>> Yes, that's a good question. B will now make it to the

112
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:48,540
goal a 100% of the time, and A will only make it to the

113
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,650
goal 50% of the time. So B has an incentive to switch to

114
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,140
that, to this strategy if we tell them to both go through the semi-wall.

115
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,320
>> Right.

116
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,780
>> So that wasn't a Nash Equilibrium. B would wanted switch this new policy.

117
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,060
>> Mm-hm.

118
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,260
>> Is this a Nash Equilibrium?

119
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:08,990
>> No. Wait, is it? No. Because, why doesn't A just choose to go west east?

120
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:13,560
>> Well, would, would A do better on average by switching to this strategy?

121
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:19,260
>> Well let's see. no, actually. Oh, no,

122
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,710
no, you said half the time they go through.

123
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,330
>> Yeah.

124
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:25,440
>> So half the time you flip a coin. So half the time I don't make it.

125
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:25,660
>> Right.

126
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,750
>> But half the time I do.

127
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,080
>> Right.
>> So,

128
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,680
actually, it looks the same.

129
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,200
>> It looks the same. That's right.

130
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,790
>> And B would go from 1 to one half.

131
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:38,200
>> Yeah, that's true. [LAUGH] So, it, A doesn't have an incentive to

132
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,220
do it, but B is hoping very much that A doesn't do that.

133
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,630
>> Right.

134
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,650
>> So so, yeah. So that, so there's one Nash Equilibrium

135
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,330
where B takes the center. Another one where A takes the center.

136
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,040
I guess if, if they do, if we do this coin

137
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,330
flip thing, it, it works out this way. If it's the case

138
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,100
that if they both if we change the rules here. So

139
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,800
that if they collide, neither of them gets to go. Then go,

140
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,080
both trying to go to the center is not a Nash equilibrium

141
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,700
anymore, because you can do better by actually going up the semi-wall.

142
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,630
>> Right. And so if we, if, if collision means nobody

143
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:13,400
goes through, then, suddenly, you'd want to do the other thing.

144
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:13,960
>> Exactly.

145
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,460
>> Or one of you goes through the semi-wall and one goes the direct way.

146
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,400
>> Right.

147
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,450
So we can see that there's a bunch

148
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:21,940
of different Nash equilibrium here, sorry, Nash equilibria

149
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:26,540
here. And that it's not so obvious how you'd find them, but it is at least

150
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,790
clear that they exist and they have a

151
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,580
different form than what we had before, because

152
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,770
they're not policies instead of these otherwise simplified

153
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,630
just you know, choose this row of the matrix.

154
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,226
>> Mm-hm.

155
00:06:36,226 --> 00:06:38,260
>> Cool. Alright. So let's think about how

156
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,860
we might learn in these kinds of environments.

157
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,930
>> Oh, okay, I like that already.
