1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,460
Let me give you another algebraic
interpretation of principal components,

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,380
and eventually this will
just get us to our formulas.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:10,270
Here we have our point P, and
let's supposed we have some origin.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,450
If we want to minimize the square of
the distance from the point to a line,

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,350
we want to find the line
to minimize this square.

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:24,660
Well, you remember Pythagoreans Theorem,
of course you do, right.

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,680
It's that the sum of the squares of
the two legs of a right triangle

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,990
are equal to the square
of the hypotenuse.

9
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:35,270
If we want to minimize the square
distance of the point to that line

10
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:40,360
we can, the same thing as maximizing the
projection of that point on the line.

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,250
That's what this value is here, right?

12
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,900
X transpose P.

13
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,000
X is some unit vector through
the origin, and if we project P

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,290
on to it that's going to be the vector
and you want to maximize that length.

15
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,800
So minimizing the sum of the squares,
the distance to the line is the same

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,400
thing as maximizing the sum of the
squares, the projections on that line.

17
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,470
A way of writing that is we
want to sum up all the squares.

18
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,830
And this is just a little bit of
a matrix manipulation trick, right?

19
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:12,520
If I wrote my points down here right,
of x1, y1 or x2, y2.

20
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,120
And if this was my line so
it's maybe, it's, A, B, right,

21
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:23,240
if I multiply x transpose b transpose,
so now this is B, xy, xy, bx, all right?

22
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,760
If you multiply that all through,
what you'll realize is,

23
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,100
it's exactly that value, okay?

24
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:38,840
It's the sum over all the points of
that square of the magnitude, all right?

25
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,950
So.

26
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,800
What that means is algebraically,

27
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,170
this maximizing the projected distance,
can be written like this, right.

28
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,510
So our goal is to maximize x transpose,
b transpose, bx.

29
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,550
But we've got a constraint, right.

30
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,910
X is a unit vector.

31
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:58,810
So that means that x
transpose x has to equal 1.

32
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,910
So what we have to do is we have to
maximize this subject to a constraint.

33
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,850
All right, so
that's what this says here.

34
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:06,850
And I wrote is as m.

35
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,288
Maximize equal to x transpose mx.

36
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:11,750
Where m is b transpose b.

37
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,070
So we just have a single matrix.

38
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,640
Now, I'm not going to tell
you a lot about this method.

39
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,320
But I am going to introduce this quick
notion of what's called Lagrange

40
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,540
multipliers.

41
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,460
Here is e and here is e prime.

42
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:28,080
And you notice that what we
added to e prime is this term,

43
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,220
lambda times 1 minus x transpose x.

44
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,943
So Megan,
if everything is solved correctly,

45
00:02:35,943 --> 00:02:38,929
1 minus x transpose x should be what?

46
00:02:38,929 --> 00:02:39,947
>> Zero?

47
00:02:39,947 --> 00:02:42,820
>> Whoa!
Yes, zero.

48
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,790
So, when this thing is solved correctly,

49
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,040
it doesn't matter what this lambda is,
right?

50
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,890
Because it will add zero to the term.

51
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:56,700
That in a very hand wavy way, that is
the method of Legrange multipliers.

52
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,470
It says, I'm going to put in a term

53
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,220
Multiplied by lambda that will
be zero at the correct solution.

54
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,750
And then, you solve everything and

55
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,450
you've satisfied your,
Lagrange multiplier method.

56
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,700
It turns out in our
case it's even easier.

57
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,400
So that's our e prime.

58
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,050
So, what we do now is, we take the
derivative of that new error function,

59
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,630
e prime with respect to x,
and we get this.

60
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,480
2 Mx plus 2 lambda x is the derivative.

61
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,030
And, now, in order to minimize this
we set this equal to what, Megan?

62
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,320
>> Zero,
>> Zero, very good.

63
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,810
We actually rehearsed
that one this time.

64
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,790
And so when you do that, you get
this very simple equation that says,

65
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:38,370
Mx equals lambda x, alright.

66
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,140
Forget the positive or

67
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,190
negative, doesn't matter because lambda
can go in either direction, all right?

68
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,180
So that's a very special x, right?

69
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,500
So when I multiply x by a matrix M,
if I get back a linear multiplier,

70
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:57,320
in this case lambda, of x, that means
x is an eigenvector of the matrix M.

71
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,630
So that means that x is going to be
an eigenvector of this B transpose B.

72
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,450
All right?

73
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,010
So, this axis of least inertia.

74
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,510
This solution where we minimize
the distance to the axes.

75
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,790
The sum of the square distances,

76
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,510
which is the same as
maximizing the distance along.

77
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,570
Says it has something
to do with this matrix,

78
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,829
b transpose b, where b was
that list of all those points.
