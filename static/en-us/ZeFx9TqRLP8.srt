>> So if you were in state On, you'd be one shift to the right would put you

And similarly for going left. And we can we can list that by saying,

4
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,190
using the word if or some conditional. Ultimately in the code, we are going to

5
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,540
have to have a conditional statement that indicates these various possibilities.
