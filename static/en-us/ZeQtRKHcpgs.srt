00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,800
Let's look at some examples of
real memory hierarchy parameters.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,189
A register file with 16
registers of 16 bytes each.

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:13,020
An L1 cache that can hold 32
kibibytes with 64 byte lines.

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,540
An L2 cache of size 8 mebibyte
with a 128 byte lines.

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:24,590
A 256-entry TLB or translation lookaside
buffer with pages of 8 kibbibytes each.

6
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:29,950
In this case the slow memory is main
memory, and the fast memory is the TLB.

7
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:34,390
And finally a virtual memory setup
with 32 gibbibytes of physical RAM as

8
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:39,590
the fast memory, 32 kibbibytes pages and
disk as the slow memory.

9
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:43,370
My question is this,
which of these is a tall cache?

10
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,190
To answer the question,

11
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,980
you'll need to assume a word size,
which I'll tell you is 8 bytes.

12
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,080
Note that there might be more
than one correct answer, so

13
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,450
please check all that apply.
