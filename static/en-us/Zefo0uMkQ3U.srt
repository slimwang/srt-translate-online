Here's an example context diagram for a system that plays chess with the user.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,744
The rectangle is the human player, the oval is the chess-playing program, and

3
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:15,268
there are three lines between them. One line indicates that the human player is

4
00:00:15,268 --> 00:00:19,520
supplying a move to the chess-playing program. Another line from the chess

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,430
playing program back to the user is the computer's move. And the third line

6
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:28,830
indicates that the computer can also put out a diagram describing the board.
