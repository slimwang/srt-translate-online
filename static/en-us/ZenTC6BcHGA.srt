1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,510
So one of the more powerful techniques that psychologists have at their

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,710
disposal for understanding where a personality comes from is twin adoption

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:11,440
studies. Now, twin adoption studies are so important because they really

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,595
simulate these naturally occurring experiments as it were. So the twin part is

5
00:00:15,595 --> 00:00:20,752
really shorthand for how genetically related people are. So, for instance

6
00:00:20,752 --> 00:00:25,240
identical twins are 100% genetically related, fraternal twins, siblings and

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:31,173
parents and off springs are 50% genetically related. Cousins then for instance

8
00:00:31,173 --> 00:00:36,302
are about 12% genetically related on average. The adoption part is important

9
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:41,224
because it varies the environment. So whether people are raised in the same

10
00:00:41,224 --> 00:00:46,473
family and household are in different families and households. So we can't

11
00:00:46,473 --> 00:00:49,575
randomly assign people to these conditions, so we have to use what nature gives

12
00:00:49,575 --> 00:00:54,112
us and that's the Twin Adoption Study. So the best way to study the affects of

13
00:00:54,112 --> 00:00:57,596
genes in environment or nature and nurture on personality is to study different

14
00:00:57,596 --> 00:01:03,630
kinds of relatives brought up in different kinds of environments. So now let's

15
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,559
go to Lauren for a question.
