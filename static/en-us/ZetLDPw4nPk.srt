00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,431
>> The y-intercept is at 0, negative 14. We know that the x-coordinate has to be

2
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:10,579
0 because the y-intercept is where this curve hits the y-axis, and the y-axis is

3
00:00:10,579 --> 00:00:15,760
just the line x equals 0. If we substitute 0 in for x in this equation, these

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:21,044
two terms both turn into 0, and we end up with y equals negative 14. So that's

5
00:00:21,044 --> 00:00:22,231
the y-coordinate.
