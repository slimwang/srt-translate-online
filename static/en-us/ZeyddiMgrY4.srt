Congratulations on finishing unit 4!

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:05,798
We've done a lot in this unit, so well done for getting through this.

3
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:10,753
Now we're going to talk to Ian Buck from NVIDIA about CUDA's past, present, and future,

4
00:00:10,753 --> 00:00:15,482
and then in the assignment, what we're going to do is learn how to remove red eyes from photographs,

5
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:19,000
so that your photographs can look just a little bit better.
