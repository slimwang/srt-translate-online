Alright, so we know we need to change fifths and tenths into tenths. So to

2
00:00:04,157 --> 00:00:08,501
change fifths into tenths I need to multiply by 2 over 2. And then for 3 10ths

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,857
it's already tenths. So I don't need to change it. So let's see what happens

4
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:17,275
when I change 2 5ths into tenths. I know if I multiply my fractions I'll get 4

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:22,575
10ths. Here is what that would look like, this would be 4 10ths of a kilometer.

6
00:00:22,687 --> 00:00:27,775
Remember I doubled the number of pieces that I had, I went from 5 pieces to 10

7
00:00:27,787 --> 00:00:32,868
and I doubled the number of pieces thatI had. I had 2 5ths originally And now I

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,004
have 2 times 2, which is 4 or 4 10ths. Visually we can see that 2 5ths of 1

9
00:00:38,016 --> 00:00:43,514
kilometer bar is the same as 4 10ths of 1 kilometer bar. They really represent

10
00:00:43,526 --> 00:00:49,153
the same length. My 3 10ths of a kilometer doesn't change, I'm just adding it to

11
00:00:49,165 --> 00:00:49,993
the 4 10ths.
