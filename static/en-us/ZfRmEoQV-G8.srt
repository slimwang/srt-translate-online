00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,780
It is a day as ordinary as the next. Jenny wakes up and decides

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:10,990
to go for a hike. On this day, however, she goes down a

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:17,520
path she wouldn't normally take. Before long, an unsettling feeling of being

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,850
lost sets in and she comes to a fork in the road. Which way to go?

5
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:31,710
Only her trusted diary can answer this question. She opens it and there lies the

6
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:40,150
answer, a message. It says take the road less travelled. Now it's

7
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:44,430
up to you to help Jennie get home. All you have to do

8
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,980
is read this piece of code, which guides the next step she will take.

9
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,610
Now tell me, which path will you send Jennie down.
