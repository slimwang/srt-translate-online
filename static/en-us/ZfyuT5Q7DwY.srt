00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,340
Now, that we have our equations matched with the proper lines, I'd like to point

2
00:00:05,352 --> 00:00:09,945
out that I see three special spots on this plot, the three points that all lie

3
00:00:09,957 --> 00:00:14,601
right here on the y-axis. Looking at our three equations, which, of course,

4
00:00:14,613 --> 00:00:19,207
represent these three lines, can you pick the term in each equation that

5
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,979
determines these three points?
