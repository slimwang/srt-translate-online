1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
Just as a reminder, what the teams will be starting with in Week 1

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,790
is filling out the business model canvas and getting out of the building

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:14,070
and testing their hypotheses about the value proposition, customer segments, and channel.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,250
In the next week they'll be testing customer relationships,

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,550
revenue streams, and partners.

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:24,300
And then in Week 3 they'll be looking at key resources, key activities, and cost structure.

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,040
The thing to remember: that the goal is not to draw on the canvas.

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:34,180
The goal is to get out of the building and use the canvas as a scorecard

9
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:39,260
for the customer development activities that are going on in the Z axis

10
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,460
and depth between each one of those canvas scorecards.

11
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:48,820
You need to make sure your team is learning about who are those right customers,

12
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,760
what are the right value propositions, what is the right revenue model.

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,950
And it's the activity that they're doing outside the classroom.

14
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,660
Now, the real winners in this program are not just the teams who get out

15
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,830
and talk to lots of customers but those who actually turn the data into insight--

16
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:10,360
that is, who see patterns, who realize, "Oh, it's not that 43 people liked it,

17
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,220
"it's the 4 people who threw us out but said they would have paid a lot of money."

18
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,530
"Maybe the business is over there."

19
00:01:16,530 --> 99:59:59,999
That's what you as mentors and you as facilitators are actually helping these teams see.
