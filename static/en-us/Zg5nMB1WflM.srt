00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,440
Let's go through this algebraically.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:06,070
So here we have our camera which has some viewing direction.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,990
All right, and the viewing direction's not going to matter because we're

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,100
going to assume a Lambertian system which is what we have here.

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,770
We assume that it's just proportional to the cosine of the instant angle between

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:18,670
the light source and the normal, but the idea is that the camera is fixed.

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,410
And for each one of our sources, source one we take our first image.

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,410
Source two, we take our second image.

9
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,710
Source three, we take our third image.

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,645
Now notice, by the way, that rho is in these equations, right?

11
00:00:30,645 --> 00:00:34,730
Rho is the albedo, so I'm not assuming I know the albedo.

12
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,390
So now I have three images, right?

13
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,760
And I can write these as a matrix equation for, this is for

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,950
a single pixel, right?

15
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:47,140
So at a single pixel, I would have three different values and

16
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,920
I could just write this equation as rho.

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,320
And these are the three vectors that are the source, directions and

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,440
by the way, I assume I know the source directions times the unit normal.

19
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,960
And the unit normal is the thing that I don't know.

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,390
So I need to solve for that, all right.

21
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,120
So remember we're making this Lambertian assumption.

22
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,760
So solving those equations is straightforward, its linear, simple system if we

23
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,360
have three lights, I is our three measurements three intensities.

24
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,780
S are the three directions to the light source and

25
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,870
we know those so I and S are known.

26
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:26,640
And then as we said before n is supposed to be uninormal, rho is the albedo.

27
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,230
So together I call them n tilda.

28
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,330
So to solve for n tilda is trivial.

29
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:35,990
N tilda is just s inverse I, but of course n tilda is not unit normal.

30
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,870
In fact it's magnitude is what?

31
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:42,110
It's magnitude is the albedo, so I can solve for rho, the albedo.

32
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,300
And I can solve for

33
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,950
the unit normal as well, by justing taking the magnitude of that.

34
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,860
Now of course, that's with three lights.

35
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,920
And anything that works well with three lights,

36
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,110
is going to work better with more lights.

37
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,920
So let's suppose we have more lights, like M of them.

38
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,990
Well, we get the same set of equations but now, we need a least square

39
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:04,770
solutions cause the system is over constrained and basically solve it here.

40
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,950
So M by one is the number of measurements we have.

41
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,940
And so, we have to take the pseudo inverse, and the pseudo inverse will give us

42
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,195
the least squares solution for n tilda, and then again you can find the albeido.
