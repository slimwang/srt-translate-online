1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,960
As we just said, EHR certification
specifies requirements for

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,790
commercial EHR systems.

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,710
This is a very important development,
because for

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,430
decades the grand challenge for
health IT here in the U.S.

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:17,550
has been interoperability, the ability
of hundreds of commercial EMR

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,710
products and tools to exchange and
meaningfully share data.

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:26,230
Even with universal adoption,
without some degree of interoperability,

8
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,510
we still wouldn't be able to coordinate
care among the many providers who care

9
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:34,120
for the same patients and
who may well have different EMR systems.

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,700
So the EHR certification
process supports,

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,960
among other things, a basic
interoperability standard or capability.

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,320
Systems must be able to record key
specified demographic and clinical data.

13
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:53,000
They must be able to provide tools
to measure and improve care quality.

14
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,890
And, of course,
they must protect the confidentiality,

15
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,320
integrity of the health
care data that they record.

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,510
We'll now look at each
of these in some detail.
