1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:04,630
So, we've now updated the diagram, which we placed the constraints and

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,850
associated the, the indirect constraints, and associated the,

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,900
them with the, the components.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,140
Now we can begin to think about, well,

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,350
implementing those components is going to involve being responsible for

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,310
making sure that those constraints are, in fact, satisfied.
