1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,850
So our three problems are so closely related that either all of them lie here in NP but not in P

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,900
or all of them lie in P.

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,850
We don't know which one it is but it can't be the case that,

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,980
for example, we have just vertex cover in P and the other two problems here in NP.

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,800
And how did we show that in the last unit?

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,860
For clique and independent set, we showed that there was a polynomial time algorithm

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:28,010
that could take a graph that was an input to independent set

8
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:32,229
and transform that into a graph that we can use as an input for clique,

9
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:35,440
and once we have solved the clique problem on the transformed graph,

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,240
that same solution is also the best possible solution to independent set.

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:44,480
So we have a polynomial time algorithm, so the algorithm transforms the input of one problem,

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,060
say X, into an input of another problem, Y.

13
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:55,330
So, for example, we take independent set and transform that graph into an input for clique

14
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:59,380
and now you'll see one of the advantages of working with decision problems

15
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:03,880
because the third condition is rather easy to state because we can now simply say that

16
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,770
solving the problem Y on the transformed input yields the same answer

17
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,950
as solving the original problem on the original input.

18
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,590
So these three statements here are the same thing that you have seen in the last unit.

19
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,720
So, we took an input which was a graph to independent set

20
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,410
then transformed it into an input for clique and we found out that if we solve clique on that new input,

21
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,980
then we would get the same answer that we would've gotten

22
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,670
if we had solved independent set directly on the original input.

23
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,580
And of course we also saw that the transformation works in the other way,

24
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,540
so we could transform an input to clique into an input of independent set

25
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,430
and now for a vertex cover and independent set, it was even easier

26
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:47,920
because we didn't even have to transform the input, so basically the transformation was,

27
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,260
we could keep the input as it is, the only thing is if we're working with the decision problem,

28
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:58,930
of course, the answer will be a little bit different, so if we have a vertex cover of size k

29
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,880
for a graph with N vertices, then for independent set,

30
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,260
we must ask if we have an independent set of size n-k.

31
00:02:06,260 --> 99:59:59,999
But other than that, the transformation here is very easy.
