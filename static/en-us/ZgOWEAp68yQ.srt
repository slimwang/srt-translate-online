1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,100
Okay.
You're doing a great job.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,620
And your app is looking pretty good.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,340
Unfortunately, right now,
it only really works for

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,150
a pretty one sided basketball game.

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,950
What we really want is for it to be
able to keep score for two teams.

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,600
Let's start with the xml, and
then we can worry about the Java.

7
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,400
Okay.
So you're going to be adding another

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,080
column for team b.

9
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,380
And remember we're just
focusing on the XML right now.

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,770
If we remember the design for
this first side.

11
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,200
It's a stack of views all within
a vertical linear lay out.

12
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,310
Now the side for
team B looks pretty darn similar.

13
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:37,280
Try as we might though,
you can't have two root views.

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,220
So you're going to need to use
nested lay outs in this case.

15
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,070
You should be thinking of each
of these linear lay outs,

16
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,759
kind of like a view in itself.

17
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:51,320
So if we think of this all as just one
view, and this all as just one view.

18
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,780
And if each of these two views need
to take up equal amount of space, so

19
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,630
basically half of the screen.

20
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,560
What parent view group
would we need to use?

21
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,970
Put your answer to that here.

22
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,560
Now, once you've got this right,

23
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,170
hopefully that will give you enough
information to start coding this out.

24
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,400
Give it a try, you can always watch
the solution video if you get really,

25
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,000
really stuck.

26
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,010
Now, once you've coded it up,
it should look like this.

27
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:21,430
So, Team A, well that side
should still function okay.

28
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:27,400
Team B though, might have well,
a bit strange behavior.

29
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,850
That's because we haven't really
coded up the Java for that side.

30
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,720
So don't worry about it,
just try to get it to look like this.
