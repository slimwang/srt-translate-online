1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,899
So let's get the facts. The optimum solution contains, at most, N objects,

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,999
simply because there's no more than N objects in the input itself. So it's almost a very coarse estimate,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,932
but it'll do for us. So due to the rounding, we may introduce some error. So the algorithm, when working with the rounded objects,

4
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:26,232
might tell you that it's best thing to take this object here, this object here, this object here, and this object here, for example.

5
00:00:26,233 --> 00:00:31,966
But instead, it could have been better to actually take this one here instead of that one here.

6
00:00:31,967 --> 00:00:36,832
Or this object here instead of this object, and so on. Well, some, some might also be the same,

7
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:42,232
but sometimes we might make mistakes by just taking the wrong objects. So we know that these kind of mistakes

8
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:52,566
can only be made if the value of A divided by X, rounded down, is the same as the value of B divided by X, rounded down.

9
00:00:52,567 --> 00:00:58,532
So mistakes of this kind, taking the wrong object, can only be made if, to the algorithm, object A, value-wise,

10
00:00:58,533 --> 00:01:04,799
looks the same to the algorithm as object B, value-wise. Which means that the value of A--

11
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:11,266
so the original value, divided by X, rounded down, is the same as the value of B divided by X, rounded down.

12
00:01:11,267 --> 00:01:17,066
But that actually allows us to quantify a mistake. So mistakes can only be made if this condition here is fulfilled.

13
00:01:17,067 --> 00:01:23,032
Now, the amount of value lost in each mistake that we make is, of course, the value of the object, B,

14
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:28,132
which is the more valuable object we should have taken, minus the value of object A.

15
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:34,332
And now my question to you, and this is of course a bit challenging, is what is the maximum difference in value

16
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:41,166
that actually objects B and A can have? And the way to figure this out is to look at this condition, because the mistake is only made

17
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:50,032
if this here is fulfilled. So what I would like you to figure out is what is the maximum difference in value between the objects B and A?

18
00:01:50,033 --> 00:01:52,000
And please enter your answer here.
