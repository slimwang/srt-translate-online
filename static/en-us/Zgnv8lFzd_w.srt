1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And the answer is, the probability of every sequence becomes small.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This is true because there become more and more sequences.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Every time you flip a coin, you double the number of sequences.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And they have varying probabilities but they are always more against the probability,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
always goes down and always multiplying in a number less than 1.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That's why this assumption is important.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The probability of every number of heads become small.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This is a little trickier that this is also true because as the number of flips increases,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
the number of heads must increase even if we're assuming some low probability for it.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So, it becomes farther and farther away from what we expect.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The probability of every proportion of heads also becomes small.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This is a little trickier but the thing to remember is--

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
every proportion of heads, corresponds to a given exact number of heads.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Now that exact number of heads changes as, let's say,

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I double the number of flips, I also double the number of heads I need.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:20,000
But, that's going to always be a smaller number, since again that probability has to be divided

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
into the chance that I could just have one more head or one less head

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
which is going to be an ever so slightly different proportion.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Now, this statement is not true.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The probability of every range of proportions can't become small.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The range of all proportions is arranged and we know that has to stay at once,

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So, that can't be true and the probability of some ranges of proportions become small.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Well, this will also be true--consider something improbable like

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
getting the proportion--a proportion below 10% on a fair coin.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That's going to tend to become rare and rare and rare as you flip it more times,

26
00:02:03,000 --> 99:59:59,999
because the same rare or unlikely event has to keep repeating itself.
