1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,070
Welcome to the first work session.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,590
These work sessions are a way
you'll work on the web page,

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,650
that you're going to be building
through out the Nano degree.

4
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:08,430
And each session has two parts.

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,710
In the first part, you're going to
go over everything you learned in

6
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:15,890
the previous lesson.And summarize
in short concise statements,

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,760
all the important concepts.

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,750
In the second part, your actually going
to take the skills you've acquired.And

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,550
put them to use by
improving your web page.

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,910
Now, the purpose of each of these two
parts is to address two important gaps

11
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,210
in expertise.

12
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,600
And these gaps are what
separate novice from expert.

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,630
The first gap has to do with
the gap in what you know.

14
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,860
When you're a novice, and you're
presented with new information.You

15
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,180
typically see that information
as a bunch of scattered facts.

16
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,220
That's normal.

17
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,110
But experts, on the other hand,
they take these facts and

18
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,810
they actually see a logical
structure behind them.

19
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:53,000
And that logical structure makes
it much easier to recall and

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,480
use the new information.

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,000
And that, brings us to the second gap.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,950
The gap in what you can do.

23
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,070
As a novice in any field,
you generally just can't do that much.

24
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,540
Again, it's normal.

25
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,130
You may have good ideas.

26
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:10,880
But until you cross that skills gap, you
won't the ability to execute on them.

27
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,915
So you won't be able to create amazing
things like one of the Web pages I love,

28
00:01:14,915 --> 00:01:16,460
scratchpad.io.

29
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,380
But both of these gaps can be crossed.

30
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,570
Crossing the knowledge
gap requires reflection.

31
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:26,860
Reflection is what you do when you take
the time to deliberately think about and

32
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,140
process the facts that you've learned.

33
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,540
And that what you'll be doing
when you summarize each lesson.

34
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,480
Crossing the skills gap takes practice.

35
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,730
And practice is a especially useful
when you're just beginning to

36
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,120
learn something new.

37
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,540
But, with reflection and

38
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:46,760
practice, you'll begin to think like
an expert and act like an expert.

39
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,110
And since you'll be practicing by
building something really impressive,

40
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,230
you'll actually start to
look like an expert too.
