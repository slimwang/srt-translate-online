00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,972
Let's take a look at how
to add ads to your site.

2
00:00:03,972 --> 00:00:06,150
In order to serve ads on your site,

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,040
you need an account with
one of the ads providers.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,090
We will use AdSense account for
our demo.

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:15,090
We'll chose to show you how
to create responsive ad units

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,370
because you are building
a responsive site.

7
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,500
Right?

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,610
So use responsive ad units.

9
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,940
Responsive ads automatically resize
based on the size of the device and

10
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,730
the width of the parent container.

11
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:33,030
This will ensure that the ad works in
line with your responsive layout and

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,440
the site will look great on any device.

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:42,300
So, first step, we're opening the home
page of AdSense, and clicking on my ads.

14
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,640
Then we'll click on new ad unit,
and we'll give it a name.

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,270
For our purpose, we'll call it demo two.

16
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,100
We're choosing the responsive size,
like we said before, and

17
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,080
then we have the option
to choose the type.

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,960
Let's go with the default here.

19
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,830
Then we could choose the style.

20
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,220
I like this one.

21
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,220
And of course you could do here the best
to match the theme of your site.

22
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,510
And then we are just clicking,
save and get the code.

23
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,790
Now all you need to do
is just to copy and

24
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,780
paste this inline code to your html.
