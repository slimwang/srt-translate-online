1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:05,810
So again, the correct response for
this query is to take the mean of the K,

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,550
where K is equal to 3,
nearest neighbors.

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,070
Take the mean of their Y-value,

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,890
and that gives us a value
somewhere about like there.

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,010
If we were to repeat
this process at many,

6
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:24,830
many points along the X-axis, we end
up with a model that looks like this.

7
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:29,730
What's nice about it is it fits the data
over here where it's curving this way.

8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,480
It fits the data over here
where it's curving that way.

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,500
And in interpolates nicely and
smoothly between all the data points.

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,530
There are number of methods like
this that keep the data around and

11
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,110
when they make a query, they consult
the data to find the answer.

12
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,560
The most famous of these
methods is K nearest neighbor.

13
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,590
But there are others,
such as kernel regression.

14
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,789
The main way that KNN differs
from kernel regression is that in

15
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,474
kernel regression we weight
the contributions of each of the nearest

16
00:01:01,474 --> 00:01:05,349
data points according to
how distant they are.

17
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:06,461
Where as with KNN,

18
00:01:06,461 --> 00:01:11,010
each data point that we consider
gets essentially an equal weight.

19
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,750
We've covered now parametric models,

20
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,920
where our goal is to find
parameters like M and B.

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,820
And we toss the data away, and
then just use M and B later to make

22
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:26,570
our queries and here I've shown
you non-parametric or instance

23
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:31,480
based methods where we keep the data and
we consult it when we make a query.
