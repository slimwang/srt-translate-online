00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,010
Here's another example that comes from the World Cup.

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:06,860
I like this visualization in particular because it uses small multiples.

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,710
Small multiples take advantage of the same layout and

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,190
visual encodings from one slice of the data to the next.

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,040
This allows us to make comparisons across the data or

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,250
across the different views of the data quickly.

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,800
You can find a link to this visualization in the instructor notes.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,430
I'd like you to do the same thing for this graphic as you do with the last one.

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,580
I want you to determine how the variables are encoded in the visualization.

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,950
The encodings for this graphic are somewhat harder to decipher

11
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,680
because a variable may be encoded in more than one visual encoding.

12
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,860
We've set up the grader to accept a variety of answers, but

13
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,720
when you go to integrate your answer, I only want you to choose

14
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,950
one visual encoding, one of these, for each of the variables.

15
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,060
So what do you think?

16
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,150
How are these variables visually encoded?
