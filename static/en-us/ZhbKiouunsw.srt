1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,008
To find the LCD of these three denominators, we want to find the highest power

2
00:00:05,008 --> 00:00:10,032
of each factor that appears in any denominator. We know four is already a factor

3
00:00:10,032 --> 00:00:14,568
of eight, so we really just want to find the greatest common denominator for x

4
00:00:14,568 --> 00:00:20,024
and eight. The only common factors for x and eight are one, so we'll have x

5
00:00:20,024 --> 00:00:25,193
times 1 times 8, which equals 8x, our lowest common denominator.
