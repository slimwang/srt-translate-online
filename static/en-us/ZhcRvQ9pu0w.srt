00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,080
To do this, we need to add a method to our book class. We're going to want to

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,860
use the substring method to print out just the text from the beginning to the

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:14,207
first period. So, the first index we should put in is zero because that's the

4
00:00:14,207 --> 00:00:17,074
first index of the character in the book, and then we need to find the end of

5
00:00:17,074 --> 00:00:22,870
the first sentence. We can do this using the indexOf method that we used before

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:28,019
to look for Mad hatter. And now the key here is that substring for the second

7
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:33,635
argument, wants to take the character after the last character to print. So, if

8
00:00:33,635 --> 00:00:37,340
the last character we want to print is the period and that's our endOfSentence,

9
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:42,310
we want to give substring endOfSentence plus one. Now in our tester, we'll

10
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,650
want to add another line where we test out our new method and compare it to the

11
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:52,272
expected value, which is a little long. So, we'll need to split it across a few

12
00:00:52,272 --> 00:00:58,776
different lines. And see how this worked. So, the actual is exactly what we

13
00:00:58,776 --> 00:01:03,128
expected and the expected is missing some line breaks and goes to the side for

14
00:01:03,128 --> 00:01:09,090
a long time. But other than that, it looks like this is basically doing what we

15
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:09,850
wanted.
