00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,376
The lobotomy has a tragic and torrid history, in that, in nearly four decades

2
00:00:04,376 --> 00:00:09,318
approximately 40,000 lobotomies were performed. If you're interested in the

3
00:00:09,318 --> 00:00:13,280
history of the lobotomy there's a lot of information available on the web. In

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,240
addition, you may be interested in a book about Walter Freeman. Who's

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,794
considered one of the most scored physicians because he performed approximately

6
00:00:21,794 --> 00:00:26,385
3,500 of those 40,000 lobotomies. The name of the book is entitled "My

7
00:00:26,385 --> 00:00:30,641
Lobotomy" by Howard Dully. In that book, Mr Dully explains his experience of

8
00:00:30,641 --> 00:00:35,812
getting a prefrontal lobotomy from Walter Freeman. Now, we're going to post a

9
00:00:35,812 --> 00:00:40,600
link from a PBS special in the instructor's note box. I want to warn you that

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,320
this video is extremely graphic because it shows actual lobotomies being

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,000
performed. Therefore, I want to warn you that it can be very upsetting,

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,598
disturbing, or disconcerting to watch. So please think carefully before you do

13
00:00:53,598 --> 00:00:54,060
so.
