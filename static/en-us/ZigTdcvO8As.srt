1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,090
In addition to this
notion of domination,

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,510
another thing that's
going to be helpful is,

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:08,060
if I tell you a tale of two
operators for two policies.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,202
So imagine we've got policy Pi(1) and
policy Pi(2).

5
00:00:12,202 --> 00:00:16,490
We're going to define the one step
Bellman operator on those two policies.

6
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:20,620
So the first operator B1,
when we apply it to a value function V

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:26,020
is just going to return for each state
the immediate reward from that state.

8
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:30,720
If we follow policy Pi1 plus
the discounted expected value for

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,980
following policy Pi1 with
one step look up on V.

10
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,570
So we're converting V, we're basically
putting V through a one step value

11
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,700
iteration with a fixed policy Pi1,
and B2 is the same idea,

12
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,056
same operator,
except with respect to policy two.

13
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,588
Pi2.

14
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,120
Pi2.

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,000
So, what we're going to be able to
show is various kinds of interesting

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,820
domination relationships between

17
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,290
the value functions that we get
out with each of these operators.
