1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,459
It's time to open exercise three,
display URL.

2
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:07,519
Our first to do is to implement that

3
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:10,599
GitHub Query URL that we talked
about in the introduction.

4
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:16,660
In our quest to help you avoid work, and
the inevitable errors that can come with

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:21,740
typing out long URLs, we've created
constants for the base GitHub URL,

6
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:27,119
the query URL parameter and the sort URL
parameter in the network details class.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:32,350
Which also contains our first to do,
to fill in the Build URL method.

8
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,980
To build our search URL,

9
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:39,169
we can take advantage of
the Android URI.builder framework class.

10
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,190
It allows us to create a well-formed URI

11
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:46,909
without having to worry about
the particulars of URI components.

12
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:50,949
For example, adding ampersands
between query parameters and

13
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:55,340
encoding invalid characters with a
percent followed by the character code.

14
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,270
And yes,

15
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:02,760
a URL is a specific class of Uri
which is why this is a bit confusing.

16
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:07,439
Once we've created our base URI
by parsing the GITHUB_BASE_URL

17
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,700
string we create a Uri.builder
using the buildUpon method.

18
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:18,040
Then we can call appendQuery parameter
for our search query and sort fields.

19
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,929
Finally we call build to produce
the Uri we'll use to query GITHUB.

20
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:28,689
However this produces
an Android Uri while our method

21
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:33,140
requires a Java URL, all caps.

22
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,930
We can convert our new
built Uri to a Java URL

23
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,830
by passing it as a string parameter
to the Java URL constructor.

24
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,310
Then we move to main activity.

25
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,620
We'll make a method called,
makeGithubSearchQuery.

26
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:55,770
It pulls the githubQuery from the edit
text, calls the buildUrl method

27
00:01:55,769 --> 00:02:01,869
we just wrote, and displays the
resulting URL in the UrlDisplayTextView.

28
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:08,120
Finally, we replace the toast
from onOptionsItemSelected.

29
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,689
With a call to
the makeGithubSearchQuery method.

30
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:14,609
Now when we hit the search
button in the action bar,

31
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,900
we'll display the URL that
we're going to query.

32
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,580
Now it's your turn, build the URL that
will be used to query GitHub, and

33
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,790
display it when the search
button is pressed.
