1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is the second one. R4 is receiving this.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So it'd better be something encrypted with a key that R4 can decrypt.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
R4 should not be able to decrypt something encrypted with the public key of Alice.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
R4 could decrypt these two because R4 could know the public key of Bob,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
but then anyone could also decrypt these two.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So we want it encrypted in a way that only R4 can open.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That's like the envelope with a seal that only a particular person should be able to open.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The content needs to be visible to R4 where to send the message next,

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
which is what the To Alice part does, but invisible to R4 what the actual content is.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Alice looks different from the other routers the way I'm writing in here.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
For this to be secure, there shouldn't be any real distinction between R4 and Alice.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That's hard to get in a network like this.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So it probably is the case that R4 actually learns that Alice is the endpoint,

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
but because the message was received from the previous one in this chain

15
00:00:52,000 --> 99:59:59,999
doesn't learn that it was Bob talking with Alice.
