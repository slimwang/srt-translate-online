1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Another thing to think about is what's the market size estimate?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
How big is this and what's the percentage marketshare realistically you could get?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
How many can you distribution channel actually sell?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
If you have your own direct sales people, do the math.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
How many customers can they call on it at what price?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
As you start putting all this into a spread sheet

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
you actually start building the classic income statement balance sheet and cashflow

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
we haven't even had you do yet.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
If you think about this, this entire conversation we've had

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
was how to get the basic data so you can put together a revenue model

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
that's based on fact rather than fiction.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You are going to start thinking about, well, if I have a direct sales force,

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
how much can they sell in dollars,

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
or if I'm using an indirect channel, what's realistic number they sell for other customers?

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
How much will it cost to have this distribution channel?

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hopefully in the last lecture you start thinking about the cost of you channelâ€”

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
how many customer activations, how much it will cost to get customers

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
into my physical store or my virtual website.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Then as we talked about earlier, how much will it cost to acquire a customer?

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And by the way, not only how much does my customer acquisition cost

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
but what's their lifetime value?

22
00:01:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
How many units will they by from each of these efforts?
