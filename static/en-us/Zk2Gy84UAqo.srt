00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,298
Congratulations. You've made it to the end of this unit and made it to the end

2
00:00:04,298 --> 00:00:07,955
of the course. And you now have a search engine running as a web application and

3
00:00:07,955 --> 00:00:11,535
a way to separate the crawling part from the server. There's certainly a lot you

4
00:00:11,535 --> 00:00:14,955
can do to improve that but let's recap what we've learned in this unit. You

5
00:00:14,955 --> 00:00:19,075
learned about how to set up a web application using web.py. And that led us to

6
00:00:19,075 --> 00:00:23,406
the more broadly applicable idea of regular expressions. And then we looked at

7
00:00:23,406 --> 00:00:27,019
how to use files. And to deal with files well, we needed to understand

8
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:32,637
exceptions. And you use try and except and finally to do that, as well as the

9
00:00:32,637 --> 00:00:36,690
with construct. The other thing we've seen a lot in this unit is examples of

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,762
using inheritance. This was the main topic of the previous unit. I'd encourage

11
00:00:40,762 --> 00:00:44,290
you to think about all the places we've used inheritance in this unit to make

12
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:48,168
things work well, especially the inheritance hierarchy for exceptions. I want to

13
00:00:48,168 --> 00:00:51,268
thank you for taking the class and all the effort that you've put in to get to

14
00:00:51,268 --> 00:00:54,682
this point. You've really learned a lot. I don't think Google is scared of you

15
00:00:54,682 --> 00:00:58,192
yet, but you're well on your way to becoming a computer scientist, as well as to

16
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:02,510
becoming a proficient Pythonista. There's lots of things you can do from here,

17
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,397
and there'll be more discussion about this in the forms. You definitely know

18
00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:08,340
enough to make your own interesting programs and unleash them all on the world.

19
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,142
And I hope many of you will do that. If you do, I hope you will share it with

20
00:01:12,142 --> 00:01:15,737
us, and there's a site for sharing udacisous projects. Some of the examples

21
00:01:15,737 --> 00:01:19,690
there might give you some inspiration about things you might build. There is, of

22
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,372
course, a lot more to learn. And if you learn more, you'll be able to do more

23
00:01:23,372 --> 00:01:27,193
interesting things in better ways. And I learn new things about computing every

24
00:01:27,193 --> 00:01:30,785
day. I hope you'll continue to learn more after this class, and I hope you'll go

25
00:01:30,785 --> 00:01:34,510
on to do exciting and interesting things. Stay Udacious.
