1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,390
This second choice is correct. If pandas all have about the same lifetime, then

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:10,448
they'll die off at a constant rate, not at a constant number per year. That

3
00:00:10,448 --> 00:00:13,810
means that the higher the population. The more deaths there will be, because a

4
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:18,108
certain percent approximately, will die each year. As the population shrinks,

5
00:00:18,108 --> 00:00:20,649
there will be fewer pandas to die.
