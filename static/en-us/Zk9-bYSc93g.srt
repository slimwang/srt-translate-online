00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,588
We're done working with exponents for now, but we'll come back to them later.

2
00:00:03,676 --> 00:00:07,786
Let's look at some other ways that we can use decimals. We're going to look at

3
00:00:07,798 --> 00:00:11,502
decimals and percents. Decimals and percents are often used in currency and in

4
00:00:11,514 --> 00:00:15,344
commercial business. We can buy shoes, sweaters, or electronics on sale. And we

5
00:00:15,356 --> 00:00:18,906
often want to know how much does something actually cost. By the end of this

6
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:23,225
segment, you'll be able to find out how much an item cost, like a new pair of

7
00:00:23,237 --> 00:00:27,630
shoes. So, here's the problem that we're going to have you answer and come back

8
00:00:27,642 --> 00:00:32,030
to later. A pair of shoes costs $80 and is on sale for 44% off, what will you

9
00:00:32,042 --> 00:00:36,485
pay for the shoes? The first thing we need to recognize is this problem has a

10
00:00:36,497 --> 00:00:41,144
percent in it. Percent literally means per 100 or out of a 100. I can write

11
00:00:41,144 --> 00:00:41,144
44 percent another way.

12
00:00:41,144 --> 00:00:50,253
I know it's 44 out of 100 or 44 divided by 100. 44 divided by 100 is the same

13
00:00:50,265 --> 00:00:57,782
thing as 0.44. Here's a grid of a 100 squares, or I have 1 block. Of these 100

14
00:00:57,794 --> 00:01:05,814
pieces, I'm going to have 44 of them. So, I'd have 10, 20, 30, 40, 44 blocks out

15
00:01:05,826 --> 00:01:15,136
of a 100 or 0.44 and that's this written as a decimal, 0.44. Okay, here are some

16
00:01:15,148 --> 00:01:19,518
other percents. I can have 23%, 6%, or 200%.

17
00:01:19,524 --> 00:01:24,997
I'm going to convert these percents to decimals. Sometimes, we need to convert

18
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:30,478
percents to decimals in order to use them in problems or to multiply. Okay, so

19
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:35,905
let's use these 100 blocks to help us out. Here, I have 23 squares shaded out of

20
00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:42,530
100. So, 23 divided by 100. As a decimal, that's 0.23. For 6%, I'm going to have

21
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:47,512
6 blocks out of a 100. So, I have 6 blocks out of a 100 or 6 hundredths, 0.06

22
00:01:47,632 --> 00:01:53,515
Notice that 6 has to be in the hundredths spot. For 200%, I know that I have to

23
00:01:53,527 --> 00:01:59,407
do something different. I can color in 100 of the squares in this 1 block. So, I

24
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:05,624
have a 100 blocks shaded, but I need 200%. This is only a hundred out of a

25
00:02:05,636 --> 00:02:11,618
hundred, that's a 100%. 200 percent means 200 out of 100. I know one of these

26
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:18,379
squares represents a hundredth, so I have 200 hundred hundredths, or I just have

27
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:24,300
2 or 2 blocks. Okay. There's actually a pattern here that we want to notice.

28
00:02:24,423 --> 00:02:30,340
Let's look closely at the decimal places. Here in 23%, the decimal is here and

29
00:02:30,352 --> 00:02:36,279
then it ended up here. For 6%, the decimal started here and ended up here. For

30
00:02:36,279 --> 00:02:40,316
200%, the decimal started here and ended up there.

31
00:02:40,316 --> 00:02:45,120
Let's have a quiz behind what's going on with this pattern. What do you notice?
