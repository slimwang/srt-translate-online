00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:04,151
This idea is called the Mixnet. It was invented by

2
00:00:04,151 --> 00:00:06,652
David Chaum. Any youll notice that this is quite

3
00:00:06,652 --> 00:00:09,367
similar to onion routing and in fact onion

4
00:00:09,367 --> 00:00:11,910
routing was based on this idea. There is a couple

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,725
issues we have to work out though. This kind of

6
00:00:14,725 --> 00:00:16,901
encryption won't work very well. There are some

7
00:00:16,901 --> 00:00:18,739
big problems with the way weve described

8
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:21,211
it so far. So supposed that we do this and we

9
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:24,403
encrypt this way, how well would this actually

10
00:00:24,403 --> 00:00:27,652
work? If we encrypt to vote as described where

11
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:29,671
youre going to use the layered public key

12
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:32,079
encryption and the vote is the name of the

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,393
party, the voter wants to vote for and you can

14
00:00:34,393 --> 00:00:37,739
assume that the encryption is done using RSA

15
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,770
where the public keys are well-known to everyone,

16
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,669
the private keys are kept secret to their correct

17
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:47,669
owners. And there are no vulnerabilities in RSA.
