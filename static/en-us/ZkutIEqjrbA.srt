1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So the definition is a little bit complicated,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
and it involves a bunch of moving parts

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
like c1s, c2s and 0s and ends in f's and g's.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's see whether the definition at least satisfies

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
some intuitive properties that we want it to.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So to the extent that we're saying that Big Theta

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
means the two functions grow roughly the same as each other,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
then it ought to be the case that

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
if some function f(n) is in Θ(g(n)),

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
it seems like it should go the other way, as well.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
If f(n) grows roughly the same as g(n),

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
then g(n) should grow roughly the same as f(n).

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Is that true? So here's some possible choices.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
No, as much as we would like this to be true,

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
it just doesn't follow from the definition

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
of Big Theta that we just gave.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yes, because Big Theta is like an equality.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
An equality is reflexive, so Big Theta ought to be reflexive.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And then another possibility is yes,

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
because we can use the c1 and c2

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
from the definition of f(n) is in Θ(g(n)),

22
00:00:55,000 --> 99:59:59,999
use the reciprocals, and that sandwiches g(n).
