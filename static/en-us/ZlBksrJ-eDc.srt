1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,660
The variable we used to refer
to Rebecca's address we titled

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,550
RebeccasAddress with a capital R and
capital A.

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,780
So this is the same variable that we
used to update the address here and

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,810
the ZIP code here.

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,910
So that's what we need to add
to the session and then commit.
