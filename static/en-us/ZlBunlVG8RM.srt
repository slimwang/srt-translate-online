1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,160
So now that we understand how to
address the variety of screen sizes and

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,600
densities out there,

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,590
we can get into how we go about
constructing your user interface.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,740
As you remember from
Android Fundamentals,

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,750
your UI is a nested tree that
we call the view hierarchy.

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,960
Now, this tree defines the entire
structure of the UI from the root view

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,890
group all the way down to the leaf
views, such as text, buttons, or images.

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,660
Now, every single thing you
see on the screen in your app

9
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,370
is a view somewhere in this hierarchy.

10
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:33,070
You can define your UI either by
creating these objects in code, or

11
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,720
by declaring your layout in an XML file.

12
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,130
Now we very much prefer
the latter approach,

13
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:42,430
as it allows you to separate the
presentation from the app's behavior.

14
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:46,470
Each element in your UI will have a
number of parameters associated with it.

15
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,500
Some are common and must be provided for
all views, such as its width, height, or

16
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,090
location on the screen.

17
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:56,040
Other parameters are specific to
a particular view, such as a button will

18
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,910
have parameters for its background and
the text to display.

19
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,110
Let's dive in and see how the elements
are sized and placed on the screen.
