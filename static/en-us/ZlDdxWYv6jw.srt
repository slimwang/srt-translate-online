I'm now going to practice my hand-drawn data fitting skills.

00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,230
But I think the line would look a bit like this.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,770
It'd be closer to C than to B,

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,360
because there's other points pulling on it over here.

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,270
It'd be really close to A.

6
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,710
So B would have the highest
