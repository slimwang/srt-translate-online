>> Here are our answers. You've learned that inequalities have ranges of values

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,602
that are solutions to them. So that means that if a number falls in this range,

3
00:00:08,602 --> 00:00:12,840
we can use it in the inequality to make a true statement. Some of these may be a

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,449
bit confusing though. For example, 3 is less than or equal to 7. On a number

5
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:21,985
line, if we're curious about all of the numbers that are less than or equal to

6
00:00:21,985 --> 00:00:26,387
7, we would shade in all the numbers to the left of 7 on the number line. And

7
00:00:26,387 --> 00:00:30,630
then draw a square bracket to include 7 in that range. We can see that 3

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,922
definitely falls in this region. It is not equal to 7, but it is less than 7.

9
00:00:35,922 --> 00:00:40,568
And it only needs to fit one of the criteria implied by this symbol. It either

10
00:00:40,568 --> 00:00:45,325
needs to be less than 7, or it needs to be equal to 7. Similarly, the statement

11
00:00:45,325 --> 00:00:49,809
8 is greater than or equal to 1 plus 7 is also true. When simplified, this of

12
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:54,472
course gives us the inequality 8 is greater than or equal to 8. And you might at

13
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:58,754
first think, oh my gosh, 8 is not greater than 8. However it only needs to be

14
00:00:58,754 --> 00:01:02,902
greater than or equal to 8. It's equal to 8 so that's enough to satisfy this

15
00:01:02,902 --> 00:01:07,106
inequality. We can see the difference here then, between this symbol, the

16
00:01:07,106 --> 00:01:11,528
greater than or equal to, which implies inclusion of 8, versus the just greater

17
00:01:11,528 --> 00:01:16,606
than sign. This statement is true. Whereas this statement is not, because 8 is

18
00:01:16,606 --> 00:01:22,150
greater than 1 plus 7, only allows for the greater than criterion, not the equal

19
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,002
to one. 1 plus 7 no longer fits the bill.
