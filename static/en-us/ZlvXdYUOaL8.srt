1
00:00:00,927 --> 00:00:03,341
And the answer is, there are 8 states.

2
00:00:03,341 --> 00:00:08,355
There are two physical states that
the robot vacuum cleaner can be in,

3
00:00:08,355 --> 00:00:10,567
either in state A or in state B.

4
00:00:10,567 --> 00:00:14,971
But in addition to that,
there are states about how the world is,

5
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:17,786
as well as where the robot
is in the world.

6
00:00:17,786 --> 00:00:21,390
So, state A can be dirty or not.

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,390
That's two possibilities.

8
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,050
And B can be dirty or not.

9
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,344
That's two more possibilities.

10
00:00:26,344 --> 00:00:29,868
When we multiply those together,
we get eight possible states.

11
00:00:29,868 --> 00:00:35,009
