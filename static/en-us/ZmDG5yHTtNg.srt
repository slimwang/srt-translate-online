1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The next thing you can do is you can co-locate.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Basically, this means buying space 
in a rack in a data center.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So, you still buy your own machines and 
you install them in this data center

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
or maybe you buy a whole rack or you buy a 
whole cage but basically a lot of websites do this.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The biggest ones have their own data centers.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The biggest reason you do this is 
you have control over the machines.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You can build whatever machines you want, 
configure them however you want,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and wire them together however you want.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
They're your machines, and you're renting the space.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Generally, you pay for things like rent to have your 
space, and then you pay for power and bandwidth.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You pay for 30 amps or 60 amps to 
power a couple of machines in a rack,

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
or you may pay for many more to 
have a whole cage of machines

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and you pay for how much bandwidth to use.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You maybe only need 10 megs a second 
or maybe you need 10 gigs.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,723
It all depends and you have control over all of this.

16
00:00:42,723 --> 00:00:46,000
Downside is there's a high amount of work. You 
have to actually administer these machines.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You have to install software. 
You have to maintain them.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
If they break, you have to replace them. 
It's a lot of effort.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So, if you're not good at sysadmining--system administration--doing all that sort of thing

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
colocation is a tough option.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If you like doing that sort of thing, you can 
save some money by co-locating

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
or if you're a big website with highly specialized 
needs, data centers are the way to go.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Few large websites don't control their own machines.
