1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,260
Now what we want to do is extract the

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,650
url. So we found this position, that's going to be

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:09,340
the value of start_link. Now our goal is to extract

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,160
this url. And the url starts from the first double

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,790
quote that we find after start link, and it

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,510
ends with the second double quote. So for the last

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,480
quiz of this unit, your goal is to write all

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,390
the code we need to end up finding that url.

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,620
So this is going to be the hardest quiz that we've had so far. It's going to

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,040
involve you thinking about variables, thinking how

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,800
to use find in different ways. And write

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,920
several lines of code yourself. Think carefully

13
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,480
about how to do this. But I think

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,012
if you understand what we've covered so far, you'll be able to do this yourself.

15
00:00:42,012 --> 00:00:45,179
[BLANK_AUDIO]

16
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:48,203
So to be specific, here's the quiz, your goal is

17
00:00:48,203 --> 00:00:51,519
to write Python code that assigns to the variable url.

18
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:54,849
These are all lowercase letters, a string that is the

19
00:00:54,849 --> 00:00:57,513
value of the first URL found on the page, in

20
00:00:57,513 --> 00:01:01,060
a link tag. So you should assume that we have

21
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,120
the variable page that's already initialized to the contents of

22
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,700
the page. And in your browser this will be initialized

23
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,320
to the contents of an example page. From the previous

24
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,510
quiz we also have the value of start-link already

25
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,150
worked out. It said start-link is the result of calling

26
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:20,800
find on page, passing in the string, a href

27
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,210
equals. And your goal is to finish this code, so

28
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:30,280
at the end of this code, the value of url is the first link on the page. And if

29
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,690
you print the value of url, and you've done

30
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,780
all the code correctly for the example that we provided,

31
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:42,040
you should get the result http://udacity.com,

32
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:47,610
which is the url that finds the Udacity webpage. So this is pretty tough quiz.

33
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,340
There's a lot of steps. Think about it carefully. So it uses almost everything

34
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,370
that you've seen in the unit today. You'll

35
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,900
have to think about how to use the find

36
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,470
method, possibly passing in numbers as well as strings,

37
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,170
as well as variables to keep track of things.

38
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,040
To find the result, you'll also need to think about how to

39
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,920
use the string indexing operators to select a sub-sequence of a string.
