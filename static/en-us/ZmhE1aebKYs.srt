1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,260
So one more question.

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:09,090
And we're talking about
legal deterrents having

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,050
CFAA or BMC and those kind of laws.

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,990
We didn't talk about privacy laws.

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,010
I did say that they exist.

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,150
But let's go back to sort of connect
the privacy discussion we had

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,410
with some of the stuff
we talked about was.

8
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,084
So we said poor privacy,
what does poor privacy mean?

9
00:00:28,084 --> 00:00:33,574
Somebody collects data about you, they
don't tell you what they're collecting,

10
00:00:33,574 --> 00:00:38,544
they don't protect it, they share it
with whoever, and things like that.

11
00:00:38,544 --> 00:00:41,376
So that would be poor privacy.

12
00:00:41,376 --> 00:00:45,885
Good privacy is, you know what they
collect, you know what they use it for,

13
00:00:45,885 --> 00:00:49,055
you know who they share it with,
and they protect it,

14
00:00:49,055 --> 00:00:50,543
work hard to protect it.

15
00:00:50,543 --> 00:00:54,129
So poor privacy would be one of
those things not being done.

16
00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:56,537
So poor privacy is good for bad guys,

17
00:00:56,537 --> 00:00:59,680
because they can use
information about you.

18
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,830
Poor privacy means they can
gain access to information

19
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,599
that you consider private.

20
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,790
They can get hold of it.

21
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,710
So why is that useful to them?

22
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,650
That's why we need those legal
deterrents against them.
