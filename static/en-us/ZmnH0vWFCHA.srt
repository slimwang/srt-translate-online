00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,819
Congratulations!

2
00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:03,900
You've made it to the end of lesson one.

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,939
You may not have realized it before but

4
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,210
being creative actually
takes a lot of work.

5
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,130
This may have been the most
difficult point in the class.

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,980
Now in the next lesson,
you're going to choose an idea, and

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,710
you're going to execute on it.

8
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:16,670
Come check it out when you're ready.
