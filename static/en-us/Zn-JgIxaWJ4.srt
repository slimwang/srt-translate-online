1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So 60°. What would that be in our new units?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
½? Or is it 1 radian?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Or is it 2 radian? Or is it 3 radian?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
0.1 radian. How many degrees would that be:

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
6°, 7°, 12°, or 24°?

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And if we have this right triangle,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
which has an angle of 40 angular degrees here,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
a right angle here, a hypotenuse of 10 units,

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
how long would this leg be?

10
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Would it be 5.0 units, 6.4 units, 6.5 units, 6.6 units?
