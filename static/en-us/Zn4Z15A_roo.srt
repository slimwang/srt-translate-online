1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,180
If we pop up a level you can make a
similar argument here which you sort of

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,840
made when you asked me that question,
all right.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,350
You asked me the question before
we start the quiz which is,

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,770
well if I want to eat a big dot, I need
to avoid the ghosts along the way.

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,420
So maybe eating a big
dot eating a dot is

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,970
really requires that I
know almost everything.

7
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:21,470
Except, in the worst case, eating a big
dot doesn't require that over the little

8
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,870
dots are, even if I need to worry
about where the ghosts are and

9
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:24,730
whether they're scared or not.

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:32,009
Although, if I know where
the dots are then I might

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,990
choose to eat the big dots in such a way
that eat a bunch of little dots as well.

12
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,220
But this is really a kind of,
this points out two things.

13
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:43,770
One, it sort of points out that
if my options are not written in

14
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,170
exactly the right way, then I may not
be able to find an optimum policy,

15
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,500
we'll talk about that in just a moment.

16
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,310
But, if I worry about that,

17
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,059
then all of these options have
to solve every single problem.

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,610
And I kind of get nothing out of it.

19
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,330
I don't get a big win by even thinking
about it in terms of options because

20
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,099
effectively, I'm just trying
to solve the entire problem.

21
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,660
The whole point of abstraction, it's
a kind of the Software Engineering and

22
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:11,870
Computing sense and here we are using
it, is that in part it allows you to do

23
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:16,850
an abstraction not just over time,
it allows you to do state abstraction.

24
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,470
And other kinds of abstraction.

25
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:19,960
So, what do I mean by
state abstraction here?

26
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,680
Well, if you look at the big dot case,

27
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,370
if I don't have to worry
about where the dots are,

28
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,880
never mind where the ghosts and
whether they're scared or not.

29
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,820
That means that if I needed to learn
this policy, if I needed to figure out

30
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,170
how to most optimally solve
the problem of eating dots.

31
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,090
I can actually ignore large
parts of the state space.

32
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,100
What happens if I can ignore large
parts of the state space, Michael?

33
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,330
>> Then you can solve
the problems more efficiently.

34
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,110
>> Right in the very beginning we said
the thing that made reinforcement

35
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:52,280
learning hard is that as the number of
states grew, the problem became more and

36
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,700
more difficult, it was sort of super
linear in the number of states.

37
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,230
So if I can avoid whole features of
the states, that is I can collapse

38
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:03,210
states that are otherwise different
as if they were single state

39
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,820
where the dots are don't matter, then
the problem of learning this policy,

40
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,900
learning this option
actually becomes easier.

41
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,220
Both from a planning point of view and
from a learning point of view.

42
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,700
>> So
it's if the state space gets smaller?

43
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,212
>> Right.
So

44
00:02:14,212 --> 00:02:16,840
temporal abstraction doesn't
just buys temple abstraction.

45
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,290
It buys a state abstraction.

46
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,430
At least if we can divide
the world up appropriate.

47
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,520
>> Neat.
Okay.

48
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,160
I mean is there a guarantee
that we can always do that?

49
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,390
>> No.
There's not a guarantee that we

50
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,310
can always do that.

51
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,180
>> In the kinds of problems that people
can solve maybe it's pretty common

52
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,060
because people don't have infinite
computational resources either.

53
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:35,920
>> Right.
And in practice,

54
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,330
I mean, if you just even think about
the way you were describing things,

55
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,510
you sort of ignore large parts
of what's going on around you

56
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,360
in order to solve the problem, right?

57
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,020
We do these kinds of
things all the time.

58
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,250
It had better be the case that we can
ignore large parts of the state space

59
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,170
with otherwise,

60
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,360
we're in trouble it's going to very
difficult to move around in the world.

61
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,465
I mean first off, the world upon DP so

62
00:02:55,465 --> 00:02:58,640
[LAUGH] we're ignoring large
parts of this database anyway.

63
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,270
But beyond that,

64
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,980
I'm in this room talking to you there
are things going on outside I can't see.

65
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:09,640
By and large I can mostly ignore them
at least for short periods of time.

66
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,880
And we just have to hope in the real
world that the parts of the state space

67
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,920
that might matter such as
I don't know a polar bear,

68
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,520
the location of the closest polar bear.

69
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,868
It will be announced to me
when that becomes relevant.

70
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,304
>> [LAUGH]
>> And

71
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:25,960
I can start paying attention to it,
in which case I'm going to stop worrying

72
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:31,990
about eating my big dots which is what
I call teaching this class and instead

73
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,850
start avoiding ghosts which is what
I call running away from polar bears.
