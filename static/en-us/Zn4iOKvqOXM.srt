1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,570
Learning by storing cases in memory has a very strong connection to cognition.

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,400
Cognitive agents like you and I are situated in a world.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,850
Our interactions with the world have certain patterns of regularity.

4
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:19,120
The world offers us the same problems again and again. If we think about it,

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,730
the kinds of problems that you and I deal within a routine everyday basis

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,960
are the same problems that occurred yesterday and the day before.

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,795
Tying shoelaces is a good example of that. When we have to tie shoelaces,

8
00:00:30,795 --> 00:00:36,270
none of us thinks a lot about how to do it. Memory supplies us with the answer.

9
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,415
We don't think as much as we think we do. If you recall we have drawn

10
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:45,193
a cognitive architecture earlier that had three components in it, reasoning,

11
00:00:45,193 --> 00:00:50,350
memory, and learning. When we think of intelligence, we typically focus on

12
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,575
the reasoning component. We think intelligence has to do with reasoning,

13
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:57,470
with solving problems, with decision making. To some degree, that is true.

14
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:02,370
By learning by recording cases, shifts the balance between the component.

15
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,459
It says that, learning is very important and so is memory.

16
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,450
We recall things in memory and then memory supplies us with the answers so

17
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,600
that we don't actually have to reason as much as we think we need to.
