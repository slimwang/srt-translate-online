I think it'd be a good idea to practice with this algorithm a little bit to get better into your head.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's say that we're going to try to find the shortest path from A to F in this graph

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and we're going to use the algorithm that we were kind of sketching out together on the previous line.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
As you recall, what is does is it does a kind of breadth-first search from A

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
but instead of expanding nodes at the bottom of the tree it always

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
expands the node that has the smallest number written in the node.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The very first time that E appears when we're building that tree,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
what number goes into the circle associated with E as we build up this tree anywhere inside.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Simulate the algorithm, figure out what goes in the E, and then write the answer in the box.
