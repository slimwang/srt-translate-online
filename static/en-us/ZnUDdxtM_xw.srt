00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now how do you go about finding a solution if you don't have an algorithm for it?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,500
Well, first of all, this edge here costs just 1, so we probably want to take that.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,500
Then we have a lot of edges that just have a weight of 2,

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,000
and, of course, they have been arranged in a way that is very beneficial for us here

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,500
because we can actually put them all into the tree,

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,000
and we almost have a spanning tree here.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
There's just one vertex missing, which we still need to connect to that tree here.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And the cheapest way to do that is to use this one edge down here, of course,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
using 4 instead of this one here which would use 6.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,500
So this is a minimum spanning tree for this graph, and this has a total weight of

11
00:00:37,500 --> 99:59:59,999
2+2+1+2+2+4, which is a total of 13.
