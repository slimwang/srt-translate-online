I know if I multiply 1 by 2 and then add 1, I would get 3. Let's see if this

2
00:00:06,255 --> 00:00:12,857
same rule applies in the other cases. I can take my input of 2, multiply it by

3
00:00:12,857 --> 00:00:19,263
2, and then add 1 to get 5. The same rule works for 3. 3 times 2 is 6, plus 1 is

4
00:00:19,263 --> 00:00:27,534
7. So, for any input of x, I just multiply it by 2 and then add 1. That's my

5
00:00:27,534 --> 00:00:29,189
rule.
