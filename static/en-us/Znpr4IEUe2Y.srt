00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,100
In this lesson, we reviewed two older papers that gave us some historic

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:08,370
perspective and some insights into the challenges related to supporting threads.

3
00:00:09,818 --> 00:00:14,000
A major takeaway from these papers is that now we have a better understanding as

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,420
to why current operating systems like Linux have their present day

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,840
threading model.

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,680
In addition, in this lesson, we also introduced interrupt and signals to

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,230
important notification mechanisms supported in operating systems today.
