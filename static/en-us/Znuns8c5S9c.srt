00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,810
This is a good time to revisit 
our final detail wireframe.

2
00:00:03,851 --> 00:00:06,605
For each weather forecast, 
we're going to need to store

3
00:00:06,605 --> 00:00:12,797
at least the date, the condition, the high
and low temperature, the humidity,

4
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:17,016
the wind speed and direction, 
and the barometric pressure.

5
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:21,568
Since our database will use row 
to represent each forecast day,

6
00:00:21,568 --> 00:00:26,757
we'll store each piece of data associated
with the forecast in a separate column.
