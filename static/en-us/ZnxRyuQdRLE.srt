00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,345
The first of the three sensory systems with a specific sensory cortex is the

2
00:00:04,345 --> 00:00:09,743
visual cortex, which is located in the occipital lobes. The second is the

3
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:14,704
auditory cortex, which is located in the temporal lobes. And the third is the

4
00:00:14,704 --> 00:00:18,799
somatosensory cortex, which is responsible for touch and is located in the

5
00:00:18,799 --> 00:00:24,161
parietal lobes. Our sense of smell and taste don't have their own processing

6
00:00:24,161 --> 00:00:29,200
region. However, it's interesting to note that smell can bring forth very

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,070
strong and immediate memory. Have you, for example, noticed that particular

8
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,713
smells can bring back a memory for you? I can think of a few myself. For

9
00:00:38,713 --> 00:00:42,380
example, the smell of homemade pizza reminds me of my grandmother. The smell of

10
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:46,214
the beach reminds me of the summers my family and I spent on the beach. Or, for

11
00:00:46,214 --> 00:00:50,049
example, maybe the smell of a perfume or cologne reminds you of an ex-lover you

12
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:55,530
once had. That's just an example of how smells can evoke powerful memories.

13
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,715
Stop and think for a minute if you recall any particular smells that bring back

14
00:00:58,715 --> 00:01:00,310
a memory to you.
