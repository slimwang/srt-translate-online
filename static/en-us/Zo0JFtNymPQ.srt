1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,900
Let's tackle this together. Here we have the rightmost value

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,644
of the picture to the left. We'll add ten and then

3
00:00:06,644 --> 00:00:10,280
we translate pic by that amount. That's the statement. Now

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,240
we need to do that for all of the pictures. So

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,940
I need to add the loop header. I've done that

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,624
often enough that my fingers can do it on autopilot. Here

7
00:00:18,624 --> 00:00:20,980
goes. Pretty soon your fingers will be able to do

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,480
that too. Let's go and compile, and let's run the program.

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:31,140
Hm, that did not seem to work, now did it? Let's see. The program crashed, and I

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,450
am told that there is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, and the

11
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,820
index that was out of bounds was minus one.

12
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,945
Well, minus one is not a valid array index. And why would I have gotten a minus

13
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:50,550
one. Oh look at this i is 0, so over here this i is 0 and then the

14
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:57,980
i minus 1 is 0 minus 1 and that's bad. Now the problem is that when

15
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:03,340
I am at the zeroth picture, that is the initial picture in this sequence. There

16
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:10,805
is nothing to the left, so the remedy is to start here. With i equals 1. The

17
00:01:10,805 --> 00:01:15,664
zeroth picture just stays where it was. Picture at index one then gets moved to

18
00:01:15,664 --> 00:01:18,288
the right of the one at index zero, and

19
00:01:18,288 --> 00:01:22,160
that's all great. So in this case, my fingers shouldn't

20
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,050
have been on auto pilot, but I should have thought

21
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:28,380
through what values for i, I actually want. It's very,

22
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,857
very common in actual programming to get these kinds of

23
00:01:31,857 --> 00:01:34,360
errors. And I wanted to show how it looks like

24
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,060
when you do. Now let's try this. And look at

25
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,830
that, our pictures are finally arranged in a neat sequence.
