00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,260
There is a very useful class inside
of AV foundation that focuses

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,462
on recording audio
called AVAudioRecorder.

3
00:00:07,462 --> 00:00:13,230
We're going to utilize this class for,
you guessed it recording the audio.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,510
One important skill in iOS development
is being able to read code that you have

5
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,272
never seen before.

6
00:00:18,272 --> 00:00:19,560
I'm going to show you a bit of code,

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,562
and ask you to get a gist
of what it's doing.

8
00:00:21,562 --> 00:00:24,220
We're going to be taking
a closer look at this code, and

9
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,690
see if you can tell what's going on.
