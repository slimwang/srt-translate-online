1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,765
We can also shift parabolas, or move them around on the coordinate plane. Let's

2
00:00:04,765 --> 00:00:08,874
take a look at our original equation, y equals x squared. If we add 1 to the

3
00:00:08,874 --> 00:00:15,864
equation, we can see that the entire graph shifts up 1 unit. Notice before that

4
00:00:15,864 --> 00:00:23,510
the vertex was at 0,0. And now, our vertex is at 0, 1. By adding one right here

5
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:29,301
to the end of our equation, we really increase the y values from before by 1.

6
00:00:29,301 --> 00:00:35,838
This is why the entire graph, the orange graph, shifts one unit up. So a point

7
00:00:35,838 --> 00:00:42,500
that was at negative 1, 1 is now at negative 1, 2. And a point that say was at

8
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:49,227
two comma four is now at two comma five. Notice how the y value increased by

9
00:00:49,227 --> 00:00:55,544
one. We can also make this graph go up by two units, three units, four units,

10
00:00:55,544 --> 00:01:01,510
or even eight units. So, we can see that adding a constant term to the end of

11
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:06,746
our parabola, will shift it up. So, if we subtract a number, it will shift it

12
00:01:06,746 --> 00:01:12,550
down. The parabola, y equals x squared minus 3, is our original parabola, only

13
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:17,662
it's been shifted down three units. And again, notice that the orange parabola

14
00:01:17,662 --> 00:01:24,118
had a vertex of 0, 0. And this new parabola has a vertex of 0, negative 3. We

15
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:28,498
could even change this to be a negative 5, so that way the orange parabola

16
00:01:28,498 --> 00:01:33,990
would shift down 5 units. And again, notice that the vertex of this last

17
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,838
parabola is 0, negative 5. We can see that the y coordinate of the vertex comes

18
00:01:38,838 --> 00:01:44,407
from here, this negative 5 is right here on our vertex. The x coordinate of our

19
00:01:44,407 --> 00:01:50,141
vertex is 0. And it turns out it comes from solving this binomial or setting

20
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:56,432
this binomial equal to 0. X minus 0 is still x, so we know that this term is

21
00:01:56,432 --> 00:02:02,010
really still x squared. And if I graph this equation, I can see that there

22
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:07,435
exactly the same. I'm just writing this in a different form. So, now we can

23
00:02:07,435 --> 00:02:12,326
quickly see where this vertex comes from in our equation. The 0 is here, and

24
00:02:12,326 --> 00:02:17,860
the negative 5 is here. Now, we've seen shifting the parabola up and down.

25
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:23,023
Well, we can also see a parabola shifted left and right. So, we know by adding

26
00:02:23,023 --> 00:02:28,083
3 on the end, we could shift the parabola up 3 units. To shift the graph left

27
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:32,690
or right, we're going to change this binomial. If I subtract 1 from x, it

28
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:38,089
really moves the graph one unit to the right. Now the vertex is here. Notice

29
00:02:38,089 --> 00:02:41,929
that the sign of the x coordinate of the vertex is opposite from the one in

30
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:47,747
here. For a y equals parabola, we can set this binomial equal to 0 to find the

31
00:02:47,747 --> 00:02:54,968
x coordinate of the vertex. So in this case, x would equal one. The y

32
00:02:54,968 --> 00:02:58,274
coordinate of the vertex is simply found by the number that's added or

33
00:02:58,274 --> 00:03:01,340
subtracted at the end of the equation.
