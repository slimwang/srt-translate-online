1
00:00:00,147 --> 00:00:04,540
So here's some examples of models and
these are the same transformations that

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,182
we talked about earlier when we're
talking about doing mappings for

3
00:00:08,182 --> 00:00:11,024
homographies and panoramas,
and things like that.

4
00:00:11,024 --> 00:00:15,759
So we have very simply so we basically
go from the red to the, the green.

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,412
So if we have a translation, right,
so this thing just move that way.

6
00:00:19,412 --> 00:00:23,204
And in translation,
how many unknowns are there?

7
00:00:23,204 --> 00:00:23,945
>> Two.

8
00:00:23,945 --> 00:00:24,700
>> Two, right.

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,338
So since we get two equations for
each point,

10
00:00:27,338 --> 00:00:30,541
we just need to track one point here,
one point there.

11
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:33,790
If I know that between them, I know
how x changed, I know how y changed.

12
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,891
Two equations, two unknowns.

13
00:00:35,891 --> 00:00:37,111
Great, everything is good.

14
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:38,852
We have what's called a similarity.

15
00:00:38,852 --> 00:00:43,530
A transform similarity is where things
can translate rotate and scale.

16
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,740
All right, and
that's four unknowns, two points.

17
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,070
Which if they, think about it.

18
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,620
If I take a stick here, I can translate
it, rotate it and stretch it.

19
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,700
I only need two points to know
the translation rotation stretch.

20
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,790
Much more interesting is
what's referred to as affine.

21
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:02,050
I have this rectangle and
when I move it,

22
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,820
I can translate, rotate,
skew, all right?

23
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,560
And so, parallel lines remain parallel.

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,790
And I have six unknowns.

25
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,460
And, and there's, we,
we actually looked at the math before.

26
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,890
One way to think about it is,
I take one triangle, and

27
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,560
I map it to its corresponding triangle.

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,910
And that's an affine transform.

29
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,670
So the six unknowns, and
I can solve it with three points.

30
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,190
And then finally, I know you're
all waiting for this, right?

31
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:30,310
Here it's written as perspective,
we can also write this as homography.

32
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,700
Now you're seeing why we don't
have me writing anything.

33
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,850
We did this before right?

34
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,750
We said if we have perspective
projection of a plane

35
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,170
to another plane that,

36
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,980
that transformation is a four-point
transformation, eight unknowns and

37
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:47,410
that's because it takes four and four
points therefore to recover homography.

38
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,880
So each of these can be thought
of as transformations or

39
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,310
as motions within a region.
