Finally, we're going to review these really cool functions which put together,

2
00:00:03,617 --> 00:00:07,866
are called Piecewise Functions. Let's take a look at a graph of the following

3
00:00:07,866 --> 00:00:13,718
function. Match the pieces of the function with the region of the graph. You

4
00:00:13,718 --> 00:00:17,678
can choose from x squared, x plus 2, and 2, and please be sure to fill in the

5
00:00:17,678 --> 00:00:23,715
corresponding regions on the right-hand side. Fill in the blue boxes with the

6
00:00:23,715 --> 00:00:29,031
appropriate symbols and the green boxes with the appropriate numbers.
