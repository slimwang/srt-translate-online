1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,070
So now let's look at a 2-D example of this.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:11,060
Here I've basically shown you a nine by nine, image just as a sample.

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,600
And we will actually work around with this.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,010
And note that basically I've filled it in with a lot of zeroes and 90s and

5
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,920
just to keep the, approach simple.

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,870
And these are intentionally designed to be values that we can actually do

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,740
some simple math with.

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,150
What we want to do now is smooth some aspects of this,

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,480
to be able to generate a newer, smoother image.

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,030
Here is the new image that I want to start filing in the values for.

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,370
Notice again that in this image, I've actually given values of 90s.

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:41,350
So you can imagine them to be the most, the peak value, of the image.

13
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,060
And again I've left us some holes with the zero here, black point, and

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,130
also 90 here to kind of give it some diversity, and

15
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,230
see how that actually generates itself.

16
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,990
To help us do this, let's actually look at a three by three neighborhood.

17
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,300
So while this image is nine-by-nine, I want to actually use

18
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,180
a three-by-three neighborhood to be able to then, smooth out and an intense,

19
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,670
basically the intention is, that every time I apply this three-by-three

20
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:11,500
neighborhood, I want to generate a new value, at this point, and place it here.

21
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:13,810
Okay? That's the goal.

22
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,340
So of course by looking at this, you can start guessing that if I was to do

23
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:23,520
a simple linear average, that is take the sum of all of this and divide by nine,

24
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,920
I would be able to come up with a value that I could place in here.

25
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:30,080
And that value of course would be zero.

26
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,910
Let's keep moving, and now I actually, next time what I'll do is, I want to

27
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,870
move this one frame here because we want to actually raster scan and move this

28
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:41,190
all over this image to be able to generate newer versions of the output image.

29
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,260
Now doing the summation over all of this neighborhood here, you would basically

30
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:48,780
see the summation is simply ninety, and of course I have nine divided by nine,

31
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,540
nine elements so you can predict what the next value is going to be, ten.

32
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,950
And we can keep doing this one after the other,

33
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,340
moving to the next one, one eighty is the sum divided that by.

34
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,410
nine, twenty and you can see basically,

35
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:08,650
how we can start filling up all of the values of this output matrix.

36
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:13,600
Once I'm done with this part here, of course I've filled in the ten and

37
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,690
now I need to rotate around, and start looking at these values here.

38
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:18,580
Move here.

39
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,030
Zero again.

40
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:24,210
Three values of ninety, so 270 divided by nine.

41
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,830
And using this, I can get all the way to the end here and,

42
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,740
fill in all of the values that came out of this process.

43
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,220
Now one thing you may notice that because the way we looked at our neighborhood

44
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:38,880
of three by three, and we're replacing the value here which is value here,

45
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,550
this whole top row, and the two edged columns, and

46
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,550
the bottom row are, of course, not filled.

47
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,130
We'll discuss how to fill that up in a, in a bit.

48
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,440
So while this thing is filled up,

49
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,760
let's now start looking at what really happened and what we can learn from this.

50
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,210
So a couple of interesting things happen.

51
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,720
There was a zero here.

52
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,320
If you noticed, the zero is now in this image, replaced by a much higher value.

53
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,930
Because again, if you notice it in both direction.

54
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,170
This pixel would have been of this intensity has been smoothed out.

55
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,660
Similarly there was a 90 here and it's been reduced to 10.

56
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,690
And again you may argue that actually the whole image now is

57
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,290
much smoother than this thinks.

58
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,600
Now of course there were two reasons we could have done this one.

59
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,910
Maybe this was some sort of an error.

60
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,820
Or maybe we just want to blur some information out.

61
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,440
And again both we will look at in careful detail.

62
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,880
Blurring or removing noise and error.

63
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,880
To help visualize this let me actually show this with a little bit of

64
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,060
information that's not just numbers, but shades of gray.

65
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,780
To achieve this, what I'm doing now is creating the same image,

66
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,450
except now I'm giving white values to all 90.

67
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,750
Assume this to be 255 equivalent scale between zero and 90.

68
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,530
And all of the blacks are, of course, still zero.

69
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,290
So this is my original image.

70
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,380
And now what I do is basically run the same process and

71
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,060
see what the output looks like.

72
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,050
So this would be what the output would look like for that image.

73
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,550
Again, smoothed out by an average filter that's

74
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,670
a three-by-three rubbed over the whole image.

75
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,660
And if you notice again, most of the 90s persist here because that's where

76
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,960
majority of the information was much more in the neighborhood the same.

77
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,000
And the rest of it now is kind of a simple smooth ramp,

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,910
as opposed in this one where it goes to 90 to zero and 90 to zero here.

79
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,459
All that kind of jagginess has been removed.
