1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,046
So to help Grant out, we're going to need to be able to solve this inequality.

2
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:08,145
But this is unlike other inequalities we've looked at before, because this is a

3
00:00:08,145 --> 00:00:12,413
quadratic inequality. You can see that if we multiplied out the terms here, we'd

4
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:16,526
end up with some term that has an x squared in it. So this isn't linear anymore.

5
00:00:16,526 --> 00:00:20,692
Even though, when we're dealing with inequalities, we can do many of the same

6
00:00:20,692 --> 00:00:24,917
operations that we can And when working with equation, we do need to be a little

7
00:00:24,917 --> 00:00:29,312
bit more careful. Do you remember which situation might at some points cause us

8
00:00:29,312 --> 00:00:33,327
to have to switch the direction of inequality. Please check off any of the

9
00:00:33,327 --> 00:00:37,400
situations where this might happen depending on what number we are using.
