For the next practice problem on solving absolute value equations, we're going

2
00:00:04,124 --> 00:00:08,361
to try the absolute value of 3x plus 6 equals 0. Now since 0 is neither positive

3
00:00:08,373 --> 00:00:12,478
nor negative, there's only going to be one solution. You can put your answer in

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,833
this box. So do your best.
