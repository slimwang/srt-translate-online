1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,750
In the previous sections,
any time we focused an element,

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:09,000
we relied on the built-in browser focus
ring to style that element for us.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,920
The focus ring is great because
without it, it's impossible for

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,330
a keyboard user to tell which
element is currently focused.

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,330
In fact, the WebAIM checklist
specifically states in section 2.4.7

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,260
that it should be
visually apparent which

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,570
page element has the current keyboard
focus as you tab through the page.

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,620
But sometimes the default focus ring
may not fit in well with your design.

9
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,890
For instance, here I've got a blue
focus ring on a blue background.

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,520
So it's just really hard to see.

11
00:00:37,755 --> 00:00:41,945
And in some cases, the focus ring can
kind of awkwardly wrap around elements

12
00:00:41,945 --> 00:00:44,965
as we saw in our lesson to for example.

13
00:00:44,965 --> 00:00:47,555
So we need a way to change
the appearance of our element, and

14
00:00:47,555 --> 00:00:50,635
we'd like that change to happen
only when the element is focused.

15
00:00:51,715 --> 00:00:55,375
To do this,
we can use the focus pseudo class.

16
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:59,710
The focus pseudo class only
matches when an element has focus.

17
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,950
To change the appearance
of our focus ring,

18
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,560
we can then use the outline property.

19
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,150
Here, I'm using the outline property to
change the appearance of the focus ring

20
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,780
to a one pixel dotted white line.

21
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,440
Now, some developers choose to
remove the style altogether

22
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,430
by setting the outline property
of the element to zero or none.

23
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:22,480
And this, by itself,
is a major anti-pattern.

24
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,860
Without a focus indicator,

25
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:28,250
how is a keyboard user supposed to tell
which item they're interacting with?

26
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,720
If you're going to remove the focus ring
because you don't like how it looks,

27
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,650
then you need to replace it with
another consistent focus indicator so

28
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,260
a keyboard or switch device
user can navigate your page.

29
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,150
Using that example from before,

30
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,260
let's look at how we can provide our
own alternative focus indicator.

31
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,070
So you might be familiar with adding
hover states to your controls

32
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,580
using the hover pseudo class.

33
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,850
Here, I've set my buttons to have
a red background with white text and

34
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,090
a text underline whenever
they're hovered.

35
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,457
I can actually see this in practice as I
go and mouse over the items on my page.

36
00:02:00,457 --> 00:02:02,818
[BLANK_AUDIO]

37
00:02:02,818 --> 00:02:05,555
So a simple solution of
removing the focus ring and

38
00:02:05,555 --> 00:02:10,289
replacing it is just to give your
element the same hover and focus styles.

39
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,680
I can do this by adding another
line to my block of CSS here

40
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,240
that uses the focus pseudo class.

41
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,690
And because the hover style might not
make it obvious which element has focus,

42
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,550
I'm also going to write
a style specifically using

43
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,780
the focus pseudo class.

44
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,280
This style right here is going to
remove that default focus ring, and

45
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,773
replace it with a colored box-shadow.

46
00:02:32,773 --> 00:02:36,840
Now, you might be wondering why use
a box-shadow instead of just changing

47
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,560
the color of the focus ring,
which is a really good question.

48
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,450
Because the various browsers
out there style the outline

49
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,230
properties slightly differently,

50
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:49,690
just changing the color might not
always produce a consistent experience.

51
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:53,360
Using a box shadow here, I know that
I'm going to get a consistent focus

52
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,180
indicator across the different browsers.

53
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,630
Now, as I tab through the page,

54
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,059
It's much easier to tell which
element currently has focus.

55
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,210
Let's use the same technique to fix up
the radio group example from lesson two.

56
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:11,600
I'll start off by removing this sort
of awkward wrapping focus indicator

57
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,020
by setting the outline to none
using that focus pseudo class.

58
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:22,390
And then, I'll use a focus tile to
just target my before pseudo elements.

59
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,612
These are what actually produce
our little radio circles here.

60
00:03:25,612 --> 00:03:29,850
I'm going to give those radio
circles a blue tinted box shadow.

61
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,050
So now when the user
presses their arrow keys,

62
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,610
it's very obvious which
item currently has focus.

63
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,160
So, to sum it up, if at all possible
leave the default browser focus ring in

64
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,530
place, as it's what many
users have come to expect.

65
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,690
If, however, the ring is
clashing with your page styles or

66
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,760
it's just awkwardly wrapping
around your elements, then you can

67
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,790
use the focus pseudo class to provide
your own custom focus indicator
