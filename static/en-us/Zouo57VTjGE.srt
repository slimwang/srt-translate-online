00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,715
The distance between the mile markers is 20 miles, great work if you found this

2
00:00:03,715 --> 00:00:08,910
number. We know this is correct, since we want to just count the number of

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,778
miles between 190 and 210. So, we really just want to subtract this mile marker

4
00:00:13,778 --> 00:00:23,036
from this one. So, 210 minus 190 equals 20 miles. And you might have thought to

5
00:00:23,036 --> 00:00:26,890
subtract 210 from 190. That actually would have worked as well. You just

6
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:30,216
want to make sure that you take the absolute value of that number. Since 190

7
00:00:30,216 --> 00:00:35,546
minus 210 is negative 20, we want the positive result, or the absolute value of

8
00:00:35,546 --> 00:00:40,378
that number. So either way you think about it, you'll still have a distance of

9
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:41,460
20 miles.
