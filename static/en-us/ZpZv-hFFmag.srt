00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:05,080
Again, this is neural-plasticity in action. Neurons develop and are strengthen

00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,946
with use and stimulation and die off when not used. That's why stimulation is

3
00:00:09,946 --> 00:00:13,466
so important. Especially for babies and toddlers who have tonnes of neurons

4
00:00:13,466 --> 00:00:17,320
waiting to form connections. After a year or two of being neglected or

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,071
under-stimulated socially, emotionally, or cognitively. There's a noticable

6
00:00:22,071 --> 00:00:25,305
difference between toddlers who were stimulated, and toddlers who were under

7
00:00:25,305 --> 00:00:26,540
stimulated.
