00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,010
We know enough now to start
building a plane class that will be

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,280
very similar to our line class.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,080
Let's go ahead and do a quiz so
we can get the framework built

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,560
before starting to tackle the problem
of intersections of planes.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:16,020
For this quiz, I've provided
a Python module called plane.pie.

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,420
In it, I provided very similar
functionality to the line.py module.

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,290
In fact, it is the same except that all
instances of the word line have been

8
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,940
replaced with plane.

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,510
You can find this module in
the downloadable section of this page.

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,480
For the quiz, I'd like you to
add two functions to the module.

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,550
One to test whether two
planes are parallel, and

12
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,190
another to test whether
two planes are equal.

13
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,910
To check your code,
here are some test cases.

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,990
Please indicate whether each of
the following pairs of planes are equal,

15
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,980
parallel but not equal, or not parallel.

16
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:54,220
The first pair of planes is -0.412x +

17
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:59,608
3.806y + 0.728z = -3.46.

18
00:00:59,608 --> 00:01:04,617
And 1.03x- 9.515y-

19
00:01:04,617 --> 00:01:08,519
1.82z = 8.65.

20
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:13,964
The second pair of planes is 2.611x

21
00:01:13,964 --> 00:01:19,889
+ 5.528y + 0.283z = 4.6 and

22
00:01:19,889 --> 00:01:27,750
7.715x + 8.306y + 5.342z = 3.76.

23
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:33,544
The third pair of planes is -7.926x

24
00:01:33,544 --> 00:01:40,503
+ 8.625y- 7.217z = -7.952.

25
00:01:40,503 --> 00:01:46,674
And -2.642x + 2.875y-

26
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:52,051
2.404z = -2.443.
