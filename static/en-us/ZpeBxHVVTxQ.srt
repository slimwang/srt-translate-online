1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,710
So how do you validate the idea?

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,380
How do you not waste a lot
of time building something

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,580
that people don't need?

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,050
>> Well, I think that the thing you
need to do is just build something.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,050
I realize that sounds a little backwards
to the way you asked the question.

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,270
But you can talk to as many
people as you want in life, and

7
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,709
you'll get some good answers and
some bad answers.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,580
Unless you know how to ask
the questions properly,

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,410
you'll get a lot of bad answers.

10
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,110
But really the best way to get people's
feedback is to build something.

11
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:35,528
And it might not be the right thing, but
as long as it has sort of the minimal

12
00:00:35,528 --> 00:00:40,260
quantitive useable functionality.

13
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,890
It gives people something
to interact with.

14
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,210
And then you start learning how they
use it, what they really want, and

15
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,620
you can go from there.

16
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,740
>> So,
if I'm an early stage startup, and

17
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,750
I want to do user research,
what do I do?

18
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,030
I just build it and
release it to the market?

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,970
>> Essentially, yeah.

20
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:04,870
It really is you know, build something,
put it out there, see what happens.

21
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,550
The way I would modify
that just a little and

22
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,674
this is why it's useful to be
your own customer is that,

23
00:01:10,674 --> 00:01:14,090
if you're your own customer and if
you're building this thing for yourself,

24
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:18,740
as you start developing it, you can
actually figure out what you need and

25
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,820
what you don't need before you release
it and see what other people need.

26
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,110
If you're building something for someone
you don't understand and it's not you.

27
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,450
The first piece of feedback you'll get
is when you toss it out into the world.

28
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,560
And getting people to engage
with something is hard enough.

29
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,530
Getting people to engage with
something they don't actually want or

30
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,350
need at all is basically impossible.

31
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,910
So if you build something
that you need and

32
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,110
want, you can get it to the point
where it solves your problem.

33
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:48,860
Then you release it and other people
will be able to give you feedback and

34
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,370
really interact with it and
then you'll just get better faster.

35
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,410
You make your iterations faster.

36
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,950
>> And how do you make sure that you get

37
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,480
the right feedback
from the right people?

38
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,900
How do you make sure that it's not
like showing it to your mother and

39
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,760
she's saying, hey that's a great idea.

40
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,100
>> Yeah.

41
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,300
Well, mothers will usually tell you your
idea is very nice unless they actually

42
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,430
want you to go back to law school
which is what my mom keeps suggesting.

43
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,880
Although she suggested I go get an MBA
the other day, I don't know why.

44
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,050
You have to pick, right?

45
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,800
You have to be smart about it and

46
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,410
seek out the people who you think will
find what you're doing is useful.

47
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,920
Now, some of that actually
is picking people by hand,

48
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,400
looking at your network and saying,
hey, this person is the right demo.

49
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,290
The right user type for
what I'm building, looks like me or

50
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,190
doesn't look like me, but I think
I can solve their problem anyway.

51
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,330
Let me start with them.

52
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,730
The other way is try to find
some sort of distribution early.

53
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,540
And there's a bunch of
different ways to do that.

54
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,910
If you're building a product,
Hacker News, is an amazing place to go.

55
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,270
Because that's where a lot of people who
are interested in technology congregate.

56
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:52,770
They go there.

57
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:53,560
They see what's up.

58
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,820
They look at interesting articles.

59
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,020
We have something called Show HN, where
people just put up new products, and

60
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,890
they'll get a lot of feedback.

61
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,640
A lot of customers,
potential customers, coming to them.

62
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,790
You can use product hunt for
the same thing.

63
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,940
There's a bunch of other things
like that that you can use.

64
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,270
But really, it's about being relentless.

65
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:17,550
There's a great story that
Ben from Pinterest tells.

66
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,880
The founder of Pinterest.

67
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,360
And when he was starting Pinterest,

68
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,400
he didn't think anyone
would want to use it.

69
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,300
And so
he literally went to coffee shops and

70
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:31,370
showed the prototypes of Pinterest
to moms that he saw at coffee shops.

71
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,130
He said,
these are probably going to be my demo.

72
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,090
Let me see what they think.

73
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,010
And he had them, and
he just took notes at coffee shops.

74
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,450
And it's that level of drive of

75
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,670
just finding people who want
to use what you're building.

76
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,070
That's critical in getting
some sort of engagement.
