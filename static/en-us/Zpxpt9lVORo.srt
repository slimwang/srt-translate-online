1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,730
So now let me actually introduce
you to a fun quiz we're going to do

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,180
with Harris Detectors.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:11,190
And you'll get experience of actually
using some code online to be able

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,830
to kind of see how we can actually
do Harris Detectors on an image.

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,855
To do this quiz, you'll have to work
back to the browser where, basically,

6
00:00:19,855 --> 00:00:22,070
you've been getting to see
all of your lectures, and

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,640
go to, and this site, and go to Sandbox.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,600
Of course, whenever you are in
the sandbox some code should be existing

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,660
there that's been working on before.

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,090
And in this case I have something for
feature matching.

11
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:34,820
So, for this quiz,

12
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,690
what I want you to do is basically
look at this code and run it.

13
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,170
Let me show you what's happening here,
and

14
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:45,240
this is the code that actually
does Harris corner detection.

15
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,640
And our goal at this quiz is to
take piece of codethat is there and

16
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,610
find this image.

17
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,420
And in this image, find the corners.

18
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,670
Of course,
all of the processing steps are shown,

19
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:00,640
and here you basically can see that it
did find corners, but not all of them.

20
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,030
So one, two, three, four, five.

21
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,810
It missed these two.

22
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,830
So what I want you folks to do is,
first, go ahead and

23
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,770
find the documentation for
this function.

24
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,240
And here, basically,
in this function in the code,

25
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,860
basically change the parameters that
all eight corners are detected.

26
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,580
Then you hit the Submit.

27
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,280
The code will be evaluated
against two different images and

28
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,450
you'll get an answer.

29
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,670
So that's what I want you to for
this assignment, or this quiz, please.
