00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,110
Before we can begin to create or

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:07,610
even recreate visualizations, we need to understand data and data types.

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,240
Almost anything can be turned into data.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,260
Let's take a look at a well noted graphic, and see its data types.

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:18,770
This visualization comes from Hans Rothstein's work with global health data.

6
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,920
If you have five minutes, I highly encourage you to watch Hans narrate

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,430
this visualization in the video linked in the instructor notes.

8
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,660
Han gives a charismatic performance that makes this data come alive.

9
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:32,450
Now, I want to highlight the different data types that can be found in

10
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,980
this visualization.

11
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,150
Let's start with the quantitative data, or

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,170
any variables that have exact numbers.

13
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:44,538
These include variables like life expectancy,

14
00:00:44,538 --> 00:00:50,110
income per person, total population, and year.

15
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,865
Quantitative data can be discreet or

16
00:00:51,865 --> 00:00:56,950
continuous, and typically, variables that are countable are considered discreet.

17
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,930
In this case, total population would be considered a discreet variable,

18
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,730
while income per person would be a continuous variable.

19
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:08,370
Another data type that appears in this visualization is categorical data.

20
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,890
Nominal data is a way of labelling or categorizing the data into groups.

21
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,749
In this case, the countries of the world are grouped into regions.

22
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,590
The Americas are colored yellow, and sub-Saharan Africa is colored blue.

23
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,586
Categorical data may take on numerical values, but

24
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:30,093
these numerical values won't necessarily carry any mathematical meaning.

25
00:01:30,093 --> 00:01:34,300
One final type of data not shown in this visualization, is ordered data.

26
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,770
Ordered data is similar to categorical data,

27
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,390
except that the categories are ordered or ranked in some particular way.

28
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,970
One example would be is if I took the populations of each country, and

29
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,420
then split them up into bins.

30
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,250
For example, I could have four groups where each of the countries falls into

31
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:56,500
a population bin if their population is between 0 and 10 million, 10 and

32
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:01,410
100 million, 100 and 500 million, or greater than 500 million.

33
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:06,130
In this example, we're pretty much just taking quantitative data, and

34
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,490
splitting it into groups.

35
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:11,140
So we have bins or categories of other types of data.

36
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,530
A slightly different example would be class difficulty, such as beginner,

37
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,400
intermediate, and advanced.

38
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,010
Those three types of classes would be a way that we could label the classes, and

39
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,270
they have a natural order in increasing difficulty.

40
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,180
As data scientists, it's important for

41
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,370
us to know that each of these data types can be encoded visually.

42
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,541
And in the next few videos, we'll dive into how we can make

43
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:37,972
appropriate choices for visual encodings, based on the different data types.

44
00:02:37,972 --> 00:02:40,469
This was just a brief overview of data types.

45
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:43,861
And if these concepts are still a bit fuzzy for you, we recommend that you

46
00:02:43,861 --> 00:02:47,940
watch the three videos from the Instructional Data Science class.

47
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,150
These videos are linked in the instructor notes.
