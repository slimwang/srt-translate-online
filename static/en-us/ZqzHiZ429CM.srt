1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,565
Let's do the first step together, of
adding a new method to the MainActivity.

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,390
You can pick anywhere in
the file to add your method,

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,100
as long as it's outside of
the braces of a different method.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,230
I'm just going to add it right
below the other method we defined,

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,300
which was calculatePrice.

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,530
I'm going to say private for the access
modifier, because the only things

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,960
that need to access this method
are within the main activity.

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,060
Then I'm going to say,
string for the return type,

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,550
because the createOrderSummary
method should return a string.

10
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,665
And then the name of the method
is createOrderSummary.

11
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,940
And then it should take as input
a price, which is a number.

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,890
Okay so
we got the method signature done, but

13
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,060
now we have to implement the method so
that it returns this message.

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:52,040
The message starts with the name,
a quantity, a total and then, thank you.

15
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,580
So, I'm going to go ahead and
copy this and then,

16
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,590
I'm going to paste it in
the createOrderSummary method.

17
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:00,120
Now, we can start with some base code.

18
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,150
The difference though is now,

19
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:05,090
the order summary should start with
a name, not with the total price.

20
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:08,890
So, I'm going to move this to
the next line and save it for later.

21
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,359
I'm going to initialize the price
message variable to Name, and

22
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:14,580
then Kaptain Kunal.

23
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,660
And then, on the next line,
I'm going to update the price message.

24
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,025
I'm going to append to
the existing message, so

25
00:01:22,025 --> 00:01:26,485
I'll say price message, plus,
and then the new text, and

26
00:01:26,485 --> 00:01:31,115
I want to add quantity and
then add the quantity variable.

27
00:01:32,265 --> 00:01:34,095
Since quantity is a global variable,

28
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:36,745
we should be able to access
it within this method.

29
00:01:36,745 --> 00:01:39,340
Okay, so now we have name and quantity.

30
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:44,020
On the next line I'm going to
update the priceMessage again and

31
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,940
add some more text.

32
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,700
Actually this text is supposed
to be the total price, so

33
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,270
I can just use what we had before.

34
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:55,080
Okay, and then on the last line
we update the priceMessage again.

35
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,639
Take the existing value of that string
and then add, Thank you!, to it.

36
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,210
This all looks good, but
there's still an error here.

37
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,260
And it says missing return statement.

38
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,090
Since we're supposed to be
returning a summary string,

39
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,370
then I need to add another line
of code that says, return.

40
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,240
And then the return value.

41
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,210
In this case the return
value is priceMessage.

42
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,630
And I add a semicolon at the end too.

43
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,440
Okay, now the error's gone.

44
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,150
It looks like our code is good, so
I'm going to run it and test it.

45
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,300
Okay, so now if I change
the quantity to three, and

46
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,930
I hit the order button, it doesn't work.

47
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,320
Let's see what's wrong.

48
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,260
Looking at the code more closely,
I see what the problem is.

49
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,660
There's a warning here that says that
the private method createOrderSummary

50
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,730
is never used.

51
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,100
I forgot to call it.

52
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,450
Let's go back to the quiz slide.

53
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,910
Okay, so we did the first task
successfully but now I have to

54
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,010
call the createOrderSummary method
from the submitOrder method.

55
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,300
Going back to Android Studio,
I need to fix the submitOrder method.

56
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,300
I've calculated the price,
which is correct.

57
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,320
But now I have to pass it into
the createOrderSummary method.

58
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,860
So I'm going to do that right
here createOrderSummary with

59
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,690
the price variable.

60
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,340
The return value of this method
is going to get stored in

61
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,380
the priceMessage variable.

62
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,190
I don't need this line of
code anymore because "Thank

63
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,260
you" is already in the text down here.

64
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,680
So I can delete that.

65
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,800
And then to update the screen all I
have to do is call displayMessage with

66
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,230
the priceMessage variable like before.

67
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,410
And now let's try to run the app again.

68
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,370
If I change the quantity to three and

69
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,930
I hit the order button,
it's still not working.

70
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,970
Most of the text is on one line when
it should be on multiple lines, so

71
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,210
let's go back and fix our code.

72
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:40,650
Looking at this code I realize that
I forgot the new line character.

73
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,950
I added it properly for
Thank you but not for the others.

74
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,340
So I'm going to add it
to the other lines now.

75
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,230
Okay, let's try to run it again.

76
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,600
And it works.

77
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,830
Awesome.

78
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,050
Now Kaptain Kunal can have
his three cups of coffee.

79
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:59,670
I want to show you some other
optimizations you can do to your code.

80
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,530
Notice that you could have called
the calculatePrice method within

81
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:07,170
the createOrderSummary method instead
of passing it in as an input parameter.

82
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,420
So you could have done
calculatePrice right here.

83
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,880
That would have worked as well.

84
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,250
But I wanted to show you that you can
take the output of one method and

85
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,370
pass it as input to another method.

86
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,040
So we'll leave it as we had it before.

87
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,874
Within the createOrderSummary method,

88
00:04:23,874 --> 00:04:27,920
the other thing I would have
done is use the += operator.

89
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,240
This is shorthand, and

90
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:35,070
it means the same thing as priceMessage
= priceMessage + all of this.

91
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:40,660
So if I change all of this to be +=, it
will be the same as what I had before.

92
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,680
This just requires less typing so
your code is more concise.

93
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,120
In the calculatePrice method,

94
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,160
the other thing I would've
done is just return the value

95
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,030
immediately instead of storing it in
a local variable and then returning it.

96
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,840
This also leads to more concise code.

97
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,340
And then up here, in the submitOrder
method, instead of creating the order

98
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,880
summary and storing it in a variable and
then using it right after, I could have

99
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,960
just called createOrderSummary and
then call displayMessage on that.

100
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,290
This leads to the same thing.

101
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,590
The return value of the
createOrderSummary method is a string,

102
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:19,190
and that will get passed as an input
argument to the displayMessage method.

103
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,410
You can leave it like this if you want,
if it's easier to read.

104
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,630
All of these tips and
tricks lead to the same logic anyways.

105
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,290
And before I forget, also remember
to add a Javadoc comment at

106
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:33,680
the top of this method to describe
what it's supposed to be doing.

107
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,821
Technically you don't need a Javadoc
comment for a private method, but

108
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:39,449
it's just good practice to write
a description of a method so

109
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:42,437
that other people who are reading
your code will also understand what

110
00:05:42,437 --> 00:05:44,380
you're trying to do.

111
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:48,002
The description of this method is that
it creates a summary of the order.

112
00:05:48,002 --> 00:05:51,560
The input parameter as the price of the
order, and it returns the text summary.
