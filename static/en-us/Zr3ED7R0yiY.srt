00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,972
Well, nearsightedness focuses the image somewhere around here in front of the

2
00:00:03,972 --> 00:00:09,150
retina. I know it doesn't focus on the retina, because that's perfect vision.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,660
So, it has to be here, behind the retina.

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,188
>> Exactly Lauren, and this happens when the retina doesn't bend the light far

5
00:00:15,188 --> 00:00:19,192
enough. So, we have a situation something like this. Of course the light

6
00:00:19,192 --> 00:00:22,970
doesn't actually go back behind the retina, gets collected here. But this is

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,719
where it would be focused.
