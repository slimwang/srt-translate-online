1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,477
It would take Lucy 2 hours, and Javier 3 hours. Great thinking if you found

2
00:00:04,477 --> 00:00:08,799
these numbers. We want to keep in mind that t represents the number of hours it

3
00:00:08,799 --> 00:00:14,298
takes for Lucy to mow the yard alone. So when we solve for t in this equation,

4
00:00:14,298 --> 00:00:19,690
we'll find Lucy's time. To begin solving this equation, we want to multiply

5
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:25,700
through by the LCD, which is 1 and 2 10ths times t times t plus 1. It's the

6
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,950
product of these 3 denominators since they're all different and the greatest

7
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:33,530
common factor is 1. When we multiply through by the LCD, we'll see that the

8
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:39,350
factors cancel. The t's will cancel. The quantity t plus 1 will reduce to 1.

9
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:44,480
And then number 1.2 or 1 and 2 10ths reduces to 1 as well. This leaves us with

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,813
1 and 2 10ths times t plus 1 here. 1 and 2 10th here and the quantity, t plus 1

11
00:00:49,813 --> 00:00:55,477
times t here. We'll distribute the 1 and 2 10th and the t to the terms to get

12
00:00:55,477 --> 00:01:00,386
this equation. Then we'll combine the like terms on the left hand side to get 2

13
00:01:00,386 --> 00:01:06,880
and 4 10th times t, plus 1 and 2 10th equals t squared plus 2. To get rid of

14
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,480
these decimals, we'll multiply through by 10. So we'll have 24t plus 12 equals

15
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,766
10t squared plus 10t. Now we have a quadratic equation that we can try and

16
00:01:17,766 --> 00:01:21,555
factor. We want to move all of these terms to the right hand side and then see

17
00:01:21,555 --> 00:01:27,173
if we can factor. So, subtracting 24t and 12, we'll get 10t squared, minus 14t,

18
00:01:27,173 --> 00:01:34,708
minus 12 on the right hand side of our equation. And we'll get 0 on the left. I

19
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:38,410
notice that all of these terms are even. So I can divide my entire equation by

20
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:44,472
2. 0 divided by 2 is 0. And then I divide each of these terms by 2. From this

21
00:01:44,472 --> 00:01:49,282
quadratic equation, we use factoring by grouping to get the factors of 5t plus

22
00:01:49,282 --> 00:01:55,174
3, and t minus 2. We set each of these factors equal to zero and then we solve

23
00:01:55,174 --> 00:01:59,880
for the values of t. We find that t can equal positive 2, or t can equal

24
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,880
negative 3 5ths. We know that t represents the time for Lucy to mow the yard so

25
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,259
we don't want to use this negative value, it wouldn't make sense here. Instead,

26
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:14,519
we'll use t equals 2. So, she takes 2 hours to mow the yard. If we remember,

27
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:18,299
Javier's time was t plus 1, he took an hour longer than Lucy, so this would

28
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:24,588
mean he would mow the yard in 3 hours. We just needed to add 1 on to Lucy's

29
00:02:24,588 --> 00:02:25,590
time.
