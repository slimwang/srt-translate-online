1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,788
If a quadratic equation is in this form, we can simply divide both sides by a,

2
00:00:03,788 --> 00:00:09,040
and then take the square root of both sides to find x. If we divide both sides

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,950
by a, we'll get x squared is equal to c divided by a. And now we take the

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,975
square root of both sides. When we take the square root of both sides, we need

5
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,450
to add a plus or minus symbol in front of the side that doesn't have a

6
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:24,911
variable. And here's why we include this plus or minus sign. Think about if I

7
00:00:24,911 --> 00:00:29,642
had x squared equals 1. I know there are really two values that make this true.

8
00:00:29,642 --> 00:00:35,850
Positive 1 squared would equal 1, and negative 1 squared would also equal 1.

9
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,805
This means when we solve and take the square root of both sides. We need to add

10
00:00:39,805 --> 00:00:42,977
the plus or minus symbol to account for both the positive and the negative

11
00:00:42,977 --> 00:00:48,360
answer. The square root of x squared is x and the square root of 1 is 1. So

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,680
really x could be positive 1 like we thought or x could equal negative 1. So

13
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,618
you see if you can use the square root method. Try solving this equation by

14
00:00:57,618 --> 00:00:59,170
following these steps.
