You already know the results from your ANOVA table, sum of squares for between

2
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:08,983
group variability is 54, and we divide by 54 plus 6, which is the total sum of

3
00:00:08,983 --> 00:00:17,395
squares. 54 divided by 60 is 0.9. This is actually pretty huge. 90% of the

4
00:00:17,395 --> 00:00:23,294
differences in the amount eaten is due to the differences in food types. The

5
00:00:23,294 --> 00:00:28,486
other 10% remains unexplained. It could be because of the individual cows, how

6
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:34,493
hungry they happen to be that day or something else. The statistician Jacob

7
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:40,691
Cohen said that anything bigger than 0.14 is considered big. So 0.9 is pretty

8
00:00:40,691 --> 00:00:41,630
big.
