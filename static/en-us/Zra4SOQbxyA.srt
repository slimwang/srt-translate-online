Okay. Let's get back to our original problem on cellular division. I wanted to

2
00:00:03,857 --> 00:00:07,689
know how many cells would there be after seven rounds of division. Remember, I

3
00:00:07,702 --> 00:00:11,532
started with one cell, and that split into two cells. You can draw a diagram to

4
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:15,371
model this out, or you can just use an exponent. So, if I started with one cell

5
00:00:15,461 --> 00:00:19,347
and had seven rounds of division, each cell doubled, how many cells would there

6
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,240
be? You can put your answer in this box.
