1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,400
Now I want you to apply
the lower bound on congestion,

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,750
consider this list of networks.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,110
For each network I give you
the network's diameter, the network's

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,990
bisection width, and the number of
links in the network assuming p nodes.

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,310
Now suppose you wish to map a logical
network onto a physical one.

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,970
Here's a list of pairs of mappings.

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,930
The pairs go from logical
on the left hand side,

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,900
to physical on the right hand side.

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,240
My question is, which of the following
pairs would you expect that it might

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,860
be possible to have no congestion,
assuming the lower bound analysis?
