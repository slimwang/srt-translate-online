1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,440
Let's revisit the Android flavor
app from the last lesson.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,320
So if we can understand how the Android
flavor app displays an image

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,350
per list item, then we can do
something similar in our Miwok app.

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,070
Now let's get started by taking
a look at the adapter class,

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,720
which is used to control
how list items appear.

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,270
So to help us out,
I'm going to type T on my keyboard, and

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,930
that triggers the file finder in GitHub.

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:25,155
I'm going to search up adapter, and it
looks like here, there's a file called

9
00:00:25,155 --> 00:00:29,320
Android flavor adapter, which sounds
really similar to our word adapter.

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,171
Now, taking a look closer at this file,
it looks like it does also extend from

11
00:00:33,171 --> 00:00:37,024
the ArrayAdapter class, but here,
instead of holding word objects like our

12
00:00:37,024 --> 00:00:41,023
word adapter does, the Android flavor
adapter holds Android flavor objects.

13
00:00:41,023 --> 00:00:44,238
So skimming down the code,
we get to the getView method call, and

14
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:47,035
all of this looks similar
to our word adapter class.

15
00:00:47,035 --> 00:00:50,705
And down here, there's some
code related to the ImageView.

16
00:00:50,705 --> 00:00:54,171
So here in this first line,
we're searching through the listItemView

17
00:00:54,171 --> 00:00:56,840
layout to find the view
with the ID list_item_icon.

18
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,910
When we find that view,
we cast it to an ImageView and

19
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,580
then store it in a variable called icon.

20
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,997
After that, we can call
the setImageResource method on that

21
00:01:06,997 --> 00:01:11,352
ImageView, and into this method, we pass
in an input of the image resource ID

22
00:01:11,352 --> 00:01:13,230
from the AndroidFlavor object.

23
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:18,820
So these two lines of code sets the
right dessert image on the list item.

24
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,340
Let's take this information and
do something similar in our Miwok app.

25
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,430
So here we are in the Miwok app.

26
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,405
Now in the getView method
of our WordAdapter,

27
00:01:26,405 --> 00:01:28,950
let's find the imageView
in the list item layout.

28
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,010
Here in this line, I search for
the listItemView layout for

29
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,220
the view with the ID image.

30
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,430
Once I find it, I store the view
in a variable called ImageView.

31
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,900
Now do you remember where we
assigned this view ID image?

32
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,790
Well, it was back here
in the list item layout.

33
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:48,300
So remember that we assigned the view
IDImage to the ImageView here?

34
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,090
Now let's go back to
the WordAdapter class.

35
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,180
Once we have the ImageView Java object,
we can call a setImageResource method on

36
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,126
it, just like we saw in
the Android flavor app.

37
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:03,400
Now in that method, we need to pass
the ImageResourceId as its input.

38
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,648
And luckily, we can get that from the
current word object by simply calling

39
00:02:06,648 --> 00:02:09,199
the getImageResourceId method.

40
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,410
Great, so
those were all the changes we needed.

41
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,400
And let's run the app on our device now.

42
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,370
So tapping through each activity,

43
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,660
we can see the proper images
loaded into our list view.

44
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,350
And it's looking really good.

45
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,690
And as we expected,
the Phrases activity looks broken.

46
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,140
So we're going to fix that
in the next exercise.
