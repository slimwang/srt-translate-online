Hi, welcome to the coding portion of lesson five.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,980
Your Conference Central application is now in full swing,

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,970
you can save conference and profile entities all day

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:14,180
and all night long if you want to. However, every

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,140
hit to the data store counts against your application's

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,540
daily quota. The good thing is that you can

7
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,660
use Memcache to save your entity data to reduce

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,000
the hits to the data store. In this lesson you're

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,510
going to find out just how easy it is

10
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,150
to save your entities data in memcache using objectify.

11
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,980
In fact, it's so easy that you're going to do

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,260
another exercise to use underlying Java data store API

13
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,660
to put values into Memcache and to get them

14
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,290
back out. We're going to create announcements about conferences

15
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,450
that are nearly sold out, and store those announcements

16
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,190
in Memcache. There's no need to save the announcements

17
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,750
in the datastore, because they're so transient in nature.

18
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,650
Another thing your going to do is use task cues.

19
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:00,350
So that your application can so work in the

20
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,315
background. You're going to use task queues to send conformation

21
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:08,080
email anytime anybody creates a new conference. To wrap

22
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,460
it all up, we'll set up a cron job to

23
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,160
periodically check for conference that have nearly sold out

24
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,350
and update the announcement in Memcache. Let's get to it.
