1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,103
In an equation like this, in order to calculate the value of y, we need to pick

2
00:00:05,103 --> 00:00:10,049
a value of x to plug in to the right side. And then that, in turn, will tell us

3
00:00:10,049 --> 00:00:14,430
what y is equal to. Now, of course you can always rearrange equations and solve

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:18,274
for x instead, but we tend to write equations like this when we've assigned

5
00:00:18,274 --> 00:00:22,180
variables in such a way that y is generally what we're going to be looking for

6
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:26,827
and x is more what we're given. So, for example in the situations we've talked

7
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:30,670
about, the independent variable has been things like time, a sort of more

8
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,891
fundamental quality, and the dependent variable has been things like number of

9
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:40,242
sodas spit out, or height of a throw. Overall in the natural state of things, y

10
00:00:40,242 --> 00:00:42,802
is going to be determined by x.
