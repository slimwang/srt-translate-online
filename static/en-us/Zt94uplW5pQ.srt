00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,666
Now I want to switch gears and talk about machine translation between two natural languages.

2
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:12,499
Here we have Spanish translated into English, and we talked about this a little bit at the beginning of the class

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:19,099
where we showed the Chinese menu and talked about how we could learn from data as represented in the menu

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,932
to learn a model of transfer from one language to another.

5
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:29,099
Now we have more tools at our disposal, and we can think about the transfer at multiple levels.

6
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:37,266
So it could be at the word by word transfer, and we could say, "What's the probability that 'tomorrow' would be chosen

7
00:00:37,267 --> 00:00:44,799
"as a translation of mañana?" and we could build a table of those types of word by word probabilities.

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:53,899
Or we could move up a level to the phrase level and talk about phrases like "lojare" as a phrase,

9
00:00:53,900 --> 00:01:05,432
and consider multiple phrases at a time, "I will do it tomorrow," or we could go up to the level of syntax.

10
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:14,699
So we have words here, phrases here, trees here, and we could think about a syntactic tree,

11
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:23,532
"I" being a noun phrase, which is part of a sentence, and then the verb phrase being "will" and so on.

12
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:33,332
Just as we talked about the probability of word for word or phrase for phrase, we can talk about the probability

13
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:39,732
of a tree in English corresponding to a similar tree in Spanish.

14
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:47,432
And I won't spell it all out there. And we also have the option to go up even higher into the level of meaning or semantics,

15
00:01:47,433 --> 00:01:53,699
and try to understand what it is what this sentence means, and have some representation of,

16
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:06,832
say this is "doing action" and "time is equal to mañana" and so on, and transfer that into a corresponding meaning in English.

17
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:10,032
And from there, generate out the words.

18
00:02:10,032 --> 00:02:17,899
And so this whole structure, as we go up, we have multiple levels at which we can deal with the translation.

19
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:28,032
And this has been called a pyramid. It's known as Valcroix's Pyramid after a linguist called Bernard Valcroix.

20
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:32,366
And we can do the translation at any level or at multiple levels.

21
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:38,166
And I'm going to show you a little bit more closely about how to do it, concentrating at the phrase level.

22
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:45,500
But I should say that modern translation systems do use multiple levels, including the syntactic level.
