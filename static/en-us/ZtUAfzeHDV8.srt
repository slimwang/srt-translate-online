1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,811
It turns out that it depends. Let's see why. We saw earlier that Carnival

2
00:00:04,811 --> 00:00:09,566
charges $10 for a registration fee, and $10 per hour for renting the car.

3
00:00:09,566 --> 00:00:14,612
Rent-a-car charges $30 for a registration fee, and $6 per hour, or x, that we

4
00:00:14,612 --> 00:00:19,247
rent the car. This would be the total cost. Let's see a table of values and

5
00:00:19,247 --> 00:00:23,688
these two equations graphs. Here are our two equations and the lines for our

6
00:00:23,688 --> 00:00:28,089
graph. And here's a table of values. X was the number of hours of renting the

7
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:32,436
car, and this y represents the cost for a Carnival car rental. The second y

8
00:00:32,436 --> 00:00:37,150
represents the cost for a Rent-a-Car, car rental. We can see at one hour, that

9
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:42,363
Rent-a-car cost more than Carnival. We also see that on the graph. Rent-a-car

10
00:00:42,363 --> 00:00:47,347
cost $36, and Carnival costs $20. In this region of the graph, we can see that

11
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:52,660
Carnival is the better option. It's cheaper, or the costs, the y value, is below

12
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:57,222
that of Rent-a-car. But, we can see at other times, like 7 hours, that

13
00:00:57,222 --> 00:01:02,319
Rent-a-Car is the better option. It's cheaper. We also see that on our graph.

14
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:07,584
Rent-a-car cost $72, and Carnival cost $80. So, it depends. Carnival is usually

15
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:12,666
better for the shorter car rentals, and Rent-a-Car is better for the longer car

16
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:13,315
rentals.
