00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:04,965
What can we say about these numbers in our table? Well, we said that the x

2
00:00:04,965 --> 00:00:09,554
values are increasing by one, as we move down the list. But, what about the

3
00:00:09,554 --> 00:00:13,598
values of f of x? Please to complete this sentence, to say what's going on with

4
00:00:13,598 --> 00:00:18,674
those numbers on the right side of the table. As x increases by one, f of x

5
00:00:18,674 --> 00:00:23,838
does one of these things by some number.
