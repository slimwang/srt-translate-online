1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,569
Let's go through these 1 by 1. So first, x cubed plus 6y squared. We want to

2
00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:09,637
start by finding the degree of each term. So the degree of this first one is 3

3
00:00:09,746 --> 00:00:14,842
and the second term is 2. Since we have exponents of 3 and 2, respectively. 3 is

4
00:00:14,854 --> 00:00:21,086
greater than 2. So this is a third degree polynomial. Next 7 minus 3x plus 8x

5
00:00:21,086 --> 00:00:30,008
cubed y. You have degrees of 0, 1, and 4 since we have 3 plus the invisible 1 on

6
00:00:30,008 --> 00:00:34,345
this y equals 4. 4 is definitely the largest of these three numbers so this

7
00:00:34,345 --> 00:00:38,795
polynomial is of degree 4. So we can do the same thing for the last two

8
00:00:38,795 --> 00:00:41,971
polynomials as well. One interesting thing to note is that the degree of a

9
00:00:41,971 --> 00:00:46,033
polynomial is usually information that comes from just one term in the

10
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:50,234
expression, the term with the highest degree. But in some cases, like in this

11
00:00:50,246 --> 00:00:53,997
last example, might have more than one term that's of the same degree. So for

12
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:57,996
example, here we have x squared which is a second degree term and z squared

13
00:00:58,008 --> 00:01:02,262
which is also a second degree term. Having 2 terms of the same degree. Doesn't

14
00:01:02,274 --> 00:01:06,261
change what the highest degree we see here is. We just happen to see that

15
00:01:06,273 --> 00:01:10,504
highest degree twice. We still follow the typical rule and say that this is a

16
00:01:10,516 --> 00:01:11,763
polynomial of degree 2.
