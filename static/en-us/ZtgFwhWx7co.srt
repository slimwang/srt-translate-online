1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,340
Sometimes we may want to shape bursty

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:07,560
traffic patterns allowing for bursts to be sent

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,420
on the network, but still ensuring that the

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,370
flow does not exceed some average rate. For

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:19,550
this we might use what's called a token bucket. In a token bucket, Tokens arrive

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:26,280
in a bucket at a rate Rho, and Beta is again the capacity of the bucket.

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,010
Now, traffic may arrive an an average rate Lambda

8
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,520
average, and a peak rate Lambda peak. Traffic can

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,710
be sent by the regulator as long as there

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,610
are tokens in the bucket. To consider the difference

11
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:41,390
between a token bucket and a leaky bucket, consider

12
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,460
sending a packet of size B That's less than

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,200
beta. If, the token bucket is full. Packet is

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,420
sent, and b tokens are removed. If the bucket is

15
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,520
empty though, the packet must wait until b tokens drip into the bucket. If the

16
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,570
bucket is partially full. Well, then it depends. If the number of tokens In the

17
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,519
bucket exceed little b then the packet

18
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,660
is sent immediately, othewise we have to wait

19
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,850
until there are little b tokens in the bucket before we can send the packet.
