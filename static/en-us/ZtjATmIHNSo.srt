00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Peter] So the simplest way to solve this problem is going to be

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
by introducing a variable.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's call it "first_zip."

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
To find the first_zip, it's going to be pretty straightforward,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and it's going to give us the location of the first zip.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Now we want to print out the second one,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
so let's write "print."

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We're going to do text.find again, searching for zip,

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
but this time we're going to start from the first_zip +1.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If we didn't start from +1,

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
we would get the result of first_zip again,

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and that wouldn't tell us anything about a location of a second zip.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This is one way to solve the problem using a second variable.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Another way to do this without introducing a new variable

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
is to simply put text.find right where we had first_zip before.
