00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,360
Now that we have seen some examples of semantic networks,

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,000
let us try to characterize semantic networks as a knowledgeable presentation.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,660
A knowledgeable presentation, will have a lexicon. That tells us

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,100
something about the vocabulary of the presentation language. A structure

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:23,340
which tells us about how the words of that vocabulary can be composed together

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:29,270
into complex representations and the semantics which tells us how

7
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:35,360
the representation allows us to draw inferences so that we can in fact reason.

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,360
In case of semantic network the basic lexicon consists of nodes that

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,100
capture objects. So, x, y, z. What about this structural specification?

10
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,300
Structural specification here consists of links which have directions.

11
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:54,810
These links capture relationships and allows to compose these notes together

12
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,480
into complex representations. What about the semantics? In case of semantics,

13
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,070
we are going to put labels on these links which are then going to

14
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,070
allow us to do, draw inferences and do reasoning over these representations.
