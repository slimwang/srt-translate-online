00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,663
So, here are the answers. In this first part of the graph, we're moving down as

2
00:00:04,663 --> 00:00:09,212
x goes up, so the graph is decreasing. Then f of x starts to increase again as

3
00:00:09,212 --> 00:00:13,972
we continue to move to the right, so this must be increasing. Then the value of

4
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:18,372
g of x doesn't change at all as we go here, so it must be constant. Moving up

5
00:00:18,372 --> 00:00:23,100
again means we're increasing. And then lastly moving down means decreasing.
