1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,936
So if we repeatedly sounded the tone over and over and did not follow it with

2
00:00:03,936 --> 00:00:09,042
meat powder, we would see the process of extinction. Eventually the dog would

3
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:13,348
start to salivate less, and then he would stop salivating all together. Here we

4
00:00:13,348 --> 00:00:18,404
could say the classically conditioned response has been extinguished. However,

5
00:00:18,404 --> 00:00:22,184
if we wait 2 weeks, and we come into the lab and we present the conditioned

6
00:00:22,184 --> 00:00:28,650
stimulus, or we sound the tone, we see then the dog, in fact, will salivate.

7
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,373
That salivation is termed spontaneous recovery. Spontaneous recovery happens

8
00:00:33,373 --> 00:00:37,468
when a previously conditioned response has been extinguished, and it occurs

9
00:00:37,468 --> 00:00:43,113
again when the conditioned stimulus is presented at a later time. So let's take

10
00:00:43,113 --> 00:00:47,343
a look at how these last 3 terms in classical conditioning. Aquisition,

11
00:00:47,343 --> 00:00:50,800
extinction, and spontaneous recovery occur.
