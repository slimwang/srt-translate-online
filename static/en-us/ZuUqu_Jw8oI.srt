1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,410
Here's the answer I came up with.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:06,770
The actor wants to maximize
the number of burned calories and

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:08,960
he burns 12 calories for

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,470
every minute of step-aerobics and
four for every minute of stretching.

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,840
He can't spend more
than 40 minutes total.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,720
So I expressed that constraint by
saying that x + y is at most 40.

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,037
And expressing that he has to
spend five minutes stretching,

8
00:00:25,037 --> 00:00:29,790
is a little unintuitive because of
the way the inequality is directed here.

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:36,820
But I can do it by saying that
-y is at most -5, like so.

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:41,940
Using the graph and check method of your
high school teacher, gives the optimum

11
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:48,530
solution as 35 minutes of step
aerobics and 5 minutes of stretching.

12
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,100
Now you probably didn't bother graphing
the polytope as I've done here.

13
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,050
The answer was too obvious.

14
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,940
But why was it so obvious?

15
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,150
Maybe you realized that more exercise
was better, and started thinking about

16
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:05,030
constraints somewhere along here,
that used up all 40 minutes.

17
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,770
Because step-aerobics
burn more calories,

18
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,460
you realize that you would want to
do as many of them as possible,

19
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,580
pulling you along this constraint,
downward towards this vertex.

20
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,500
Or maybe you realized that just
five minutes of stretching, and

21
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,280
zero minutes of step aerobics
would satisfy the constraints.

22
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,430
And then you decided to
increase the number of minutes

23
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,940
spent on step aerobics,
until you ran into another constraint.

24
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,890
Another case, your intuition led you
to think very much along the lines of

25
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,290
the simplex method,
that we'll see in a little bit.
