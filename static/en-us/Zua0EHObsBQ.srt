1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,350
So a variety of proposals have been made.

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:07,220
Most famous is by, Edwin Land, actually, and it's called now the Retinex Theory.

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,160
He had a variety of, ways of going about this but

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,340
overall the whole process is called the Retinex Theory.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,110
This was Edwin Land, a remarkable inventor.

6
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,470
He was the inventor of the Polaroid Land camera.

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,400
So he originally was doing, polarized filters, and

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,960
Polaroid the company got started and he was part of that.

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,960
And then when, they invented, he invented the instant film it wasn't enough to

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,700
call it the Polaroid Camera, it was actually called the Polaroid Land Camera.

11
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:35,920
He was incredibly industrious, and har, driven, and driving kind of guy.

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,630
He used to give really interesting,

13
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:42,270
remarkable demonstrations of humans perceiving different lightness, using.

14
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,610
In fact, he had this really cool way, he could show an image of just one color.

15
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,330
Kind of, this pink, with these different squares.

16
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:51,560
And then a, a greyscale image, of, also, different squares, and overlay them.

17
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,270
And humans would see color.

18
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,750
And it was, it was remarkable.

19
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,160
I had the opportunity to see him,

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,640
when I was still a graduate student in Cambridge.

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,120
And he's kind of giving this talk, and

22
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,840
then also shows this thing, and these colors appear.

23
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,489
And the whole audience broke out in applause, it was kind of cool.

24
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,250
Anyway, Land, invented, or, or, or put forward a, a variety of what's re, called

25
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,550
the retinex theory, and I'll give you just the general idea of how that works.

26
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:18,940
So the goal, is to remove the slowly vary, it's the slow variations in

27
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,590
the image, and there are a variety of ways of doing it.

28
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,276
One approach, that I'll show you in just a minute.

29
00:01:23,276 --> 00:01:29,753
Is to, if L is equal to the product of R times E,

30
00:01:29,753 --> 00:01:34,747
then if I take the log of both sides.

31
00:01:34,747 --> 00:01:39,220
So, obviously, the log of multiplication is just the sum of the logs, right?

32
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,220
And then what you're going to do is we're going to, and

33
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,080
I'll show you this in a minute, we're going to hi-pass filter this,

34
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,820
only keep the high frequency.

35
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,470
And then we're going to threshold to remove.

36
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,250
Any of those low frequencies.

37
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,150
And then we're going to invert it to get back the, actual reflectance.

38
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,640
So let me show you what that looks like
