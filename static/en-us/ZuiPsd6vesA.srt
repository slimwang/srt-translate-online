00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,200
Well, Sam, I want to say thank you. I feel like I've learned a lot

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,440
and I have built a really cool app,

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,880
and it's on my phone. that's pretty exciting.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,440
>> Yeah.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,350
>> I guess, all that stuff we learned about. All the workflows, the

6
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,480
approvals, the, you know, dashboards and charts. Is that all in the phone too?

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,510
>> Yeah. So everything we built today is totally accounted

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,440
for and works both in the desktop or mobile app.

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:24,720
>> Cool.

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,610
>> So you simultaneously

11
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:26,750
built two apps today.

12
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,830
>> That's really awesome. I guess my last

13
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,400
question is where do I go from here?

14
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,400
I mean, I'm hooked. I'm into this. I want to build more stuff. What should I do?

15
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,120
So I mean, we've only scratched the surface

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,870
of stuff that you can do with point and

17
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,450
click tools, so you can learn a little

18
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,450
bit more about what else we could do there.

19
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,540
>> Mm-hm. you could maybe read about Apex and Visual Force,

20
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,130
and you know, get into the programmatic code side of things.

21
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,710
>> Okay. Or you could take the

22
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,720
skills that we've learned today and then build your app. What do you want to do?

23
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,100
>> Let's do that. I want to build another app. Alright, let's do it.

24
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:02,110
>> Congratulations. You created an app and you went mobile. It's pretty

25
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:05,600
exciting. But really, it's just the tip of the iceberg, there's so

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,470
much more you can do in Salesforce. I'm really excited to see

27
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:13,940
what you're going to do in your final project. Are you ready to start?
