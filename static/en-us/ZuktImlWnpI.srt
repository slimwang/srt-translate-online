00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's get 1 more view into how this relationship

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
between grammars and parsing states plays out.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I've written a new grammar over here on the left,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
but actually if you think about it, it's simpler than our old grammars.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Since this one isn't recursive, there are only a finite number of strings in the language--

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
INT + string and INT alone.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's say that the full input is going to be INT + INT,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
which is not in the language of the grammar,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
but thus far, we've only seen a single token--INT.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Our parser has to handle good input and also malformed input.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Not everything out there on the web is super clean.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We're going to want to write a web browser that can tell the difference between

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
the good and the bad, the wheat and the chaff.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So what I'd like you to do is figure out after just 1 token of the input,

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
what are some parse states we could be in?

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I've listed 7 possible parse states in this multiple multiple-choice quiz.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I would like you to check each one if we could be in it, after seeing only 1 token of this input.
