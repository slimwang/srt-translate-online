00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,625
Let's have a quiz on this.

2
00:00:01,625 --> 00:00:04,917
If all memcpys and kernel launch operations in the below code snippets

3
00:00:04,917 --> 00:00:07,571
take exactly 1 second to complete,

4
00:00:07,571 --> 00:00:10,644
what is the minimum time taken before the results are available on the host?

5
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:12,527
So here's the code snippets.

6
00:00:12,527 --> 00:00:15,739
We'll start by declaring a couple of cudaStreams, s1 and s2,

7
00:00:15,739 --> 00:00:21,644
and by using the cudaStreamCreate call to create streams with those stream objects.

8
00:00:21,644 --> 00:00:23,961
And then there's are a bunch of code snippets,

9
00:00:23,961 --> 00:00:28,110
and I want you to tell me how long each one is going to take, in seconds.

10
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,107
I've taken a couple of shortcuts here.

11
00:00:30,107 --> 00:00:35,215
I haven't showed you d array, h array, d array 1, h array 1, 2.

12
00:00:35,215 --> 00:00:37,302
I haven't showed you these things getting allocated.

13
00:00:37,302 --> 00:00:40,770
You can assume that d_arr has been allocated with cudaMalloc

14
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,635
and it is a pointer to some device memory

15
00:00:43,635 --> 00:00:50,010
and that h_arr has been allocated in pinned host memory using cudaHostMalloc.

16
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,889
And for a shorthand, I just abbreviated CUDA host to device as H2D

17
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:57,771
and CUDA device to host as D2H.

18
00:00:57,771 --> 00:01:02,242
Notice that I'm launching a single block with a fairly small number of threads

19
00:01:02,242 --> 00:01:04,474
in each of these thread launches.

20
00:01:04,474 --> 00:01:07,175
So if all of these operations take 1 second,

21
00:01:07,175 --> 00:01:11,248
what's the minimum time that each of them can take to complete?

22
00:01:11,248 --> 00:01:15,105
What's the minimum time that it will be before the final results are ready for the host?
