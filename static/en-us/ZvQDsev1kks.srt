1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,890
The question that we are, for that matter, Alice, Bob, and Carol were stuck with

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,550
at the end of the previous unit was that they had only been able to find

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,740
exponential time algorithms for these 3 problems here,

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,760
and those algorithms did not show any acceptable running time.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,400
So the question they were stuck with is, did they just not think hard enough

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,180
to find good algorithms for their problems, or are their problems intractable,

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,940
which would mean that it's not even possible or at least highly unlikely

8
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,369
to find a polynomial time algorithm for those problems?

9
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,390
And this is what we'll investigate further in this unit.

10
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:40,240
And I'm not yet going to reveal the answer to you but what I am going to tell you is that

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,050
without realizing it by asking this question, if their problems are tractable or intractable,

12
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,800
Alice, Bob, and Carol are currently pondering what is by many seen

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,000
as one of the toughest questions in computer science--

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,070
the famous P vs. NP problem.

15
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,570
And in this unit, I want to show you 4 things.

16
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:03,640
First, what these letters mean. Second, what the problem is actually all about.

17
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,800
So what this here means.

18
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:11,830
Third, what Alice, Bob, and Carol have actually to do with a P vs. NP problem.

19
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,250
And then, last but not the least, how you could become an instant millionaire.

20
00:01:15,250 --> 99:59:59,999
That's not bad for one unit, is it?
