00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:05,780
It's clear that the vpn to ppn mapping is in the guest operating system. Now

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,930
the question is, where should this ppn to

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,920
mpn mapping be kept. In a fully virtualized

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,830
setting. Should it be in the guest operating

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,770
system. Or should it be in the hypervisor.

6
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,460
And simirerly. In the context of a para

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,250
virtualized system, where should the mapping be between

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,950
PPN and MPN? Should it be in the guest operating system or in the hypervisor?
