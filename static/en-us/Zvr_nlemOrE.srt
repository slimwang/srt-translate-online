1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,949
Well that answer would be no. We can't do this simplification. We cancelled

2
00:00:04,949 --> 00:00:09,320
terms here. Remember we can only cancel factors, or things that are multiplied

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,146
in the numerator and in the denominator. X minus 6 divided by the quantity x

4
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:19,294
minus 4, would be our final answer. If you're ever trying to simplify a fraction

5
00:00:19,294 --> 00:00:23,448
further, ask yourself if you can factor the numerator and the denominator, or if

6
00:00:23,448 --> 00:00:27,264
you can cancel factors that appear in both. In this case, we can't factor

7
00:00:27,264 --> 00:00:31,351
anything besides 1 out of the numerator and the denominator, and these 2 factors

8
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:34,673
aren't the same. So, this is our final result.
