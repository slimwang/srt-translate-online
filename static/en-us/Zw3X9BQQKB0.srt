00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,761
Let's go through each one of these before we find our answer. Mu minus x will

2
00:00:04,761 --> 00:00:09,612
give us a positive number because mu is larger than x in both cases, so that's

3
00:00:09,612 --> 00:00:14,826
the first thing we did. But that doesn't tell us how many standard deviations

4
00:00:14,826 --> 00:00:20,004
away from the mean x is, x minus mu will give us the opposite of this one. Which

5
00:00:20,004 --> 00:00:25,284
is basically the negative distance, x minus mu times sigma doesn't really make

6
00:00:25,284 --> 00:00:30,793
sense. That would be multiplying thins distance by this standard deviation, x

7
00:00:30,793 --> 00:00:35,856
minus mu divided by sigma is closer to what we did, but this will give us the

8
00:00:35,856 --> 00:00:40,755
negative distance. However, later you'll see that this equation is very

9
00:00:40,755 --> 00:00:45,898
important. And again, we didn't multiply by sigma. So, this is the correct

10
00:00:45,898 --> 00:00:51,306
answer to find just how far in terms of standard deviations x is from the mean.

11
00:00:51,307 --> 00:00:57,162
We found the distance which is mu minus X, and then we divide it by the standard

12
00:00:57,162 --> 00:00:58,106
deviation.
