1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:07,125
The first one is d. The second one is b. The third one is a. And the fourth one

2
00:00:07,125 --> 00:00:12,224
is c. Using equals instead of equals equals or .equals is an easy mistake to

3
00:00:12,224 --> 00:00:17,318
make. This won't compile. If I create a string friends, and set it equal to the

4
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:22,318
empty string. And now, if friends is the empty screen. And I'm going to use

5
00:00:22,318 --> 00:00:27,226
Shift Enter to go down a line without running it. Then I'll print out no

6
00:00:27,226 --> 00:00:31,610
friends left. Now if I run this, I get an error incompatible types, because

7
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:37,148
friends equals the empty string, isn't a condition. It can't go inside of an if

8
00:00:37,148 --> 00:00:42,299
check. In the second one, friends will never be null. No matter how many

9
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:46,329
friends we remove we just erase their names from the string, we don't reset the

10
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:52,697
string to be null. In this third one, we're comparing using equals, equals. But

11
00:00:52,697 --> 00:00:58,052
strings are objects so we always want to use dot equals to compare them. In

12
00:00:58,052 --> 00:01:01,773
this last one, we say if the number of friends equals, equals the number of

13
00:01:01,773 --> 00:01:06,511
people times 0.33. Then you're friends with one in three people. But these are

14
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:12,370
doubles, and doubles have precision loss. So, you could actually find out that

15
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:19,034
numFriends equals numPeople times 0.33333 or 0.339, or something like that, and

16
00:01:19,034 --> 00:01:25,309
this wouldn't be true. Even though that person is basically friends with one in

17
00:01:25,309 --> 00:01:29,817
three people. When comparing doubles, you always want to find the difference

18
00:01:29,817 --> 00:01:35,769
between them, and then compare it to a threshold. Pick an epsilon, that is the

19
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:40,917
biggest difference you want to accept, and compare the actual difference with

20
00:01:40,917 --> 00:01:43,379
your epsilon.
