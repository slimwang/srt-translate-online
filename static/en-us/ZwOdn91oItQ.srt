1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,700
So you could identify lines in different ways.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,350
For instance, this could be a short segment,

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:11,280
a longer segment to the right-hand side and a diagonal cutting across.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,680
Now this is a consistent set of line segments, which almost accounts for

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,950
all of the edge points.

6
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,320
But there are other possibilities.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,550
For instance, this long segment going right through and

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,090
two shorter segments on either side.

9
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,340
There's no single correct answer to this question.

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,440
If you entered 2, 3, or 4, we would accept it as correct.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,760
Hopefully, this will give you an idea how finding line segments in

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,890
an image is not a trivial task.

13
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,580
This is especially true if you don't have any additional context and

14
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,690
are looking at edge pixels individually.
