1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In this question, we'll introduce OAEP, which is Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
OAEP is a padding scheme for use with RSA.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It provides stronger assurances than the PKCS#1 scheme.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In OAEP, we use two functions--

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
G, which is a hash function outputting g bits,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and H, which is another hash function outputting h bits.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We also have r, a random nonce of g bits.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We then take our message m and append to it 0's

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
such that the length of m' is g.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We then calculate x by concatenating two parts,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
First part is our message XORed with the output of the hash of r.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The second part is r XORed with the hash of the first part.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We then encrypt x using RSA and send off our message.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
For this assignment, you've been given a ciphertext, which was encrypted

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
using OAEP and RSA, using the given encrypt function.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Your task is to decrypt the ciphertext and put your answer into the plaintext variable.
