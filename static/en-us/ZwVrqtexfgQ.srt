00:00:03,327 --> 00:00:04,220
Hi, Dave.

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,310
>> Hi, Professor.

4
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,330
>> Now, you took this course recently,
didn't you?

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:09,950
>> Yes.

6
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:14,590
>> Do you think you have to be a stock
market whiz to pass this course?

7
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:15,490
>> No, not really.

8
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:19,500
I got interested in the finance
only after I took your course.

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,870
>> [LAUGH] The main prerequisite for

10
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,480
this course, is that you
should be a strong programmer.

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,060
We have a lot of assignments and
projects, and we move at a quick pace.

12
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,316
We also use Python which may be new to
some of you, so you should prepare for

13
00:00:35,316 --> 00:00:36,354
that challenge.

15
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:40,510
>> Oh, Professor,
can I ask you what you are doing?

16
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,300
>> This is my Monty Python impression.

17
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,420
You know, the Ministry of Silly Walks.

18
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:46,920
>> No.
