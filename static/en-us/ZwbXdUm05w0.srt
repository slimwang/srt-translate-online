1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,450
As we said, the key idea is we're
going to use this model of motion to

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,140
make these predictions.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,990
And there are two goals, right?

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,800
Goal number one is that we can
do less work because of this.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,015
Because we have some idea of where the
object is going to be we can restrict

6
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:17,025
our search.

7
00:00:17,025 --> 00:00:21,895
Goal number two is we should be able to
actually improve our estimates because

8
00:00:21,895 --> 00:00:25,685
we're using both predictions based
upon dynamics and our measurements.

9
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,960
Now, to do this,
we're going to make certain assumptions.

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,750
Okay?
And the assumptions basically come down

11
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,980
to the notion that this is some
form of continuous motion.

12
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,590
We're going to assume that
objects don't disappear and

13
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,990
reappear instantly somewhere else.

14
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,520
For those of you child psychology,
that's a whole Piaget thing.

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,010
Kids don't come to that belief until I
don't know, it's like year and a half or

16
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,170
something like that.

17
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,380
So like kids who are, are really little,
if you take a toy truck and you've got

18
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,290
a screen here, and you put the toy
truck behind the screen, and then you

19
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,450
lift up the screen and the truck's not
there anymore, they're not surprised.

20
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:03,630
Things disappear in their universe all
the time, or it becomes a, a carrot.

21
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,340
They're not surprised either.

22
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,070
Then all of the sudden they get to
a certain age where the truck comes,

23
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,940
if you pick it up and
it's a carrot, they're like whoa.

24
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:11,480
All right?
And

25
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,550
that requires a certain
change in the mental model.

26
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,970
Okay I don't know why I mentioned that.

27
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:16,820
It's just really cool.

28
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:22,060
It's true by the way, not that Piaget is
all true but that's true about children.

29
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,650
Anyway so we're going to make our
assumption in our tracking that,

30
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,970
that things don't just appear and
disappear.

31
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:32,200
We're also making an assumption that
the camera doesn't move instantaneously.

32
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,620
You know,
because that would be the same thing.

33
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:38,330
All right, if I instantly went from
here to here, right, big change,

34
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:42,240
things will have violated my
apparent continuous motion.

35
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,920
So that's basically that there's
this gradual change imposed between

36
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,680
the camera and the scene and the object.
