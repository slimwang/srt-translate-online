1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,924
Now we're actually done,

2
00:00:01,925 --> 00:00:06,109
coded all of the provider cred functions
that this to do app list will use.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,770
So congrats on your completed app.

4
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:10,269
But I just want to take
a second to talk about two

5
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:13,029
tiny functions that every
content provider includes.

6
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:16,359
Just so if you ever need to use them,
you know where they'd be used.

7
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:19,509
The last cred method that we have
left is the update function.

8
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,804
This would be useful if you decided
to include a feature like editing

9
00:00:22,804 --> 00:00:26,609
pre-existing tasks, or a checkbox
to change the task date to done.

10
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,460
The update function takes in a URI,
content values, a collection, and

11
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,740
selection args, and then it returns
the number of items updated.

12
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,160
These parameters may remind
you of the insert method.

13
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:40,809
The main difference here is that
the update will alter some existing data

14
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,230
by using what's in the updated
content values, and

15
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:47,079
it won't create a new row of data or
a new URI location.

16
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:49,170
And again, our app won't use this.

17
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,550
You don't need to implement provider
methods that you won't actually use.

18
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:55,709
But if you plan to make your content
provider publicly accessible and

19
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,289
share your data,

20
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:59,560
you'll want to be really careful
about leaving any method unfinished.

21
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,079
And so as an example, I'm providing
you with the provider code to update

22
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:05,430
a single task in the code link below.

23
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,630
So this is the last of the Cred Methods.

24
00:01:07,629 --> 00:01:10,711
But what about that sneaky get
tight method we mentioned earlier?

25
00:01:10,712 --> 00:01:12,460
Let's learn a little bit
about that method next
