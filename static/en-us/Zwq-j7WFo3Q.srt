1
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,750
So organizational structure definitely
plays a role in terms of how

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,500
successful DevOps transformation can be.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,760
And I think this is where it's important
to understand that as a DevOps

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,890
practitioner you are taking a set
of software development and

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,480
operational practices as a base.

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,170
But maybe what you are really doing
is you're doing some community

7
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,610
organization.

8
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,680
And so, I think it's important
to understand that your role is

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,870
one of someone who is promoting change,
and

10
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,370
this is different from
being a change agent.

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,410
So often people think of themselves as,
I'm the change agent and

12
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,850
so, sorry change agents.

13
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,030
But [LAUGH] the way that that
role then gets played is you run

14
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:51,060
around inside the organization
seeking permission for change.

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,818
And so
in a very hierarchical organization,

16
00:00:54,818 --> 00:01:00,379
the pattern that that's going to take
is your in an organizational silo.

17
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:04,330
You see that maybe you can reach
out to the silo right next to you.

18
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,180
But you're only path for
communication is straight up,

19
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,290
maybe up to the point at which there's
two people playing golf, right.

20
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,990
And then all the way
back down to the bottom.

21
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:19,280
And that takes time, it's frustrating,
and often you go unheard.

22
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,630
I think the real limitation there
is the limitation of language.

23
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:30,020
So I think, it's maybe more important
inside of an organization that

24
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:36,570
is heavily siloed or sort of heavily
structured in that way to take actions

25
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,240
that support your goals in ways
that are that are safe but

26
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,340
that can also communicate value.

27
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,970
For instance,
even in the strongest silo, when you can

28
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:53,130
identify real organizational pinpoints
and take a step toward alleviating them.

29
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,982
And in today's world these can be
done using open source projects.

30
00:01:58,982 --> 00:02:03,360
There are many ways in which they can
be, these problems can be approached

31
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,199
with a light weight experiment
that's sort of low cost.

32
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:12,130
I think that's when you are having
now a conversation that isn't one

33
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:16,490
about organizational structure on
its face but it's one about value.

34
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,730
I think that what you're
doing is you're changing your

35
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,680
relationship to
the organization from one

36
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,990
of permission-seeking to
one of value-seeking.

37
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:30,590
And I think when you make that
fundamental change internally and you

38
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:35,630
use that language and you take actions
to support it, people will join you.

39
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,920
I have seen a lot of very siloed
structured organizations, but

40
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,360
I have never found the person inside
them that said I do not want to get

41
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,780
to the big bag of money at the end
of my sort of company journey.

42
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,240
Everyone wants to be successful,
everyone wants to be happy.

43
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,050
And often what we're trying to do is
we're trying to figure out the right way

44
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:00,050
to match the solution that we see
to the desire that they're seeking.

45
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:04,608
And I think when you can do that it's
both magical, and it's hugely valuable.

46
00:03:04,608 --> 00:03:09,467
And at that point, the organizational
components really disappear because

47
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:11,568
now we're talking about value.

48
00:03:11,568 --> 00:03:14,670
I don't want to pretend that
organizational structure doesn't exist.

49
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,520
And I don't want to pretend that
there aren't organizations in which

50
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,110
certain kinds of permission
are going to be required.

51
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:25,240
You have to be very careful about where
you choose in your organization to test

52
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,830
these waters.

53
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,670
People security concerns are valid.

54
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:32,790
What goes into a build,
how a build gets out in the world,

55
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,550
how software gets created,
people care deeply about these things.

56
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:39,710
And often the structure that exists
around them is there for a reason.

57
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,180
So, choose carefully and choose wisely.

58
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,180
The goal is not to get
you tilting at windmills.

59
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,260
The goal is to take clear responsible
steps toward relieving the problems

60
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,230
that you see using the tooling that
you're going to learn in this class.
