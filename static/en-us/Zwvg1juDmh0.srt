1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,333
The last issue is what's called drift,
okay.

2
00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:08,750
Drift is the error that happens
that accumulates over time.

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,419
That basically what happens is you've
got this dynamic model that's making

4
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:15,875
a prediction and, and you've got
its censored observation model etc.

5
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:20,160
And you're really caught
with two choices, okay, and

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,542
both of the choices are lousy.

7
00:00:22,542 --> 00:00:28,260
Choice one is,
I stick to my target model, right?

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,830
I really believe the model.

9
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,230
And I never change it, like its
appearance, it's colored up just.

10
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,040
The problem with that is what
happens if the object is changing?

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,470
All of a sudden, you know,
it goes in the trees, shadows,

12
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,960
things look a little different,
and I didn't update my model.

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,560
So, almost every tracker does
some form of model update.

14
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,428
The problem with that is
when you do model update,

15
00:00:48,428 --> 00:00:50,833
you run into situation like this, okay?

16
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:53,488
So this is actually taken from
the Tracking People paper,

17
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:56,790
although this was, they were
explaining how not to do tracking.

18
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:01,180
So they've got this little box that's
stuck on the middle of the ice skater.

19
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,542
And each time they're updating
something about the description, and

20
00:01:05,542 --> 00:01:07,583
eventually the box slides down.

21
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:10,081
And what's not shown here is,

22
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:16,700
it might get stuck on the background
markings in the, in the rink.

23
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,770
And so what's happening is you keep
changing, changing, changing and

24
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,227
all of the sudden more of the mark,

25
00:01:21,227 --> 00:01:24,020
of the target model came from
the rink than came from the skaters.

26
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,590
So as the skater leaves,
the model stays right there.

27
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,800
And this is the,
the problem with adaptive tracking.

28
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,720
And so all real tracking,
in order to fight drift,

29
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,220
always has this balance between how
quickly or how much do I change

30
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:42,700
my model versus how much do I
keep what I had from before.

31
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,160
And you might ask, well,

32
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,900
how come I didn't see any of this in
all that Bayesian stuff that you did?

33
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,430
The reason is, I gave you
the sensor model, P of z given x.

34
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:59,050
And I really didn't tell you
how it behaves generically, or

35
00:01:59,050 --> 00:01:59,980
I should say, all the time.

36
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,620
It just, we, we in fact, all we did
was we generically gave the algorithm.

37
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,480
P of z given x might be how
well do I match the pixels.

38
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,560
Well, but if the pixels are changing,
I have to change my sensor model.

39
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,380
So that's the place in the algorithm
where that notion of how well do I

40
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,400
hold onto my old model versus change it.

41
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,840
That's the place where it stays.
