00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,960
Okay, so I asked you to search for
textview android.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,310
Usually, when I do a search, I always
add the word android at the end of it,

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,210
so that it only shows
me android results.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,975
The first link is for TextView, and
it's on developer.android.com site so

5
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:14,565
I'm going to click on it.

6
00:00:15,695 --> 00:00:18,875
I can ignore most of
the information on this page except

7
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:22,385
I do want to verify that
this is indeed for TextView.

8
00:00:22,385 --> 00:00:25,375
I can read the class overview but
the most important thing is down here,

9
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:26,349
the XML attributes.

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,170
So I can manually scroll the list,
but that will literally take forever.

11
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,110
So, I'm going to use the fine
feature that I talked about earlier.

12
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,280
The quiz question was about finding an
attribute that would change the text to

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,780
be bold or italic.

14
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,145
So I'm going to search for
the word bold.

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,220
Cool, so let's look at this description.

16
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,690
It says Style (bold, italic,
bolditalic) for the text.

17
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,842
That sounds pretty good, so
I can click on this attribute.

18
00:00:52,842 --> 00:00:57,230
For android:textStyle, it seems that
the different values are normal, bold,

19
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,780
or italic.

20
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,270
Let's try it out.

21
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,360
The documentation says that if I
add android:textStyle attribute,

22
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,490
then I can set it to be bold,
italic, or normal.

23
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:08,220
So let's try bold.

24
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,750
Nice, and it bolds the font.

25
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,030
And let's be adventurous and
try italic as well.

26
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,080
Awesome, it italicizes the text.

27
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,000
So this was an example of how
you can look at documentation

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,850
to find new attributes that
you can set on your TextView.

29
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,940
In the future, when you're working
on something and you get stuck, or

30
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,070
you don't know how to do it,

31
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,900
remember they can always use
documentation as a resource.
