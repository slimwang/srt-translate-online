1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,110
Currently the monolith service
does not have any end points.

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:08,860
One way to troubleshoot an issue
like this is to use a kubecti

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,170
get pods command with
a label [INAUDIBLE].

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,760
We can see we have a couple of pods
running with a monolith label.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,843
But what about app=monolith,
and secure=enabled.

6
00:00:19,843 --> 00:00:24,800
Notice that this label query
does not print any results.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,400
But what about our secure monolith pods?

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,090
Let's see what labels they have.

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,790
It seems like we need to add
the secure=enabled label to them.

10
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:38,587
We can use the kubecti label
command to add the missing secure=

11
00:00:38,587 --> 00:00:41,496
enable label to secure monolith pod.

12
00:00:41,496 --> 00:00:44,793
Let's describe the secure-monolith
pod to see if it worked..

13
00:00:44,793 --> 00:00:47,136
And now that it's correctly labeled,

14
00:00:47,136 --> 00:00:50,620
let's see the list of imports
on the monolith- service.

15
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,842
And we have one,
let's hit one of the nodes again.

16
00:00:54,842 --> 00:00:56,421
Bam!

17
00:00:56,421 --> 00:00:57,960
Houston we have contact.
