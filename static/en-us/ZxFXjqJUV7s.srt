00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,910
Let's look at the solution to our multi-predictor quiz where we

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:09,090
have a program for which the two bit predictor works for many instructions.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,840
PSHARE covers some additional instructions and

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,110
GSHARE covers the rest that PSHARE doesn't cover. But all of

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:23,880
them can correctly predict the same branches that the two-bit predictor can.

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,190
So, because the two-bit predictor covers the most branches, and

7
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:33,030
it's the cheapest predictor, what we want to do is use the two-bit predictor for

8
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,760
most of the branches. So the correct answer here is E, Hierarchical predictor,

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,160
that chooses between a two bit predictor and

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,660
a predictor that combines the PSHARE and GSHARE. So,

11
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,390
what this first part does is it basically makes most of the branches just go

12
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,080
to the two bit predictor so that the space in the more expansive predictor here.

13
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,580
Will be reserved for only the branches that actually need to go there,

14
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,415
because the 2 bit predictor is not predicting them correctly. Because PSHARE and

15
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:12,730
GSHARE have different strengths and neither of them is clearly superior

16
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:17,380
to the other, we are not going to combine them using a hierarchy co-predictor,

17
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,470
we are going to combine them using a tournament predictor.

18
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:27,120
That will choose between PSHARE and GSHARE. So,

19
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,680
the correct answer is that the overall predictor is a hierarchical predictor

20
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,760
that chooses between a two bit predictor and a tournament predictor

21
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,230
which itself chooses between PSHARE and GSHARE or the other way around.
