1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is even though we sped up B by a factor of 10,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
we've only made the whole program 1.1 times faster--

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
that is, 10% faster.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The problem is we've left A unchanged,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
so our new program would have an execution time that looks like this.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
B would be this tiny little slice here.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It would just take 1 second rather than 10 seconds,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but the whole program would still take 91 seconds.
