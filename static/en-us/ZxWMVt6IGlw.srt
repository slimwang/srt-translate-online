00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,140
The answer is Jonathan grows 50 pixels on each side. Let's see how I figured

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,490
that out. We're back where we left off in BlueJ. I'm calling the grill method

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,350
on the picture of Jonathan and passing 50 and 50, but I'm going to cancel that

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:17,660
for a moment. Out of curiosity, what is the current width of this picture? Get

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,560
width. It looks like it's 185. So now, if I call the grow method, like I was

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,470
going to do before, Jonathan just got bigger. But how much exactly? It's hard

7
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:32,494
to tell whether he grew 50% bigger or 50 pixels on each side bigger? Or, just

8
00:00:32,494 --> 00:00:36,880
50 pixels wider and 50 pixels taller. So, let's check the width again. Get

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,260
width, and now it's 285. So, it looks like the width grew by 100 pixels. If it

10
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:47,090
were going to grow by 50%, it would probably have grown by about 190 pixels.

11
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:52,220
So, it sounds to me like it grew 50 pixels this way and 50 pixels this way, and

12
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,730
then did the same up and down.
