00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,896
In this new unit we're going to be looking at Quadratic Equations and

2
00:00:02,896 --> 00:00:07,870
Inequalities. These are going to be equations and inequalities that have a

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,586
variable squared. Now I know we already learned how to factor quadratics from

4
00:00:11,586 --> 00:00:15,990
before and we even used that to help us solve quadratic equations. We're going

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,320
to learn some other methods that we can use to also help us solve these. Let's

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,364
review factoring quadratics before we get started. How do we even know if a

7
00:00:23,364 --> 00:00:28,144
quadratic is factorable? If this is factorable, there must be factors of blank

8
00:00:28,144 --> 00:00:32,665
that sum to blank. I want you to fill in these blanks with one of the choices

9
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:37,800
below. What do we know must be true, if we can factor this expression?
