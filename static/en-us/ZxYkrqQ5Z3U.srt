1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,390
So, let's talk about the fabrication yield, which is,

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,110
what is the percentage of chips at the end

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,228
that we get to sell. So, the yield is

4
00:00:10,228 --> 00:00:13,000
the number of working chips we get at the end

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,772
divided by the total number of chips that we

6
00:00:15,772 --> 00:00:20,090
actually had on our wafer. We will see that the

7
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,316
size of the chip affects the yield. So, it

8
00:00:23,316 --> 00:00:25,756
is not only that we get fewer chips when they're

9
00:00:25,756 --> 00:00:28,074
big but also that a smaller percentage of them

10
00:00:28,074 --> 00:00:31,365
work. So, let's say this is our wafer. And

11
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:34,140
the wafer, typically, has a few spots on it

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,321
that we call defects. It is either because the silicon

13
00:00:38,321 --> 00:00:41,022
was impure to begin with or because there was

14
00:00:41,022 --> 00:00:44,161
something wrong with the process at that place so,

15
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:46,935
in the end, once we get the manufacture wafer

16
00:00:46,935 --> 00:00:50,877
pretty much through a given manufacture process, there will be

17
00:00:50,877 --> 00:00:54,128
some number of expected defects per wafer. So,

18
00:00:54,128 --> 00:00:56,740
lets say this wafer has two defects. Lets

19
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:03,070
say that we divide this wafer into a lot of small chips. So, note that some

20
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,170
of the chips are not really complete, because

21
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,940
of the wafer roundness. We can only use

22
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:16,560
the complete ones. So, this is a good chip. So, we got 62 working chips, and

23
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:23,526
2 bad chips. So, our yield, is 62 out of 64, which

24
00:01:23,526 --> 00:01:29,557
is about 97%. Now, let's start with the same wafer and the same defects, but now

25
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:35,370
let's have much larger chips. Now we have six working and two bad

26
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:41,644
chips. So, our yield is only 75%. So, not only did we get fewer chips

27
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:46,590
out of our expensive wafer, we also get a fewer percentage of them working.
