00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,540
All right, Charles welcome back, so let's let's see what you've come up with.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,265
>> Okay, so I would choose for the second one support vector

3
00:00:08,265 --> 00:00:12,780
machines, and the reason why is because there seems to be a single

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,230
line that seems to be in the middle between where the plus and

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,360
the minus are, so it looks like it's trying to maximize the margin.

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,920
>> Yeah, though, those aren't training points. I'm just labeling the regions.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,630
>> Oh never mind. Well then I totally misunderstood. [LAUGH] to do.

8
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,375
I stand by it.

9
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,250
>> Yeah, I think it, I think that's a perfectly

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,159
fine answer because the sup, support basic vector machine is going

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,920
to find a linear separator. And so the output, the

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,570
classifier that comes out of it is going to separate any kind

13
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,690
of region into pluses and minuses, with some lines separating

14
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:44,120
them out. That's also true of perceptrons, it's also true of

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,940
certain kinds of you know, simple neural nets. So all those

16
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,680
seem like they would be reasonable answers for the middle one.

17
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,010
>> Oh okay well, then given

18
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:57,480
that, I'm going to say the third one is a nearest neighbors method.

19
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,330
>> good. And like what nearest neighbor do you think?

20
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,093
>> K nearest neighbor? [LAUGH]

21
00:01:04,093 --> 00:01:06,200
>> Sure, I was thinking one nearest neighbor.

22
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,950
>> Yeah I was too actually, believe it or not.

23
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,610
>> One nearest neighbor. So we, I don't think we got a chance to draw

24
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,070
one of these diagrams when we were talking

25
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,130
about nearest neighbors. But this is called a,

26
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,210
>> Voronoi diagram?

27
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,140
>> Voronoi diagram! Right! Because what,

28
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,770
what's happening is, it's breaking up

29
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,950
the plane into the regions that are closest to some particular points.

30
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:25,040
>> Right.

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,220
>> So you give it a set of points,

32
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,730
it breaks up the plane into the things closest

33
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,380
to that. And in this particular case our We

34
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,200
had, we probably had three points. And one was labeled

35
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,190
plus, and another was labeled plus. One was labeled

36
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,010
minus, and so it break the space up into

37
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,580
these sections that way. So this, this should. Voronoi

38
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,140
diagrams can be very aesthetically pleasing I don't think I

39
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,390
drew this one particularly well.

40
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,510
>> I think it's perfect. My eyes are closed. I think it's

41
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:49,249
perfect. Given that, that I'm going to say the first one is decision trees.

42
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,810
>> Very good. Because decision trees split

43
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,810
things you know, if you're talking about

44
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:59,410
in, in a, in a two dimensional space it's going to split at the

45
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:04,310
top node in one dimension. And here it looks like that's this split. Then

46
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,170
maybe, looks like on the left side that's a minus. On the right side

47
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,538
there's another split. On the left side of that

48
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,260
it's a plus. On the right side there's another

49
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,900
split into pluses and minuses. You get these sort

50
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,950
of interesting nested rectangles. They also can be very pretty.

51
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,330
>> Right.

52
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,920
>> Very Mondrianish. Yeah, very good. So this

53
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,220
is not what we're going to talk about today.

54
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,160
>> Okay, good.
