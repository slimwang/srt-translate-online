1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is 0.72.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The way we get there is to take the variance and divide it by the square root of n--83.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Then factor in the magic number 1.96,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
which is the two-sided 95% confidence interval number for the normal distribution.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That gives us 0.72.
