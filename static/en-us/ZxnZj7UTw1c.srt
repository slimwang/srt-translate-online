1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,280
This is Cameron.

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,660
You probably recognize him from
some other courses around Udacity.

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,420
>> Hey everybody, it's good to see you.

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,400
>> So Cameron, we've been working
through stuff with frameworks.

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,260
>> Yes, frameworks are awesome.

6
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,010
No, I love frameworks,
they're so much fun.

7
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,330
You get to build your app and

8
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,610
just think about the logic of your app,
without worrying about all the nuances

9
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:22,230
that go into making your app
work at the lower levels.

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,490
>> That's right, and frameworks, the
developers have already created a bunch

11
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,960
of different components that you
can just stick together, and so

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,610
you don't actually have to worry
about any of that complexity at all.

13
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,380
>> Yeah, it's fantastic,
like for instance, templating.

14
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,967
Usually there's some kind of HTML that
you want to display over and over, or

15
00:00:36,967 --> 00:00:39,278
display differently in
different situations.

16
00:00:39,278 --> 00:00:42,083
And so with templating,
you can just define that once,

17
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:45,545
say what kind of information you
want to go inside that template, and

18
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:49,725
then when that data changes on your app,
the template automatically changes, and

19
00:00:49,725 --> 00:00:50,580
it looks great.

20
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,830
It's easy,
you don't have to think about it.

21
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,830
So at the end of the day, your workflow
is so much faster and more efficient.

22
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,667
>> That's right, and another thing
is that they also handle events,

23
00:00:58,667 --> 00:01:01,256
so you don't actually have to
worry about atEvent listener or

24
00:01:01,256 --> 00:01:02,428
managing state at the dom.

25
00:01:02,428 --> 00:01:05,028
[CROSSTALK]
>> That's awesome, it's great, yeah.

26
00:01:05,028 --> 00:01:07,989
There's so much you don't have to
worry about, because you have the best

27
00:01:07,989 --> 00:01:10,540
developers in the world, usually,
working on these things.

28
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,410
Maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration,
but they're really good, and they know

29
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,740
what they're doing, and so you're not
really building this app by yourself.

30
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,460
You're building on top
of their expertise,

31
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,840
which means that your app is
going to be more performant, and

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,600
there's a lot that you just don't
have to do, which is great.

33
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,530
>> That is great, yeah,
less work is better.

34
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,038
>> Definitely, the best code, or the
code that has the least chance of being

35
00:01:30,038 --> 00:01:32,028
a bug, is the code that you don't write.

36
00:01:32,028 --> 00:01:34,850
There's probably a better way of
saying that, but you get the idea.

37
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:36,070
>> Exactly, yeah.

38
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,080
Okay, so we're looking at angular and
ember and

39
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,310
some other frameworks in this course.

40
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,050
But each framework is different, and

41
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:45,090
each one provides its own set
of benefits and detractions.

42
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,710
So there are lots of different things
you need to keep in mind as you're

43
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,535
looking for a framework.

44
00:01:48,535 --> 00:01:49,130
>> Yeah,

45
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,720
everyone is slightly different, they all
have their own different philosophy.

46
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,171
They all have their way of doing things,
and

47
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:57,430
they all also have different features.

48
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,010
Usually, sets of features
are fairly similar, but

49
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,550
there can be some differences, so
it's definitely worth experimenting with

50
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,170
different frameworks to see
which one you like more.

51
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,229
And then when it comes time
to build your project,

52
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,150
it's worth thinking about
what's going to go into it, so

53
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,910
you can make the best decision about
which framework best fits your needs.

54
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:20,070
Sometimes there's not necessarily a best
framework, it's just what you're most

55
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,830
comfortable with and what you think
you can move the fastest with.

56
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:24,330
>> Right.
