1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,820
What we have to do is, I needed to change make password hash

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,350
a little bit to take in a salt parameter. because we don't want to

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,670
make a new salt every time, we only want to make a new salt

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,230
when we're making a new password hash. But if we want to verify our password

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,378
hash, we want to pass in salt as a default parameter. Or, salt, or

6
00:00:16,378 --> 00:00:18,776
pass in salt as a parameter. So, what I do is, I pull salt

7
00:00:18,776 --> 00:00:22,091
out of the h by splitting on a comma and taking the the

8
00:00:22,091 --> 00:00:25,758
second part which is the salt and then I pass that into my function.

9
00:00:25,758 --> 00:00:30,090
Now, you could have also implemented this by just copying this

10
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,950
line into valid PW, which I guess this should have said.

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,890
May need, but it's always better if you can reuse a

12
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,940
function like this, so you don't have to you know, if

13
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,550
you want to change the logic here, you don't have to change

14
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,870
everything here. Let's go ahead and give this a run. You

15
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,890
can see it says true. And if we add an extra

16
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:50,880
print statement here, print h. And now we give this a run.

17
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,570
We should see our what would store on the database. Here we go, there's a

18
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,440
hash, there's a salt. And we can see that it matched. And if we were

19
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,290
to run this again we'd see that we get a different hash and salt but

20
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,890
it still matches. So, pretty cool, huh?

21
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,630
Let's discuss one more thing about password hashing.
