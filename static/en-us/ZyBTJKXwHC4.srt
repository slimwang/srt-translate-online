00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,640
The main mechanism in firewalls
is traffic filtering.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,806
Firewall filtering means that
the traffic gets to the firewall and

3
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:10,770
the firewall will decide whether
to let the traffic through or not.

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,060
In other words, each packet is
stopped at the firewall and

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,079
is checked against security policy.

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,830
And then the firewall will decide
whether to allow the packet or

7
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,160
discard the packet.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,040
And both the inbound and
outbound traffic is filtered or

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,340
checked by the security
policy of the firewall.
