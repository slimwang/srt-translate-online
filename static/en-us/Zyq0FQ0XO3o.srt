1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,210
So surely let's say you are in
a free throw competition right.

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:07,800
And if you win you get
one hundred dollars.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,680
So you have two options,
either you get two shots.

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,510
Each with two thirds probability of
being made or three shots each with

5
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:24,150
one half probative you made you win
if you make at least one shot.

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,580
Which one would you take?

7
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,680
>> Okay.

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,780
>> Feel free to use the board.

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,770
>> Yeah I think I will.

10
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,410
So let me just.

11
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,820
I'm going to trying to catch out
make sure I've understood and

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,160
we'll try to figure it out.

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,770
So I think this kind of
lends itself to a tree.

14
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,538
So you said, two shots with two-thirds
or three shots with a half.

15
00:00:46,538 --> 00:00:47,669
So.

16
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:59,228
Either I, what's the word,
success or fail.

17
00:00:59,228 --> 00:01:05,900
So that's two-thirds of the chance
of success and one-third fail.

18
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,557
And I get two shots like that.

19
00:01:09,557 --> 00:01:17,187
Yeah?
>> Yes.

20
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,770
>> And so I want there to be at least
one success so I could draw something in

21
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,220
here but there's no point because
>> Like

22
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,780
already if I win on
the first shot I'm good.

23
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,540
Yes.

24
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:34,010
The other one was the same thing but
this time I'm just going to shorten

25
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:38,224
success to S, fail and each one
>> One's a half.

26
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,010
Okay.

27
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,370
So I think the easiest way to

28
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,110
evaluate each of these would be to
look at the probability of failure.

29
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,220
And then if I fail all the way
through then whatever's left over is

30
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,790
me winning $100 or so.

31
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,479
So the probability of failure like
these I'm assuming this is independent.

32
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,190
I guess I might be disappointed.

33
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,184
>> Yeah. No, no, no.
>> If i miss the first time.

34
00:02:13,184 --> 00:02:14,402
>> [CROSSTALK]
>> Yeah.

35
00:02:14,402 --> 00:02:16,788
>> But if I
>> Okay, okay.

36
00:02:16,788 --> 00:02:23,031
So so
the probability of failing in this case,

37
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:28,570
is going to be a third
times a third is a ninth.

38
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:29,260
>> Okay.

39
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,609
>> And in this case.

40
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,920
>> Where i've got three shots
the probability of failing is

41
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:44,860
a half cubed, a half times a half,
which is an eight.

42
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,320
So, and I want the biggest
possible probability of success.

43
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:49,920
>> Okay.
>> So

44
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,300
i would rather go with this version.

45
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,550
Because a ninth is less then an eight.

46
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,580
Yes.
So yeah that's great.

47
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,437
So what if you had to
make two shots to win?

48
00:03:01,437 --> 00:03:06,240
>> Okay.
So if I had to make two shots to win,

49
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,040
how could I okay so I need to
modify my diagram a little bit.

50
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,520
So I can add bits in.

51
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,222
So on the top one.

52
00:03:20,113 --> 00:03:21,553
And I guess, so now,

53
00:03:21,553 --> 00:03:26,277
the easiest thing to calculate is
the probability of success on here,

54
00:03:26,277 --> 00:03:30,038
because I'm going to have,
I want to have the probability new,

55
00:03:30,038 --> 00:03:32,886
because it's the new situation, [LAUGH]
>> Yeah.

56
00:03:32,886 --> 00:03:37,200
[LAUGH]
>> Of S, is going to be two-thirds

57
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,288
squared, which is four ninth's, this
one is a little bit more complicated.

58
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:42,895
>> Yes.

59
00:03:42,895 --> 00:03:47,000
But I can do that S, F.

60
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,700
So here this track I'm done.

61
00:03:53,700 --> 00:04:00,100
So that's good, so this is a half.

62
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,900
Okay, so now I'm just going to
highlight the ones I'm

63
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,808
interested in because this is
looking a bit more complicated.

64
00:04:09,808 --> 00:04:10,880
So this is good.

65
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,450
This is good.

66
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,790
These are both with two successes.

67
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,394
This isn't okay and here.

68
00:04:18,394 --> 00:04:21,839
Okay I need to i'm missing
a bit of tree in there.

69
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:23,740
But.

70
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,305
Okay i'm sorry about my diagram.

71
00:04:27,305 --> 00:04:30,436
[LAUGH]
Okay and then.

72
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:38,720
It's going to be.

73
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,590
Is this and this is okay.

74
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,845
And anything after that
includes two fails.

75
00:04:42,845 --> 00:04:45,120
>> Mm-hm.
>> So now,

76
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,240
the probability of the new success for
here.

77
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,660
I'm going to have to multiply and
then add.

78
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,250
>> Yes.
>> So

79
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:59,870
I'm going to have a half times a half.

80
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,870
So that's a quarter.

81
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,370
Plus a half times a half times a half.

82
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,758
And another one of those.

83
00:05:06,758 --> 00:05:09,550
So that's one-eighth is that.

84
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,160
And that's another eighth.

85
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,760
So that's two times one-eighth.

86
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,448
Picture's a quarter so
the whole thing is a half.

87
00:05:17,448 --> 00:05:23,120
So the probability of success,
in this case,

88
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,630
is better for the new situation because
a half is bigger than four-ninths.

89
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,790
>> Yes, actually that sounds perfect.

90
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,690
You're ready to make a hundred dollars.

91
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,245
[LAUGH] Only if I can shoot.

92
00:05:35,245 --> 00:05:36,030
>> [LAUGH] Awesome.
