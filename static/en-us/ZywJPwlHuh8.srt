1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,780
While there might not appear to be a correlation between

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,310
the two variables, let's think about this a little bit

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,145
more. What's on the x-axis? Months. And what's on the

4
00:00:09,145 --> 00:00:13,010
y-axis? Temperature. So, we know that this month variable is

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,890
very discreet. We'll have the months from January to December,

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,460
and they'll repeat over and over again. Let's be sure

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,740
we add that detail to our plot. Here's the code

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,010
that we used to create the plot using the ggplot syntax.

9
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,100
What layer and syntax would you add to

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,810
this plot in order to make that change? Type

11
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,440
in your code here. You'll want to break

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,170
open the x-axis every 12 months, so that way

13
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,240
it corresponds to a year. I'll let you

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,370
figure out what the lower and upper limits of

15
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,600
the x axis should be. So, what do

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,870
you think? What layer and syntax should we add?
