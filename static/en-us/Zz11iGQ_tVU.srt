00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,020
From what we just discussed, you learn that an increase of 3 decibels doubles

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,780
the power of sound. So, this gives us some context for thinking about what a

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,380
decibel means, in general. Now, it's been found that after about 8 hours of

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:20,740
exposure to 85 decibel noise, you can experience permanent hearing damage. So,

5
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,710
this is just an example, but every time the sound power doubles, the exposure

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,280
time before hearing damage occurs halves. I wonder then how long it would take

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,485
for you to experience permanent hearing damage, if instead of 85 decibels a

8
00:00:36,485 --> 00:00:41,760
sound was 100 decibels. Let's start off simple. What's the increase in decibels

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,831
from 85 decibels to 100 decibels?
