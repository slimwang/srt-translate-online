1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,400
I turns out that this i has an interesting pattern to it. We can simply any

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,332
power of i by following this pattern. First, we need to remember that i equals

3
00:00:09,332 --> 00:00:14,580
the square root of negative 1. This means if we square i, we also square the

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,940
square root of negative 1. So i squared would equal negative 1. To find the

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:25,435
value of i cubed, we multiply i squared by i. Since the value of i squared is

6
00:00:25,435 --> 00:00:30,740
negative 1, we simply have negative 1 times i, or negative i. So we know i

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:36,226
cubed really simplifies to negative i. So let's use a similar approach to find

8
00:00:36,226 --> 00:00:40,447
i to the 4th. We'll split it up into two powers of i that we know, i squared

9
00:00:40,447 --> 00:00:46,977
and i squared. Since i squared equals negative 1, we have negative 1 twice.

10
00:00:46,977 --> 00:00:52,696
Negative 1 times negative 1 equals positive 1. So i to the 4th will just

11
00:00:52,696 --> 00:00:57,409
simplify to positive 1. Let's see if you can extend our pattern. What do you

12
00:00:57,409 --> 00:01:02,896
think i to the 5th, i to the 6th, i to the 7th, and i to the 8th would be? If

13
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,680
you get the square root of negative 1, I want you to just enter i for your

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,759
answer. And as a hint to get you started, you can rewrite i to the 5th as i to

15
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:17,252
the 4th times i. Think about if you can replace any of these values.
