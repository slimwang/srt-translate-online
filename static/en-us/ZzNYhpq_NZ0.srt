1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,100
So now that you know what you're
expecting to change through

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:07,760
your hypothesis and what you're going to
do, you need to run an experiment.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,560
You can do this using an A/B test.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,280
This will help you compare two different
versions of your webpage or app and

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,129
learn which one performs better.

6
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:19,500
You can use a Control group and
an experimental group.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,100
Having a control group can show you
how effective your campaign is.

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,090
Now, the control group consists
of randomly selected users

9
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,630
who are representative of
the population you're targeting,

10
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:33,300
and who do not receive the change to
whatever campaign you're running.

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,140
So being representative of
the population means that if 50% of

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,830
your app users are male and
50% are female,

13
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:44,850
you need to have the same demographic in
your randomly selected Control group.

14
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,190
Now everything except the one change
you're targeting should stay the same.

15
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:53,090
For example, if you want to test
the effect of moving your sign-up button

16
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,813
to the top of the screen, all messaging,

17
00:00:55,813 --> 00:01:00,170
colours, looks and feel of the site
should stay the same, except for

18
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,080
moving the sign out button
to the top of the screen and

19
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,730
only the people in the experimental
group will see these changes.

20
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,340
So the people in the experimental
group will see the sign up button at

21
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,090
the top of the page and
the people in the Control group

22
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,670
won’t see a change in the location
of the sign up button.

23
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,380
This way you can see how the people in
the two different groups perform and

24
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,230
which button placement would
result in more sign-ups.

25
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,950
Now your Control group
doesn’t need to be huge.

26
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,830
The key is that it is representative
of the target population.

27
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,080
If you have a really, really large
population like thousands and

28
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,840
thousands of people,

29
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,568
you might only need about 5% of that
population to be in your Control group.

30
00:01:38,568 --> 00:01:40,560
However, if it's a smaller population,

31
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,020
you may need closer to 20 %
to be in your Control group.

32
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,890
To determine the best sample size for
your experiment,

33
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,750
there are a ton of free online sample
files calculators you can check out.

34
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,080
Now to run A/B test, there are a ton
of different tools that you can use.

35
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,730
For example, Optimize Me allows you
to make changes on your website and

36
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,920
will run and
host the experiment for you.

37
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,880
So, let's hear from
an expert about A/B testing.
