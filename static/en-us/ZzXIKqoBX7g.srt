1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,110
So this has actually been something
that's been, kind of been thought up and

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,660
hoped for a long time.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:10,510
In fact, as early as 1908,
Lippmann proposed that we could actually

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,540
use this to generate what is referred
to by him as integral photography.

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,350
He actually was a physics person,
and he won a Nobel prize for

6
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,320
this kind of stuff.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,900
And again, you know,
lot of fun stuff was done by

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,150
actually doing the physics
on the sensors like this.

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,000
So, I should, of course,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,300
spend a brief moment on the history
of light field cameras.

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,619
The concept has been around for
a long time, as early as 1908.

12
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:36,760
And Lippmann, a Nobel laureate
in physics, actually introduced

13
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,130
the concept of integral photography and
basically talked about how, actually,

14
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,930
you know, the physics of light
itself could be used to reproduce

15
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,710
colors based on interference
patterns and stuff like that.

16
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,480
Since then, much work has happened.

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,980
1930, they kind of constructed
parallax panograms.

18
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,940
In 1992, Adelson and
Wang proposed a plenoptic camera and

19
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,790
used it to generate stereo
from a single lens.

20
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,819
And in fact, some of the stuff
that I just showed you,

21
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:07,374
was based on the work that they did.

22
00:01:07,374 --> 00:01:10,089
Similarly then,
kind of early stuff happened,

23
00:01:10,089 --> 00:01:12,354
in terms of building light fields.

24
00:01:12,354 --> 00:01:16,290
Again, the example of using the UV and
the SD kinds of stuff, planes,

25
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,240
UV plane and SD plane was based
on some work these people did.

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,600
And of course, the plenoptic
camera that you also see now.

27
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,500
Actually what has happened
now in about 2012,

28
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,830
Lytro actually invented this light field
camera which is commercially available.

29
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,030
There are advanced versions of this now.

30
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,110
When we looked at some of our
earlier cameras, we saw various

31
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:38,760
cameras which had an array of
cameras connected to each other.

32
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,270
They can also be used to
generate light fields.

33
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,010
Much more advanced stuff has
happened in this space, and

34
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:47,440
I encourage you to look it up on
your own and study more about it.

35
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,730
But again, you know these,

36
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,410
this is one of commercially available
light field camera these days.
