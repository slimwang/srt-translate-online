00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,981
Okay, so we know how to calculate the volume of a box if we know the length, the

2
00:00:03,981 --> 00:00:08,092
width and the height of the box. So let's take another look at how Athena was

3
00:00:08,092 --> 00:00:12,322
folding her boxes. She'd take a piece of paper like this one. Then she would

4
00:00:12,322 --> 00:00:16,647
measure a square in each corner of her rectangular piece of paper. Then she cut

5
00:00:16,647 --> 00:00:20,968
the squares out of the corners. And then she would fold up the edges. And tada,

6
00:00:20,968 --> 00:00:25,173
with a little bit tape we'd have a pretty nicely put together box. So we know

7
00:00:25,173 --> 00:00:29,541
then we can make box out of a piece of paper that looks like this. It once was a

8
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:33,882
rectangle until I cut the squares out of the corners. Let's draw that on here.

9
00:00:33,882 --> 00:00:38,238
So here is a nice little piece of paper for us to start out with. And then I can

10
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,718
draw this to show what it would look like after the corners have been cut out of

11
00:00:42,718 --> 00:00:48,529
it. Awesome. Now, on the real piece of paper that I was using, this one, the

12
00:00:48,529 --> 00:00:54,600
original side length of this long side was seven inches. And the original side

13
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,058
length of the shorter side was five inches. So let's pretend like this paper has

14
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:04,986
the same dimensions. So the orginal side length was five inches. And this

15
00:01:04,986 --> 00:01:09,999
original side length down here was seven inches. Now, Athena and I are both

16
00:01:09,999 --> 00:01:14,897
super careful people, so we made sure that the squares that I cut out of each

17
00:01:14,897 --> 00:01:20,596
corner are exactly the same size. That means that each of these lengths of a

18
00:01:20,596 --> 00:01:26,708
cutout square is the same. Let's call that length x. Now, I'm going to give you

19
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:31,765
a second to refresh your memory on how this box looks when we fold up the sides.

20
00:01:31,766 --> 00:01:38,910
So here's my real one again. This length is x. This is seven inches and this is

21
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:46,068
five inches. When I fold it up, it looks like this. We have length, width, and

22
00:01:46,068 --> 00:01:52,158
height. Now, my question for you is, once I fold up this box, what will the

23
00:01:52,158 --> 00:01:57,333
height of the box be? Please put your answer in this box. And just a hint, it

24
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,983
may not just be a number.
