00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,343
We had three groups. Snapzi, Irisa, and LolaMoon. So there are 2 degrees of

2
00:00:05,343 --> 00:00:11,172
freedom for the between groups variability. For the within groups, we had four

3
00:00:11,172 --> 00:00:17,272
values in each group. And we subtract one for each group. That makes 9 degrees

4
00:00:17,272 --> 00:00:23,713
of freedom. Remember that this is the same as the total number, capital N which

5
00:00:23,713 --> 00:00:31,250
is 12 minus k, the number of groups, which is 3. 12 minus 3 is 9.
