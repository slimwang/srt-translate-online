1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,370
So now that we've seen how
regular notifications work,

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,540
how do we go about extending this
application to work with Android Auto?

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,790
These are the same steps
you would have to take,

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,810
if you had an existing messaging
app that you wanted to modify.

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,290
So this would be very useful for
you to understand.

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,650
When a user connects their phone
to an Android Auto head unit,

7
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:22,810
a companion app runs on the phone which
implements the Android Auto experience.

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:23,770
Shown here.

9
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,650
This Auto Companion app looks for

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,370
apps on the device, such as these here,
that declare Android Auto support, and

11
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,650
so our messaging app needs to declare
this in the AndroidManifest.xml file.

12
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,420
So let's open that file up.

13
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,550
So we go to manifests,
AndroidManfest.xml, and here it is.

14
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,870
We need to declare an XML file that will
contain the Android Auto information.

15
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:47,850
So let's add something like this
inside of the application tag.

16
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,040
Now we need to create
this reference file.

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,880
So if we go over here and select res,
you won't have an XML directory so

18
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,320
we need to create that.

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,700
So right click New, Directory,
type the word XML and hit OK.

20
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,159
Right click on the XML directory,
select New File,

21
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,700
and type in automotive_app_desc.xml,
and hit OK.

22
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,130
Inside this new file,
you then need to declare support for

23
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,230
notifications, like this.

24
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,140
The next step is to create broadcast
receivers that will be called,

25
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,610
whenever an Android auto message has
been heard by the user or replied to.

26
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,750
So we can use Android Studio to
create these receivers very easily.

27
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,960
And it'll up the AndroidManfest.xml
file for us as well.

28
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,900
So to do this, click on File,
New, Other, Broadcast Receiver,

29
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,750
and for the name, we're going to
type my message heard receiver and

30
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,880
we'll leave all the defaults
as they are, and hit finish.

31
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,970
You can see now,
we have sub class created for us.

32
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,030
And you can see the AndroidManifest.xml
changes here, as well.

33
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,680
You need to add an intent filter, so

34
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,540
that this receiver will only
respond to specific actions.

35
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,960
Note that we include
the package name here.

36
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,610
You should change this package
name to whatever the name is for

37
00:01:58,610 --> 00:01:59,700
your application.

38
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,480
Ours is defined here, at the top
of the AndroidManifest.xml and so

39
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,260
we're going to use that here, too.

40
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,229
We also need to create a receiver for
message replies as well, so

41
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:13,280
let's do the same thing File,
New, Other,

42
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,790
Broadcast Receiver, and this time we're
going to use MyMessageReplyReceiver.

43
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,630
Once again with the same default and
then finish.

44
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,320
If we go back to
the AndroidManifest.xml file,

45
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,340
we need to make sure we add
a similar intent-filter as before.

46
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,580
And so we put that in like this.

47
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,870
You'll see here that
the action is a reply,

48
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,150
instead of heard like we used before.

49
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,760
We also need to double check that
we're including the Android support

50
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,350
library as well.

51
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,710
This is defined in the build.gradle
file for the application module.

52
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,370
We can find that here.

53
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,710
Here, and then we load it up.

54
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,160
And if we scroll here,
you can see that we're already including

55
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,470
the support-v4 library here,
so we're good to go.
