00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:07,942
W'll start by rewriting 9 16ths as 3 squared divided by 4 squared. We can do

2
00:00:07,942 --> 00:00:12,550
this since we know 3 squared is 9 and 4 squared is 16. Next, we're going to

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:17,464
pull out our exponent of 2 from each part of the fraction. So we'll just have 3

4
00:00:17,464 --> 00:00:21,803
4ths raised to the 2nd power. Now again, I'm so close to having these bases

5
00:00:21,803 --> 00:00:28,300
match. I have 4 3rds here, but I have 3 4ths here. In order to get these two

6
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,180
bases to match, we need to flip this base. So, we'll use a negative exponent to

7
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:39,180
do that. So, 3 4ths squared is the same thing as 4 3rds raised to the negative

8
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:45,024
second power. Remember, this negative 1, or this exponent of negative 1, flips

9
00:00:45,024 --> 00:00:49,635
over our base. Now we have two bases that are the same, so we can set the

10
00:00:49,635 --> 00:00:55,593
exponents equal. X must equal negative 2.
