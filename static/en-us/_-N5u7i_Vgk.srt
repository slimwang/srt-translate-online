1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
The first word we want to think about

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,230
is something called Total Available Market,

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,210
and I like to think of Total Available Market as a pie.

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,080
It's the entire pie.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,410
Total Available Market says, look,

6
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,030
how many people or companies or whatever your unit of sale is

7
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,390
would want or need this product,

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,820
and how large is the market

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,810
in dollars or units

10
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,210
if they all bought?

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,540
That's just a pretty nice calculation.

12
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,080
And the question is, okay,

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,120
how would I find out?

14
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,950
In different industries, there are analysts that

15
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,660
specialize in vertical markets and enterprise software,

16
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,510
it's Gartner and Forrester; in video games,

17
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,290
it's the MPD Group; in consumer research,

18
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,120
it's Nielsen; if you want to understand

19
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,950
how many mobile startups there are,

20
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,350
you go to the Mobile Startup Genome Project, et cetera.

21
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,600
So you need to ask some questions as

22
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,470
which industry analysts kind of follow your specific domain,

23
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:58,010
and then also Wall Street analysts follow competitors in this business.

24
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:01,010
That is, they follow whoever's public;

25
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,870
in fact, some of them write very nice research reports.

26
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,130
If you have access to university library or a friendly broker,

27
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,890
you can get a great free industry analyst report

28
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,840
and I would be asking others, as well,

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,000
and Google is your best friend here.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,920
I truly would be spending time trying to understand,

31
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,940
is this a $1 billion market,

32
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,760
and by the way, if you throw out those numbers,

33
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,300
the first thing I'm going to ask you is,

34
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,960
well, that's nice, but break it down for me.

35
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,730
Help me understand how many users,

36
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,630
who are the players, what are the competitors, et cetera.

37
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:36,160
You need to understand this total available market pie

38
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,890
in some detail before I'll let you get to the next step,

39
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,650
and the next step is

40
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,070
how big is my slice?

41
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,850
And we tend to use a fancy word for that:

42
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,470
What's the served available market?

43
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,340
The served available market means

44
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,820
okay, well instead of the theory that there are 7 billion people in the world,

45
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,880
how many people really can use a mobile app?

46
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,310
Oh, well a mobile app is kind of dependent on

47
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,070
how many people have mobile Smart Phones,

48
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:08,389
and if I'm making the mobile app for, let's say an Android platform,

49
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,000
then the first question is

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,310
how many theoretical people are going to be using

51
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,590
Android platforms in this year and in the next 5?

52
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,990
Oh, now I can start estimating

53
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,180
what's my served available market.

54
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,800
And so many people have the money to buy the product;

55
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,050
that is, are you a 99-cent product

56
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,390
or are you a $99 product?

57
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,580
Now you're narrowing the market based on pricing or availability

58
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,360
and you want to do some thought experiments like

59
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,960
how large would the market be in dollars

60
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,000
if they all bought--

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,540
if everyone in the served available market bought,

62
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,000
how large would this be,

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,540
and this is kind of your first test

64
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,240
to say, "Oh" or "Wow."

65
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,870
So you want to understand this before dollars and units.

66
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,190
How do you find out?

67
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,380
Well, this is one where you're really out of the building and talking to customers.

68
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,360
Then I think of this again using the pie analogy

69
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,070
the first step was

70
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,140
try to understand the number of people in the world,

71
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,680
but now we can narrow it down if I have the Android app

72
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,530
to number of Android phones--capable phones,

73
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:10,500
and then down to how many would buy it at my price,

74
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,480
but now we really want to get pretty specific.

75
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,440
Who example am I going to sell in years 1, 2, and 3?

76
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,400
How many customers is that?

77
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,100
How large is the market if they all bought?

78
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,330
That is, what we now are coming up with

79
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,480
is the total number of dollars

80
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,820
if you had 100% market share,

81
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,370
your revenue isn't going to exceed this number,

82
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,900
and many units would that be?

83
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,300
Again, how do I find out?

84
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,100
Boy, this is really about

85
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,000
getting out of the building and talking to customers

86
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,230
and talking to potential channel partners,

87
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,480
and talking to competitors, et cetera.

88
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,300
You really, at the end of this exercise,

89
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,300
now have the first pass hypothesis

90
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,770
about is this business model canvas

91
00:03:50,770 --> 99:59:59,999
worth executing for the next couple of years?
