1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
If you did this right, it should be the case that all of these edge boxes are checked off,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and you ended up with an actor.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Now--this is the magic trick part--I'm going to tell you which actor you ended up with.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The answer is Kevin Bacon. Ta da! Pretty neat, huh? Let's try it.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm going to follow maybe a different path than you did, but I'm going to do my best to try it.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Just to try to thwart this, maybe I'll do directly to Kevin Bacon.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'll visit this edge. Now I'm at Kevin Bacon.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I go to Dustin Hoffman.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I go to Susan Saradon. I go to Julia Roberts.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I can't go do Kevin Bacon now, because I'll be at a dead end.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I visited all the other edges that have gone through Kevin Bacon,

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
so I'll go to Dustin Hoffam to Robert Deniro to Meryle Streep again

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
to Ann Hathaway back to Julia Roberts, and now I can go to Kevin Bacon and be done.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It may or may not have been the same path that you followed,

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
but I did end up at Kevin Bacon.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You can try this a couple different ways, and you'll see that you'll always end up with Kevin Bacon.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So that's our magic trick.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This example illustrates two things that are central to this course.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The first is the idea of a social network.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We often think of social networks as being particular websites that exist these days,

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
but really what a social network is is connections between individuals

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
that capture relationships between them.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
These days, of course, they ubiquity and scope of social network data is exploding.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Clever computer software is needed to reveal interesting patterns

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and answer important questions about this data.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's a really neat area.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The second focus of this course is on the magic of algorithms.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Algorithms are just how we organize computations to solve a particular problem.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Some algorithms are really straightforward,

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
but other algorithms take advantage of subtle mathematical properties

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
to quickly and accurately provide an answer.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Those are the ones that feel like magic.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
With that said, now I'm going to try to tell you how this trick actually worked

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and what it tells us about these kinds of structures.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Let me first point out that this kind of structure where you've got a set of circles and lines

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
connecting between them is what we in computer science and discrete math call graph.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
In this particular graph, the actors are playing the role of nodes, sometimes called vertices.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And the movies are playing the role of edges or links.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'll probably mostly say "nodes" and "edges,"

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
which kind of mixes a metaphor, but that's how I'm used to saying it.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We can also talk about the degree of a node in a network.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
For example, this Dustin Hoffman node here is a node in the network.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's got degree 4 because there are 4 edges coming out of it--1, 2, 3, 4.
