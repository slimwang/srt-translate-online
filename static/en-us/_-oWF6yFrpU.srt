1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,240
So given that little bit of information,

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,939
we can now talk about image reprojection.

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:06,740
Here's the basic question.

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,690
How do we relate two images, so I have two images, projective plane one,

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:17,265
projective plane two, where the center of projection of the camera was the same.

6
00:00:17,265 --> 00:00:18,410
'Kay, so I've got the camera, and

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,240
it's center projection is fixed, and I take two images.

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,530
So the question is,

9
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:27,376
how do I map from projective plane one to projective plane two?

10
00:00:27,376 --> 00:00:32,450
Well here's the answer, basically think of that image or the point on

11
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:37,210
the image as we said is it's actually a ray in space, and it's a ray from

12
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,920
the center projection, through the image plane intersecting the image plane.

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,660
And then in order to figure out how to map

14
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,680
from projective plane one to projective plane two, I basically have to

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,920
figure out where that same ray intersects projective plane two.

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,770
So if I knew where that plane was,

17
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,800
then I could just figure out where that point is.

18
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,690
All right?

19
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,300
And so that would be, you know, right here.

20
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,310
'Kay?

21
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,170
So what should be clear is,

22
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:07,690
that in order to figure out where this ray was intersecting projective plane

23
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:13,300
two, I didn't actually have to know where in the world that ray hit.

24
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,670
I just need to know the camera center,

25
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:20,170
the location of the point in image plane one that defines the ray, and

26
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,930
then I intersect the ray with projective plane two.

27
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,000
Where it hits in the world is irrelevant.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,040
What that means is, instead of thinking of this as a reprojection from

29
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,500
3D to 2D in figuring out how it projects to some other 2D plane,

30
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,200
when I'm going from two planes that are from the same center,

31
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,020
I really want to think of this as a 2D image transformation.

32
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,450
A 2D, it says here, image warp from one image plane to the other.

33
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,930
I don't have to worry about the third dimension, the 3D world.

34
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:55,485
So a very cool application of this is what's referred to as image mosaics, or

35
00:01:55,485 --> 00:01:57,570
sometimes called image panoramas.

36
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,179
So would you like to know how to make an image panorama, sometimes called

37
00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:05,850
an image mosaic, which is way easier to say than panoram, ra, pa, pan, panama.

38
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,490
Maybe they make them in Panama.

39
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:08,340
I don't know.

40
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,540
We're going to make panoramas, and we're going to use homographies to do this.

41
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,550
All right, so here's the basic procedure of how to make a panorama.

42
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:20,250
You're going to take a sequence of images from the same position.

43
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,510
So you might say, you might ask,

44
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,400
well if it's from the same position, don't I get the same picture?

45
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,030
No, you're going to rotate the camera about its optical center.

46
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,820
So the position stays the same, but

47
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,130
the direction that the camera's pointing can change.

48
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:39,070
Then what you're going to do is you compute a transform between the second image

49
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,530
and the first, or the first and

50
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,130
the second, and then what you do is you transform that second image to

51
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:49,390
overlap with the first according to the, the, the correct transformation.

52
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,060
And then what you'll have to do is you'll have to

53
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,890
blend those two pictures together to make the mosaic.

54
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,710
And of course, if there are more images then you have to repeat.

55
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,320
But wait a minute.

56
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,920
How come I don't have to worry about the 3D world in order to

57
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,890
put together a panorama of images that are taken of

58
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,830
this whole big world that's got different depths etc.

59
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,740
What about the 3D, 3D geometry of the scene?

60
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,530
Why aren't we using it?

61
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,320
Well, you can probably guess it's that thing that we said before.

62
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,520
About that the, when you're projecting from one image plane to the next,

63
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:27,040
if they're taken from the same camera center, the 3D world is irrelevant.

64
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,280
So I don't actually have to know the scene structure in order to

65
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,910
paste together these pictures to make a panorama.
