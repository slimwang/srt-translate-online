1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,250
What kind of data model could
be used to populate this table?

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,910
The view in each row shows the same
three things, the album name,

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,230
an image from the album,
and the picture count.

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,950
Then those rows are repeated.

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:17,440
So, this table could be a representation
of some ordered list of similar items,

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,500
for example, an array.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,390
Which of the following models might
be used to construct this table?

8
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:25,667
An array of structs?

9
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:27,051
An array of dictionaries?
