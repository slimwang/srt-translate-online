1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:06,000
A key construct at most exchanges
is something called the order book.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,230
Each exchange keeps an order book for
every stock that they buy or sell.

3
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,240
And here's how it works.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,230
Let's suppose you've just issued
an order to buy 100 shares of IBM

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,682
with a limit price of 99.95.

6
00:00:21,682 --> 00:00:25,490
And let's suppose for
the moment that this arrives at

7
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:31,250
the New York Stock Exchange and so
far today nobody's put in any orders.

8
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,630
So your order is the first one and

9
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,210
they'll use it as the basis to
start building their order book.

10
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,080
So yours is the first
entry in the order book.

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:46,920
And it simply shows somebody has
bid 99.95 for 100 shares of stock.

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,920
And this is public knowledge.

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,720
People can view this and see, okay,

14
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,800
there's interest in buying
shares of this stock.

15
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,060
Now, they don't know
who has made this bid.

16
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,070
The exchange knows that it's
you that's made that bid.

17
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,810
But they see that there's
interest in 100 shares.

18
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,950
Now others may send
in orders like yours.

19
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,650
And this number just keeps
getting larger depending on

20
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,490
how many orders come in.

21
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,646
When this is displayed publicly,
people just see that okay,

22
00:01:17,646 --> 00:01:20,570
there's interest maybe
from various people.

23
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:25,273
And 1,000 shares of IBM at 99.95.

24
00:01:25,273 --> 00:01:28,302
So far nothing's been bought or sold yet

25
00:01:28,302 --> 00:01:33,410
though because we don't have
anybody willing to sell.

26
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,398
Well, let's suppose
a sell order comes in.

27
00:01:35,398 --> 00:01:40,484
Sell IBM 1,000 shares, limit of $100.

28
00:01:40,484 --> 00:01:46,920
Well, there's nobody willing
to buy 1000 shares at $100.

29
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,830
So, the exchange again, is going to have
to add this order to it's order book.

30
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,670
And this will be our first ask.

31
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:58,600
We've got now our first ask
as part of our order book.

32
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,650
Now let's say more and
more orders come in.

33
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,050
And it fleshes out our order book a bit.

34
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,700
Here's our order book as it's fleshed
out a bit, as orders have come in.

35
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,260
We've got a number of asks,
which are requests to sell stocks, and

36
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,300
a number of bids,
which are requests to buy.

37
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,570
Suppose now we get a market order
to buy 100 shares of stock.

38
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,470
Here's our new order,
and here's what happens.

39
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,880
The Exchange looks at
it's order book and

40
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,860
it sees, yes,
we have lots of shares for sale here.

41
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,860
We have to give the client the lowest
price so we'll give that client

42
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:40,870
100 shares of these that
are priced at $100.

43
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,650
So, that means now we've
only got 900 left here,

44
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:49,920
we take that 100, give that to
the client who put in the order and

45
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,190
this is the state now of our order
book after that transaction.
