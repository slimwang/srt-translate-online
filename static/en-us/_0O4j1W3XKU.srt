00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
HTML stands for the "hypertext markup language."

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Many of you may have some previous experience with HTML,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
but that's not necessary.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
HTML as w know it was invented to Tim Berners-Lee,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
a British computer scientist working in Switzerland around 1990.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
For our purposes, HTML just tells a web browser how to display a webpage.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
In fact, HTML is not all that different from using symbols like stars or underscores

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
to emphasis text that you're writing to someone else.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
In HTML this emphasized plain text becomes "I,"

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and then this special punctuation that means let's do some bold now, "really,"

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
this special punctuation that means I'm done with bold, let's go back to normal,

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and then "like you." The "b" stands for "bold."

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let's go see how that pans out.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Here in this particular window, I'm showing the raw HTML source on the left

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and how it might look in a web browser on the right.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Here when I've added the bold tags around really, we see "I really like you."

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The "really" is rendered in bold.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Other comment approaches in HTML for emphasis are the use of underlines, the "u,"

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and italics, "i." Each one of these is called a "tag."

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This special syntax with the "b" in angle brackets and the "b" sort of similar angle brackets,

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
the "u," the closing "u," the "i," the closing "i,"

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
is a tag that's associated with that word, or that span of text,

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and tells the web browser how to render it.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
This part here, the left angle bracket and the right angle bracket--

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
that's a starting tag, and this other part--the left angle bracket followed by a slash,

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
the slash is super important, begin an end tag.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That's a little complicated to say.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Mark the start of an ending tag and tell you that the current tag is about to stop.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Here's a beginning bold tag. Here's an ending bold tag.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You can see that play out on the right. Only the word "really" is bolded.
