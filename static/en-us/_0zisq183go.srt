1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,720
Cascading authorizations occur when
access is propagated multiple times,

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,920
as we said, from Alice to Bob
to Charlie to whoever else.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,370
And it's just a matter here where
Alice is granting it to Bob,

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,500
who further grants it to Charlie.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,680
Now Alice is revoking access from Bob.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,460
So, we're saying,
what should happen to Charlie's access?

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,850
Remember, Charlie got
access because of Bob.

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,560
When we revoke it from Bob,
how should we handle Charlie's access?

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,810
That's the question.

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,680
Question's asking, should we also revoke
Charlie's access or we should not?
