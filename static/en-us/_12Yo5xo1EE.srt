00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,510
Here are the three expressions. Great work if you got each of these correct.

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:09,990
When we multiply bases, we add these exponents together. So x to the a times x

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:16,415
to the b equals x to the a plus b. And when we raise a power to another power,

4
00:00:16,415 --> 00:00:22,514
we really multiply these exponents. So to the a raised to the power equals x to

5
00:00:22,514 --> 00:00:27,858
the a times b. And finally, when we divide the same base, we subtract the

6
00:00:27,858 --> 00:00:34,168
exponents. We have x to the a minus b. Now, keep in mind that the logarithm of

7
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:38,320
a number is an exponent. So, we know that these properties are going to have

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,708
some sort of relationship with logarithms. Let's look at some examples and

9
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:43,600
figure it out.
