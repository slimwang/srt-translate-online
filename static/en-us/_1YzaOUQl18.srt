00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,330
Congratulations on getting your
hands dirty with responsive images.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,110
You're on your way to a workflow,
that allows you to easily

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:11,590
create websites with high quality
images with as few bites as possible.

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,810
>> And in the next lesson, you'll
actually approach responsive images

5
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:19,480
using techniques that, well,
allow you to avoid using images at all.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,470
You might be surprised by
the number of options available for

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,580
situations where images
no longer seem necessary.

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,710
You'll explore some image alternatives
using simple mark-up techniques.

9
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,350
>> See you then.

10
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:30,850
>> Yeah.
