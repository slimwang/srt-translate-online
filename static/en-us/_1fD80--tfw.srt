Well, what's a role? That is, what's number one. A role is an interface for

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,980
a connector, which is answer B. Open semantic framework. That's an export format

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,120
for use by automatic reasoners. A family, well, that's a means for

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,490
defining architectural styles. Properties. Properties are name value pairs for

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,045
exporting information and ACME descriptions through external tools.

6
00:00:24,045 --> 00:00:29,270
Rep-map. That's a binding mechanism when we're doing vertical decomposition.

00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,270
Finally, port. Port is a component interface.
