00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here's the game tree for another stochastic game.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This game involves flipping a coin.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The chance nodes have two results: heads or tails.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Then the player Max has two possible moves, A and B,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and the player Min has two possible moves, C and D.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This game is too small to have any alpha-beta pruning involved,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
but I've listed all the terminal values for the terminal states of the game.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What I want you to do is fill in the non-terminal values

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
for the chances nodes, the max nodes, and the min nodes

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
according to the rules of minimum value and maximum value and expected value.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I should say that the probability of the coin flip is 50% heads and 50% tails.
