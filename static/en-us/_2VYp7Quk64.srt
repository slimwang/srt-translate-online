00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,400
Let's take an example,
the task of detection.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,020
Imagine you have a camera in your
car looking at the street ahead.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,210
You want to detect where
pedestrians are in front of you, so

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,590
that you don't hit them.

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,050
How would you use
a classifier to do that?

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,820
Type in what approach you would
take in the box provided.
