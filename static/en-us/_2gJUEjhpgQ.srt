In this problem for Unit 5, I want you to implement the control algorithm that you saw

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
in sections 2 and 15 of Unit 5 for the hydraulic braking system.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We've set up a number of important values for you, as always,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
including two things called low slip and high slip.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
These are both possible values for the real slip.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
If the real slip gets smaller than low slip, we want you to decrease the pressure of the brakes.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Similarly, if the real slip gets higher than high slip, we wan you to increase the pressure.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Increasing and decreasing the pressure like this leads to rate of change called hydraulic speed

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
in the strength p of the brake.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hydraulic speed is shown right here while p the braking strength which you can see right here

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
is measured as the deceleration of the velocity at the rim of the wheel

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
if there is no friction from the road.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Possibly logical, the strength of the brake cannot be a negative number

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and we've set the maximum value that it can take on with this constant called max brake right here.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You're going to need most of the contents of the for loop inside this function,

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
but there are a couple of line left that we want you to write.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We want you to model how the brake pressure changes between these maximum and minimum

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
values that we outlined above, and using these, how the brake acceleration changes step by step.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This might require a little bit of creativity, so if you need some hints, come to the forums.
