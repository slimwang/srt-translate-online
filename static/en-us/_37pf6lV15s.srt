1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Narrator] And here's my solution.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I initialized the robot--my robot--using the function robot.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I set the coordinates to be 30, 50, and pi/2.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I then apply the motion command, assign the result to my robot again

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
with minus pi/2 and 15.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I print the measurement values.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I move again, and I print the measurement filters again,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and when I hit run,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
this is exactly what I get.
