00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,760
The two possible values for the font-style property are italic and normal.

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,800
Also, in order to make the text look bold,

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,250
you would use the font weight property.

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:18,920
Looking at this in the CSS documentation, we find under the values heading,

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,200
we can set values normal, italic and oblique.

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:30,300
And in the documentation for the font-weight property under Values we can find

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,769
normal, bold, lighter, bolder and set a numeric font-weight.
