Hey Jessica,
I just had a chat with Tommy, and

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,759
he's wondering where the app is.

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:07,733
>> Well, we don't have it just yet,
but there's a good reason for that.

4
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:08,573
>> Okay.

5
00:00:08,573 --> 00:00:10,368
>> So,
first we had to lay the foundation for

6
00:00:10,368 --> 00:00:14,080
our students, teaching them SQLite
statements in the command line.

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,390
And now we're ready to take what
they learned in the command line and

8
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,570
move it into the pet's app.

9
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,390
So in lesson two right now, we'll focus
on how to create a database in the app,

10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,100
and then learn how to insert and
then query data from it.

11
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,430
>> Okay, sounds like you've
got it all under control.

12
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,450
>> Yeah.
>> All right, good,

13
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,880
because we don't want to make Tommy mad.

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,590
>> That's true,
he's really scary when he's mad.

15
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:31,704
>> Yeah.

16
00:00:31,704 --> 00:00:34,001
>> Actually how about in the mean
time we give him this snack?

17
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:35,276
>> Okay, good idea.

18
00:00:35,276 --> 00:00:37,436
Hey Tommy, do you want a snack?

19
00:00:37,436 --> 00:00:38,955
Good boy.

20
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:39,860
What pet's app?
