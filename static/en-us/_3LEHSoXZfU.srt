1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,460
So the specific objectives
of this lesson are,

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:07,950
first we will review what video textures
are and panoramas, very briefly.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,320
Then we'll talk about how we can
combine these to create a panoramic

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,500
video texture.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,840
We'll learn about how we can actually
construct a panorama from video,

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,580
again remembering that the in the video
there might be dynamic motion.

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,340
Some things might be changing.

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,430
And again, how are we going to use that
part of the scene that is dynamically

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,510
changing and
construct a video texture from it.
