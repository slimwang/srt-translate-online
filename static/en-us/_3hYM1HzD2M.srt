00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let me summarize some observations that we made in this unit about the complexity of models.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
For instance, in the SIR and SEIR models, we worked with fractional population numbers.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We didn't care whether or not the numbers of persons are integers.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
In the SEIR model, we used an average amount of latency.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We did not build in a fix delay and we assumed perfect mixing.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
There is no geographical distribution, there is no age distribution, there are no isolated towns.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
One of the advantages of the simple models we looked at in this unit is that we were able to derive

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
general statements such as the existence of Herd Immunity.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Of course, we have to be careful.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
A general statement about a cartoonish model may not be that helpful, and the simple equations

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
that we've got from these models are helpful in may ways.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 99:59:59,999
For instance, when it comes to working with implicit methods such as the big foot Euler method.
