1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,270
So, you've seen some examples of how
API's can work within the same machine.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,210
But what this course is
really going to focus on,

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,950
is how API's can enable communication
between several machines.

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,630
This is where Web API's
come into the picture.

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,580
Simply put, Web API's make it possible
to invoke the execution of code

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,670
on another machine via the Internet.

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:21,810
A machine can use multiple web
APIs to create a new application,

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,610
sometimes called a Mashup,

9
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:27,550
providing users with a new experience
that leverages existing applications.

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,100
Soon, you'll be making
a Mashup of your own.

11
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,930
But why is all this important?

12
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,035
And what do companies gain by allowing
their content to be accessible via

13
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,220
API's?

14
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,010
By opening up code over the Internet,

15
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,890
API providers are not only helping other
developers who want to use their code,

16
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,355
but are also promoting
their own business.

17
00:00:44,355 --> 00:00:48,870
API's for social media applications, for
example, allow users to share content,

18
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,410
logins, and personalized data
between web applications.

19
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,110
Gaining popularity, and giving users
more functionality with their accounts.

20
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,210
This means more traffic,
and more users for

21
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,710
social media applications
with publicly available APIs.

22
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,650
So, implementing accessible web API's,

23
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:07,150
isn't only just a nice thing to do,
it's also a lucrative investment for

24
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,320
many companies, and in some cases
a companies proprietary money stream.

25
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,090
An example of a company that depends
heavily on it's API, is Twilio.

26
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,760
A cloud communications company that
allows developers to make, and

27
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,910
receive phone calls, and text
messages using its web server's API.

28
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:25,570
Twilio has free, and
paid access versions of their API,

29
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,800
forming a key revenue stream for
the company.

30
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,780
Check out Twilio's developer's sight,
and see all the features of their API.
