1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,400
At this point, you might have some questions.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,400
You might be wondering if GitPull is the same as fetching and then merging.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,610
Why haven't our previous pulls generated merge commits like this one did?

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,040
It's a fair question.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,220
The answer is fast-forward merges.

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,900
This kind of merge occurs when you merge two commits,

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,130
where one is ancestor of the other.

8
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,330
That is, where one commit is reachable by the other.

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,730
If all merges happened the way we've been showing you so

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:32,720
far, if you took b and tried to merge it into a, then you would end up

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:38,190
with a merge commit that had both commits as a parent, and you would move a.

12
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,260
In the usual case, merge commits are generated to keep track of

13
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,210
all the commits that played a part in getting to this new stage.

14
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:49,070
But in this case, the commits that played those parts are this one and this one.

15
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:53,540
And this commit already has all the information about this one's history.

16
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,150
So there's not actual reason to add this extra one.

17
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,330
So instead of adding a new commit,

18
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,610
all we would do is update the label to point here instead.

19
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,180
Hopefully, at this point the name fast-forward merge makes sense.

20
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,900
We're taking a label from the history of a branch somewhere in its ancestry, and

21
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,830
moving that label forward to the tip of the branch.

22
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,280
Take a look at these commit histories.

23
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,120
Check the box next to each diagram,

24
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,970
where merging branch b into Branch a would result in a fast-forward merge.
