1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,019
So accelerators are interesting,
there are a lot of accelerators.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,760
There's accelerators that
universities have put together,

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,430
that corporations have put together,
and then there's the sort of private

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:14,750
investment vehicle accelerators like
Y Combinator, and there's a lot of them.

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,340
The interesting thing about
accelerators is the jury's still out

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,020
on the efficacy of accelerators.

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,980
There's a huge question out there of, if
a company goes to an accelerator program

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,660
or doesn't go to an accelerator program,
what are the odds of success?

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,300
Does an accelerate or
increase the likelihood of success?

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,760
And there's a lot of research going on
in that at Yael Hochberg at MIT and

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,430
Susan Cohen at the University of
Richmond are publishing all kinds of

12
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,540
papers, based on this
using crunch based data.

13
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,450
And we saw a recent study from U.C.

14
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:51,030
Berkeley, which showed that while
it's still difficult to tell whether

15
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,080
accelerators increase
the odds of success,

16
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,510
one thing that accelerators are doing is
they're making companies fail faster.

17
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:02,800
Because the mentors and the feedback
that the entrepreneurs are getting

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,720
help everybody understand,
is this a problem that's worth solving?

19
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,890
Is this a business that's
going to make it or not?

20
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,520
And it's moving much faster within
the environment of an accelerator

21
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,830
versus outside of an accelerator.

22
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,070
So that is something that
definitely has been proven thus.
