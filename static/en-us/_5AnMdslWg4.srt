00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,400
Okay, great. Let's do a quiz having to do with

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,960
data consistency. Now in this case, we're going to look at

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,410
stock symbols for three different companies over a period of

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,010
several years. This is an example drawn from the Bad Data

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:16,170
Handbook. Spencer Burns, in his chapter, When Data and Reality

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,700
Don't Match, tells this story having to do with unique identifiers

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,820
for a few different companies that are publicly traded. So for

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,760
most of the 20th century, stock symbols for Kmart and Sears

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,110
were KM and S, respectively. Sprint also, during the time

10
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,520
it was a company during the 20th century, had the stock

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,600
symbol, FON, or FON. So now, let's take a look at

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,090
what happened with regard to these unique identifiers for companies as

13
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,410
we move forward in time. And, what I want you

14
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,780
to think about is; what type of challenges might this present

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,300
to us from a consistency standpoint, and thinking about auditing data

16
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:51,400
and cleaning data. So, in 2002, Kmart filed for bankruptcy and

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,320
was then delisted as a stock. In 2003, they recovered from bankruptcy,

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,908
were relisted, but this time with the stock symbol KMRT. In 2005,

19
00:01:00,908 --> 00:01:05,968
Kmart and Sears merged and so all former shares of Kmart

20
00:01:05,968 --> 00:01:12,030
became SHLD, or Sears Holdings, as did Sears stock.

21
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,979
And then later that year, Sprint changed its stock symbol

22
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,210
from FON to S. So, over a period of

23
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,650
several years, three different companies were uniquely identified by

24
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:28,140
five different stock symbols. And in fact, two companies

25
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,850
were, depending on which point in time you're talking

26
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,040
about, uniquely identified by the same stock symbol. Now

27
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,910
when we talk about these being unique identifiers, we

28
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,410
should really be using air quotes. It's this kind

29
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:41,980
of problem that we'll often face, when we are looking

30
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,930
at data collected from different points in time.

31
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,500
The identifiers for specific entities have a tendency to

32
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,830
change. Now this type of data is actually

33
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,950
fairly difficult to find. So, in this quiz what

34
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,580
we're going to do is look at something

35
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,035
similar, having to do with when countries joined the

36
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:02,370
eurozone and what that means for what currency

37
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,720
they were using at a given point in time.
