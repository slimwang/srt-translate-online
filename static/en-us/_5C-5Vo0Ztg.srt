1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Well, let's go try them out.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This "put your finger on the state method" is actually pretty much how you do it.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You start here in the start state, and then we see an a,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
so we move over here.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We see a 1. We move over here.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We're out of input in an accepting state. This totally works!

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
How about 'aa'?

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We start in state 1. We see an a. Great! We move to state 2.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We see the next a--oh! We fall off the finite state machine and die. No such luck.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
'2b'--we start here in state 1. We see a 2. We immediately fall off and die. Not very good.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The empty string--we start in state 1. We don't go anywhere because we're out of input.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
But state 1 is not an accepting state, so we don't accept this string.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
'cc3'--start here in state 1. We see a c. We go to state 2. We see another c. We fall off.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
'44d'--we start here in state 1. We see a 4. We fall off immediately.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,481
In fact, only 'a1' matched out of all of these.
