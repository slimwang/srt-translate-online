00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,458
First, we subtract 12 from both sides to get x squared plus 6x equals negative

2
00:00:04,458 --> 00:00:09,308
12. The b value is positive 6, so we need to add b over 2 squared, or 9, to

3
00:00:09,308 --> 00:00:14,375
both sides of our equation. This allows us to rewrite the left side as a

4
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:20,850
perfect square. X plus 3 squared. The right side just simplifies to negative 3.

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,446
Next we take the square root of both sides of the equation to get x plus 3

6
00:00:24,446 --> 00:00:30,318
equals plus or minus the square root of negative 3. This square root simplifies

7
00:00:30,318 --> 00:00:34,874
to plus or minus i root 3. It's an imaginary root here, since this radicand is

8
00:00:34,874 --> 00:00:40,125
negative. Finally, we subtract 3 from both sides to get x is equal to negative

9
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:45,618
3 plus or minus i times root 3. Our final answers. Excellent work if you found

10
00:00:45,618 --> 00:00:47,760
these two imaginary solutions.
