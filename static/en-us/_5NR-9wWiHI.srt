00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,750
What's more, the average webpage makes
a whopping 56 requests for images.

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,640
Every one of those image requests
has a cost in terms of page load.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,195
And studies by Google, Amazon, and
others have shown that even very small

4
00:00:15,195 --> 00:00:20,132
delays in loading pages can result in a
significant loss of traffic and revenue.

5
00:00:20,132 --> 00:00:25,075
Here we see from Google that
a 0.4 to 0.9 second increase

6
00:00:25,075 --> 00:00:28,974
resulted in traffic and
ad revenues down by 20%.

7
00:00:28,974 --> 00:00:32,682
And for Amazon, every 100 millisecond

8
00:00:32,682 --> 00:00:37,529
increase in page load time
means a loss of sales of 1%.
