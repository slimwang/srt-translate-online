Let's try another problem. This time, you're going to fill in some of the steps

2
00:00:03,802 --> 00:00:07,437
along the way. I'm going to start this by writing each number in scientific

3
00:00:07,437 --> 00:00:11,352
notation. Once we have our scientific notation, we can rearrange our terms to

4
00:00:11,352 --> 00:00:15,246
group the numbers together, and the powers of 10 together. What would be the

5
00:00:15,246 --> 00:00:17,970
exponent for our power of 10? Enter your answer here.
