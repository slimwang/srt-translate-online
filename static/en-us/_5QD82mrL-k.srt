1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,106
>> I second that. Thank you very A and L Creations, this is a wonderful addition

2
00:00:03,106 --> 00:00:06,916
to the event. So now it's time to move into our chemical senses.

3
00:00:06,916 --> 00:00:09,489
>> Wait. Andy, should I be worried? Should I be, are things going to be blowing

4
00:00:09,489 --> 00:00:10,465
up? What's going on?

5
00:00:10,465 --> 00:00:13,552
>> Lauren, before you run to get your hazmat suit, the chemical senses are just

6
00:00:13,552 --> 00:00:17,960
senses that are based on the reception of chemicals. So for example, your sense

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,852
of smell or your sense of taste.

8
00:00:19,852 --> 00:00:23,614
>> Oh. So, with smell, the tiny particles that go up your nose and that are

9
00:00:23,614 --> 00:00:25,915
detected by your smell receptors?

10
00:00:25,915 --> 00:00:30,430
>> Exactly. And something pretty similar for taste, actually. let's actually go to

11
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:35,081
Susan, who is, yep, sounds like she's on location at the taste-off now.

12
00:00:35,081 --> 00:00:39,762
>> Thank you, Andy. Although the taste-off will focus on our senseletes' ability

13
00:00:39,762 --> 00:00:44,129
to activate their 10,000 tastebuds. The person who's going to excel in this

14
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:47,555
competition is the one who also activates their smell receptors.

15
00:00:47,555 --> 00:00:51,331
>> It's truly amazing how our perception of taste actually depends on the

16
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:54,045
sensation of taste and smell.

17
00:00:54,045 --> 00:00:58,820
>> It really is. How is it possible that these two seemingly different senses are

18
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,015
so intimately related?

19
00:01:01,015 --> 00:01:04,039
>> Well Andy, that's because both taste and smell are processed up here, in the

20
00:01:04,039 --> 00:01:08,837
frontal lobes of our brain. For the taste-off the contestants are going to have

21
00:01:08,837 --> 00:01:14,266
to identify samples that contain each of the five basic flavors. These are

22
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:19,863
sweet, salty, sour, savory and bitter. To do this we'll be using the following

23
00:01:19,863 --> 00:01:25,472
ingredients. Sugar, salt, lemon, MSG, and tonic water.

24
00:01:25,472 --> 00:01:31,703
>> And Susan, which ingredient is going to correspond to which flavor?
