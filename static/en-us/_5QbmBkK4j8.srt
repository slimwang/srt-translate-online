1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,130
Buy a bicycle will be logged.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,700
Backbone's trigger-events method passes
arguments to the callback function,

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,920
using call.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,860
So each item should
have its own parameter.

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,750
Since bicycle is first, bit's stored
in presence and gets logged out.

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,880
It's important to realize
that both sword and

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,720
clarinet are sent along with
bicycle into the callback function.

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,130
They just aren't stored or used.
