1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,160
That was a big one.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,830
I think your boss would be proud of the
progress you've made on this prototype.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,730
Here's one last request though,
she wants to see two new features.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,790
She doesn't want to hold you back just
create what you think would add the most

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,920
value to this application.

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,940
Then, after making sure that your
code quality is up to snuff, and

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,060
that your code runs as expected,
your boss, and

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:27,320
the Udacity code reviewers, want to know
what you learned during this process.

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,350
In your project repository, we want
you to create a reflections file, and

10
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,960
write about your experiences
working on this.

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,610
We want you to answer
the following questions.

12
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,080
How long did you spend
working on this project?

13
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,880
What was the most rewarding
challenge you conquered?

14
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,550
What new features did you build and why?

15
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,330
And where do you still have room for
growth?

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,570
Lastly take a step back and
look at what you've just created and

17
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,800
compare this to Toy City One.

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,770
It may feel like there's still a long
way to go before you're making web apps.

19
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,690
But just look how far you've come.

20
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,540
Keep this momentum up and way to go.
