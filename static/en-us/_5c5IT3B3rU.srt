1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
[Narrator] The first 3 questions on this homework is so that you understand conditional probability.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
For these 3 questions, we are going to use the relative frequencies of vowels in English,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and I'm giving you those results as a percentage of all the letters in a sample of typical English text.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You can assume that 13% of all letters in the text are the letter E,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
8% are A, 7% are O, 7% are I, and 3% are U.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Obviously, this is not a very audacious sample of English text.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
For question 1, assume some letter X is drawn randomly from English text

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
with the same distribution as we've collected here.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Give the value of the probability that X is a vowel.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Your answer should be in the range from 0-1,

11
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
so a real number where 0 means it could never occur, 1 means it always occurs.
