1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,218
So the 2 algorithms that we're going to look at are by Hillis and Steele and by Blelloch.

2
00:00:04,218 --> 00:00:07,395
Both of them are going to be more efficient than the implementation we just saw,

3
00:00:07,395 --> 00:00:09,882
but they have different performance characteristics.

4
00:00:09,882 --> 00:00:13,131
What we'll learn is that Hillis and Steele's formulation of scan

5
00:00:13,131 --> 00:00:15,779
is more step-efficient than Blelloch's,

6
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:19,296
but Blelloch's formulation is more work-efficient than Hillis and Steele's.

7
00:00:19,296 --> 00:00:21,903
They're both quite relevant today in parallel computing,

8
00:00:21,903 --> 00:00:25,105
and I hope you find their implementations as interesting as I do.
