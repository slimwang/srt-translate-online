1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,588
So my gut says I should group by, by date

2
00:00:03,588 --> 00:00:07,790
first? Because I'm, when I think about this, it's thinking like

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,480
how many tickets were sold this month and then within

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,050
that month, how would those tickets distribute? How many were each?

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,020
>> And you're right. You should be grouping

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,092
by date first because that's the overarching categorization.

7
00:00:20,092 --> 00:00:20,604
>> Okay.

8
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:25,580
>> So. Grab the purchase date field and then drag it above.

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:25,820
>> Above.

10
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,160
>> Ticket type.

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:26,860
>> Oh, cool.

12
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:32,360
>> Yeah, but, the thing right now with purchase date is it's everyday.

13
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:32,549
>> Everyday.

14
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:33,510
>> And we don't want that.

15
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,680
>> We want to do it by month.

16
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,530
>> Right. So, if we, click that little arrow,

17
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,100
and then Group by Dates, or Group Dates By.

18
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:40,820
>> Yes, that's awesome.

19
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:41,320
>> Calendar month.

20
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:46,430
>> Alright, so October had 20. One which is VIP, that's awesome. Okay.

21
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,000
>> So again this is just a preview. So don't

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,985
freak out if it doesn't show all of the records.

23
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,040
because I know sometimes people do.

24
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,160
>> Okay, should I hit Save and then?

25
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,390
>> Yeah click Save always.

26
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:56,550
>> As.

27
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,370
>> Save As, yeah. That was close.

28
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,490
>> Okay,

29
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:01,420
>> Total revenue over time.

30
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,830
>> Yeah, I'll say by monthly.

31
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,050
>> Oh, by month. Yup.

32
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,990
>> Save and Run?

33
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,254
>> Save and Run.

34
00:01:08,254 --> 00:01:11,650
>> Oh, that's so cool. So we've got May 2013,

35
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:16,970
we had 14 VIP tickets and 17 General Admission. June,

36
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,590
a lot of people bought tickets. All right, this is very cool. So

37
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,780
now I, I mean I want to make a chart. I'm going to fool around.
