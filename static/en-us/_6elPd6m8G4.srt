1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,800
Another way of thinking of this is
that tracking is just an induction,

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,860
a process, right?

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,899
An induction, like for math is if I know
how to do n then I know how to do n + 1.

4
00:00:09,899 --> 00:00:14,450
When you show what the sum of a
geometric series is or things like that,

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,750
you tend to prove these things by
induction or something like that.

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,500
So for induction,
you have to have a starting case,

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,120
a base case so you have some
guess as to how things start.

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,670
Maybe for our tracking,
we have some distribution.

9
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,990
It could be a very
uncertain distribution.

10
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:34,390
And then, with that first frame,
we take a measurement, y zero and

11
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,550
then we would correct our estimate.

12
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,290
And then we just keep
iterating through this.

13
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,220
Right?
So,

14
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:43,870
At every time t, we make a prediction
for time t plus 1, take a measurement,

15
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,660
and we correct for time t plus 1.

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,680
And somebody spent a lot of time
designing these beautiful arrows, so

17
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,560
I wanted to make sure you saw them too.

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,840
And if you go take a look all over
the internet, you'll find these arrows.
