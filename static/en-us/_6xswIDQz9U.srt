00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,570
In this part of the course, we will use two notations, mathematical logic and

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:09,210
OCL. The brand of mathematical logic we will use is called by various names,

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:15,120
including first order logic, FOL, and predicate calculus. You should be familiar

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,100
with FOL from your undergraduate computer science courses. If you need a brush

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,810
up, there's a paper on the class resources page you can look at. Also for

6
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:29,600
purposes of this lesson, we will use a textual syntax for FOL that is described

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,830
on another paper on the class resources page. As a reminder, FOL enables you to

8
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:40,320
precisely express propositions, combine them using logical connectives like and,

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,030
or, or not. And quantify them using the operators for all and there exists.
