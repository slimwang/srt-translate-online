1
00:00:00,276 --> 00:00:01,930
Well now we're getting somewhere.

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:05,469
All we have to do is run 
those table creation queries

3
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:09,763
by calling exact sequel 
at the end of our onCreate function.

4
00:00:09,763 --> 00:00:14,150
But wait, there's another function 
in our SQliteOpenHelper, onUpgrade.

5
00:00:14,246 --> 00:00:16,761
You might think, 
why should I care about those?

6
00:00:16,761 --> 00:00:18,934
I'm not upgrading anything yet.

7
00:00:18,934 --> 00:00:21,751
To make our development lives easier,
we're going to implement

8
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:25,030
the most standard kind 
of onUpgrade there is.

9
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,060
You see onUpgrade only fires

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,093
if you change the version 
of your database.

11
00:00:29,093 --> 00:00:31,085
Now remember, we passed that version

12
00:00:31,085 --> 00:00:35,356
into the SQliteOpenHelper 
base constructor, ages ago.

13
00:00:35,356 --> 00:00:39,279
Since we are going to be using
our database as a cache for web data

14
00:00:39,279 --> 00:00:42,793
and not for user generated content, 
we'll drop the tables.

15
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,377
This is helpful if we want to change 
the database in the future.

16
00:00:46,482 --> 00:00:48,279
If we were using user data,

17
00:00:48,279 --> 00:00:51,709
we'd do something like use alter table
to add new columns.

18
00:00:51,709 --> 00:00:54,018
So, now we have a database.
