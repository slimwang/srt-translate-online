1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,140
Okay, so here are two other
tables in the zoo database.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,510
The first one, taxonomy,
gives the scientific names for

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,300
all our animal species.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,700
We've been using the common names
like brown bear in our other tables.

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,680
This table gives not quite the full
taxonomic name but a lot of it.

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,940
The brown bear is genus Ursus.

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,760
Species arctos.

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,740
And the family Ursidae.

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,740
And the oder Carnivora.

10
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,730
We have to call this column
t_order instead of order,

11
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,700
because order is a reserved
word in SQL for order buy.

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,820
The t is for taxonomy.

13
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,710
And if we look in this table over here,
we'll see the common names for

14
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,330
all of the orders.

15
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,060
Bats belong in the order Chiroptera and
lizards and

16
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,580
snakes belong to the order Squamata.

17
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:50,730
and llamas and moose and warthogs all
belong to the order Artiodactyla.

18
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:51,850
Okay, okay, so

19
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,850
really these tables are just here
to give you more stuff to join.

20
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,290
Big surprise.

21
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:00,060
This time we want to find out which
orders have the most individual animals

22
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,040
in the zoo, and we want to give
their common names like monotremes,

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,860
instead of their scientific
names like monotremata.

24
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,390
So you'll probably need to use both
of those tables, the taxonomy and

25
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:15,090
the order names table, plus the animals
table with the individual animals in it.

26
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,090
So the problem is, to list the taxonomic
orders by their common names,

27
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:23,200
sorted by how many individual animals
we have of each order in the zoo.

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,000
To see the full schemas the tables,
take a look at the instructor notes.
