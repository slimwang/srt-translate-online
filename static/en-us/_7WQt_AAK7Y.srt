00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,210
There are several ways to look
at different intrusion detection

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,470
approaches.

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,390
From the point of view of
how data is analyzed, or

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,340
how intrusion is detected,
we have two approaches.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,720
One is misuse detection,
also known as signature-based detection.

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,580
The other one is anomaly detection.

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:23,690
Misuse detection models all
represents long intrusions.

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:28,410
Anomaly detection models all
represents normal activities.

9
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,970
From the point of view
of deployment strategy,

10
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:35,680
we can deploy an IDS on end host,
or a network perimeter.

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,070
In terms of how the detection
models are viewed and

12
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,210
maintained, we can use manual
encoding of expert knowledge.

13
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,570
All hand written rules, or
we can apply machine running

14
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,550
algorithms to data to automatically
learn the detection rules.
