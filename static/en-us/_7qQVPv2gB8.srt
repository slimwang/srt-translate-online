1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,730
So that's a description of mean
shift as applied to segmentation.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,400
It's a, it's a, I will tell you
it's a very strong technique.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,970
The cool thing is it automatically
finds these basins of attraction.

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,320
So, you don't have to tell
it how many modes there are.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,140
You just tell it, in fact there's
one parameter choice essentially,

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,003
which is that window size,
how big that Gaussian is.

7
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:22,780
There's also, when you talk about that,
because you're operating in a feature

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,730
space, you actually have
a distance function, right?

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,730
because when my Gaussian is over
some distance, so if I want to scale

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,060
color more than texture, oh, texture,
we haven't talked about that yet.

11
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,365
All right, we'll do that next.

12
00:00:34,365 --> 00:00:37,985
Or color more than luminance you
make that decision ahead of time.

13
00:00:37,985 --> 00:00:40,945
So, there's this parameter
choice of window size, but

14
00:00:40,945 --> 00:00:44,435
there's also a, a general
distance metric function choice.

15
00:00:44,435 --> 00:00:47,472
But you have that in every sort
of clustering that you do.

16
00:00:47,472 --> 00:00:49,962
It doesn't make any assumptions
about the shape of the,

17
00:00:49,962 --> 00:00:53,082
the segment in the image, or the cluster
in the image, it just does this in the,

18
00:00:53,082 --> 00:00:55,812
the probability of
the distribution of the pixels.

19
00:00:55,812 --> 00:00:58,742
And it's a very generic technique for
finding multiple modes,

20
00:00:58,742 --> 00:01:01,552
and people use mean shift for
a variety of things like tracking,

21
00:01:01,552 --> 00:01:05,251
when we actually talked
about doing that previously.

22
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:09,042
You know, as in anything else
there are some down sides.

23
00:01:09,042 --> 00:01:10,881
It does depend on this window size, and

24
00:01:10,881 --> 00:01:13,612
sometimes figuring out that
window size is a bit of an art,

25
00:01:13,612 --> 00:01:17,710
with respect to the nature of the set
of the images that you're looking at.

26
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:22,310
And, the other problem is, because you
are sort of moving in feature space, oh,

27
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:27,110
and, and, you want to make sure that
you get a reasonable number of points

28
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:31,420
within your, your region of interest
in order to shift the mean.

29
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,542
Well, suppose you've got
a big feature space.

30
00:01:34,542 --> 00:01:38,708
All right, and what I mean by that
is you've got fifty dimensions.

31
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:43,330
Well, almost by definition,
your future space will be sparse, right?

32
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,190
Because the, sort of,
the number of little, if you,

33
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,610
if you let's suppose you carved
up every dimension into,

34
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:53,830
like, ten buckets, well,
if there's fifty dimensions right?

35
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,170
That's ten to the 50th buckets.

36
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,099
So by definition,
there's going to be lots and

37
00:01:58,099 --> 00:02:00,950
lots of buckets that have
hardly any points in them.

38
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,630
So mean shift needs you to
have a reasonable number of

39
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,300
points within that region, so it doesn't
work as well in high dimensions.
