There is a possibility though that you really, really hate fractions. I mean,

2
00:00:03,843 --> 00:00:07,791
really hate them, like you don't want to deal with them at all. This method over

3
00:00:07,803 --> 00:00:11,589
here then is probably not quite your cup of tea. So, there is a different way

4
00:00:11,601 --> 00:00:15,283
that you go about solving this problem. And that way would be to start out by

5
00:00:15,295 --> 00:00:19,058
getting rid of the fraction that's over here on the left-hand side. So, what do

6
00:00:19,058 --> 00:00:23,213
I need to do on each side of the equation right now, in order to end up with the

7
00:00:23,225 --> 00:00:27,242
next version of it having no fractions in it, whatsoever? Please fill in that

8
00:00:27,254 --> 00:00:28,560
operation in these boxes.
