00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,870
I'm back with Kaushik from Locket again,
and

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,570
this time we're going to be discussing
the challenges of measuring things.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,890
So Kaushik, when you were
measuring different metrics,

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:13,220
what sort of barriers or
obstacles did you encounter?

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:13,890
>> Oh, well,

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:18,129
user retention rate was one of the most
difficult things to measure for us.

7
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:23,506
Especially because a lot of users
actually installed our application,

8
00:00:23,506 --> 00:00:27,910
never used it, but because it
was there on the lock screen we

9
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,189
miscalculated them as
always using users.

10
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:35,425
Or we calibrated their retention
rates to be very positive and

11
00:00:35,425 --> 00:00:41,100
very supportive, but in reality they
totally forgot about our application.

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,970
They did not even know that our
application existed over there,

13
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,960
because it was very native and
that's how it was.

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,010
So that was very difficult for
us to measure.

15
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:53,632
We had already a unique way of
measuring the user retention rate.

16
00:00:53,632 --> 00:00:57,360
We'd considered the user engagement
as well as we considered,

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,980
we had a few set of metrics,
which they had to hit every single day

18
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,580
in order to make sure that they
are using the app consistently.

19
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,621
So that was one challenging part.

20
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:08,131
>> Wow.

21
00:01:08,131 --> 00:01:10,377
And what do you think will
be most important for

22
00:01:10,377 --> 00:01:13,669
the company moving forward,
in terms of metrics and measurement?

23
00:01:13,669 --> 00:01:14,828
>> Well, first,

24
00:01:14,828 --> 00:01:20,500
drop off between day 7 to day 14 is
one of the most important metric.

25
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,070
And then number of invites
each user is sending, and

26
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,633
the number of people who
are positively responding for

27
00:01:25,633 --> 00:01:31,400
those invites as well as number,
their respective retention rates and

28
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:38,060
then how the total,
the chain reaction is working.

29
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,730
For example, if we buy users
off someone from Facebook or

30
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,910
if we buy users from different
sources' headquarters.

31
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:48,348
So we want to measure this complete
chain as to how much vital coefficient

32
00:01:48,348 --> 00:01:50,398
it is adding and stuff like that.

33
00:01:50,398 --> 00:01:52,650
So that's one of the most
important things.

34
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:56,390
>> So tell me a little bit about how
you guys go about measuring things and

35
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,280
how did the product
inform what you measured?

36
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,641
And the metrics that you chose,

37
00:02:00,641 --> 00:02:02,969
that you thought were important
to track as a company.

38
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:08,280
>> Right, so we mainly measured
metrics around two broad areas.

39
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,260
One is user retention rate and
user engagement rate.

40
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,336
So user retention rate means day
1 retention, day 7 retention and

41
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:17,130
day 14 retention.

42
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,200
And as we are on lock screen we
are all the time on the screen, and

43
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,280
it is really difficult to find whether
he is using it or no, and he just forgot

44
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,360
about the application after installing,
because it is right on the lock screen.

45
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,928
So user engagement is also
very important metric,

46
00:02:31,928 --> 00:02:34,890
where we measure how many
times he is liking animation.

47
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,410
How many times he is sending
animation to his friends,

48
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,590
or is he receiving images?

49
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:43,400
All these things, so
in the beginning we actually

50
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,660
thought day one retention rate
was very important for this.

51
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,466
But over a period of time, we realized
that it's not day 1 retention rate,

52
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:53,868
it's a drop off from day 7 to day 14,
which is highly important.

53
00:02:53,868 --> 00:02:58,769
Because day one retention rate
actually was the retention rate

54
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:04,310
provided by users who might not
have had friends in Screenpop.

55
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:08,380
But day 7 and
day 14 retention rates were mostly

56
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,320
around who already had
friends in Screenpop,

57
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,730
so they were the people who
actually sent a lot of invites.

58
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,230
They were the people who sent a lot
of messages, as well as images,

59
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,160
to their friends.

60
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,880
So, measuring those were
highly critical for us.

61
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,380
>> Oh, wow.
