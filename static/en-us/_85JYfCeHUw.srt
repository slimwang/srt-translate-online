00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In the quiz, we analyze the stability of the forward Euler method.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Now, we introduce some changes to turn the forward Euler method to backward Euler method.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This method is called an implicit solver. We are going to see why.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The backward Euler method works like this to go from the initial value of x

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
to the value after the first step, it added the step size times the rate of change at times 0.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The backward Euler method works with the rate of change at the end of the first step, x(h).

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Actually, our estimate of the rate of change at the end of the first step.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Keep in mind that I'm writing x(h) but I'm referring to my estimates,

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
the numerical solution of the exact solution.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This means that the value at the end of the first step appears

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
on the left-hand side and on the right-hand side.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This is why this is called an implicit method, we have to solve for x(h).

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's hidden in this equation. It's not explicit so let's solve for x(h).

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
When this term over to the left-hand side, then we have x at the end of the first step

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
plus time step times constant times x at the end of the first step equals the initial value,

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:18,000
we can factor out x(h) and find that x(h) equals the initial value divided by 1+hk.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This is something like 1/1+100 if you choose a really large h which would be 1/101.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
If you form powers of these, they are going to decay pretty quickly

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and there is no oscillation whatsoever, so we have no problem at all with this expression.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's always going to work no matter how large the steps as is.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This is very handy when one tries to solve stiff differential equations.
