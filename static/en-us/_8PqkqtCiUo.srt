1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,880
So now we're ready for a quiz to see

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,730
if you understand the find command with the number as

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,338
the second parameter, as well as indexing and selecting

4
00:00:08,338 --> 00:00:12,390
sub-sequences of strings. And the question is given any string

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,090
variables, so we're going to initialize the variable s to

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,130
hold any string. T to hold any string, and i

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,880
to hold any number, which of the expressions below is

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,870
equivalent to s.find passing in t as the target string

9
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:31,521
ni as the number? So here are the

10
00:00:31,521 --> 00:00:36,385
choices, s index i colon, find t.

11
00:00:36,385 --> 00:00:41,710
S.find t index colon i. S i colon.find

12
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:46,540
t Plus i or s, i colon, find t,

13
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:51,050
i colon. So check all the ones that are always the same as s

14
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:56,400
dot find t, i no matter what s, t, and i are. And for this

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,970
quiz, this is pretty tricky. Try to think

16
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,850
of the answer yourself before trying to run

17
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,080
anything into the Python interpreter. But feel free

18
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,870
to also run things in the Python interpreter

19
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,500
to try to confirm your answer and to see if things behave the way you expect.
