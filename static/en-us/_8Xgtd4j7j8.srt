00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,059
So the answer is over 3,000 years old. Humans

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:07,350
have been using networks like this since at least

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,750
as long as we can record. They might have

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,790
just been networks where people talk to each other, but

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,010
even networks where they were using technology to communicate,

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,349
in this way, go back at least 3,000 years.

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,870
So to give you an idea of how sophisticated

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,280
networks could be over 3,000 years ago, here's a quote

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,260
from Homer's The Iliad, where he's talking about the network

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,890
the ancient Greeks had. And they had a line of

11
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,870
beacons spread over the Greek islands. They could use that

12
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:36,530
to send messages, to warn the neighboring islands when there

13
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,350
was an enemy attacking, and that would tell them to

14
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,470
bring in their ships, that trouble's about to occur. And

15
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,530
Homer was writing this around 800 BC. But what he

16
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,560
was describing are wars that happened over 3,000 years ago.

17
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,100
And Homer wasn't just making this up. The Greeks actually had

18
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,970
such a network. They had a network where soldiers could light a

19
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:59,480
fire on one island and soldiers on another island would see

20
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,980
that fire. Light their own fire that would send a signal to

21
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,870
the next island. The next island would see that and light

22
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,960
its own fire. And they could send messages over great distances this

23
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,400
way. They could send a message over 600 kilometers across the Greek

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,260
islands. So what do you need to make a network like this?
