00:00:00,164 --> 00:00:02,033
So I’ve just told you the difference between

2
00:00:02,033 --> 00:00:04,534
revenue streams and pricing models, but let’s

3
00:00:04,534 --> 00:00:07,652
take a look at an example. So imagine I have

4
00:00:07,652 --> 00:00:10,833
15 sales reps and they cover 27 cities in the

5
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:12,735
United States, and they are traveling all the

6
00:00:12,735 --> 00:00:15,102
time and they work for me. And by the way,

7
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:19,101
my product, its material cost is $99 and I

8
00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:22,504
decided I’m going to add $30 gross margin

9
00:00:22,504 --> 00:00:25,730
on top of it, so I sell the product for $129.

10
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,803
So why don’t you think about this for a second

11
00:00:27,803 --> 00:00:30,868
and tell me, which part was the revenue

12
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:34,617
stream and which part was the pricing tactic.

13
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:37,821
Are the sales reps in 27 cities the revenue stream,

14
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:41,704
or are the cost plus $30 the revenue stream.

15
00:00:41,704 --> 00:00:44,371
Was the pricing tactics the sales rep or

16
00:00:44,371 --> 00:00:48,000
was it the cost plus the gross margin.
