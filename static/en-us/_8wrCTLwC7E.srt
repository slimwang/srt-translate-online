1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the solution that we hear is that you can do a vertex cover

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
with just three vertices, so here's one example.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,200
You could select this one which would cover all of those edges here.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,000
Now we could select this one, covering all those edges.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And, finally, we could select the one down here.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So all edges are covered selecting just three vertices,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,500
and there are alternative solutions but none that contain less than three vertices.

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,500
Now what about over here--here we can find

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,000
a very small vertex cover using just two vertices.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,500
This vertex here, we just don't even need to care about

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,000
because it has no edges that it's connected to.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We can select this one here--it covers all of those edges.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And we can select, for example, this one here.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Or not only for example because this is actually the only possible smallest solution.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,500
So now we did this exercise to see if vertex cover could have any relation

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,500
to clique or independent set.

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,300
So let's have a look back at which vertices were contained

18
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,000
in the largest possible clique in this network,

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and those were four vertices--it was this one here, this one here,

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
this one, and this one.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Not any really apparent relation between the two problems.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This one over here, however, is more interesting

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
because in the largest possible independent set, we had those four here.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So it could seem like vertex cover--those two green vertices here--

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
is exactly the opposite of independent set,

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
so if you have found the largest possible independent set,

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
then you have found the smallest possible vertex cover.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And, indeed, it's actually not that difficult to see that this is always the case.
