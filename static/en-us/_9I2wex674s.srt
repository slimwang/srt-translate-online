00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,682
Now, if we found that 2 plus 3i and 2 minus 3i are both roots of some

2
00:00:03,682 --> 00:00:10,186
polynomial, then we also already know two factors of this polynomial. Those

3
00:00:10,186 --> 00:00:17,300
factors are x minus the quantity 2 plus 3i and x minus the quantity 2 minus 3i.

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,740
If we know that both of these are factors of some polynomial, then they're

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,535
going to be multiplied together to help create it's equation. So, what's an

6
00:00:23,535 --> 00:00:28,472
equation of a polynomial that only has these two factors? I've written them out

7
00:00:28,472 --> 00:00:31,893
as multiplied for you right here. But, I'd like you to expand this

8
00:00:31,893 --> 00:00:35,457
multiplication and simplify, writing the final version of this polynomial in

9
00:00:35,457 --> 00:00:37,229
this blue box.
