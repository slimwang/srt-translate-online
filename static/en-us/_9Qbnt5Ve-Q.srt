1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,760
First of all, let's run our app once so
we can call the preload data method

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,890
that deletes all the previous
contents of the database, and

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,810
then populates it with notebooks and
nodes.

4
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,070
And here we have our preloaded data.

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,020
So let's go to app delegate.

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,500
And let's comment it out.

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,980
As we don't need this anymore, we can
create objects using the app's UI.

8
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,915
So let's comment out pre-load data.

9
00:00:30,915 --> 00:00:34,669
And now, let's go back to the model and
make some modifications.

10
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:41,430
Let's create a new entity for photo
frame with an image data attribute.

11
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,840
We can't save the image
as an instance of UI

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,420
image because core data has
no idea what a UI image is.

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,478
So we have to save it as a binary
type which means [INAUDIBLE].

14
00:00:52,478 --> 00:00:54,760
It's a bit inconvenient but
we'll deal with it later.

15
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,670
Every single note will
have a photo frame and

16
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,150
each photo frame might
have a single image data.

17
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:08,630
This property is going to be
optional as it could be empty but

18
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,810
every note will have an image data.

19
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:15,670
So now we have to create
the relationships between note and

20
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,200
photo free.

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,000
It can't be optional because every
note must have a photo so off it goes.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,650
And the deletion rule should be when we
delete a node, we delete the PhotoFrame.

23
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,770
So it should be Cascade.

24
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,420
Now let's go back to PhotoFrame and
create the inverse relationship.

25
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,010
This should not be optional
because a photo frame

26
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,560
should not exist if it's
not connected to a note.

27
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,555
And when we delete a photo frame,
what should we do to the note?

28
00:01:47,555 --> 00:01:50,180
Nothing so nullify.

29
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:55,770
Okay so let's save and
run our app and see what happens and

30
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:01,000
it looks like we have an error and
this is the reason.

31
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,400
The model used to open
the store is incompatible

32
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,199
with the one used to create this store.

33
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,440
Well we got this error because
we already have saved objects

34
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,030
that match the previous data model,
the one that didn't have a photo frame.

35
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,650
Now we changed this model but

36
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:25,410
we forgot to tell core data how to
migrate the older data to the new form.

37
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,320
Fortunately, this is quite easy.

38
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,649
So think about it and

39
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:33,510
make sure you can't reproduce this on
your own project and we'll fix it.
