00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Alright, so you've just finished learning how to specify tokens for languages

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
like HTML and JavaScript.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
At this point, you might be thinking, boy, so those HTML and JavaScript designers

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
did not make pretty tokens.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I just want to mention an experience from my own life. It could be much worse.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I once had the opportunity to work on software that did, let's say, collaborative edits.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Say that a bunch of people wanted to make changes to a book like Pride and Prejudice

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
by Jane Austin.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Suppose that you really want to make it about pandas instead of people,

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and I really want to make Mr. Darcy nicer because he's a bit snappish in the book

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
as it stands.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
In theory, we should be able to apply both of these edits together as long as they

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
don't conflict and then someone could download that new version of the book

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and read it with happy pandas all around.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Because I didn't know much about language design at the time,

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I made all of these editing commands very long and very verbose,

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
including 1 key word token that now lives in infamy for me--

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
BUT<u>ONLY</u>IF<u>IT</u>CHANGES--all separated by underscores, 1 word, must be capital letters,

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
which meant oh, if there's nothing that would change in this scene,

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
for example, because it doesn't have Mr. Darcy in it,

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
there's no way to make him happier,

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
then don't do anything so that people don't think they have to redownload the book

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
or redownload that chapter.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Because I didn't have any experience with language design,

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I made this super long token name, and now I'm stuck with it forever.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You, too, can find it on Google if you search.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So although it may seem now like HTML and JavaScript are totally arbitrary,

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
in fact, some effort has gone into making them concise and relatively easy.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I just wanted to mention that it could be worse. I know from personal experience.
