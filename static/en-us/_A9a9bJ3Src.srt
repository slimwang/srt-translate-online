[Thrun] Once again let's calculate the probability of rain on day 1.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This one is easy because we know it is raining on day 0,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
so it's 0.6, the 0.6 over here.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This expression over here is expanded by a Bayes rule as applied over here.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Probability of happiness during rain is 0.4,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
the probability of rain was said to be just 0.6,

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and we divide by 0.4 times 0.6 plus 0.9 times 0.4, which is 1 minus 0.6.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And that resolves simply to 0.4 if you work it all out.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So the interesting thing here is if you were just to run the Markov chain,

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
on day 1 we have a 0.6 chance of rain,

11
00:00:51,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but the fact that I observed myself to be happy reduces the chance of rain to 0.4.
