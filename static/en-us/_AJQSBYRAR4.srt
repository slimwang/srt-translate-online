1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The reason why I gave you all this is because I want you to apply it now

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
to a slightly more complicated problem, which is the 2-test cancer example.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In this example, we again might have our unobservable cancer C,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
but now we're running 2 tests, test 1 and test 2.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
As before, the prior probability of cancer is 0.01.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The probability of receiving a positive test result for either test is 0.9.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The probability of getting a negative result given they're cancer free is 0.8.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And from those, we were able to compute all the other probabilities,

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and we're just going to write them down over here.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So, take a moment to just verify those.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Now, let's assume both of my tests come back positive,

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
so T1 = + and T2 = +.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What's the probability of cancer now written in short form probability of

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
C given ++?

15
00:01:03,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I want you to tell me what that is, and this is a non-trivial question.
