1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,490
So, we need to swap out the root
page for the skeleton page, but

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,640
continue to make everything
work offline first.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,550
I guess this is a job for you,
because the phone lines are lighting up.

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:11,800
We have a Mike dialing in.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,320
Think they're up for this one, Mike?

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,130
>> I do.

7
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,230
>> Then go for it.

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,660
>> If you completed the previous task,

9
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,270
your copy of the project is in
the right shape to take on this task.

10
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,290
But for some helpful to-do comments,

11
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:27,375
you can run git reset hard to
remove any local changes you have.

12
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:31,655
Then git checkout task-page-skeleton
to get up to speed.

13
00:00:31,655 --> 00:00:34,235
You only need to edit the service
worker to complete this task.

14
00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:40,095
So head over to public/js/sw/index.js.

15
00:00:40,095 --> 00:00:43,995
The root page is currently being cached
and served up in the fetch event.

16
00:00:43,995 --> 00:00:46,884
Your job is to cache the page
skeleton instead and

17
00:00:46,884 --> 00:00:50,240
serve that if the root
page is requested.

18
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,820
Once you've change the code,
refresh the page.

19
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,640
The browser will see the new service
worker and now we get this notification.

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,080
We can hit the Reload button to
update to the latest version.

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,940
You can confirm your changes
are working by checking view source on

22
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,349
the root page.

23
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,710
The source should be small like this.

24
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,900
To double check everything is working,
head to the settings page.

25
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,910
And type service skeleton into
the test field and press enter.
