1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,080
The question we want to think about is

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,720
how you could define who your ancestors are. The

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,689
way to think about ancestors. Well, here's you.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,680
Hopefully, you're smiling, because you're enjoying learning about recursive

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,670
definitions. And you had some parents. Let's assume

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:21,100
you had two. And we won't assume whether of

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,000
not your parents are smiling, but let's hope

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,670
at least one of them is. And your parents

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,090
were your ancestors, but they're not all

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,750
of your ancestors. Your parents had parents, as

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,970
well. These are your grandparents. Grandparents are always

12
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,760
happy. So, they're all smiling. And your grandparents,

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,640
well, they also had parents. Those would

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,620
be your great-grandparents, and so forth. And all

15
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,750
of these, except yourself, are your ancestors. So

16
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,620
our goal now is to define that precisely.

17
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,910
Can we come up with a definition that describes

18
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,550
exactly this same relationship, all the ancestors that you

19
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,940
have? So the question is, which of these is

20
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,885
the best definition of ancestors? And there are three

21
00:01:02,885 --> 00:01:05,730
choices, the first has one rule, ancestor is replaced

22
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,330
by parent of ancestor. The second has two rules,

23
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,540
ancestor is replaced by parent, and ancestor is replaced

24
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,220
by parent of the ancestor. The third has three rules.

25
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,600
Ancestor is replaced by parent. Ancestor is replaced by parent

26
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,430
of parent. And ancestor's replaced by parent of parent of ancestor.
