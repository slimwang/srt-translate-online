1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,270
Before we dive deeper
into this orientation,

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,780
we should probably start
with some introductions.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,690
I'm Cheng-Han, the data analyst
curriculum manager here at Udacity.

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:12,340
I studied a lot about mission learning
when I was a student in school, and

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,920
I most recently worked as Program
Manager at Microsoft before coming here

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,280
to Udacity.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,300
I have worked with our industry
partners and with course helpers here,

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,790
at Udacity, to create all the courses
and the project in this nanodegree.

9
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,130
>> And, I'm Miriam Swords Kalk.

10
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,160
I work on community and
student experience for nanodegrees.

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,070
I started out here at Udacity as
a course developer, helping plan and

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,290
create new courses.

13
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,870
And then, I moved over towards student
services team to get more direct

14
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,410
interaction with students.

15
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,330
I really, really love learning to
understand what our students, like you,

16
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:40,880
want and need.

17
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,080
And that's exactly what I'm
doing in this nanodegree.

18
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,310
I'm here to be your number one advocate,
your voice within our company.

19
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,475
I can't wait to hear the feedback you
have for us throughout the nanodegree.

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,930
>> There are a lot of other people
as well working on this nanodegree.

21
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,030
You will talk to Udacity coaches and
course developers.

22
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,120
These people have all
worked on the courses and

23
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,060
the project in the nanodegree.

24
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,090
They have backgrounds ranging
from math PhDs to engineers and

25
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:06,760
people working in natural sciences and
more.

26
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,090
They're all very excited to work with
you and other aspiring data analysts.

27
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,080
>> On top of that,
they're professional educators.

28
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,930
They understand how to
help you learn best and

29
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,090
are here to help make that happen.
