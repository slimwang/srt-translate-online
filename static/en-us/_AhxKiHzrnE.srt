00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,240
Now that we talked a little bit about what this slope might be like, let's

2
00:00:04,252 --> 00:00:08,800
actually find it. Please first tell me what the increase in x between these two

3
00:00:08,812 --> 00:00:13,371
points is, and also the increase in y, and then from that, figure out the slope.
