Vasco, from Portugal, asks:

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In a world where we already have Google and other search engines,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
what are the advantages of building another search engine?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So certainly, you don't want to try to duplicate something

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
that behaves exactly like Google does,

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
because Google works pretty well at what it does.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But there are lots of things you can do that would be

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
different from what Google does.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
One of the best examples of that is the search engine called DuckDuckGo,

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and we had a visit from Gabriel Weinberg a few weeks ago.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
There's a video, with a few clips from that visit,

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
where he talks about what motivated him to build DuckDuckGo.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
There''ll be a few more clips of that later in this course

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
where you'll get some idea of the kinds of things

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
that he thought were interesting to make a new search engine,

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and why he was motivated to build one.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But there are lots of things that you can think about that would be

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
new features that are different from what Google does--

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
or specializing your search engine for a particular kind of

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
corpus that you're searching for.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Probably, you don't want to try to build a generic Web search engine, like Google,

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
unless you've got some ideas how to go beyond that or

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
to do things differently, that would be more interesting.
