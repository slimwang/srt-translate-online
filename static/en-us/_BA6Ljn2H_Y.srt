1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer happens to be 0.7,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and the reason is we can see that there is a positive correlation between x and y.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It is not a 1. That would mean there would be no spread on the data.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
They'd all line up nicely on the line.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But there is spread around this data, so it can't be 1.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's not zero, because there would be no correlation.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's not negative, because the line doesn't go down. It goes up.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So, 0.7 is the best guess for the correlation.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's always good to look at the data and guess it in advance,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
because then you can see if your math is actually correct.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's dive in and calculate the actual correlation.
