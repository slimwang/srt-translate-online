00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,940
So the specific objectives of this lesson are for

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:07,150
you to learn how to compute edges from images.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,785
We will look at how we can actually do derivatives using kernels and

4
00:00:11,785 --> 00:00:14,560
neighborhood pixels, the concepts that we have learned again.

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,280
And with that, I'm going to introduce to you three different methods

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,130
of computing edges using kernels.

7
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:25,590
I will also showcase that as soon as image noise shows up into these images,

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,130
how it actually complicates the whole process of computing edges or

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,900
basically compromises the whole process of computing gradients,

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,410
which impacts how edges are computed.

11
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,852
And then I'll actually introduce a special type of an edge detector.
