1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,418
This was the factored form. Excellent work if you got that one correct. When we

2
00:00:04,418 --> 00:00:09,188
start to factor, we should always ask ourself, is there GCF. Each of these terms

3
00:00:09,188 --> 00:00:14,096
doesn't share an a, but they do share a 5. If we factor out a 5, we're left with

4
00:00:14,096 --> 00:00:19,372
this trinomial. We multiply a times c to get negative 45. And then we put

5
00:00:19,372 --> 00:00:24,785
negative 4 in the bottom, the b term. We want to find factors of a times c that

6
00:00:24,785 --> 00:00:30,740
sum to b. So we want to find factors of negative 45 that sum to negative 4. Here

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,370
are factor pairs for negative 45. I made the first factor negative, each of

8
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,573
these sums would be positive so I need to make the second factors negative. 5

9
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:45,862
and negative 9 sum to negative 4. So this is what I use to rewrite negative 4a.

10
00:00:45,862 --> 00:00:49,488
Remember it's best to put the negative coefficient first. It makes our factoring

11
00:00:49,488 --> 00:00:54,081
more simple. We can factor 3a from the first two terms, and a positive 5 from

12
00:00:54,081 --> 00:00:58,478
the second two terms. Finally we factor out an a minus 3 to give us this

13
00:00:58,478 --> 00:01:02,906
expression. And we don't actually need to include these brackets anymore since

14
00:01:02,906 --> 00:01:07,885
all we have between factors is multiplication. This is the complete factored

15
00:01:07,885 --> 00:01:08,373
form.
