00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,852
If you got 23 for the numerator and 24 for the denominator, you got it right.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,658
Let's see how to get that answer. I know when I add fractions, I have to have

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:14,439
the denominators be the same. So, the first thing that we need to do is find a

4
00:00:14,451 --> 00:00:20,010
common denominator between 12 and 8. Using the factor tree method, I know that 4

5
00:00:20,022 --> 00:00:26,405
is a common factor for both 12 and 8. I know that 4 times 3 is 12. And 4 times 2

6
00:00:26,417 --> 00:00:32,359
gives me 8. So, I can multiply those together, which gives me a common

7
00:00:32,371 --> 00:00:38,271
denominator of 24. The next thing I need to do is create equivalent fractions

8
00:00:38,283 --> 00:00:43,919
that have 24 as the denominator. So, I need to create equivalent fraction for 7

9
00:00:43,931 --> 00:00:49,560
over 12. Since we want to have 24 in the denominator, I know I have to multiply

10
00:00:49,572 --> 00:00:54,930
12 by 2 to get 24 and whatever I multiply the denominator by, I also have to

11
00:00:54,942 --> 00:01:00,389
multiply the numerator by. So, an equivalent fraction for 7/12 is 14 over 24.

12
00:01:00,762 --> 00:01:07,524
Now, let's convert 3/8. We want 24 as the denominator. 8 times 3 gives us 24. 8

13
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:14,576
times 3 is 24. 3 times 3 is 9. Now, I have an equivalent fraction for 7/12 and I

14
00:01:14,588 --> 00:01:21,213
have an equivalent fraction for 3/8. I can now rewrite the problem using my

15
00:01:21,225 --> 00:01:28,210
equivalent fractions. I have 14 over 24 plus 9 over 24. When I add fractions, I

16
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:34,760
keep the denominator the same and I add the numerators. 14 and 9 is 23. This

17
00:01:34,772 --> 00:01:41,685
answer is already simplified because there are no factors in common between 23

18
00:01:41,697 --> 00:01:42,235
and 24.
