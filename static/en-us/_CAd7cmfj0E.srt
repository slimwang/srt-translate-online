00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,840
Code reviews are an effective technique for detecting defects in artifacts.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,050
Collected data indicates that for typical formal review, as described above,

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,680
between 70 and 90% of defects are found. That is,

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,890
if we're talking about a code review of all the defects in that code,

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,175
the review meetings are going to find between 70 and

6
00:00:18,175 --> 00:00:23,100
90% if you have effective reviews. Of course, there is a cost which amounts,

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,300
in typical situations, to between 10 and 20% of the total cost of development.

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,760
This cost is largely due to the staff time involved in the preparation work and

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,991
the review meting itself. The above data notwithstanding,

10
00:00:34,991 --> 00:00:39,413
defect detection rates vary dramatically depending on the specific rule goals,

11
00:00:39,413 --> 00:00:43,210
artifact complexity and how effective the meanings are themselves.
