00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,553
Here's the equation we want to solve. Great work if you found this one. I know

2
00:00:04,553 --> 00:00:08,949
this one was tough. The key idea to get started is to assign the variable. I

3
00:00:08,949 --> 00:00:13,842
think it's best to let x equal the time it takes for the slower person. If we

4
00:00:13,842 --> 00:00:17,181
let x equal the number of hours it takes the slower person to carpet the room,

5
00:00:17,181 --> 00:00:21,999
then we can use 1 over x for the first fraction. This would be one job

6
00:00:21,999 --> 00:00:28,918
completed in x hours. The faster person works in 6 hours less time. So this

7
00:00:28,918 --> 00:00:33,598
means the second person could complete that same job, one job in x minus 6

8
00:00:33,598 --> 00:00:38,774
hours. Now we don't know who's faster Jamal or Danielle, we just know that the

9
00:00:38,774 --> 00:00:42,196
faster person does in in x minus 6 hours and the slower person does it in x

10
00:00:42,196 --> 00:00:48,574
hours. If we add the slower person's rate to the faster person's rate, we'll

11
00:00:48,574 --> 00:00:54,080
get 1 4th. One job completed in 4 hours. This is the amount it takes Jamal and

12
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,710
Danielle to carpet the room together.
