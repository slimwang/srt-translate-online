00:00:00,585 --> 00:00:04,380
We'll take the four levels from the simplest to the most powerful.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,450
The simplest form of contract that Boniyar calls level one

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:12,940
guarantee is a syntactic or signature contract, in which the names and

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,670
arguments of the component operations are specified.

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,210
Thus guaranteeing it is possible to link components into an application.

6
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,660
Can't really imagine using components in which you don't have this,

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,590
this level of guarantee.
