1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,980
Now, I'll run git push origin different-oil.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,250
As you saw before, pushing the branch updates the pull request.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,330
So, now the pull request can be automatically merged.

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,220
If I look at the changed files within the pull request,

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,570
I still only see my changes.

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,500
That's because this view, only shows changes that are present in my branch, but

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,470
not present in the master branch.

8
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,130
And Sarah's changes are in both branches now.

9
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,460
Finally, I'll leave another comment for Sarah, so

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,510
she'll know to take another look and make sure everything looks good now.

11
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,250
That's because GitHub will email Sarah, if I leave this comment.

12
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,500
But it actually, won't email her that I've updated the pull request, so

13
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,160
I want to make sure she sees the update
