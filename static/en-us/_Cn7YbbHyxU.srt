00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,620
All right, let's do some more practice
exercises with Gaussian elimination.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,750
Each of these systems could either have
a unique solution, no solution, or

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,530
infinitely many solutions.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:17,106
The first system is x-2y+z=-1,

5
00:00:17,106 --> 00:00:23,491
x-2z=2 and -x+4y-4z=0.

6
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:28,542
The second equation is y-z=2,

7
00:00:28,542 --> 00:00:34,299
x-y+z=2, and 3x-4y+z=1.

8
00:00:34,299 --> 00:00:39,827
The last system is x+2y+z=-1,

9
00:00:39,827 --> 00:00:46,571
3x+6y+2z=1, and -x-2y-z=1.

10
00:00:46,571 --> 00:00:49,314
For this quiz,
if there's a unique solution,

11
00:00:49,314 --> 00:00:54,610
fill in the appropriate coordinates for
the answer boxes labeled x, y, and z.

12
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,540
If there's no solution,
check the box on the right.

13
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,500
If there are infinitely many solutions,
fill in these answer boxes

14
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,540
with the appropriate expressions
using the free variable or

15
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,540
variables as parameters.

16
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,100
So if x and z were the pivot variables,

17
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,640
then the expressions should only
contain numbers in the variable y.
