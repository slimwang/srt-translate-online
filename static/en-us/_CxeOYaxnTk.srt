Welcome to Lesson Three.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,520
Right now you have a web page that has
structure, but doesn't look good at all.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,570
That's okay.

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,110
In this lesson you're going to
learn how to use CSS code to add

5
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,020
style to your page.

6
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,690
Now as you learn to write CSS code,
you'll really be

7
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,260
introduced to one of the most important
ideas in computer programming.

8
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,910
Don't repeat yourself.

9
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,118
Avoiding repetition is essential
in all areas of programming and

10
00:00:22,118 --> 00:00:24,750
this is where you're going to
be first exposed to that.

11
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,662
So as you watch,

12
00:00:25,662 --> 00:00:29,514
pay attention to how CSS allows
programmers to avoid repetition, and

13
00:00:29,514 --> 00:00:33,250
how that avoiding of repetition can
really help you make good code.
