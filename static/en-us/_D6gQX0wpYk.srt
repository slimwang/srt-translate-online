00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Next question comes from Eduardo Lopez.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
He points out that Python is a flexible language.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We can use many different programming paradigms.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We can do functional, procedural, or office-oriented programming.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
How do you decide which of these paradigms to use when approaching a new problem?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yeah, I guess I try to think of things as how can I get as close to the problem as possible?

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And so I want to program at the level of the problem.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And then, incidentally, I have to program with a particular language.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And so I start analyzing the problem and saying,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
what are the pieces of this problem,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
what are the objects I'm going to be manipulating,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
what are the ways I'm going to manipulate them,

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and try to do most of the analysis at that level.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And then once that analysis is done, then I can say,

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
well, what do I have in my programming language?

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And there there might be some differences between languages.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So if you're using Python, you might have more functions.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
If you're are using Java, you might have more classes.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
But they're still implementing the same basic set of ideas.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And I like that approach

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
because there is a more direct connection between the problem and the solution,

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
rather than a multistep of going from the problem to the language implementation

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and then back to the solution.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
All right. Thank you.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That's all we have for this week. See you next week.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
See you next week.
