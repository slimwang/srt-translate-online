00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,730
There are many ways to solve,
what we'll call, the Tri-Cities problem.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,700
A straight forward way is to do
a search from Buckhead to Scottdale,

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,849
then from Scottdale to
Little Five Points, and

4
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:12,559
then from Little Five Points
to Buckhead.

5
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:16,759
However, this method would explore
many more street intersections than

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,750
necessary.

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,759
The trick here is to start the search
from each of the three locations

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,570
simultaneously using the A* algorithm,

9
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,660
which we'll call
the tri-directional A* search.

10
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,859
So the correct answer is,
none of the above.

11
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:33,070
We'll revisit this challenge question at
the end of the lesson in more detail.
