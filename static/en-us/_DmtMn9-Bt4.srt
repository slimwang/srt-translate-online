1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:04,640
I think that entrepreneurs,
when they go out to fundraise,

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,930
they have to think about it like,
I think, getting married.

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,450
You are about to bring somebody
on board to your business

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,300
that you can't undo afterwards.

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:21,510
So once you bring on board investors,
it's not only just your business.

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,220
And you have to acknowledge that and you
have to believe that that's the right

7
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:28,530
thing for you and
that's the right thing for the business.

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,950
If you can bootstrap, great.

9
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,060
If you don't have to fundraise, great.

10
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,900
But for the vast majority of
businesses in today's tech world,

11
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,620
you have to go out and raise money.

12
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,490
So the downside perhaps is that
it's no longer your business.

13
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,910
I actually think it can
be a very good thing,

14
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,480
because now you're accountable
not just to yourself but for

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,860
other people as well and people that
put their trust and money in you.

16
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,290
And that I find to be a very
invigorating thing for

17
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,350
a lot of entrepreneurs,
who already are working super hard,

18
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,350
actually upping their game,
because they appreciate

19
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,100
the responsibility that
comes with raising capital.
