1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,140
So we're going to define a special
kind of operator called a contraction

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,140
mapping, and we're going to say
an operator's a contraction mapping

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,470
if it has this property.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,510
So B is some operator, and it's mapping
value functions to value functions.

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,910
If it's the case that for all value
functions, so all value functions F and

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:23,020
G, and some multiplicative factor
gamma which is less than 1.

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:27,920
If it's the case that the distance
between B applied to F and

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,750
B applied to G has to be smaller than or
equal to gamma times the original

9
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,600
distance between F and G, then we
say that B is a contraction mapping.

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,910
It's causing things to get closer
together, tighter together.

11
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,670
So this notation here is sometimes
called the infinity norm, the max norm,

12
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,510
and all it's doing is saying,
this is a function of states and

13
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,730
actions, so which is the largest?

14
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,010
What's the largest state action
pair in terms of absolute value?

15
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,040
>> Okay, so that's just saying,

16
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,590
what's the maximum value that
the function Q can have?

17
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,420
>> Or that it currently has,
yeah that's right.

18
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,790
So when we write F- G max
norm really what it's saying,

19
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:11,430
what's the biggest difference
in Q values between F and G?

20
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,785
And this is corresponding Q values.

21
00:01:13,785 --> 00:01:15,022
>> Mm-hm.

22
00:01:15,022 --> 00:01:17,540
>> So F- G is saying what's the biggest

23
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,130
difference between these two Q
functions at any state action pair?

24
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,740
Whatever that largest difference is,

25
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,890
we're going to multiply it by
something that makes it even smaller.

26
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,870
And we're going to say that, for
it to be a contraction mapping,

27
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:30,850
is has to be the case that,

28
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,770
if you apply that mapping to F and you
apply that mapping to G, the distance

29
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,350
between the resulting functions is even
closer together than they started.

30
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,370
>> And
that makes it a contraction map, okay.

31
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,750
>> Yeah this is how we're going to
define contraction mapping, and

32
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,860
this is going to give us all sorts of
nice properties, and it's also going to

33
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,260
happen a lot in the kinds of operators
we get in reinforcement learning.

34
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,120
>> So
just to make sure I have this right,

35
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,310
since the infinity norm
finds the biggest value and

36
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:02,030
here you define the difference between
two functions, at least the infinity

37
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,940
difference between two functions, being
wherever their greatest distance is.

38
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,930
It's certainly the case that over time
as we apply this operator over and

39
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,430
over again, the point where their
maximum is, the state action pair where

40
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,690
their maximum is,
might change every time, right?

41
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:14,300
>> Right.
That's right.

42
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,750
So this max norm is computing for
the specific

43
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,040
value function that it's given where
the biggest absolute value is.

44
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,570
And that could be different on
this side of the equation from

45
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:26,370
this side of the equation.

46
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,340
There is no reason that it needs to
be the same over and over again.

47
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,060
And in fact when we're using B

48
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,330
to be a value iteration operator
it does tend to move around a lot.

49
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,010
>> Okay.

50
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,040
So you would expect it
to move around a bit,

51
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,680
at least as you're going
through value space.

52
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,410
>> Yeah, exactly.

53
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,202
However, let's not worry
about that quite yet,

54
00:02:47,202 --> 00:02:50,040
let's actually do some
contraction mapping examples on

55
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,130
just scalar values where it's
really easy to reason about them.

56
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,590
>> Okay,
yeah I think that would be cool.
