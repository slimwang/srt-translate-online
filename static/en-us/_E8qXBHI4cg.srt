00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,260
Okay. So now, we've discussed basic browsers, HTML, HTTP, which is

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,640
how the browsers talk to the servers. And now, we're finally

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,790
going to get to servers, which is what most of this course

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,170
is going to be about. How to run programs on servers. The

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,149
purpose of a server is to respond to HTTP requests. We've

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,230
drawn this picture a couple of times now. This is you.

7
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,890
This is your computer running your browser. And these are our

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:25,520
servers. These little pink boxes. Your browser is speaking HTTP to these

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,690
servers to request documents. There are two

10
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,230
main classifications for the type of responses the

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,460
server will do. They are called static

12
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:39,048
and dynamic. Content is considered static if it's

13
00:00:39,048 --> 00:00:41,734
a pre-written file that the server just

14
00:00:41,734 --> 00:00:45,690
returns. An example would be an image. Most

15
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,160
images are static requests. All the server does

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,560
is says, it looks up the image off

17
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,700
of its hard disk or off of its cache, and just

18
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,030
sends it over the wire using HTTP. More interesting requests are dynamic

19
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,620
requests. These are requests where the response is built on the

20
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:04,410
fly by a program that's running. Just about all of the content

21
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,220
online these days is dynamic. That didn't always use to be

22
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,420
the case. When the web was first invented in the early 90s,

23
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,060
almost all of the content online was static. They were just

24
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,970
files. People would edit the files, put them on their servers, and

25
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,670
they all linked to one another, but that was

26
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:23,366
that. These days, almost every website including Udacity, Reddit

27
00:01:23,366 --> 00:01:26,000
and Hipmunk, the two websites that I worked on.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,090
Wikipedia, Facebook. All of those pages, almost 100% of

29
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,790
them are built dynamically on the fly by programs

30
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,740
called web applications. And a web application is just

31
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,780
a program that generates content. And that is what

32
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,340
we're going to learn how to build in this course.

33
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,270
So we've spent all of this time getting to

34
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,550
this description of what a web application does. Which

35
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,930
is, it lives on a web server, it speaks

36
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,420
HTTP, and it generates content that your browser requests.
