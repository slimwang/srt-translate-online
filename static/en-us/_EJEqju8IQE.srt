1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I won't give you a number, but here is my solution.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The hardest part is to get the outlier removal correct.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
For that I sorted the data and I computed the lower and upper quartile.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And these are the exact formulas I used in the exact case.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It turns out even if it doesn't factor nicely, those give me good numbers.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And then I compute a new data set where I just extract data in the range

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
from the lower quartile to the upper quartile using this simple command over here.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
There's many different ways to implement this.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Then, the maximum likelihood estimator is very simple.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You've already developed the functions mean and standard deviation. I just use those.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And they were supplied for to you in the code we gave you.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And finally, this is the inverse of the standard score z that I've told you.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
If the standard score z is this expression over here,

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:18,000
then you can easily solve it for x by bringing x to the left side.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
With this formula, we get this kind of code over here and we return the corresponding x value.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Now when you hit "run" you get the answer to the fascinating question

17
00:01:32,000 --> 99:59:59,999
of how much I weigh but I won't tell you.
