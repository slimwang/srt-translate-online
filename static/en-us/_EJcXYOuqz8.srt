00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,800
In this lesson, you'll learn
how to create a stellar resume.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,380
We'll start with how to make
a comprehensive spreadsheet of

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,480
all your professional experiences.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,930
This is what we call a master resume.

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,770
Next, we'll learn how to best summarize
your professional experiences.

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,930
We'll detail how to craft compelling
bullet points that prove your unique

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,580
strengths and skills.

8
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,290
Since resumes are meant
to be targeted and

9
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,650
not show everything you've ever done,
you'll also create a targeted resume.

10
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,750
Using your new master resume,
you'll research a job of interest and

11
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,200
compose a resume for this position.

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,590
To top off all of your hard work, you'll
make sure the style and format of your

13
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,400
resume is up to snuff by completing a
personal review of our resume checklist.
