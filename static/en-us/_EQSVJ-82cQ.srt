00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,750
Let's now do another BTB and BHT quiz but this time we have a BHT that has

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,540
16 entries. And each entry is a one bit

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,110
predictor and that one bit predictor starts predicting not

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,730
taken. So all of the 16 entries initially

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,869
start out predicting not taken. The BTB is a

6
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:21,588
four entry perfect predictor still. The question for you

7
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:25,200
this time, is how many mispredictions will we have

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,972
for each instruction using this BHT and

9
00:00:27,972 --> 00:00:32,743
BTB? Write the number of mispredictions here for

10
00:00:32,743 --> 00:00:36,006
this MOV instruction. Write the number of mispredictions

11
00:00:36,006 --> 00:00:37,005
here for this MOV instruction, and so on.
