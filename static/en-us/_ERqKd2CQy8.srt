00:00:27,018 --> 00:00:30,258
Hey there, I'm Matt. One of the instructors from the

3
00:00:30,258 --> 00:00:33,226
course Tales from the Genome. I'm really excited that you

4
00:00:33,226 --> 00:00:35,445
logged on to learn with us. What do you say

5
00:00:35,445 --> 00:00:39,143
we get this genetics party started? You mind loading the course?

6
00:00:39,143 --> 00:00:45,152
[SOUND].

7
00:00:45,152 --> 00:00:47,279
Welcome to Tales from the Genome. And

8
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:50,503
adventure in DNA, identity, and health. I'm Matt.

9
00:00:50,503 --> 00:00:51,668
>> And I'm Lauren.

10
00:00:51,668 --> 00:00:54,159
>> And together, we'll be your genome guides. Now, I have my PhD

11
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:58,037
in cell and molecular biology and I'll be your main instructor for this course.

12
00:00:58,037 --> 00:01:01,590
>> And I have my Masters degree in experimental psychology. Matt approached

13
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,860
me to help him teach this class because I know a little bit

14
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,980
about genetics through psychology, but I

15
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,510
always want to learn more, and I thought

16
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:10,590
this was a great opportunity for me to learn about my own genome.

17
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,900
And help you learn about yours.

18
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,240
>> This course should be accessible to anyone of almost

19
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,090
any age or any knowledge base. If you're still in high

20
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,060
school, or even if you already have a graduate degree. If

21
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,570
you find yourself taken a lesson, and the information in it

22
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,600
is a little too basic for you, feel free to

23
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,480
jump ahead or skip around. You can use the syllabus to

24
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,230
find out which portions are most relevant to you as a

25
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:35,110
good starting point. Together we'll discover the secrets of your genome.

26
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:35,970
>> And,

27
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,810
reveal a new perspective of what it means to be human.
