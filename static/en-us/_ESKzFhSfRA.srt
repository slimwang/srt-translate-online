1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,920
So you've learned a lot
about retention and

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,912
how it's pretty normal to have around
40% player attention after just one day.

3
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:09,080
Ankur, why do you think so

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,100
many players leave after just
the first day of playing a game?

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:16,170
>> Well, it's very hard to make
a game that's engaging for everybody.

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,490
So people might leave after trying it
out and finding it's not a great fit.

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,670
For example, kids tend to have a lot
more time on their hands than adults.

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,880
So they prefer longer games
with more fun story lines.

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,836
>> That make sense.

10
00:00:28,836 --> 00:00:31,100
Everyone plays games
a little differently.

11
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,376
So what can game developers do
to keep players interested?

12
00:00:34,376 --> 00:00:37,660
>> Most successful games
have a target audience.

13
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,080
They know they can't appeal to everyone.

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,460
And so they focus on the specific
age group or a type of gamer and

15
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,170
try to design a game that is
targeted to that audience.

16
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,520
>> I think I have a great idea for

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,550
a game that appeals to
people around my age.

00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,235

[SOUND].

19
00:00:56,235 --> 00:00:57,660
What do you think?

20
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,640
>> It seems fairly simple.

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,940
Maybe you can make it harder by
adding some goals or obstacles.

22
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,260
>> Good idea, how about I bounce
the ball through a ring of fire and

23
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,330
into the goal?

24
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,700
>> That's more like it.

25
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,330
When you're thinking about your game and
deciding what it looks like and

26
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,510
how difficult it is to play,
you should always put yourself

27
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:20,070
in the players' shoes and think about
what will be most exciting for them.

28
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,400
>> Ask yourself are they younger?

29
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,280
Hardcore gamers or more casual?

30
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,670
>> Exactly, it's important to make your
game pace fit your player's skill level.

31
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,490
Like adding a ring of fire and

32
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,760
goals makes bouncing ball a lot
more challenging and fun.

33
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,710
>> Let's look at some examples
of game apps that do this well.
