00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,348
To make this input to our log by itself, what we need to do is take the inverse

2
00:00:04,348 --> 00:00:09,544
of log base two. That means we need to use an exponential function where two is

3
00:00:09,544 --> 00:00:17,995
the base. So we have 2 to the log base 2 of 2 x plus 3 equals 2 to the 4. Since

4
00:00:17,995 --> 00:00:22,975
the log base 2 is undone by this, all we have left on the left hand side is 2x

5
00:00:22,975 --> 00:00:29,004
plus 3 and on the right hand side, 2 to the 4 or 16.
