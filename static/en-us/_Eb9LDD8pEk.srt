00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,430
When we're clicking around in Xcode
setting break points and debugging code,

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:08,500
it's easy to forget the main tool behind
the scenes doing all the heavy lifting.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,400
I'm talking about the LLDB debugger.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,290
The LLDB Debugger, or the low level
debugger is what actually allows us to

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:19,910
set break points, step through code, and
see the state while the app is running.

6
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:24,310
Normally we interact with LLDB using
Xcode's graphical interface, but

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:28,257
LLDB also has a powerful
command-line interface too.

8
00:00:28,257 --> 00:00:32,210
The LLDB command-line interface is
what you see here in the console of

9
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,152
the debug area.

10
00:00:33,152 --> 00:00:36,932
It has many commands,
such as fr v, which is short for

11
00:00:36,932 --> 00:00:41,380
the command frame, and
the sub command variable.

12
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,774
The command fr v shows
us all the arguments and

13
00:00:43,774 --> 00:00:46,239
local variables that
are currently in scope.

14
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:52,380
So we can see that we have self,
we have bug, we have a shakeAnimation.

15
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,040
And if we look at the variables view,

16
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,450
this is the same information
that's available to use here

17
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:02,510
in a more graphical format as opposed to
this textual format here in the console.

18
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,070
And I'll type the same command,
this is just the shortened version,

19
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:11,300
the fr v, this is the full version and
we get the same results.

20
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,240
Now the entire LLDB command set is
rather large, so instead of showing you

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,380
each command, I'm just going to focus
on some of the most commonly used ones.

22
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,760
If you want to dive deeper into LLDB and

23
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,320
learn things like custom data
formatters or writing scripts for

24
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,450
LLDB then you can check out
the resources in the instructor notes.
