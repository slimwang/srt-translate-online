00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,860
As I was creating this course and
trying to demystify frameworks,

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,910
I kept realizing that frameworks,
they're just JavaScript.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:07,840
There's no magic to them.

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,690
A framework is built up of
pieces of functionality.

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,040
For example, if we found a better
templating system than Underscore's,

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,860
we could swap it out and
give backbone a different one.

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,800
Well except that I learned Underscore's
template function is a real

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,150
powerhouse in converting
a template to rendered HTML.

9
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,720
We aren't ending here though, so
don't toss out your realizations.

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,860
In the following lessons we'll
be looking at larger frameworks.

11
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,610
The concepts that you've learned in
this lesson transfer over to those

12
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,220
frameworks too.
