1
00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:08,566
We obtained P of A0 given X0 through base rule, which should look very familiar at this point.

2
00:00:08,567 --> 00:00:20,932
P of X0 given A0 is 0.1, multiplied by 0.5, and down here we get 0.1 times 0.5, plus the same probability for B0, which is 0.8,

3
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:32,299
times 0.5. As is easily seen, the 0.5 falls out, so we get 0.1 over 0.9 over a ninth, which is the answer for the first question.

4
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:38,766
In the second question we apply total probability. This is the formal definition of total probability,

5
00:00:38,767 --> 00:00:45,566
which is the probability of A1, given previously in A0, times the probability of being A0.

6
00:00:45,567 --> 00:00:50,432
And the same for B0 before, as you might easily recognize.

7
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:56,099
Now, turns out this hidden markov model is a funny one. Every single time step, it completely mixes.

8
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:02,066
The probability of transitioning is the same as staying in the same state, so you completely forget the history.

9
00:01:02,067 --> 00:01:06,766
So therefore the answer to this question would be 0.5, or half.

10
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:15,432
But let me just derive it formally. The transition probability of going from A0 to A1 is 0.5, times our prior probability,

11
00:01:15,433 --> 00:01:21,166
which is one-ninth, and we get the same 0.5 over here, times the prior probability of eight-ninth.

12
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:26,999
And if you work this out, you'll find that one-ninth plus eight-ninth is one, and therefore the 0.5 is the final result.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,666
This is a really unusual markov model, where there's no memory retained from one step to the next.

14
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:40,032
This also means, if you now observe X again, and look at this probability over here, we can apply the exact same logic as before

15
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:47,232
because now our prior is still 0.5, and we get one-ninth again, with the exact same argument as before.

16
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:52,499
Before observing X0, we had a .5 chance of being an A, and it went down to one-ninth.

17
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:59,100
Here we still have a .5 chance of being an A. Therefore, the exact same math gets us down to one-ninth.
