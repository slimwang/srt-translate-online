1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,650
So here you can see
the onSignedOut function, and

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,150
it's pretty straightforward.

3
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,360
It just enables the sign in button,
and disables the sign out and

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,480
revoke buttons, and it just sets
a status text to be signed out.

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,590
That's it, you're done.

6
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:17,400
This app had many steps, but now you've
got something with a full sign in built.

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,960
Let's run it and see how it looks.

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,080
So here you can see
the application running.

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,720
I have my sign in button,
I have my sign out button and

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,830
I have my revoke access buttons,
the results are this little status text.

11
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,800
If I touch the sign in button,

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,930
what's going to happen first of all is
that the first error that came back,

13
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,960
came back because I hadn't
given the application consent.

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,900
So it's asking for my consent,
and then I'll say Ok.

15
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,020
Now you can see, it's signed in, and
it's signed in, and it actually got my

16
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,100
real name, my full name here, instead of
my email address, because all I provided

17
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,230
the application when I was
running it was my email address.

18
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:53,570
I now have my sign out and
my revoke access buttons enabled.

19
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,790
So if I touch Sign Out,
I'm actually signed out.

20
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,370
And if I touch Sign In,
I will sign in directly.

21
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,540
You might have seen a quick flash
as the intent was checking, but

22
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,880
now I'm signed in directly as myself.

23
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,030
If I revoke access now I've removed the
permission from the application to be

24
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,110
able to sign in.

25
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,690
So, the user has to
give permission again.

26
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:15,570
So, if I touch Sign In the intent will
come up, the arrow is triggered, and

27
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,370
it's saying, hey this wants
to look at my basic profile.

28
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,980
I'll say okay to that, and
then I'll continue, and get signed in.

29
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,790
So, now you have the full
sign in work flow going.

30
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,620
If you get stuck with any
of the code don't worry.

31
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,540
It's okay.
I've pasted

32
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,100
the entire code in the speaker notes.

33
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,910
You should be good to go.
