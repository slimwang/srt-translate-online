00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
All right. Here's our answer.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Each of these areas here is a region. I'm just numbering them.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Then there's also a region which is the outside box. Seven regions in this example.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's check Euler's formula again for this one.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We've got n = 10, m = 15, and 7 regions.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
N - m is -5, plus 7 is 2. Ta da!
