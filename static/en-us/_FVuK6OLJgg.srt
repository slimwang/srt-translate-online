1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,790
Alright the first one is definitely decidable.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,310
The RAM runs at least 1,000,000 steps before terminating.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,960
To do that you just run the program and count how many steps it takes.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,400
If it takes at least 1,000,000 steps then we know that it will take

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,400
at least 1,000,000 steps before terminating.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,710
We don't actually need to know whether or not it terminates to answer this question,

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,990
we just need to know that it runs at least 1,000,000 steps before that might happen.

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,840
The RAM runs at least a million steps and will eventually terminate.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,670
That is not decidable.

10
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,940
The reason for that is in order to answer this question we do need to know

11
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,140
whether the program eventually terminates, unlike this first question.

12
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:42,010
In order to answer that we need to answer the general question of whether

13
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:46,550
a program will terminate, which we've discussed in the unit is actually undecidable in general.

14
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,550
So this is not decidable.

15
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,900
This final statement is decidable.

16
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,250
It's decidable in much the same way that the first statement is.

17
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,980
The RAM runs at most 1,000,000 steps before terminating.

18
00:00:55,980 --> 99:59:59,999
Well simply count the number of steps it takes and then answer the question.
