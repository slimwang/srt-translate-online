1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,465
For this first term, we'll have 5 divided by 5, which equals 1, we'll have a

2
00:00:04,465 --> 00:00:09,254
cubed in the numerator and one b in the numerator as well. The second term would

3
00:00:09,254 --> 00:00:13,488
be, 8a squared b, we'll have a squared in the numerator, and one b in the

4
00:00:13,488 --> 00:00:18,387
numerator as well. For the third term, we'll have positive 3a, we'll have one a

5
00:00:18,387 --> 00:00:23,037
left in the numerator, and b squared, divided by b squared, makes 1, so just

6
00:00:23,037 --> 00:00:28,081
positive 3a for the third term. And finally, for the last term, we'll just have

7
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:32,995
negative 12, 60 divided by 5 equals 12, and the sign is negative, so we need to

8
00:00:32,995 --> 00:00:37,813
make sure we include that here. Ab Squared divided by ab squared would just

9
00:00:37,813 --> 00:00:42,706
equal 1, that's why we're only left with negative 12. This would be our answer

10
00:00:42,706 --> 00:00:44,335
to our division problem.
