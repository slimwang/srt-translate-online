So, some observations about this exercise. Be aware that there may be more than

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,930
one answer. And we, we saw some instances of that. Be open during the process of

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:13,040
analyses to the possibility of new requirements arising or

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,120
that there's ambiguities. Or infact, that there, mistakes have been made.

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,560
And this may mean for the consultation with the customer. The fact that a simple

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,500
set of requirements can have so many issues, should illustrate the value of

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,890
performing this kind of careful thinking that is but the kind of

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,439
careful thinking that is required in order to construct an OCL specification.
