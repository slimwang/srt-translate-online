1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,650
Th desire to apply the trick of using
positive and negative pairs recursively,

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,930
leads us to a very special set of
points, called the Roots of Unity.

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,570
Recall that our goal is to compute
two values of a polynomial for

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:18,040
the price of one, by dividing
the terms up into even and odd powers.

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:18,540
From here on,

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:23,080
we will assume that the number of points
is equal to the order of the polynomial.

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,903
And that this number is a power of 2.

8
00:00:24,903 --> 00:00:27,844
In the context of
polynomial multiplication,

9
00:00:27,844 --> 00:00:31,810
N will be the power of 2, that is
at least as great as the number of

10
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,132
coefficients of the product
of the two polynomials.

11
00:00:35,132 --> 00:00:38,666
And we will pad the coefficients of
the polynomials being multiplied with

12
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:42,190
the zeros, as needed to make
their number equal to N as well.

13
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,380
In order to be able to do
this computation recursively,

14
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:49,190
we need the sequence X to have
the following proprieties.

15
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:53,310
First, they should all be distinct,
otherwise our efforts will be wasted,

16
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,060
and we wont have enough points
to interpolate back to find

17
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,400
the coefficients.

18
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,992
We also need the points
to be symmetric or

19
00:00:59,992 --> 00:01:02,420
anti symmetric,
depending on how you look at it.

20
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,630
That is to say,
we want the point with index J

21
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,680
plus N over 2 to the negative of X of J,
and lastly,

22
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,630
we want all these properties to apply
to the squares of these numbers, so

23
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,220
that we can use this trick
recursively again and again.

24
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,120
If your polynomials are over
some unusual field,

25
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,860
then it may make sense to choose
an unusual set of values for X.

26
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,560
For most applications however,
the coefficients will be integers or

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,880
reals or complex numbers.

28
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,460
And the choice of X will be
the complex roots of unity.

29
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:41,640
We define omega N to be e
to the 2 pi i divided by N,

30
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,870
and we let Xj be omega of
N raised to the jth power.

31
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,830
Let's visualize these points
in the complex plane.

32
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,040
I'll do this for N equal to 8.

33
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,870
All the points have magnitude 1,

34
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,520
so they'll be arranged
around the unit circle, and

35
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,730
the angle from the positive real axis,
is given by the exponent here.

36
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:08,169
Thus, omega to the j,
will be j Nths around the circle.

37
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,259
Let's confirm that all
the desired properties hold.

38
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,300
Indeed, the points are unique.

39
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:18,060
j here is always less than N, so
there's no wrap around the circle.

40
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,060
The symmetric property holds,
because adding N over 2 to j has

41
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:28,620
the effect of increasing this
angle by pi, or half the circle.

42
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,220
And so that's equivalent to negating and
flipping over both axes as well.

43
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,290
The recursive property is
the hardest to confirm.

44
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,080
Notice however, that for
all the points that have odd powers

45
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,750
in the exponent here, squaring these
numbers makes the exponent even.

46
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:48,724
Thus omega 3 when squared,
becomes omega to the 6th.

47
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,820
Omega fifth when squared,
will become omega to the 10th,

48
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,450
which wraps around and
then becomes omega to the 2nd.

49
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,540
Moreover, each of the even powers here

50
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,750
is the square of exactly
two other points.

51
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,140
Which points?

52
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,690
Well, just divide the exponent by 2.

53
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,340
That gives you one of them.

54
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:15,150
For example, omega to the 4th,
well his square root is omega to the 2.

55
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,890
What's the other point?

56
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,790
Well it's on the opposite side
of the circle, of course.

57
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:24,630
The additional N over 2 in the exponent,
comes an additional N when we square it,

58
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:28,220
so it's just an extra trip around
the circle, and it's the same place.

59
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:33,051
For, omega squared,
half is omega to the 1st power, and

60
00:03:33,051 --> 00:03:36,712
then the opposite side
is omega to the 5th.

61
00:03:36,712 --> 00:03:40,147
The result of all this,
is that when we square these numbers,

62
00:03:40,147 --> 00:03:43,180
the odd powers of omega go away,
like so.

63
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,750
Once we're left with, only the even
powers however, It doesn't make sense to

64
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:51,030
express these points in terms
of omega sub eight anymore.

65
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:56,310
The factors of two in the numerator
j and the denominator N cancel.

66
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,140
So we can just divide both by two.

67
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,450
And voila,

68
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:04,320
we end up with the fourth roots of
unity, instead of the eighth roots.

69
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:09,480
And the same logic applies to all N,
where N is a power of 2.

70
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,190
And that then, shows that all these
key properties that we wanted for

71
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,830
X are true,

72
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:20,329
when we choose them to be the Nth roots
of unity, where N is a power of 2.

73
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,000
It's worth noting here, how few of
the properties of complex numbers

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,540
were necessary for
the recursion we used.

75
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,730
In fact, there are a number of theoretic
algorithms that use modular arithmetic,

76
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,600
and avoid the precision difficulties
associated with working with

77
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,280
complex numbers.

78
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,590
At the end of the lesson,

79
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,380
you'll get a chance to implement
one of those yourself.
