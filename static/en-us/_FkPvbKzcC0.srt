1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,430
We talked about the SetUID bit and

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:06,780
in particular a game file and
a game score file and things like that.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,720
So this question is
about the SetUID bit.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,230
In particular executable file F1,

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:16,309
so that's a program file
has its SetUID bit set.

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:18,190
And it's owned by user U1.

7
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,680
User U2 executes F1.

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,960
So we are assuming that U1 who owns F1
has given permission to this file to U2,

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:31,803
which user ID is the effective UID when
F1 is being executed in this case.
