00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,794
Now that you've had a chance to graph, it's my turn. Let's see if I can do this

2
00:00:03,806 --> 00:00:07,650
right. Because it works better for my brain, I've transferred all the data on

3
00:00:07,662 --> 00:00:11,589
the table to coordinate notation on the right-hand side of the table. That just

4
00:00:11,601 --> 00:00:15,549
helps me graph better, personally. So, I'm going to plot these points. We step

5
00:00:15,561 --> 00:00:18,921
over 3 in the negative direction on the x-axis, and down 14. Now, you want to

6
00:00:19,236 --> 00:00:23,353
make sure that the points, when you graph them on graph paper, as we saw in the

7
00:00:23,365 --> 00:00:27,357
previous example, are as accurately placed as possible. So luckily, for the

8
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:31,444
scale that we've chosen for this graph and this equation, all of these points

9
00:00:31,456 --> 00:00:35,630
should lie directly on intersection points of vertical and horizontal lines on

10
00:00:35,642 --> 00:00:39,937
the graph paper. So, that's awesome. Negative 2, negative 11, and you can see I

11
00:00:39,949 --> 00:00:43,842
just made a mistake again. I forgot that we were counting by two's in the y

12
00:00:43,854 --> 00:00:48,137
direction, and I placed a point at 2,2 instead of 2,1. So, I've graphed a fair

13
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:52,092
number of graphs in my life. So, if you make a mistake doing this, it's not a

14
00:00:52,104 --> 00:00:56,196
big deal at all. We just have to make sure we correct ourselves. And lastly, we

15
00:00:56,208 --> 00:01:00,806
have 3,4. Okay, great. These look to me like they're all in a pretty straight

16
00:01:00,818 --> 00:01:05,224
line, so let's get our ruler to make sure. I think we're safe. Let's connect

17
00:01:05,236 --> 00:01:09,667
them. And we have a gorgeous line that I will now draw an arrow on either end

18
00:01:09,679 --> 00:01:13,985
of. Remember, this arrow shows this line is extending forever out in either

19
00:01:13,997 --> 00:01:18,565
direction, continuing its pattern for all values of x. I've also drawn an arrow

20
00:01:18,577 --> 00:01:22,188
on either end of this line to show that it extends forever out in both

21
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:22,793
directions.
