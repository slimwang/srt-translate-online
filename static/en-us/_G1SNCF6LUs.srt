1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,500
Okay. What's your answer?

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,469
>> My answer is no.

3
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:06,670
>> No, I'm sorry, that's wrong. No, no, I think that, well, if

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,270
it's, if it's right, then we need to provide a sequence that proves it.

5
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:09,760
>> Okay.

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,970
>> So what are you thinking?

7
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,400
>> Well, I was thinking actually something very similar to what we just saw.

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,320
>> Okay.

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,650
>> Where so tit for tat, what they're going to do is they're

10
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,670
going to do cooperate, cooperate, cooperate, cooperate,

11
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,300
right? That's what they normally want to do.

12
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:23,780
>> Exactly.

13
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,490
>> So what would happen if at one

14
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,220
point, one of them defected?

15
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,470
>> Okay, just for simplicity let's make it the very first point.

16
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:30,870
>> Mm-hm.

17
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,940
>> So, tit for tat number one defects,

18
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,220
and tit for tat number two also defects.

19
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,500
>> At the very first time? No, it

20
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,560
cooperates, because it's done at the same time.

21
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,020
>> Well, I mean so we're, we can feed

22
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,660
it anything we want. So we could tell tit for

23
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,720
tat two to cooperate. So it's sort of like we've

24
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,540
taken over its brain for a brief amount of time.

25
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,860
>> Right. So I'm not yet convinced it's going to matter

26
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,770
for this, but the thing is that from that point

27
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:55,230
on, tit for tat two is going to want to, for

28
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,220
the next step tit for tat two is going to want to defect.

29
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,260
>> That's right.

30
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,210
>> And, tit for tat one would want to cooperate.

31
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,390
>> Uh-huh.

32
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,367
>> And that's sort of. Sucks.

33
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:06,700
>> [LAUGH]

34
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,268
>> For tit-for-tat two, right?

35
00:01:10,268 --> 00:01:12,030
>> So, I don't know, so maybe we should try

36
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,090
to think through. What is the expected reward, for tit-for-tat

37
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,750
two, to actually do this defect at this time?

38
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,055
>> Or wait, no. So, so, sorry to,

39
00:01:22,055 --> 00:01:24,850
to stick with the tit-for-tat machine at this time.

40
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:25,910
>> Well, what's going to happen at

41
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,930
that point is, it's going to keep alternating.

42
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,340
>> That's exactly right. So it's going to get the, the rewards corresponding

43
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,810
to D versus C, C versus D, D versus C, C versus D.

44
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:36,420
>> Over and over again.

45
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,699
>> Yeah. So let's thi, let's think about it

46
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:41,260
in the average reward case. So, in the D versus

47
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:46,100
C, if it does D when the other machine does C, then it gets zero.

48
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,140
>> Mm-hm.

49
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,800
>> If it does C when the other one does D it gets minus nine.

50
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,083
>> Mm-hm.

51
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:52,800
>> And then this alternates. So if we look at the average award,

52
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,310
which is basically what you get when the discount factor's very, very high.

53
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,025
>> Mm-hm.

54
00:01:57,025 --> 00:01:58,533
>> It's scoring negative 4.5.

55
00:01:58,533 --> 00:01:59,770
>> Right.

56
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,440
>> Is there any way, that it could behave against tit for

57
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,293
tat, starting from this point that would do better than negative 4.5.

58
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:07,780
>> Just go ahead and cooperate.

59
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,820
>> Just cooperate forever?

60
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,580
>> Well cooperate the next time and then keep doing tit for

61
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,300
tat from that point on. It'll work out to be cooperate forever.

62
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,270
>> On average. That's right. What will get is a minus, minus

63
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,248
one. So not being tit for tat at that point but instead,

64
00:02:22,248 --> 00:02:26,300
instead turning always to cooperate would actually get it better. So the

65
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,330
idea that is should defect at this point, is an implausible threat.

66
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,430
>> Exactly.

67
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,335
>> So this is not

68
00:02:31,335 --> 00:02:33,170
sub-game perfect. So yes, you nailed it.

69
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:33,970
>> Yeah!

70
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:34,660
>> Does that make sense?

71
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,720
>> It did make sense.

72
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,206
>> Good, alright. So that leaves open the question of, is

73
00:02:39,206 --> 00:02:42,940
there a way, to be sub game perfect in Prisoner's dilemma?

74
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,830
>> Can I ask you a question?

75
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,510
>> Sure.

76
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,220
>> Before you answer that. So, I had sort

77
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,430
of convinced myself that it didn't matter whether tit for

78
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,930
tat number two started out with C or started out

79
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,270
with D. I'm trying to decide whether that's actually true.

80
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,340
>> 'Kay, that's a

81
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,160
good question. So what will happen, at this from

82
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,970
this point on if we now continue. We, you

83
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,490
know, we took over the brains for tit for

84
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,680
tat, and we forced them to play defect against defect.

85
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,023
>> Mm-hm.

86
00:03:06,023 --> 00:03:09,070
>> And now we release that, and we let them do what, whatever it is

87
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,185
that they're going to do. And what is

88
00:03:10,185 --> 00:03:11,442
th, what are they going to do? Is [CROSSTALK]

89
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:12,022
>> They would defect forever [CROSSTALK]

90
00:03:12,022 --> 00:03:12,380
>> Defect forever.

91
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,180
>> Yeah.

92
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,750
>> And is there anything that tit-for-tat two machine,

93
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,780
could do to get a better score than that?

94
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,870
>> Cooperate.

95
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,413
>> Yeah, so it could. Cooperating with tit for

96
00:03:21,413 --> 00:03:23,224
tat will bring it back into mutual cooperation.

97
00:03:23,224 --> 00:03:23,450
>> Hm.

98
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,360
>> It will actually get a better score.

99
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:25,530
>> Yeah.

100
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,349
>> So, in one case, it would average to minus one and the other one, it

101
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:31,761
would, it would average to minus three and

102
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:34,940
minus one is better, so, you're right. Good point.

103
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,770
>> Okay.

104
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:39,580
>> So what matters is that we get we get them defecting.

105
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,800
>> Right. Okay, so that makes sense. So, I, I was right that

106
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,860
it didn't matter, although you do get

107
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,480
slightly different answers, or slightly different averages.

108
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,770
>> That's right.

109
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,850
But in both cases, there's a way of getting a higher average.

110
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,960
>> Right. Okay, cool, that's what I thought. I thought it was

111
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,760
something like that. So now, let's go back to what you wanted

112
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,870
to do. So, are we going to be able to figure out how

113
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,050
to do Prisoner's dilemma in a way that is sub game perfect?

114
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,460
>> Well, how about I propose a machine, and we'll see what it does?

115
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:00,970
>> Okay.
