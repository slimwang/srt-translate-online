1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,810
So you remember generative
versus discriminative?

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,490
So generative,
I build a model of each class, and

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,040
then I compare it against all of them.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,130
Discriminative, I build the model of
the boundary between the classes.

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,470
So we've talked a bunch about
building some discriminative ones,

6
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,460
let's talk again about
building generative.

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,540
How much you build
a reasonable generative model

8
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,560
of each class of action?

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,390
Okay.
Remember one of the reasons we might

10
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,300
want generative models we might
not have a whole lot of examples.

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,850
So a simple thing you might do is,
you've got a Hu-moment features space

12
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:36,030
and we've got seven things applied
to two images so we get 14 numbers.

13
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,990
So you could use some sort of Gaussian
or maybe it's a Gaussian with diagonal

14
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,370
covariance so that you don't have to
worry about having too many points.

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,080
And you might use a small number of
multiple mixture of Gaussians, but

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,510
the idea is you would build a model,
a Gaussian model,

17
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,340
for each of those classes.

18
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,520
And then what you'll do is
you'll compare the likelihoods.

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,830
You remember the likelihood was
probability of the data given the model.

20
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:04,120
Right so, I build all the models
then when the new data comes in I

21
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,950
evaluate the probability of the data.

22
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,670
Then if I have a prior,

23
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,730
then what I'm going to do is
I'm going to use Bayes rule.

24
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,220
That's what it says here.

25
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:17,442
That basically says I take my
likelihood, I multiply that by the prior

26
00:01:17,442 --> 00:01:22,920
of my model and that's proportional
to my, to my total posterior.

27
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,890
If I don't have a prior,

28
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,400
I might just select whichever
one has the highest likelihood.

29
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,920
And by the way, if I don't have
enough data to even build some

30
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,200
reasonable model of the densities.

31
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,650
I might just use something
like nearest neighbor.

32
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,720
So, the nice thing that we have is
that mo, the motion energy images,

33
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,080
motion history images, they're
sort of little global descriptors.

34
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,760
And the way you do this is you're
going to collect these statistics on

35
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,340
these global descriptors in
order to do the recognition.

36
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,660
One of the things that might
be a little less obvious is

37
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,930
you can't actually recognize
the action till it's done.

38
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:00,588
Right, so, I have this description
that goes back in time so

39
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:04,820
if I'm watching a person sit down,
when their done sitting down,

40
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,335
I now have that chunk of data that
represents them sitting down.

41
00:02:08,335 --> 00:02:12,200
Most activity recognition these days,
there's not a lot of focus on doing

42
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,610
online recognition that as as
you're watching something happen.

43
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,540
The idea of, is that they have
the whole sequence to begin with.

44
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,420
But if you're actually are worried about
recognizing it as it happens, this idea

45
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,330
that I can't recognize something till
it's totally done can be somewhat

46
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,850
concerning and you have to think
about how you might deal with that.
