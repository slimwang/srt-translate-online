1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,160
Well, I'll tell you most of the time when I give a quiz, the answer is all of

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,810
the above or none of the above, but not really in this case.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,920
The speed of the addition operation, you know, back in the Dark Ages,

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,290
you had to worry about the speed of addition, now addition is instantaneous.

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:13,980
Okay?

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,500
And by the way, last time I checked, 4 plus 2 equals 2 plus 4.

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,850
Addition is commutative, so

8
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,650
we don't have to worry about whether we add the noise to the image or

9
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:22,430
the image to the noise.

10
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,650
It's kind of weird to think if I start with some noise and

11
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,940
add an image to it, same value.

12
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,160
But what you do have to worry about, as I said before,

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,470
is the magnitude of the noise compared to the range in value of the image.
