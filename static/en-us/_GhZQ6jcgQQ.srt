1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,640
If we take a look at how I've
edited the buildApiClient function,

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,000
I've added a scope, new Scope("email"),

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,200
instead of the previous scope that we
had that was a profiles based scope.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,200
Now, if you recall back
to the scopes slides,

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,970
the email scope is a much more limited
scope that just gives me access to a lot

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,510
less information than the profile scope.

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,090
And it makes your users feel more
secure if they only want to share their

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,080
email address.

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,130
Then you can put this scope, and
the consent screen will reflect that.

10
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,480
So now that I've changed it to this,
I just want to scroll down and

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,520
take a look at my connection code.

12
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,889
And if you recall earlier on, we had
this connection code that when we were

13
00:00:35,889 --> 00:00:40,798
in onConnected, we then would retrieve
the currentUser from the PeopleApi.

14
00:00:40,798 --> 00:00:44,489
By using
Plus.PeopleApi.getCurrentPerson, and

15
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:46,630
pass it the ApiClient.

16
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,960
We were then able to say
the person was signed in as

17
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,930
the currentUser's full name.

18
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,346
And you saw earlier when I was
demonstrating it, even though I just

19
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:58,584
gave my email address to sign in,
the UI of the screen updated.

20
00:00:58,584 --> 00:01:01,770
And it said the person that
was signed in is my full name.

21
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,250
So I've set email Scope, and
I'm going to run this application.

22
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,530
What do you think will happen when I run
it with email Scope, but I'm trying to

23
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:15,390
access my full name, even though I'm
not given permission to do that?

24
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,000
Well, let's take a look and we'll see.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,110
Note also that I've just put this
code within a try catch clause, and

26
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:21,700
you can guess why I've done that.

27
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,120
So I'm going to debug
the application now.

28
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,340
So here you can see I'm running
the application in the Android emulator.

29
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,340
And I have my new Sign In button,
and I'm presently signed out.

30
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,630
So if I click the Sign In button,

31
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,410
first of all you're going to
see the consent screen.

32
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,620
And the consent screen is
a much more limited one, and

33
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,860
it only wants to know
who I am on Google.

34
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,040
So now the sign in will begin,
and I hit my break point.

35
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,615
Now if you remember the code
was Person currentUser =

36
00:01:45,615 --> 00:01:49,834
Plus.PeopleApi.getCurrentPerson and
pass it the client.

37
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:53,260
So I am going to step over
this line onto the next line.

38
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,830
Now take a close look here
down in the variables window,

39
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,410
we can see the currentUser is null.

40
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:02,040
The system did not allow
me to get this information.

41
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,975
So when I assigned it to
the response from this Person,

42
00:02:04,975 --> 00:02:07,130
currentUser is actually null.

43
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,143
So when I try to set
the text on the label and

44
00:02:10,143 --> 00:02:15,584
I set it to be currentUser.displayName,
of course currentUser is null.

45
00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:19,060
So this will fail, and
it will cause an error in my code.

46
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,110
So if I step over this again,
we'll see the error, and

47
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,100
I fall in to the Exception handler.

48
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,293
And if I just go down here for a moment,
we can see the actual Exception.

49
00:02:28,573 --> 00:02:31,876
It's a java.lang.NullPointerException.

50
00:02:31,876 --> 00:02:36,947
And it's attempting to invoke this
interface method on a null object,

51
00:02:36,947 --> 00:02:40,168
getDisplayName on a null
object reference.

52
00:02:40,168 --> 00:02:43,209
So I'm actually erroring
out when I try to do that.

53
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:46,933
And the reason for that is I'm trying to
access information on a scope that isn't

54
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,930
actually available to me.

55
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:49,960
So how do we fix this?

56
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,350
How do we go about changing this?
