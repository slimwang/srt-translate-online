1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,740
I want to make the distinction between exploratory data analysis and

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,900
data visualization here.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,630
Well, this addition to our graph,

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,220
coloring home games may seem exploratory in nature.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,990
By this point in the pipe line,

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,990
we are already creating a polished visualization with D3.

7
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,170
And we've already discovered for

8
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:23,270
ourselves what interesting insights we want to communicate in our data.

9
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:28,040
Maybe we've performed our exploratory data analysis in a more flexible tool

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:33,660
like R or Python using ggplot2 or and matplotlib

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,860
While coloring the home games red and

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:41,130
making them slightly larger circles using the technique of double-encoding.

13
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,540
We're communicating something, but to a reader who doesn't know what's in

14
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,580
our data, or someone who may not actually look at the source of this, and

15
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:54,490
look at the D3 code to know that I'm coloring the circle based on whether or

16
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,190
not it's a home game, or not.

17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,630
They have no idea what the red represents, or why it's important.

18
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:05,129
So, well, for us, the creator author of the plot,

19
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,100
we might have some sense of what's being communicated.

20
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,820
To the general audience, it's still very hard to interpret.
