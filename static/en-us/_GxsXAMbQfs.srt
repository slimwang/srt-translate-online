1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This finishes my class on the 3 Ms.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In the next one, we'll learn about variance and standard deviation.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
These are actually fun topics relating to the spread of data.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We learn the difference between data like this and data like this

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
that is much more spread out, even though the 3 Ms might agree in all of these data.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And we're going to sharpen our skills to really understand how to look at data.
