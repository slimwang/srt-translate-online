1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,375
Now, lets look at
the Image Acquisition Pipeline.

2
00:00:02,375 --> 00:00:06,106
This is something again, we've discussed
differently, when we talked about

3
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:09,292
cameras, but now, lets talk about it,
in detail in this context.

4
00:00:09,292 --> 00:00:11,583
Of course, we start off with a 3D scene.

5
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:15,976
And of course this scene is being
captured, and the, basically,

6
00:00:15,976 --> 00:00:21,043
the capturing in, information is called
the Scene Radiance refered to as L.

7
00:00:21,043 --> 00:00:22,402
And basically,

8
00:00:22,402 --> 00:00:28,042
what the units here describe is
watts per steradian meters squared.

9
00:00:28,042 --> 00:00:33,275
Steradian is a measure of the solid
angle, and because these are 3D scenes,

10
00:00:33,275 --> 00:00:38,346
and the light is coming out, in form
of a cone from everywhere the basic

11
00:00:38,346 --> 00:00:42,958
idea we want to do is use the cone
information, to capture the light.

12
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:46,672
So in essence what that basically
means is if I have a scene,

13
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:49,584
what I will be doing
basically is using a cone.

14
00:00:49,584 --> 00:00:52,717
And the steradian is basically,
kind of, counting for

15
00:00:52,717 --> 00:00:57,057
all of the [INAUDIBLE] information
that's in this cone, from any point.

16
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,237
And that's basically,
allows us to kind of have an area,

17
00:01:00,237 --> 00:01:01,708
from that point onwards.

18
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:06,433
To just reiterate scene radiance,
and referred to as L, is basically,

19
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:10,001
watts, which is energy per
steradian meters square.

20
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:13,203
Steradian is the measure
of the solid angle.

21
00:01:13,203 --> 00:01:16,282
Primarily because again,
this is a 3D scene, and

22
00:01:16,282 --> 00:01:19,875
the light is coming out in form
of a cone, from everywhere.

23
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:23,395
Of course, when we have a 3D scene,
to capture an image from it,

24
00:01:23,395 --> 00:01:24,292
what do we need?

25
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,667
Of course, Optics.

26
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:29,125
So here, basically now,
we use the out Lens, and Optics, and

27
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:31,875
that converts all of this
3D light information.

28
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:35,833
That's why, we have the solid angle,
and the cone basically, coming in.

29
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:38,042
And now, of course, we have a 2D sensor.

30
00:01:38,042 --> 00:01:41,580
So we, of course, do not have
the information from steradians, but

31
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,292
we do have watt per meter square.

32
00:01:43,292 --> 00:01:47,145
And we know, that was something we
referred to as Sensor Irradiance, and

33
00:01:47,145 --> 00:01:49,458
it's something we ip, in, labeling as E.

34
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:50,669
This is a Linear mapping.

35
00:01:50,669 --> 00:01:54,493
Once I know this, and if have this
information, when it hits the screen,

36
00:01:54,493 --> 00:01:58,084
I can actually now, or a sensor,
I know, what this measure will be.

37
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:00,829
Next stage in the pipeline of course,
is the Shutter,

38
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:04,543
because shutter is the amount of time,
a light is allowed into my sensor.

39
00:02:04,543 --> 00:02:06,625
And we know that basically,

40
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:12,542
E times delta t gives us the information
towards getting, the sensor exposure.

41
00:02:12,542 --> 00:02:17,167
And you may recall of course, that we
refer to the exposure as H, which was

42
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:21,958
equal to the sensor irradiance, and
amount of time, the shutter was open.

43
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:24,550
And this is something again,
we've looked at before,

44
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,085
so in essence we'll be going
from 3D scene, and now,

45
00:02:27,085 --> 00:02:29,917
we're getting sensor information
of the exposure values.

46
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:34,244
Continuing on, we basically now, will
have a sensor, which would be a CCD,

47
00:02:34,244 --> 00:02:37,586
again, we've covered
the details of how a CCD works.

48
00:02:37,586 --> 00:02:41,395
Light comes into a CCD, and what we
basically, get is electrons collecting,

49
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:43,543
and depletion layer kind of,
collects it.

50
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:46,707
In essence, what we're doing
is computing the voltages,

51
00:02:46,707 --> 00:02:49,376
at different types of capacitors,
within a CCD.

52
00:02:49,376 --> 00:02:53,425
Next step of course, is an analog to
digital converter, basically, takes

53
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:57,876
these voltages, and converts them into a
digital values, to give you a raw image.

54
00:02:57,876 --> 00:03:00,949
And of course, then we want to do some
sort of remapping, from the raw image,

55
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:04,084
again, if you were doing camera roll,
you would just use this information.

56
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:07,219
But sometimes you basically,
get compressed pixel information

57
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:10,583
of intensities, and that's where
we get the intensities artifact.

58
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,810
We have covered each, and
every aspect of this earlier, and

59
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,875
you can refer back to the previous
lectures on this one.

60
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:18,826
But the bottom line is, from 3D scene,
once we have the scene radiance,

61
00:03:18,826 --> 00:03:21,843
there's a linear mapping,
to get sensor irradiance.

62
00:03:21,843 --> 00:03:24,564
There's another linear
mapping based on again,

63
00:03:24,564 --> 00:03:26,708
the time opening to get the exposures.

64
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:29,966
And then, there is a bunch of
different operations that happen,

65
00:03:29,966 --> 00:03:31,042
at the sensor level.

66
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:33,529
So, here is one thing we
want to note here is,

67
00:03:33,529 --> 00:03:36,169
this whole process of
the pipeline is linear.

68
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:38,084
There are lots of linear
mappings going on.

69
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:40,083
This part could all be non-linear,
right?

70
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:43,503
I mean, there are no dir, direct
linear equations that would actually,

71
00:03:43,503 --> 00:03:45,168
let us predict this analysis here.

72
00:03:45,168 --> 00:03:48,376
And they're also sometimes depends
on the kinds of sensors, and stuff.

73
00:03:48,376 --> 00:03:52,183
But this is linear, and now, we need
to kind of understand, how we can

74
00:03:52,183 --> 00:03:56,386
use this to understand, and gain
information, from what's in the scene,

75
00:03:56,386 --> 00:03:59,422
to what we want on the sensor,
in terms of an exposure.

76
00:03:59,422 --> 00:04:02,205
So far, we've studied the image
acquisition pipeline, now,

77
00:04:02,205 --> 00:04:04,793
let's look at some of
the mathematics associated with it.

78
00:04:04,793 --> 00:04:09,370
So, of course, this whole pipeline
starts off with L which is the scene

79
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,518
radiance, a linear mapping to E,
a linear mapping to exposure, and

80
00:04:13,518 --> 00:04:17,833
then, of course, all the way down here,
to give me intensity values.

81
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:22,802
Of course, we're interested in this
pipeline, but we are also interested in

82
00:04:22,802 --> 00:04:27,042
the inverse of this pipeline,
which lets me compute the inverse.

83
00:04:27,042 --> 00:04:30,560
Now, we are basically, what I am
interested in, is I have an image,

84
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,445
can I actually now, predict the model
of the whole scene intensities here,

85
00:04:34,445 --> 00:04:35,921
in terms of scene radiance?

86
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:37,501
So, I'm interested in both of those.

87
00:04:37,501 --> 00:04:40,850
And that's the kind of stuff now let's
think about, to be able to model.
