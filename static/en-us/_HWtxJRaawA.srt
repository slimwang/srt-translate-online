00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,390
Indeed we can see that the prices for diamonds are pretty

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:04,960
heavily skewed, but when you put those prices on a log

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,029
ten scale, they seem much better behaved. They're much closer to

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,297
the bell curve of a normal distribution. We can even see a

5
00:00:11,297 --> 00:00:15,260
little bit of evidence of bimodality on this log ten scale.

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,410
Which is consistent with our two class rich buyer poor buyer

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,540
speculation about the nature of customers for diamonds. You actually saw

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,220
a sneak peek of this in problem set set three when you

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,370
looked at the log ten of price by cut.
