1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,710
The other type of bias that we have to

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,700
be careful about is called the, we call it the

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,220
approach bias and this bias often shows itself in the

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,150
beginning of a project or the way we approach something.

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,390
>> Yeah, we see this all the time when we've run UXD

6
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:17,520
workshops at IO, and a variety of other venues before, and almost

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,210
9 times out of 10 every developer when, when asked to build

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,380
a pizza ordering application. Thinks about

9
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,440
a photo realistic pizza ordering widget

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,890
that uses some really nifty graphics API said

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,850
they want to go and build right now.

12
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,390
>> Gosh and I was the one getting hungry.

13
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,420
But why do you think developers approach it this way?

14
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:40,110
>> Well, developers love to code. And when asked to design a pizza

15
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,560
ordering application, the first thing to think

16
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,950
about is what graphics API, APIs are

17
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,230
available on Android. And what other pinch to zoom and 3D, 4D realistic

18
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,340
things they can implement right now. And they want to get to it right now.

19
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,740
And honestly, as a developer even when I'm

20
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,060
designing things, in the back of my head.

21
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:55,160
>> Yep.

22
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,170
>> I'm always thinking, how do I build this thing? How would you approach it?

23
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,439
>> Well, as a designer, the way I would approach it is this. I would try to

24
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:03,644
imagine a user who's sitting there using their phone

25
00:01:03,644 --> 00:01:05,921
and they're hungry for pizza. And they pull up

26
00:01:05,921 --> 00:01:09,122
an application, and they want to go from being hungry

27
00:01:09,122 --> 00:01:11,801
to being satisfied. And I think about, what is

28
00:01:11,801 --> 00:01:14,148
the flow I could create in an application that

29
00:01:14,148 --> 00:01:16,619
would let them go from being hungry to satisfied

30
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,078
as quickly as possible, with as little friction as possible, and

31
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:23,440
make them happy. So that's kind of the pure designer approach.

32
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,520
But the way that we really want to go about this

33
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,410
is not exactly the developer approach or the designer approach. We want

34
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,430
to do something that kind of meets in the middle. So,

35
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:35,120
as a development minded designer, I think what you would want to

36
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,810
do is design something really great, empathize with your user, but

37
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,660
keep constraints in mind and keep the question of whether you can

38
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,760
really build this in mind.

39
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,150
>> You know, exactly. And another thing is

40
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,440
you and I are very familiar with software. And

41
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,360
the way we think about interaction design patterns

42
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,470
and libraries are not the same as a user.

43
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:54,720
>> Exactly.

44
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,230
>> When we're building things, we have a certain bias, because

45
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,100
we're so familiar with these tool kits and platforms that we end

46
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,480
up having assumptions about how somebody will actually use a particular

47
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,787
widget or a control. And that's not exactly how a [INAUDIBLE] user

48
00:02:06,787 --> 00:02:07,443
might do it.

49
00:02:07,443 --> 00:02:09,846
>> Now that we've discussed approach bias, think about the

50
00:02:09,846 --> 00:02:13,010
most recent project that you've worked on. Think about what you

51
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,510
did on day one or how you first approached this

52
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,630
project. Did any of your approaches actually bias the final product?
