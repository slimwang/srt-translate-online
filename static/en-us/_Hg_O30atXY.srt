00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,474
Let's go through these possible answers one by one. To start off, both of these

2
00:00:04,474 --> 00:00:10,310
functions do have y intercepts. In fact, every single exponential function has

3
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:14,404
a y intercept. We'll talk more about that later. Since the domain of each of

4
00:00:14,404 --> 00:00:17,938
these is all the real numbers, we must be able to plug in 0 for x and get a

5
00:00:17,938 --> 00:00:24,120
valid number for y. Which tells us where the y intercept is. Now, let's move on

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:30,742
to asymptotes. Both graphs have horizontal asymptotes at y equals 0. Neither of

7
00:00:30,742 --> 00:00:35,674
them however, has a vertical asymptote or a slant asymptote. Now it's easy to

8
00:00:35,674 --> 00:00:39,834
mistake these steep parts of the curves for vertical asymptotes. But, that just

9
00:00:39,834 --> 00:00:45,216
goes to show rapidly they grow or decay. These steep sections do not represent

10
00:00:45,216 --> 00:00:49,198
discontinuities, or breaks in the graph, like vertical asymptotes would. In

11
00:00:49,198 --> 00:00:56,856
fact, since the domain is all the real numbers, these graphs are continuous.
