1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,330
So now that you've written the callback,
and you actually have a handle on a map

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,770
object, the next thing to do is to
write the code for the buttons.

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,480
To do this, you're going to
work in the onCreate function.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,760
And for each of the buttons, you're
going to create an onClickListener.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,240
Within the onClickListener,

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,570
a function that gets called, you're
then going to set the mapType property

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:24,970
of the GoogleMap to the relevant type of
map that you want, based on the button.

8
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:25,770
So, for example.

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,000
If you want a hybrid map, you would set
the mapType property of the GoogleMap,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,490
to the constant that
defines a hybrid map.

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,630
These types and these constants can
actually be found on the GoogleMap

12
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:36,680
object itself.

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,690
Take a look at the documentation and
you'll find them.

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,920
When you're done creating all of this,
check this box.
