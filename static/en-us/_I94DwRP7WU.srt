1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,520
For Flick Finder, we'll be utilizing
the flickr.photos.search method

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,290
of the Flickr API.

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,860
This method allows us to search for
images using a text string, or for

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,320
images that are geo-tagged
near a certain latitude and

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,900
longitude, amongst other things.

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,190
Of all the methods in the Flickr API,

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,160
this one probably has
the most possibly arguments.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,940
But luckily for us,
we'll only need a few.

9
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,890
Let's start with the arguments
we'll need for a text search.

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,080
The only required argument of
course is the API key, but

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,369
the next argument of interest is called,
text.

12
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:37,004
The text argument is used to find images
that have a title, a description or

13
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:39,886
tags containing a text
value that we provide.

14
00:00:39,886 --> 00:00:41,140
If we continue down,

15
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:45,010
the next argument that we're
going to use is called safe_search.

16
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,260
What safe_ search will allow us to
do is to filter results to show

17
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,890
only images containing
content that's deemed safe.

18
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,540
The remaining arguments are ones
that we've previously used in

19
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,260
the Sleeping In The L ibrary app, and

20
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,580
I'll show them all in
the API explorer now.

21
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,000
So for text I'm going to
enter the Atlanta Braves,

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,489
which is my favorite baseball team.

23
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,560
And then for safe_search, I'll enter 1.

24
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,990
And the last argument I'm
going to specify is for extras.

25
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:20,180
Again, we need to use
the url_m value in extras so

26
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,000
that we get urls for
medium images in the results.

27
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:28,160
And before we call this method,
let's change the output type to JSON.

28
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,170
And it looks like there are thousands
of photos for the Braves.

29
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:32,720
Let's just pick one.

30
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,840
I'll copy the URL into
the address bar and

31
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,450
remove the backslash characters
that were added by Flickr.

32
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,430
Remember these backslashes will get
removed when we create NS URLs.

33
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,800
And there we go, this is
a picture actually of the Brave's

34
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,800
new baseball stadium that's being
built in Cobb County, Georgia.
