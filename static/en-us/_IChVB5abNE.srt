00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,380
So now when you're up and running with conference

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:05,060
central you have a pretty good idea of how to

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,770
write and deploy app engine applications. In the last lesson

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:12,210
we also covered usage management and we added it to

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,050
conference central so only authenticated users can access the application.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,140
When you write applications you very often need to store

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,390
data. And as you know, there are a number of

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,080
ways you can do this. App Engine is no exception.

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,790
It can work with a number of different storage technologies.

10
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:35,566
But there is one that is particularly important, it's called Datastore.

11
00:00:35,566 --> 00:00:40,978
[BLANK_AUDIO]

12
00:00:40,978 --> 00:00:44,840
This is the Big Table restaurant here at Google. You may have heard of Big

13
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,290
Table. It's a technology Google created and

14
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:52,960
published a famous paper about in 2006. Big

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,360
Table allows unlimited amount of data to

16
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,310
be stored and searched effectively. And many of

17
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,400
the huge services being run here at Google

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,310
chose Big Table to store data. You know

19
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:10,530
what? App Engine Datastore also uses Big Table. That means

20
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,220
that your applications ge the same massive scale. Isn't that great?

21
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:23,660
Hm, but I'm starting to feel a little bit hungry. Hey! I think I'll go in,

22
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:31,024
and get a big bite in the Big Table restaurant! See you in class! [NOISE]
