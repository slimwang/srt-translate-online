1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,078
In the next project, you'll be
extracting color and gradient features

2
00:00:04,078 --> 00:00:07,970
from images and training
a classifier to identify vehicles.

3
00:00:07,969 --> 00:00:10,730
In the very beginning of this lesson, we
mentioned that you could also approach

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,880
this problem with deep neural networks.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,240
So Drew,
how does deep learning fit in here?

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,379
>> Well as it happens, the methods we
describe in this lesson were considered

7
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:21,349
state of the art up until
just a few years ago.

8
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,100
Since then, various groups have
made incredible progress using

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,120
deep neural networks for
the task of optic recognition in images.

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,060
>> So, if you were to compare the
process of using deep neural networks

11
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:33,939
for detecting images versus
traditional computer vision,

12
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:36,579
how would you say they're
fundamentally different?

13
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:39,960
>> Great question, in this lesson we
showed you how to extract color and

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,619
grading features by hand,

15
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:44,159
a process that's also known
as feature engineering.

16
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,159
After that, you trained a classifier and
ran a search for objects in an image.

17
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:49,299
With a deep neural network,

18
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,259
you're essentially performing
all these steps at once.

19
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,277
In training the network,
you derive the optimal set of features

20
00:00:55,277 --> 00:00:57,064
to locate the object
you're searching for.

21
00:00:57,064 --> 00:00:58,967
And you can even train
a network to locate objects,

22
00:00:58,968 --> 00:01:00,510
wherever they are in the image.

23
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:02,339
>> Awesome, so, in this lesson,

24
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,060
we're sort of doing by hand what
a neural network can do automatically?

25
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,359
>> That's right, and while it might seem
like a lot of work to manually extract

26
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,700
features and search for objects and
images, neural nets can sometimes

27
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,130
seem like a black box, where it's hard
to visualize what's going on inside.

28
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:18,451
With the more traditional approach
we looked at in this lesson,

29
00:01:18,451 --> 00:01:21,548
it's actually possible to conceptualize
what's going on inside a neural network.

30
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,270
>> Later in the program you'll get
a chance to try using deep neural

31
00:01:26,269 --> 00:01:29,409
networks for image classification and
behavioral cloning.

32
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:32,189
But for right now, enjoy the project.

33
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:35,469
It's a great portfolio project and
I think you'll have a lot of fun.
