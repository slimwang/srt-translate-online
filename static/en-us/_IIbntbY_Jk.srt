welcome back. Now that you've seen a bit about comparisons, let's look at some

2
00:00:03,344 --> 00:00:09,970
trickier cases. In this program here, I start out with the number 2. I take its

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:15,732
square root. Then I square the root, multiply it by itself. If that gets me

4
00:00:15,732 --> 00:00:20,356
back to the original value, I print a message, they're the same. And otherwise,

5
00:00:20,356 --> 00:00:26,771
I print what the root squared actually is. Go ahead and run this program and

6
00:00:26,771 --> 00:00:30,064
tell me what answer you got.
