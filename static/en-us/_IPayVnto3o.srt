00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,455
Symmetric encryption algorithms are
typically block ciphers that take thick

2
00:00:04,455 --> 00:00:05,160
size input.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,620
In this lesson, we will first discuss
the basic primitives of block ciphers,

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:13,250
and then we will study the DES and
AES algorithms.

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,070
We will also discuss how
to encrypt a large message

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:20,090
that has multiple blocks of input data,
and how to protect message integrity.
