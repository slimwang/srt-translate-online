1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,880
If we set this expression equal to 0, I can't really think of a way to factor

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,418
it. So, our best way is to use the quadratic formula. All we need to do is plug

3
00:00:07,418 --> 00:00:10,538
the proper coefficients into the proper places in the formula, and then

4
00:00:10,538 --> 00:00:14,455
simplify. And it looks that we're going to get an answer that has an imaginary

5
00:00:14,455 --> 00:00:18,422
part since we're taking this square root of a negative number. We end up with 3

6
00:00:18,422 --> 00:00:23,400
plus or minus 2i which, then of course, we can split into two separate answers.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,519
With 3 plus 2i and 3 minus 2i.
