1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,460
The line over here would describe the data, ignoring the outlier.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,400
But it will give us a huge least squares error over here,

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,110
which has an enormous effect on the line.

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,550
This one over here makes kind of no sense,

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,160
because even though it pulls a little bit on the right side,

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,460
it pulled the left side down, and gives a huge least squares error over here.

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,630
So that really leaves this one as the most plausible line.

8
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,610
And in reality, you might get something just like this.

9
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,440
With a totally square over here is balanced with many of

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,640
these squares errors on this side over here
