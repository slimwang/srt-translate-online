1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,930
We talked about a whole bunch of things
that we think should be private.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,320
We should be able to exercise control
over who can learn about them and

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,110
who can use that information.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,810
But there are other things
that are clearly not private.

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,900
For example, where I live, my address.

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,520
You buy a house,
there's some that's recorded,

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,330
the deed is recorded, and
by your local government or whoever.

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,600
And anyone can go see that
book where that's done.

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,800
Am I registered to vote in the US?

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,570
This information is public.

11
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,960
You don't have the right to say,

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,330
it shouldn't be collected or
shared with anyone else.

13
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,250
And some more surprising
things may not be public.

14
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,120
I, as a professor at Georgia Tech,
which is a public university,

15
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,370
my salary is public because
the state of Georgia said so.

16
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,090
Actually, this is a good point.

17
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,500
The context is extremely
important as well.

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,170
So, we talked about communication,
emails.

19
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:03,290
Well, as the employees of the state of
Georgia, we're subject to, Georgia Tech

20
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:07,650
is subject to, it's a public university,
subject to open records requests.

21
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,740
The other side of privacy we're
going to see is your ability

22
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,658
to access information,
so privacy limits it.

23
00:01:13,658 --> 00:01:17,636
So, there is certainly sort of
trade-off, and what you and

24
00:01:17,636 --> 00:01:18,884
I view as private.

25
00:01:18,884 --> 00:01:22,956
Some things are clearly private versus
non-private, but obviously in other

26
00:01:22,956 --> 00:01:26,411
cases, we may have different
opinions and those opinions may have

27
00:01:26,411 --> 00:01:30,440
been formed by who we are, our cultural
backgrounds, and things like that.
