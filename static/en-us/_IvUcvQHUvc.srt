1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,670
So the first option here is
saying the VA needs to manage, or

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,900
the CIO who's explaining why
they got the poor grade.

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,420
It's talking about a huge
number of devices.

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,810
So this is how the complexity
gets you reason saying no

5
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,780
we have such a huge problem, okay?

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,220
And that's why we not
able to fully address it.

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,170
And actually this is one of
the explanations he gave.

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,220
The next option here says lack of sense
of urgency in fixing vulnerabilities.

9
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,730
And the CIO actually did not
say he did say that you know

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,700
they take vulnerabilities seriously,
so this wasn't that reason.

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,570
The last option here is choosing
to support key functions

12
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,300
even when this could
introduce vulnerabilities.

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,830
This is kind of interesting.

14
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:44,825
We say sometimes security
gets in the way.

15
00:00:44,825 --> 00:00:47,973
These organizations have
to get certain things done.

16
00:00:47,973 --> 00:00:52,825
And when it you have to choose between
you know not being able to do something

17
00:00:52,825 --> 00:00:57,352
and having security of course you're
going to say no, this needs to get done.

18
00:00:57,352 --> 00:01:01,812
And even if there's some vulnerability
that exists, I have to take the risk.

19
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:05,768
Because the risk of not being
able to do it is, is greater.

20
00:01:05,768 --> 00:01:09,910
So the CIO actually did say that there
are situations where they run into

21
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:14,124
that they must support certain functions
knowing very well that support

22
00:01:14,124 --> 00:01:16,222
those functions are critical.

23
00:01:16,222 --> 00:01:17,462
They need to be supported, but

24
00:01:17,462 --> 00:01:20,152
supporting them is going to
introduce certain vulnerabilities
