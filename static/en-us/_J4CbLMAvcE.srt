00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,840
So now that we know the different types of neurons, sensory, motor and

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,140
interneurons, and how electrical impulses result in action potentials. Let's

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:13,026
see what happens after the action potential occurs. Remember once again that

4
00:00:13,026 --> 00:00:17,184
the signal starts from the dendrites and moves down the axon to the terminal

5
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:22,836
buttons. In Lauren's depiction here at the Terminal button, we have synaptic

6
00:00:22,836 --> 00:00:28,588
vesicles that are holding neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters are then

7
00:00:28,588 --> 00:00:34,172
released into the synaptic cleft. And if those neurotransmitters attach to the

8
00:00:34,172 --> 00:00:39,874
receptors on the opposite neuron, the message will continue along. Think of

9
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:46,139
receptors as a lock and the neurotransmitters as a key. If the neurotransmitter

10
00:00:46,139 --> 00:00:50,939
attaches to the receptor site, the message will continue along, through the

11
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:53,021
next neuron.
