1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,774
This hyperbola will be centered at 0, 5 give, it will have an a value of 8, and

2
00:00:04,774 --> 00:00:10,946
a b value of 4. Good thinking if you got these three right. We'll start by

3
00:00:10,946 --> 00:00:16,660
dividing each of these terms by 64. When we divide this term by 64, we'll

4
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:21,972
simplify it by 1 16th. This term divided by 64 turns into negative x squared

5
00:00:21,972 --> 00:00:28,655
divided by 64. And finally, 64 divided by 64, equals 1. Our y squared term

6
00:00:28,655 --> 00:00:32,065
comes first, which means that our hyperbola needs to open up, an it needs to

7
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:37,220
open down. There's no number next to the x variable, so that means the center,

8
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:42,050
or the x coordinate of the center, is 0. The y coordinate of the center would

9
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:46,739
be positive 5. This is the k it is always next to y. The a is the number that

10
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:50,934
we move in the x direction so that's underneath the the x squared term. It's

11
00:00:50,934 --> 00:00:55,254
the square root of this number. Since the square root of 64 equals 8, we know

12
00:00:55,254 --> 00:01:00,602
the value of a, it must be 8. For the value of b, we simply take the square

13
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:05,864
root of 16 which equals 4. We start by graphing the ellipse with a center at 0,

14
00:01:05,864 --> 00:01:11,342
5 and then we move 8 units in the x direction for 2 points. And four units in

15
00:01:11,342 --> 00:01:16,020
the y direction for two more points. Next we draw our dash rectangle around our

16
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,990
ellipse. Then we draw in the two diagonals. And since we know the y squared

17
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,230
term is first and is positive, we know our hyperbola opens up and it opens

18
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:32,490
down. So we cut our ellipse horizontally. And we flip over these two pieces.

19
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,701
Ultimately, this produces our hyperbola. As a quick check, we can make sure

20
00:01:36,701 --> 00:01:41,765
that these two points are four units vertically away from the center. Our

21
00:01:41,765 --> 00:01:45,795
center is at 0, 5, so yes, this point is four units away vertically, and this

22
00:01:45,795 --> 00:01:50,107
point is four units away in the other direction.
