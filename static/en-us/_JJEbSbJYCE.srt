00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,930
Your natural inclination might be to have Omnivores as the superclass,

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,710
because it's probably going to be bigger, and doesn't work however.

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:14,650
Omnivores have a property, that is they can eat meat, the vegetarians don't,

4
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:18,940
vegetarians don't eat meat. Remember our rule that the definition of

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:23,220
generalization is. That instances as the subclass have to have all of

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,400
the properties the instances the parent class. What that

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,120
says is that Vegetarians are the superclass and Omnivores are the subclass.

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,510
After all, Omnivores can eat vegetables. Okay think about that for

9
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,140
a minute in, before you do your next class model.
