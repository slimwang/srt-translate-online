1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,105
So let's take a look at the code for
sending the purchase hits to Analytics.

2
00:00:06,105 --> 00:00:10,800
In order_dinner.xml you add the code for
the purchase button.

3
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,750
And the onClick is purchaseCart.

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,770
And the initial visibility is invisible.

5
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,680
It's not visible when we
first go to this page.

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:26,075
So over in the orderDinnerActivity
class, we have the method purchaseCart,

7
00:00:26,075 --> 00:00:30,419
which gets invoked when somebody
clicks the purchase button.

8
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:34,243
And again for now we're glossing
right over the actual implementation

9
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:36,790
of the purchase and
just popping up a toast, and

10
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,480
then we call a method to
send the hit to Analytics.

11
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,640
So for
learning purposes we're going to assume

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,420
that the currently selected
dinner is in the cart.

13
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,240
And we're going to buy
whatever's in the cart,

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,190
which means we're going to buy
the currently select dinner.

15
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,210
So we create the product as before,

16
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,130
set the variant to be
the currently selected dinner.

17
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,726
And of course in actual production
code you wouldn't do this,

18
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:03,490
what you would do is you'd iterate
over the items in the cart and

19
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,830
create a product object for each one.

20
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:10,830
Then we create a unique transaction ID.

21
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,750
And you need to have one transaction
ID for each purchase transaction or

22
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,260
each refund transaction.

23
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,360
So it really does need to be
unique to the actual transaction.

24
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,370
Recreate the product action.

25
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:27,940
We set the action to ACTION_PURCHASE and
then also we set the transaction ID.

26
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,610
And then we send the hit, remembering
to change the action to be Purchase.

27
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:40,660
We set product to product, and we set
the product action to productAction.

28
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:45,344
And then in the utility class,
I just added some code to create

29
00:01:45,344 --> 00:01:50,583
a unique transaction based upon
the current time and the product id.

30
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:53,309
And if you came up with your own
different way of creating a unique

31
00:01:53,309 --> 00:01:55,090
transaction, that's perfectly fine.
