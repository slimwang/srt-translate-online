00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,610
I'd like to show you an example of
supervised machine learning from my

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:10,610
robotics past, this robot you
see here is called Latgr or

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,560
learning applied to ground robotics.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,670
It is using keeners neighbor
to learn how to navigate.

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,150
Let me talk a little bit about
what comes in and what goes out.

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,310
It has a sensor in front of it that
sees the world in front of it.

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,750
It can see along a number of
directions where there are obstacles or

8
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,500
where the road is clear.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,340
So, the input is,
in which directions are their obstacles.

10
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,640
And also,
it has the direction towards the goal.

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,530
So in this case, the robots trying to
get to a goal that's off the left, but

12
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,620
these bushes that line the path are sort
of preventing it from getting there.

13
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:56,390
So x, in our case,
are these perceptions.

14
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,130
What do I see around me?

15
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,350
And what's the direction to the goal?

16
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:05,990
And y, or the output, Is,
which direction to steer.

17
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,471
So let's let it go for a while and
see how well it can navigate based on

18
00:01:09,471 --> 00:01:11,929
a little bit of training
that it's been given.

19
00:01:15,032 --> 00:01:17,006
It's doing pretty good here so far.

20
00:01:19,306 --> 00:01:25,610
But, it hasn't been trained quite well
enough and boom, it goes off the path.

21
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,890
This is where learning comes in.

22
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:32,190
We back it up over that area
where it messed up, and

23
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:36,070
we switch the learning switch on,
and we're essentially tell it,

24
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:40,600
okay, watch what we do, that's
the correct thing to do in this case.

25
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:46,168
So it takes all those examples of x's
and y's, x's being the perception and

26
00:01:46,168 --> 00:01:50,707
y being the way it should respond,
adds that to its memory, and

27
00:01:50,707 --> 00:01:54,752
now when it's running live,
it consults this memory.

28
00:01:54,752 --> 00:01:57,248
It says oh, I see this,
what should I do?.

29
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:02,433
It finds the k nearest neighbors to
that current observation and looks at

30
00:02:02,433 --> 00:02:08,220
what they say, and they essentially vote
on what direction the robot should go.

31
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,260
Now after we've trained it for
about a half hour or

32
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,880
so, it's able to navigate through
difficult scenarios really quite easily.

33
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:22,500
So keep in mind, this robot's driving
autonomously, it's just consulting its

34
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,220
memory for when I saw this,
what was the right answer, why?

35
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,860
Supervised learning, and
it's able to get around quite well.

36
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,750
Here's another more
complicated scenario.

37
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,690
The goal where it's trying to get
is on the other side of that tree.

38
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,400
So that's supervised learning for
a robot and, again,

39
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:50,000
the model maps these perceptions x to y,
what it should do.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,870
And finance instead of Y being
which way the robot should go,

41
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,780
it's often a prediction about
what a future price is.

42
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,020
Okay, enough about robots,
let's move on.
