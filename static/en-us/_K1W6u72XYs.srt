1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,320
Okay let's look at the first statement.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,100
The planes defined by the equations
have a common intersection.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,340
This is definitely necessary for
the system to have a unique solution.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,420
Having a common intersection point means
that there is a solution to the system.

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,630
However, it could be the case that
the planes have more than one common

6
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:18,940
intersection point.

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,500
So, having a common intersection point
isn't sufficient proof that the system

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,120
has a unique solution.

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,706
Second, there are no equations
of the form 0 = 0 or

10
00:00:27,706 --> 00:00:31,290
0 = k found during Gaussian elimination.

11
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,100
It might be tempting to say that
this property is related to

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,990
having unique intersections.

13
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:40,090
But it turns out that this property
is neither necessary nor sufficient.

14
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,690
Why is this the case?

15
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:47,370
Let's consider the system x
+ y + z = 0 and y + z = 1.

16
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,130
If we solve the system, we never get
an equation of the form 0 equals 0.

17
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:56,300
In fact, the only operation we can
do is to subtract equation two

18
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,950
from equation one, giving us x = -1.

19
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:04,080
The solution set is a line that
can be parametrize as X, Y,

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,060
Z equals negative one one line is E and
Z.

21
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,820
In other words, we have an infinite
number of solutions, even though,

22
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,010
we never saw a Euro equal zero.

23
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,190
So never seeing zero equals zero,

24
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,590
is not sufficient to say we
definitely have a unique solution.

25
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:22,090
On the other hand, we can run into
instances of zero equals zero and

26
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:23,940
still have a unique solution.

27
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,920
Let's look at the system which
we saw in the previous quiz.

28
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,760
The fourth equation is equal
to the first equation.

29
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,780
Plus two times the second equation.

30
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,650
So during L.C. elimination,
it will be reduced to zero equals zero.

31
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,940
Nevertheless, the system has
a unique solution (0,1,-1).

32
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,950
Let's look at the third
statement in the list now.

33
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,940
There are exactly three
equations in the system.

34
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:52,190
Well, we actually just saw a system with
four equations but with unique solution.

35
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:56,610
So certainly, this property isn't
necessary, nor is it sufficient.

36
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,380
Since we've actually seen plenty of
systems with exactly three equations,

37
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,540
which have either infinitely many or
no solutions.

38
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,950
For example, in a previous exercise,

39
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:11,270
we saw a system of the form x
plus 27 plus z equals negative 1.

40
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:15,340
3x plus 6y plus 2z equals 1 and
negative x minus

41
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:20,470
2y minus z equals 1 and this system
had a line's worth of solutions.

42
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,870
However, there is a modification
of this third statement

43
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,720
that does have a relation to whether
a system has a unique solution.

44
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,430
If we change the word exactly
to the phrase at least.

45
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,620
There are at least three
equations in the system,

46
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,190
then the property does become necessary.

47
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,360
But not sufficient for
the system to have a unique solution.

48
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,770
We've already talked
about this geometrically

49
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:46,580
since we showed that two planes
cannot intersect in a single point.

50
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,630
But we'll see an algebraic reason,
which ends up being more generalizable

51
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,450
after we consider the last
statement of the quiz.

52
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,480
After reaching triangular
form each variable

53
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,050
is a lead variable in
an equation in the system.

54
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,340
This statement is both necessary and
sufficient for

55
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,550
a system to have a unique solution.

56
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:08,700
Under the assumption that we don't
run into any zero equals k equations.

57
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,740
Also, each variable
that is a lead variable

58
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,250
in an equation after
reaching triangular form.

59
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,850
Could be solved for any variables
left over cannot be solved for and

60
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,390
will end up being parameters for
an infinite family of solutions.

61
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:26,540
Thus, having all variables be
leading variables in triangular form

62
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,320
is equivalent to saying there
are no free parameters.

63
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,550
That is, each variable can be solved for
explicitly.

64
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,230
This last statement gives us
a useful computable criterion.

65
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,560
For determining whether a consistent
solution will have one or

66
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,300
infinitely many solutions.

67
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,490
We just run the Gaussian elimination
algorithm until the system is in

68
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,580
triangular form.

69
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,830
And then, check whether all
the variables appear as leading terms in

70
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,250
the resulting system.

71
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,170
This criterion also explains why
the statement "there are at least

72
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,690
three equations in
the system" is necessary.

73
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,620
For a system to have a unique solution,

74
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,900
because if there were fewer
than three equations.

75
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,460
Then there won't be enough equations for

76
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,390
all the variables to show
up as leading variables.

77
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,950
Meaning, there isn't a unique solution.
