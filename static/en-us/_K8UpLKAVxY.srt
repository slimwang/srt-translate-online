Welcome to Statistics 101, taught by me, Sebastian Thrun and by Adam Sherwin,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
who is our assistant instructor doing a lot of work in the background.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I figure I'll start with giving you a teaser, a challenging teaser.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm going to provoke you.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So, this is you.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I believe you should be unhappy,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
not because our class is so bad,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
but you and I will prove in a second that you are unpopular.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The reason why I show this

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
is to show you how deep statistics is

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and how we can easily fool ourselves. So let's dive in.
