1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,080
Because TLB's kind of like a cache.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,710
Let's talk about how it is organized
in terms of cache properties.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,620
First, easy direct map of fully
associative or somewhere in between.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,200
Well, it is small, so
it is already very fast.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,430
So it tends to be fully or
highly associative.

6
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,670
Usually we don't have direct map TLBs

7
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,520
because that would sacrifice the hit
rate for speed, but because it's so

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,810
small, it's already very fast so
we don't really need that.

9
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,770
How about the TLB size?

10
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,720
We want it to hit at least
as often as our cache, so

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,660
we want it to cover more
memory than the cache.

12
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:44,660
So we usually want our TLB to be
somewhere about 64 to 512 entries.

13
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:49,110
What if we need more TLB entries in
order to get the hit rate that we want?

14
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,600
Well, you don't want it to be too large
because then it's going to become slow.

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,540
In that case,
you want to have a two-level TLB.

16
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,220
The first level, or level one TLB,
will be the small and

17
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,730
fast one that hits in a single cycle.

18
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:08,380
But if you have a miss there,
we have a larger level two TLB.

19
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,580
It has a hit time that
is several cycles, so

20
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,040
it's significantly slower than L1.

21
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,330
But still way faster than going through
memory and doing the translation.

22
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,300
And it is large.

23
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,340
It can be several thousand entries
because with several thousand entries we

24
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,890
can still support relatively good hit
times, but not a single cycle time.
