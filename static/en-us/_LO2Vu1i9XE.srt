1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,550
So with that I'd just like to close and
say, one,

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:05,620
we talked about Epsilon photography.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,189
Sequence of images allowed
us to now capture more

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,650
additional representation that will
allow us to generate newer images.

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,930
We basically said, let's look
at coded photography, that is,

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,180
within the same image captured, let's
put some sort of additional information

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:23,760
in there that could be done by
coded aperture or coded shutter and

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,400
that allow us to create, for example,
two different types of images.

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,340
We looked at coded aperture in detail.

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,100
We looked at flutter-shutter,
which was called a shutter.

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,840
And basically all of
them are examples of

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,290
how we can actually
do coded photography.

13
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,270
Again, Epsilon photography,
coded photography,

14
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,630
just kinds of similar things
in different ways, but

15
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:47,610
all aimed at generating novel
images on the camera by controlling

16
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,910
how the camera captures light from a
scene and in essence are major parts of

17
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,680
what we think computational photography
should be looking more and more at.

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,740
You'll be learning more
about these things and

19
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,770
other ways throughout the class with
some additional papers that I'm going to

20
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,110
be pointing out to you.

21
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:05,209
To finish, here is the paper that
actually gets into the whole concept of

22
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:08,530
Epsilon to coded photography,
then the paper that I talked about,

23
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,720
coded apertures.

24
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,260
This is the paper about
fluttered shutter cameras.

25
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:16,240
Just if you're interested in the Lucy
Richardson deconvolution methods there's

26
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,410
a Wikipedia entry on
it that's pretty good.

27
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,500
And again, for those of you interested
in learning more about the discrete

28
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,110
fourier transform and the sync functions
for different types of signals.

29
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,840
There's an online book that has
a lot of in, information on it.

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,090
But otherwise find your favorite
textbook on digital processing or

31
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,680
image processing,
they'll tell you how to do these things.

32
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,110
Just again, I've also linked
the websites of the different

33
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,970
projects that I've talked
about in this class.

34
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,410
I encourage you to look at them,

35
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,190
there's a whole lot of
additional detail available
