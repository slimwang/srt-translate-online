00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let me ask the same question for the stochastic case.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We have the same world as before,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and actions have stochastic outcomes.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The probability 0.8, we get the action we commanded,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
otherwise we get left or right.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And assuming that the initial values are all 0,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
calculate for me for a single backup the value of A3.
