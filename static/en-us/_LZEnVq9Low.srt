1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,523
At first the experiment was uneventful, the teacher delivered the smaller

2
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:09,846
shocks in the shock generator whenever the learner made an error. However, as

3
00:00:09,846 --> 00:00:13,323
the shocks increased in intensity, many of the teachers became very

4
00:00:13,323 --> 00:00:18,329
uncomfortable and unsure about continuing. When the teachers expressed to

5
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:22,359
Milgram that they didn't want to continue, Milgram would tell the teacher that

6
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:28,800
the experiment must continue. You must continue with the experiment. So, every

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,100
time the teacher tried to ask Milgram to stop, he told them that they were

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:38,102
unable to do so and they needed to continue delivering the shocks. While the

9
00:00:38,102 --> 00:00:41,996
teacher was administering the shocks, he heard some preprogrammed responses

10
00:00:41,996 --> 00:00:47,898
from the learner. For example, at 90 volts, the learner would yell ugh. And its

11
00:00:47,898 --> 00:00:52,716
at these times when the teacher became uncomfortable and would tell Milgram, I

12
00:00:52,716 --> 00:00:57,845
want to stop. And recall, Milgram would say, you must continue, the experiment

13
00:00:57,845 --> 00:01:03,121
must go on. At 150 volts, The teacher would hear the learner yell "get me out

14
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:09,014
of here! My heart's starting to bother me. I refused to go on. Let me out!".

15
00:01:09,014 --> 00:01:13,046
Here again, the teacher will become uncomfortable and tell Milgram that he

16
00:01:13,046 --> 00:01:17,390
wanted to stop. In each instance, Milgram reminded the person that he had to

17
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:22,100
continue with the experiment and that he could not leave. Finally, when the

18
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,626
volts went past 330, the teacher would hear no response from the learner at

19
00:01:26,626 --> 00:01:32,710
all. And this implied that the leaner was either unconcious, or worse. Remember

20
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:38,820
when Milgram asked those experts how many people would go up to 450 volts?

21
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,440
Well, they were very wrong. In fact, in his results he found that 65% of the

22
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:50,235
participants went all the way to 450 volts. Also, there were no differences in

23
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:53,590
the sexes, meaning men and women were equally likely to go all the way up to

24
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:59,783
450 volts. Interestingly, adding the yelling of the learner at 150 volts, where

25
00:01:59,783 --> 00:02:05,946
he yelled, 'Let me out of here. I don't want to continue,' did decrease

26
00:02:05,946 --> 00:02:11,510
obedience from 100% to down to 83%. It's important to point out that the

27
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,982
participants were debriefed, and told after the study, what the study was

28
00:02:14,982 --> 00:02:19,595
actually about. And they were reunited, the teacher and the learner and the

29
00:02:19,595 --> 00:02:23,853
teacher could see that the learner was actually never harmed. Milgram conducted

30
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:28,736
a series of studies in this area and changed some of the variables. For

31
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:32,598
example, he changed the attire of the researcher. It turns out that people were

32
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:35,978
more likely to obey when the researcher was wearing a white lab coat, than when

33
00:02:35,978 --> 00:02:40,736
the researcher was more casually dressed, like here. In one experiment, he

34
00:02:40,736 --> 00:02:44,116
changed the proximity of the teacher and the learner, and removed the barrier

35
00:02:44,116 --> 00:02:49,727
so they could see each other. In these situations, the teacher was much less

36
00:02:49,727 --> 00:02:54,866
likely to go all the way to 450 volts. These are called systematic replications

37
00:02:54,866 --> 00:02:59,432
of the original research study. So, it turns out that there are many variables

38
00:02:59,432 --> 00:03:03,980
that influenced obedience to authority. Now, let's go to Greg to talk a little

39
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,545
bit more in-depth about the ethics of this Milgram experiment.
