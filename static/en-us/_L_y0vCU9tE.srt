00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:07,520
a hard problem, and there are many possible ways. And the

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,820
only way to know whether you provided a good one, is

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,430

00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,610

00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,080
what the forum is for. Post your answers on the forum

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,230
and discuss it. See what other people come up with. See

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,760
how well your solution is understood, or what ideas you might

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,670
get from other people.
