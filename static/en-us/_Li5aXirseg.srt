1
00:00:00,202 --> 00:00:04,019
We're going to convert sunshine from
using action bars to using tool bars.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,520
We start off by changing
the app's style.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,482
Then we add a tool bar style and
reference it in the app theme.

4
00:00:09,482 --> 00:00:12,430
Remember we're just doing that to set
some common parameters across our

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,370
toolbars.

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,130
Then we add support toolbars to
activity main, and activity detail.

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,660
We call set support action bar in
each activity to register it, and

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,600
then we call setDisplayHomeAsupEnabled
with true and

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,810
setDisplayShowTitleEnabled is
false on our support action bar.

10
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:33,554
Finally, we add our logo into
the toolbar layout in activity_main.
