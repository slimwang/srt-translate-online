1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,510
>> Before we go any further,
just something you should know.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:07,441
In particle filtering,
the measurements are typically

3
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:11,250
written as the z's,
z sub t and not as y of t.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,648
It was just the way it was done.

5
00:00:13,648 --> 00:00:15,886
It has to do with whether
you're connected to vision or

6
00:00:15,886 --> 00:00:18,465
robotics in order it, so
that it aligns with various papers and

7
00:00:18,465 --> 00:00:19,890
other formulations you'll see.

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,617
We're going to start s,
showing z's in the slides to come.

9
00:00:23,617 --> 00:00:26,281
It also made it much easier to
borrow slides from other people,

10
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:27,551
because they were using the z's.

11
00:00:27,551 --> 00:00:28,532
All right.

12
00:00:28,532 --> 00:00:33,321
So the key to sort of particle
filtering is the following.

13
00:00:33,321 --> 00:00:38,002
If we have a, a distribution and
here we have a nice little distribution,

14
00:00:38,002 --> 00:00:42,003
which you see is, I don't know
what that distribution is, but

15
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:44,515
I know one thing, it's not Gaussian.

16
00:00:44,515 --> 00:00:46,897
Now somebody who's really
smart out there might say,

17
00:00:46,897 --> 00:00:49,088
well, it looks to me like
a mixture of Gaussians.

18
00:00:49,088 --> 00:00:52,060
>> Well, it sort to looks to me
like a mixture of Gaussians.

19
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,446
>> Yeah, in this particular case,
maybe it is.

20
00:00:54,446 --> 00:00:56,675
That's just for convenience of drawing.

21
00:00:56,675 --> 00:01:00,171
And in fact, there is a relationship
between mixtures of Gaussians and

22
00:01:00,171 --> 00:01:02,806
particle filters,
which we won't even talk about.

23
00:01:02,806 --> 00:01:03,809
But basically,

24
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:08,039
it is you have a bunch of things with
together represent your density.

25
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:11,546
In particle filters or
sample based methods,

26
00:01:11,546 --> 00:01:14,641
what you have is you have
a set of particles and

27
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:19,633
here the particles are drawn out
where you can see these particles.

28
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:21,125
It says, Xt.

29
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:23,964
That means these happen to be
our particles at time t and

30
00:01:23,964 --> 00:01:27,186
there's n of them and, you know,
the bigger N is the better.

31
00:01:27,186 --> 00:01:29,547
And you'll notice it says,
weighted here in parentheses,

32
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:32,574
because sometimes they're weighted or
sometimes they all have the same weight.

33
00:01:32,574 --> 00:01:36,237
It, it, density is represented by
sort of where the particles are.

34
00:01:36,237 --> 00:01:39,128
So you see we have a nice high
density here, so we have lots and

35
00:01:39,128 --> 00:01:40,397
lots of particles there.

36
00:01:40,397 --> 00:01:41,157
Okay?

37
00:01:41,157 --> 00:01:44,669
Not so many particles here, not so
many here and lots of them there.

38
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:45,348
All right?

39
00:01:45,348 --> 00:01:46,521
So that's where they are.

40
00:01:46,521 --> 00:01:49,399
And if they were weighted,
it would be as if you,

41
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:53,068
you can think of that as having
two particles in the same spot.

42
00:01:53,068 --> 00:01:57,195
If I double the weight, it'd be like
having two particles at the same spot.

43
00:01:57,195 --> 00:02:01,661
And now you can say that the probability
density that x is some value is

44
00:02:01,661 --> 00:02:06,358
essentially the probability, if you
were to draw out a particle that you

45
00:02:06,358 --> 00:02:10,987
would get a particle whose value is
really, really close to that spot.

46
00:02:10,987 --> 00:02:11,655
Okay?

47
00:02:11,655 --> 00:02:14,276
And that's what it
means to use samples or

48
00:02:14,276 --> 00:02:16,977
particles to represent
a particular density.

49
00:02:16,977 --> 00:02:21,574
And if you're doing that,
then your overall goal is you want

50
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:26,339
sort of as n gets bigger, the idea
is that the probability of getting

51
00:02:26,339 --> 00:02:30,936
a point from this distribution,
that's x is an element of xt

52
00:02:30,936 --> 00:02:35,066
is a approximately what
the underlying probability was.

53
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:39,437
And for tracking, the idea is given
everything we've observed so far.

54
00:02:39,437 --> 00:02:41,085
So what are our observations?

55
00:02:41,085 --> 00:02:42,118
Remember, they're z's.

56
00:02:42,118 --> 00:02:47,988
So given everything that we've observed
so far, what's our belief about where x

57
00:02:47,988 --> 00:02:53,105
is and we want to end up with a set of
particles that gives us that density.
