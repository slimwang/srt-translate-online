1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,480
Now, we're moving into
the world of native apps.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,050
And this is a world that's flourishing.

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,940
You might notice some similarities
between what we spoke about for the web,

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,240
but there are also some specific
monetization methods for native apps.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,670
>> At first, you need to think, what
would be the best model for your app?

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,500
It's likely to change, but that's fine.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,920
You need to be agile and
listen to your customers.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,700
Let's look at some of
the most popular options.

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,840
>> First, you can monetize premium apps.

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,280
That's selling your app for
a fixed price.

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,240
In a lot of cases, this might not
provide you with enough revenue, so

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,620
you can also optionally include ads or

13
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,259
use in-app billing to sell
additional features or content.

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,880
Now this model works great for
certain categories, like games for kids.

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,220
In this example, parents can
pay a full price up front, and

16
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:54,030
a model with like ads or in-app
purchases may not work as well since

17
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,690
the kid would have to
make those purchases.

18
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,860
However, this model may also limit your

19
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,320
app's monetization potential
in developing markets.

20
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,300
You may be able to achieve greater
revenue using the freemium subscription

21
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,360
or advertising model.

22
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,680
>> And monetizing freemium apps.

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,260
Users are more likely
to download a free app.

24
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,620
Later, you could use several
options to monetize.

25
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,250
First, use in app payments
to unlock more features.

26
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,770
For example, games like Angry Birds,
Clash of Clans and

27
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,802
many others, and productivity apps,
Evernote, Springnote,

28
00:01:28,802 --> 00:01:31,385
all are using this to
provide a free tier.

29
00:01:31,385 --> 00:01:35,195
Second, subscriptions for
recurring services.

30
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:36,825
It might be used progressively or

31
00:01:36,825 --> 00:01:42,455
expire after a period of time, such as
a game booster or a news subscription.

32
00:01:42,455 --> 00:01:45,695
Many examples like Pandora,
Financial Times, Strava,

33
00:01:45,695 --> 00:01:48,465
Dropbox and many more are using it.

34
00:01:48,465 --> 00:01:51,345
Another option is just to
leave the app free, and

35
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:54,840
use it as a marketing or
as an enhancement to another product.

36
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,805
>> E-commerce is another monetization

37
00:01:57,805 --> 00:02:00,360
option
>> In this model, you can sell physical

38
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,550
goods, like tomatoes, clothing,
electronics, what have you.

39
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,900
And you can also sell other services.

40
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:11,217
Think about Etsy and
Amazon as good examples of e-commerce.

41
00:02:11,217 --> 00:02:15,820
>> The question is, which model
gets the best results for your app?

42
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,750
Most app services are made
to help you figure out

43
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,230
what combination works best both for
your audience and your bottom line.

44
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,140
You should remember that you
will need a lot of traffic

45
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,780
in order to make this model work for
you.
