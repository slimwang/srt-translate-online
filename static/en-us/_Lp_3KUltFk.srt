00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,610
Okay, I hope you're enjoying the course so far.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,340
Here's an exercise that'll give you a chance to do

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:08,670
some data wrangling using the XLRD module in Python.

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,050
What I'd like you to do here, is read through

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:16,580
the aircot hourly load file. This file here, and report the time stamp,

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:21,310
which is stored in this column, and load for the min, max, and

7
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:26,310
average values from this column. From the coast region of Texas. Let's

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,660
quickly take a look at the code provided. What I'd

9
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,080
like you to look at first are the assertions here

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,730
at the bottom. This gives you an idea for the

11
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,430
type of values you need to produce. What I'd like you

12
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,890
to do here, is find the max value in that

13
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,680
column B, the coast region. And then, for that max

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,540
value, find the value on column to the left where

15
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:51,250
the time stamp is stored. And report it as a tuple,

16
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:55,180
just like we did when we were looking at our example of how

17
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,690
to use XLRD. In order to complete this exercise, you'll be working in

18
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,240
the Parse File function. And you need to pull out values that will

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,720
allow you to complete this data dictionary

20
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,340
right here, which is going to be returned.
