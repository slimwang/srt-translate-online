00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,900
In the old days,
games were written to run on

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,860
one particular model of computer or
gaming hardware.

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:06,533
These days,

4
00:00:06,533 --> 00:00:10,401
people will play games on any device
they can cram a microcontroller into.

5
00:00:10,401 --> 00:00:13,891
There's still dedicated gaming hardware,
like handhelds and

6
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:18,550
consoles, but there's also mobile phones
running primarily Android and iOS.

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,965
There's desktop computers running Mac,
Windows, and Linux.

8
00:00:21,965 --> 00:00:22,769
And, of course,

9
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:26,570
there's the bane of middle school
productivity browser based games.

10
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,420
With this wealth of gaming platforms,
the issue arises that

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,170
all these platforms use different
programming languages and

12
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,840
different systems for drawing,
networking, input, and

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,730
pretty much everything else,
including in what form that these

14
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,120
applications take when they're
actually distributed to end users.

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,640
For instance,
Android apps are written in Java and

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,490
get packaged into an APK archive for
a distribution.

17
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:52,260
iOS apps are written in a completely
different language, in Objective-C or

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,240
more recently in Swift.

19
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,260
iOS apps then get packaged into
an IPA file for distribution.

20
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,000
Web apps are a really complicated and
diverse beast.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,515
But the code that actually runs
the game on the client side needs to

22
00:01:04,515 --> 00:01:08,285
be in JavaScript or a language
that compiles down to JavaScript.

23
00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:11,965
Then to distribute your web app to the
servers that are going to run it there

24
00:01:11,965 --> 00:01:15,765
are a ton of different ways to do it,
one of which is a web archive file.

25
00:01:15,765 --> 00:01:19,615
Desktop apps can be even more diverse
and can be written in any language that

26
00:01:19,615 --> 00:01:22,125
runs on a desktop computer,
which is pretty much all of them.

27
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,980
For distribution, there are a ton
of options, including EXE files for

28
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,620
Windows, JARs that are executable jars,
DMG disk images for

29
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,620
Mac or really anything else.

30
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,786
As an indie developer, you would
like to make cross-platform games so

31
00:01:36,786 --> 00:01:40,254
that you can distribute your awesome new
game on as many platforms as possible.

32
00:01:40,254 --> 00:01:44,900
But you also don't want to write your
game three or four or five times over.
