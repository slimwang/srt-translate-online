00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,086
So the results of the Hart and Risley study, first we see that all the children

2
00:00:04,086 --> 00:00:09,595
started to speak at around the same time. They also developed good structure

3
00:00:09,595 --> 00:00:14,583
and use of language. And together these findings help confirm when language

4
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:20,313
generally occurs. But I saved the most interesting results of this study. And

5
00:00:20,313 --> 00:00:23,526
these results are based on the type of family environment the children were

6
00:00:23,526 --> 00:00:27,459
exposed to. So let's move forward with those results.
