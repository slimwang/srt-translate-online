1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,400
To get started, we want to give you
a big picture view of machine learning.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:03,950
What it is?

3
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:04,710
Where it came from?

4
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,530
And what you'll learn in
this nano degree program?

5
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,490
Machine learning borrows
heavily from two fields,

6
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,820
artificial intelligence and
data science.

7
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,630
So, we'll start by talking
a bit about those areas and

8
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,170
how machine learning fits in.

9
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:18,350
Using some material from one of Georgia
Tech's artificial intelligence classes

10
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,880
and one of Udacity's 
data science classes.

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,660
Then we'll move on to machine
learning more closely and

12
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,820
start looking at Georgia Tech's
machine learning class and

13
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:25,840
Udacity machine learning class.

14
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,440
Finally, we'll conclude by looking at
some of the basics of machine learning,

15
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,369
like classification and regression,
in order to get a feel for

16
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,770
how machine learning is really
about building models of data.
