1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,800
Here we're looking at

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,730
a visualization about drone strikes from pitch interactive.

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,820
As we enter the visualization, we're taken through an author driven

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:12,030
narrative step by step with the accompanying drone strike animation.

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,918
This is the narrow stem of the martini glass.

6
00:00:18,316 --> 00:00:22,350
As we click through, the final visualization starts to build.

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,040
Each element fades in slowly,

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,250
with annotations about notable events during that period.

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,530
Notice that up until now, it's been linear, with a single path.

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,205
We're still on the stem of the martini glass.

11
00:00:37,248 --> 00:00:39,344
After the visualization is finished building,

12
00:00:39,344 --> 00:00:42,460
we're invited to look into the data more closely.

13
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,320
We're now in the wide mouth of the glass, and

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,260
it's become a viewer-driven narrative, instead of an author-driven one.

15
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,963
I can mouse over specific data points, and

16
00:00:49,963 --> 00:00:52,625
a tooltip appears, allowing me to dig into the data more closely.

17
00:00:55,717 --> 00:00:59,487
I can also click on the tabs in the upper left to pivot the data and

18
00:00:59,487 --> 00:01:00,990
look at it in other ways.

19
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,739
Recent news about drone strikes is included below,

20
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,840
keeping the visualization relevant and current.

21
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,230
Hopefully, you can see how this particular visualization combines with

22
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:15,110
the author-driven and viewer-driven elements to make a compelling narrative.

23
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:15,810
Let's look at one more.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,120
In this example,

25
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:23,380
Parascopic shows us a visualization of the number of gun-related deaths in 2013.

26
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,960
It starts with a few victims and

27
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,680
projects out the number of years they would have lived without gun violence.

28
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,590
It keeps a running tally, and the visualization builds exponentially.

29
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,270
Similar to the previous example, there's a clear narrative as we enter

30
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,420
the visualization, and then we're invited to apply various FilterSense data.

31
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,310
For example, I wanted to look at males that are over 30 in the Southeast.

32
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:51,976
I can either look at their projections here, or look at a graph.

33
00:01:56,129 --> 00:02:00,014
Also included is two major insights, that the majority of victims are men and

34
00:02:00,014 --> 00:02:03,080
boys, and that the young people are a significant portion.
