1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,040
We developed the original Sunshine app
in parallel with the development of

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,400
material design in Android.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,790
For that reason the design already
incorporates some material concepts.

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,840
We're going to take the design
a bit farther in that direction

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,900
with the help of a support library.

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,250
While Sunshine functions on phones and
tablets of all sizes

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,290
it wouldn't come close to be considered
a tablet optimized application.

8
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,290
Material design could help us here.

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,060
We can take advantage of patterns
that add extra space into and

10
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,330
around our layouts to make things
feel more natural on these devices.

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,560
The new support library makes it easy
to bring some material design to our

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,770
application.

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,780
It implements toolbars and

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,070
makes it generally easy to bring vibrant
material colors to our application.

15
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,870
Finally, we're going to add motion and
dimension to our application.

16
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,950
Some of this will only apply
to newer Android releases, but

17
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,580
we'll make sure that the experience
is good on all of our devices.
