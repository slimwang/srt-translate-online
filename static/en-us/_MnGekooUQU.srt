1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,490
Is the efficient markets
hypothesis correct?

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,520
Well, if it is,

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,150
then a lot of what we're trying to
do in this course is not possible.

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,160
Namely, we can't beat the market

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,720
using any of these strategies
we might be looking at.

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,640
Now, I think there is evidence that

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,040
certain versions of
the hypothesis are not correct.

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,800
And there are a number of very
successful hedge funds out there

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,150
that would seem to indicate that
you can make money in the market

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,980
by investing in things other
than just the market portfolio.

11
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,053
I would say the strong version
of the efficient markets

12
00:00:41,053 --> 00:00:45,370
hypothesis is the least solid.

13
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,030
In other words,

14
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:52,180
the strong version says that you can't
even profit from insider information.

15
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:56,690
The reason that I think that
one is not true is because

16
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,750
we have seen people make money
from insider information.

17
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,319
Some of them have gone to jail,
but clearly,

18
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,640
it's a method that can provide profit,
even though it might be illegal.

19
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,760
This is an interesting
data set that seems to

20
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,640
refute the semi-strong version of the
efficient markets hypothesis as well.

21
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,140
It's a little bit complex, so
I'll step through it carefully.

22
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,380
So, let's look at the blue dots.

23
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:31,270
Each dot here represents the P/E ratio

24
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:35,680
on a particular date, so, for instance,

25
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,420
this stock had a P/E ratio of 20,
that's price to earnings.

26
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,050
That's the horizontal
component of its location.

27
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,630
The vertical location is

28
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:52,920
how much money did it make in
terms of price over 20 years.

29
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,310
So for instance, this stock had
a price/earnings ratio of 20.

30
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:04,850
And it made about 4% annualized returns.

31
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,229
As we go down this way,
the P/E ratio is lower.

32
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,780
So lower numbers for
P/E ratio are better.

33
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,810
If you think about it,
price divided by earnings,

34
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:18,729
if it's a lower price and has higher
earnings, you'll get a lower number.

35
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:26,500
So, presumably, lower values this way
indicate higher value for a stock.

36
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,200
And each group of colors represents

37
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,120
different decade when
the analysis was done.

38
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,035
So, for instance, this dark blue
was an analysis based on what

39
00:02:38,035 --> 00:02:43,130
the P/E ratios of stocks
were in 1890 to 1910 and

40
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:49,670
all the way up to the red,
which was 1970 through 1985.

41
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,620
Now for all of these decades,

42
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,208
we saw that at the beginning of
the corresponding time period,

43
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:05,840
low P/E ratios corresponded
with higher returns.

44
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,100
So this shows that price/earnings
ratios are very predictive across many,

45
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,380
many decades of future returns, and

46
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,960
that tends to refute
the semi-strong version of the EMH.

47
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,490
Okay, that's it for
the efficient markets hypothesis.

48
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,020
I will see you again soon, bye, bye.
