1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,550
Up until this point,

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:05,670
we've focused on learners that
provide forecast price changes.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,030
We then buy or sell the stocks with the
most significant predicted price change.

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,040
This approach ignores
some important issues,

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,680
such as the certainty
of the price change.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,560
It also doesn't help us know when
to exit the position either.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,440
In this lesson,
we'll look at reinforcement learning.

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,210
Reinforcement learners create policies

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,880
that provide specific direction
on which action to take.
