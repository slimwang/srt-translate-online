1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,660
So how does machine learning actually
differ from traditional programming?

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,000
Well when we write
a traditional program,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,039
we usually build the decision-making
directly into the program.

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,760
So if we wanted to develop a program
that could recognize my face.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,920
We would tell it, look for glasses, look
for brown eyes, look for brown hair.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,050
With machine learning though, we
wouldn't actually tell it any of that.

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,920
We would build an agent that could look
at a bunch of images over time, and

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,180
figure out who I am on its own.

9
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,390
We would give it a bunch
of pictures of myself and

10
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,060
a bunch of pictures of other people and
let it figure out on its own.

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,360
Hey, he's the guy with the brown hair,
and the brown eyes and the glasses.

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,130
Now setting apart machine
learning also is the fact that,

13
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,020
it's only recently become feasible for
us to be able to address

14
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,890
these very large data sets
with computational methods.

15
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,760
Computers have finally come along and
become fast enough to be able to address

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,130
the kinds of data sets that
we have available to us now.

17
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,600
And also helping it is the fact that the
world is more reliant on computers than

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,240
ever before, so
much data is generated kind of

19
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,020
automatically while people are going
about their everyday lives.

20
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,050
So these things really unite to make
machine learning a much more useful tool

21
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,090
right now than it would
have ever been before.
