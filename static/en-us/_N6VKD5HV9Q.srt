1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And I would say the answers are comparing auto repair rates.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Those are simply proportions that can be compared to each other

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
as we've done for many things.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And determining if a course improve test scores.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We would argue that we can't compare crash rates of two airlines with 100 flights

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
because in general there aren't crashes.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Now in theory, you could say you can use a hypothesis test

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
if you recognize that it's not normally distributed and do the appropriate

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
binomial test and figure out that you can't determine anything

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
but it's generally not adding anything over intuition.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And comparing heights of the tallest building in two cities, that's a deterministic number.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's either their taller or it's not. There are no random errors. There's no need for a hypothesis test.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That again a more creative application could be that you'd want to use it to

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
the measurements of the buildings in each of the two cities to determine whether

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
one was taller but that's only going to be useful if the measurements have the error

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
on the same order of the difference in buildings which is unusual.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So in practice you would not use a hypothesis test there.
