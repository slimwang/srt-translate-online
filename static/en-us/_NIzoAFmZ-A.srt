Given a Bitonic sequence,
a network like this will sort it.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,080
But given an arbitrary input,
how do you generate a bitonic sequence?

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,080
Here's what I'd like you to do.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,560
Create a comparator network that takes
an arbitrary sequence like this one and

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,670
produce a bitonic
sequence like this one.

6
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,470
Do that by inserting one or

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,240
more nonoverlapping
comparators in each column.

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,120
You can use either plus or
minus comparators.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,240
Now to help you get started, let me
fill in the first and the last columns.

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,980
Here's another hint.

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,520
Here, I've traced the values
of the first comparator bank.

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,330
That should remind you of the difference
between a plus comparator and

13
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,030
a minus comparator in
case you've forgotten.

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,380
So insert your comparators
by typing pluses or

15
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,470
minuses into appropriate
subsets of these empty boxes.
