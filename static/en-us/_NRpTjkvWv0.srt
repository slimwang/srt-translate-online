1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And yes, the answer is 0.99.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's assume there's a test for this cancer,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
which gives us probabilistically an answer whether we have this cancer or not.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So, let's say the probability of a test being positive, as indicated by this + sign,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
given that we have cancer, is 0.9.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The probability of the test coming out negative if we have the cancer is--you name it.
