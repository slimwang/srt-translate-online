1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,510
It's important to consider these
values you set these parameters to,

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,470
as they can have a huge
impact on battery life.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,050
As we saw with the priorities and

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:14,080
coarseness, battery usage is impacted
by which sensors you activate.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,490
However and maybe with a bigger
impact is the interval that you use,

6
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,010
consider how often you really
want to read the sensors.

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:26,210
In this case, you can see we ping them
once a second, which isn't too bad.

8
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,810
But do you really need
that level of accuracy?

9
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,690
What would happen if you
were more accurate and

10
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:31,950
pinged them a hundred times a second?

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,730
What would your app experience
be like if you ping them

12
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,040
once every ten minutes instead?

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,930
These are the type of questions
that you need to consider for

14
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,140
your users, when designing an app
that uses location services.

15
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,210
So for example, an app for
a hockey coach might want very frequent

16
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,850
updates of players' locations
on the ice during a game.

17
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,310
So the coach can plot
that data after the game,

18
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,550
to see the players' effectiveness.

19
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,980
Conversely, an app that tells
you if your kids are home yet

20
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,210
might only need to check your location
details a few times per hour.
