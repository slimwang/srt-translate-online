00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,230
Now that you're pretty comfortable
with your shiny new Linux machine,

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,990
it's time to get your hands dirty,
and really start working with it.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,280
In the next lesson, you'll start
addressing some security concerns.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,680
You'll work with user management,
authentication, file permissions,

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,260
firewalls, and software updates.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,960
It's going to be a lot of material,
but it's super important, not only for

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,880
your users, but the Internet as a whole.

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,140
You're about to unleash your very
own server to the internet, and

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,140
anyone in the world, at any time
is going to be able to talk to it.
