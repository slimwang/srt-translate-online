00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's take a look at the types of intellectual property.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,050
What I'd like you to do is help me understand if we look at the column on the left,

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,090
trademark, copyright, trade secrets, contracts and NDA, and patent,

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:20,340
and match up what's in the protectable column and the example columns

5
00:00:20,340 --> 99:59:59,999
to the correct type of intellectual property.
