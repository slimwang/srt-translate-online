00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,270
Hello again, welcome to lesson three.

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:05,050
>> In this lesson, we're going to be
talking about two things that can really

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,240
improve your dev ops approach
to the systems that you work on.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,770
>> First we'll talk about continuous
integration and delivery, or CI and CD.

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:13,550
These are systems for

6
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,850
managing your software life cycle,
taking your applications code

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,360
all the way from the repository
through testing and into production.

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,870
And trying to automate all
of the steps in between.

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,960
The CI tool we'll be showing
you is called Jenkins.

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,250
>> And then we'll talk about monitoring,

11
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,440
which is just about my favorite
subject in systems engineering.

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,760
We'll be showing you monitoring and

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,450
data visualization using
a tool called Graphite.

14
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,300
>> Okay.
Let's do it.
