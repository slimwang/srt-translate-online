1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,390
Of course, the hard part now is
I do have two different regions.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,110
How do I actually figure
out what scale to look at?

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:10,500
This looks good for finding an edge
here, doesn't work for this one.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,550
I can keep growing it.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,460
Oh, at this point, it does.

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,570
Plus, of course, it's possible,
and a computationally and

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,060
interesting challenge if
I have to do this a lot.

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,690
The problem is how do we choose a
corresponding circles for both of them?

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,560
And of course that could be
computationally a challenging task.

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,800
We could do brute force search
methods and stuff like that.

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,080
But remember there's another
problem associated with it.

12
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,560
Not just the fact that I need to do
this, but the fact is that this,

13
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,570
the region could have other bits
of information that is not there.

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,190
So in essence me matching this to this,
I don't have the full picture there.

15
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,110
I just have the full
picture at this point.

16
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,384
So we need to kind of start thinking
about what kind of a match it

17
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,940
would be also.

18
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:58,800
Again, if I now start kind of zooming
out of this one let's see what happens.

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,950
Of course, all of a sudden it
was only a match at this scale,

20
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,570
not at the other scale when I zoom out.

21
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,959
So again, it's not guaranteed.

22
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,050
I can scale out on this one.

23
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:06,810
It matches.

24
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,490
But when I scale out,
no this doesn't match anymore.

25
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:10,560
So basically,

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,760
you have to choose the scale of
the best corner and stick with it.
