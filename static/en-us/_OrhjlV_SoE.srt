The question to you is, why do the edges jump from smooth to sharp? What's

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:07,375
causing the edges to be sharp again? Minification is occurring, linear

3
00:00:07,375 --> 00:00:11,401
interpolation is no longer being used, on average, each pixel covers more than

4
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:16,776
one texel, the magfilter no longer applies. More than one answer can be correct

5
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:18,549
so, check all that apply.
