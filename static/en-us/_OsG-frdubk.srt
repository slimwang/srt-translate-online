1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,858
For this first rectangle, we have x times x squared. So that's just x cubed.

2
00:00:04,858 --> 00:00:09,947
Remember, we add the exponents, 2 and positive 1. For this rectangle, we have x

3
00:00:09,947 --> 00:00:14,830
times 2x. So, the area's 2x squared. And this third rectangle over here is x

4
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:19,836
times 3, or 3x. Notice, we're really just distributing this positive x to each

5
00:00:19,836 --> 00:00:25,124
of the 3 terms in the second trinomial. This leaves us with 3 new terms. Next, I

6
00:00:25,124 --> 00:00:30,196
have 3 times x squared, which is 3x squared. For this next rectangle, I have

7
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:35,194
positive 3 times 2x, so I get 6x. For this last rectangle, we have positive 3

8
00:00:35,194 --> 00:00:40,180
times positive 3 which is 9. The sides of the rectangle give us an area of 9.
