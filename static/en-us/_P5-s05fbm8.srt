1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is this.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It is equal to the square root of the sum of the deviations in the y's

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
over the deviations of the x's.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Note that this is exactly the same as the standard deviation of y

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
divided by the standard deviation of x,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
because the number of observations divides out.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
To see that this is, in fact, true, when we divide b/r we can see the numerators cancel,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
so we have b/r equal to the square root of the squared differences in the y's

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
times the sums of the square differences in the x's

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
over the sums of the square differences in the x's.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The key thing to recognize is we can break this into two pieces.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The denominator can be written as the square of the square root.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Now we can just cancel this and we have our answer.
