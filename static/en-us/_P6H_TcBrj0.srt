00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello! Welcome to Unit 5 Office Hours.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm Jonathan, an assistant instructor for an upcoming course.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Peter is out of town this week, so I'll be handling the Unit 5 Office Hours this week.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
First question, how's that readability survey coming?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's a great question and relatively timely.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It turns out that readability survey, the research project

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
that we give everyone a chance to be involved in, is going really, really well.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Over 6,000 people have started taking the survey, and over 2,000 people completed it

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
all the way through, and the results are still coming in.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Again, this is officially unrelated to Udacity or your grade.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's totally optional, although it would make me so happy

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
if you would take the survey--still totally optional.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We have a number of students with no experience taking the survey, which is great.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We have a number of students with quite a bit of experience,

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and we even have interesting students who appear to posses the power of time travel

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
or have made slight typos when filling it at the end how much experience they have.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
There are people who have more years of experience in Python

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
than Python has actually been around--presumably Guido's father or something like that.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We are pleased as punch with the current results of the survey, and I think it speaks to

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
the charity and the kindness of students at Udacity and elsewhere

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
who are interested in helping out with this sort of thing.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
My graduate student, Jonathan Dorn, and I will definitely be

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
giving the song reward later on.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
However, since this is a family, show since anyone could be signing up

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
for Udacity classes, a number of the more interesting suggestions for things

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
that we will sing even though they're more humorous and outlandish

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
may have to be pushed aside because we, in essence, want it to be rated G at the end.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Still cast your votes for how you would like us to sing or otherwise reward you,

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and let me just once again thank everyone who took the time to participate.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I know it did take time, and I know this sort of survey or research

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
might seem hard to understand when you first get involved in it.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Why is he asking me these questions?

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Why is he not showing me the entire context of a function?

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Why doesn't he define what readability is?

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
All of those things that appear to be tricky about the survey or about the study

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
were set up that way in order to help us scientifically isolate or control for various variables.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's tricky, and I'm glad you took the time to do it, and I think it will help us out a lot.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We've had more than an order of magnitude more people participate in this survey

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
than previous similar surveys in software engineering.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It is a really exciting time and it seems that classes like the classes here at Udacity

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
have the opportunity not just to transform education but to have an impact on research

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
near and dear to my heart on both fronts.
