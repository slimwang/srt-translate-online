1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
What's the best way to do that?

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
How can I map from function f to a function f prime?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
One possibility would be to edit the bytecode of f.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Another possibility would be to edit the source string of f

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and concatenate some strings together.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Another possibility would be to use an assigment statement to say

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
f = some function g of f to give us a new version of f.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Which of these would be the best solution?
