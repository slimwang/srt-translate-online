1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,310
Now let's find that horizontal asymptote. Remember what we found as the answer

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:08,222
to our division problem in the last quiz? What that gives us is another way to

3
00:00:08,222 --> 00:00:12,820
write the rational function we have here. Think about what happens as x gets

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,429
really, really big to the value of the function. That should tell you the

5
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:21,159
horizontal asymptote. Remember that this should be the equation of some

6
00:00:21,159 --> 00:00:22,400
horizontal line.
