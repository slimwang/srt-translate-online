1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,930
So we explored a number of
mandatory access control models,

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,820
ranging from ones that address
confidentiality and integrity

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,640
to those that are designed to meet
the needs of commercial applications.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,305
We then revisited the idea of
a trusted computing base, or a TCB,

5
00:00:18,305 --> 00:00:24,440
and how we can evaluate the level of
assurance that is provided by the TCB.

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,790
We saw that it not only depends
on what the TCB does, or

7
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:33,630
its functionality, but
also how well it has been tested and

8
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,830
verified to ensure that it
is free of vulnerabilities.
