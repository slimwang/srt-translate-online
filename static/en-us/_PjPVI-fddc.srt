Some psychologists have suggested the Frustration Aggression Hypothesis. And

2
00:00:04,561 --> 00:00:07,663
this hypothesis states that we're likely to experience aggression when we're

3
00:00:07,663 --> 00:00:12,558
frustrated from not being able to meet our goals. Here's a simple example. A

4
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:16,714
dog sees a piece of meat fall on the ground. That's his goal. A cat comes along

5
00:00:16,714 --> 00:00:21,512
and is also tempted to get that piece of meat. That is the frustration, and

6
00:00:21,512 --> 00:00:25,820
then the dog attacks the cat. That would be the aggression. Although this

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,770
explains some of our behavior, psychologists have suggested that the

8
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,070
frustration we experience from not being able to meet our goals is what results

9
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,983
in aggression. And interestingly we see this aggression in other animals. For

10
00:00:37,983 --> 00:00:41,094
example, if rats are shocked in a laboratory, they will attack just about

11
00:00:41,094 --> 00:00:44,307
anything in their cage, including another animal, a stuffed doll, or even a

12
00:00:44,307 --> 00:00:49,679
tennis ball. But let's go to Grey to look at another type of aggression.
