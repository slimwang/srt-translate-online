1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,540
Let's learn about some non-binary
classification models.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,340
We've spent some time
learning how to prepare data,

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,050
and we also solved binary problems.

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,170
Now it's time to get to the good stuff.

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,750
In this section, we're going to
discuss three types of models.

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,220
Decision Trees, Forest Models,
and Boosted Models.

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,520
Then we'll talk about
comparing the models, and

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,510
how you'll know which
one fits the data best.

9
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,330
Before we go any further, let's discuss
what our actual business problem is.

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,790
Our company's insurance policy has
a reward based benefits offer.

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,430
This benefit varies depending
on what mode of transportation

12
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,670
an employee takes to work.

13
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:40,820
So our company ran a survey to
understand the mode of transportation

14
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,795
of our employees, and
sadly, only 60% responded.

15
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:47,170
What our management
would like to do then,

16
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:52,450
is to predict the mode of transportation
of the other 40% of our employees.

17
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,540
This would help us better estimate
what benefits we can offer.
