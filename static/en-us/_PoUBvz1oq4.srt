00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,820
When specifying
synchronization requirements,

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,560
it is sometimes useful to distinguish
among the different types of accesses

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,270
that a resource can be accessed with.

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,880
For instance,
we commonly want to distinguish

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,590
those accesses that don't
modify a shared resource,

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,750
like reading, versus those accesses
that do modify a shared resource.

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,930
Like writing.

8
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:27,660
For the first type of accesses,
the resource can be shared concurrently.

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,130
For the second type of accesses,
we require exclusive access.

10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,380
For this reason, operating systems and

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,290
language run times as well supports so
called Reader/Writer Locks.

12
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,220
You can define Reader/Writer Locks and

13
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,940
use them in a way that's
similar to a mutex.

14
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,670
How ever you always specify
the type of access,

15
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,870
read versus write that
you want to perform.

16
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,610
And then underneath the lock
behaves accordingly.
