1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,584
For this first one, we have l 1 equals 10 log base 10 of p over b. So this is

2
00:00:05,584 --> 00:00:10,932
exactly the equation we have up here. If power is 2 p instead, then we need to

3
00:00:10,932 --> 00:00:20,308
plug 2p in place of p. So that gives us l 2 equals 10 log base 10 of 2p over b
