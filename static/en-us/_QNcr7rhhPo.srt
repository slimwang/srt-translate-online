1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The second question asked, what is the maximum number of edges in B.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We wrote a constructed graph with a maximum of edges,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and take each node and connect it to everything that we can.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This first node, I can only connect to the three other nodes on the right side.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I can't connect to anything else on the left side or else it wouldn't be a bipartite graph.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The second node also has three edges connecting to other nodes in the right side,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and we do the same for the other remaining nodes on the left side,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and we'll look at the nodes on the right side and this first node can't connect to anything else.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The second node can't connect to anything else and the third node can't connect to anything else.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
For this graph, we can have 15 edges, and in general a bipartite graph

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
can have a maximum l * r edges--where l is the number of edges in the left group

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and r is the number of edges in the right group.
