00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,614
We need to replace x with x minus 2 if we want to shift this parabola to the

2
00:00:04,614 --> 00:00:09,548
right by 2. In the y direction we saw that moving in the negative direction in

3
00:00:09,548 --> 00:00:14,069
y, required adding to y. And moving in the positive direction required

4
00:00:14,069 --> 00:00:16,765
subtracting from y. The same is true of x.
