1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now let's be a little bit more precise about what the rules are and what it means

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
to play a word within a row and how that hooks up to the other columns.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Now, the rules say that at least one letter that you play has to be adjacent

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
to an existing letter on the board. We'll mark with red asterisks such squares.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We call these anchor squares. These are the squares that we can start from.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Then we build out in each direction, forming consecutive letters into a single word.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Now, the anchor squares do have to be adjacent to an existing letter,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
but they don't have to be adjacent all within a row.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
They can be adjacent in either direction.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Let's expand the board beyond a single row and let's populate this with some more letters.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Imagine that this board goes on in both directions.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
There's probably an E here or something like that.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
If we restrict our attention just to this row, notice that we've now introduced a new anchor point.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This square is adjacent to an existing letter, and so that also counts as an anchor.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Now we want to find a word, which consists of a prefix plus a suffix.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We get to define the game.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We can say that for every anchor point, the prefix is going to be zero or more letters

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
to the left of the anchor point, not counting the anchor point itself.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Then the suffix will be the anchor point and everything to the right.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Of course, we have to arrange so that prefix plus suffix together form a word

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
which is in the dictionary.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Now here's a cool play that comes from the dictionary.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
BACKBENCH is a word, and note that if we just have this rule

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
of word equals prefix plus suffix where the suffix has to start with an anchor,

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
then there'd be four possible ways of specifying this one move.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We could anchor it here with no suffix.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We could anchor it here with these three letters as a suffix.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We could anchor it here with these letters as a suffix.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Or we could anchor it here with all these as a suffix and just H as the prefix.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Now, it seems wasteful to degenerate the same result four times,

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
so we can arbitrarily and without loss of completeness make up a rule which says

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
there's no anchor within a prefix.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
We couldn't use this as a the anchor, because then there'd be anchors within the prefix.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Likewise, we couldnâ€™t use this one or this one.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We can only use this one as the prefix in order to generate this particular word.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The anchor will also come from the hand,

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and the suffix can be a mix of hand and board.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Here, this is the anchor.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The prefix is empty. The anchor letter comes from the hand.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Then there's a mix of letters for the rest of the word.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Now, what are the rules for a prefix. Let's summarize.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
A prefix is zero or more characters, can't cover up an anchor square,

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and they can only cover empty squares.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
For example, for this anchor square here, the prefix can go backward,

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
but it can't cover this anchor.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So the possible lengths for this prefix are zero to two characters.

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Any prefix can be zero characters, and here there's room for two,

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
but there's not room for three, because then it would cover up an anchor.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
In that case, all the letters in the prefix come from the hand, but consider this anchor.

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
For this anchor, we're required to take these two letters as part of the prefix,

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
because we can't go without them because this abuts.

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
These two must be part of the prefix,

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and this one can't be part of the prefix because it's an anchor.

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If we wanted that we generate it from this anchor, rather than from this one.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That means the length of a prefix for this anchor has to be exactly two.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Similarly, the length of the prefix for this anchor has to be exactly one,

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
has to include this character, because if we place a letter here, this is adjacent--

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
it's got to be part of the word--and this is an anchor so we can't cover it.

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So we see that a prefix either the letters come all from the hand o

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
or they come all from the board.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What I want you to do is for the remaining anchors here, tell me what the possible lengths are.

62
00:04:02,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Either put a single number like this or a range of numbers--number-number.
