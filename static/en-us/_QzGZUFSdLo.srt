1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,500
Using this projection from the rule point to that image plane,

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,380
we get projection equations.

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,400
And we can compute the intersection, that is where x prime y prime is

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,610
by looking at similar triangles, kind of just like we did for the thin lens.

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:19,830
So basically this triangle and the projection triangle here,

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,730
these are similar triangles.

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,520
And by the similar triangles, basically get that the x, y,

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,640
z location, the location of the point, is now mapped to this point here which,

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:36,550
by similar triangles, is minus dX over z, minus dY over z, and minus d.

10
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,850
And here you can see that negative d issue, alright.

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,510
So basically what it says is the x is divided by z and multiplied by d,

12
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,430
by whatever that, essentially, focal length scale factor's going to be.

13
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,790
So, using that similar triangle and

14
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,780
knowing what the location on that point on the image plane is,

15
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,740
well the question is, what is the location in the image of that point?

16
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,290
Well, to get the location of the image,

17
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:02,290
we just throw out the last coordinate and basically it says.

18
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:06,171
Not basically, exactly, it says that x prime, y prime, which is the x,

19
00:01:06,171 --> 00:01:11,860
y location in the image, is just minus d, X over Z minus d, Y over Z.

20
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,840
Normally in class I'd say, so any questions, but Megan understands everything

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,480
totally, and you guys are all brilliant, so I'm not going to worry about it.

22
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:24,508
By the way, one of the obvious implications of this dividing by Z is what?

23
00:01:24,508 --> 00:01:28,690
Well, it's that objects further away are smaller in the image which is

24
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:29,990
something we all know anyway, right?

25
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:34,340
Take an object, pull it further away, and its size and the image gets smaller.

26
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,130
And that's because you're doing perspective projection and

27
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,560
the points are mapped to the values that are proportional,

28
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,410
X over Z and Y over Z, as Z gets bigger, X and

29
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:46,740
Y get smaller with respect to 0, which we're putting at the center of the image.

30
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,935
Do you hear that?

31
00:01:47,935 --> 00:01:50,100
0 is at the center of the image under this.

32
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,190
So not at the top left hand corner.

33
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,790
So you may have to worry about that later too.
