00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:05,196
See, as Susan is right, but to me language learning is as much about the brain,

2
00:00:05,196 --> 00:00:11,220
as it is about imitation and reward reinforcement. So for instance, humans

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,559
after all learned thousands and thousands of rules of grammar without ever

4
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,820
knowing they even have learned them. So reward and reinforcement can't be the

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,727
only explanation. Now of course, we also need input from culture and the

6
00:00:23,727 --> 00:00:28,896
environment to learn languages. After all, we learn specific languages. So in

7
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:33,854
that way, Susan and I agree. Learning language is more nature and nurture than

8
00:00:33,854 --> 00:00:36,010
it is nature or nurture.
