00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,437
Originally, I create the list by using add. And now I want to insert an element

2
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:08,647
without wiping away anything. I can't just use the add method because that

3
00:00:08,647 --> 00:00:13,334
would add it on to the end of a list and I want to put it in the middle. So

4
00:00:13,334 --> 00:00:17,344
I'll specify the index where I want to add it. So the index I would want is

5
00:00:17,344 --> 00:00:21,595
two. Now I always forget whether the index or the element comes first, but

6
00:00:21,595 --> 00:00:26,719
that's okay, I can always check. All I have to do is search for ArrayList, Java

7
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:30,424
7, go to the official documentation, and I know what method I'm looking for, so

8
00:00:30,424 --> 00:00:36,758
I'll search, for add, and here I can see the index comes before the element. So

9
00:00:36,758 --> 00:00:44,592
the index I wanted was two. And I'm adding another book. And now when I run the

10
00:00:44,592 --> 00:00:48,684
demo it'll print The Eyre Affair, Night Watch, followed by zebras and then

11
00:00:48,684 --> 00:00:51,579
next, just like I asked.
