1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,910
Welcome to the second of
many quizzes in this course.

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:05,640
If you've taken a Udacity
course in the past,

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,740
then you already know the drill by now.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,980
If you haven't,
you're in for a real treat.

5
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,160
These quizzes are Udacity's secret
sauce, and they're totally different

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,270
from what you'd find in
a traditional classroom experience.

7
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,640
There, the point of a quiz is to
figure out if you're remembering what

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,330
the instructor is saying.

9
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:21,970
Here however,

10
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,430
the quizzes are an integral part
of the learning experience itself.

11
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,610
And we give the solution to every quiz,
either as a video where we explain

12
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,790
the answer, or as solution
code in the course repository.

13
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:36,040
Some of these quizzes are super easy,
some are very hard.

14
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,590
And you're not always expected to get
the answer right on the first try.

15
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:40,790
That means you shouldn't
feel bad at all,

16
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,850
if you need to go check out external
resources, watch the solution video or

17
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:45,640
look at the solution code.

18
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,520
So let's do an easy quiz,
just so you get the hang of it.

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,230
Why do you want to make games?

20
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,580
Is it because it's too much fun not to?

21
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,800
Is it to make a little income
as an indie developer?

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,950
Is it because you want to prepare for
a job in the gaming industry?

23
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:05,170
Is it to make the world a better
place through educational games?

24
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,770
Or do you just fight for the user?
