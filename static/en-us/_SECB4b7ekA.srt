1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now let's see how we did.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So I'm going to define a set of strategies--

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
the clueless strategy we expect to do the worst;

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
strategies that try to

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
solve the problem in 4 chunks, in 3 chunks in 2 chunks,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and to solve it all in one win;

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and then the max win strategy.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Now, we play a tournament with these strategies,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and here's the results we get back.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So you can see that the clueless strategy does very poorly--

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
only wins 23 games out of 500.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The max win strategy does the best of all--

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
wins 325, but there's some competitors that are pretty close.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So hold at 20 wins 314--

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
not that much worse off than the optimal strategy.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And that holds up if we play a tournament with more games

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
just to get a little bit more accuracy.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You wouldn't be able to hit the run button and do this

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
because it would time out,

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
but if you bring it in to your own development environment, you can do that.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And here we see max wins gets

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
13,100 wins, and hold at 20 is 12,900.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So only a couple percent better for max wins

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
over hold at 20, but still it's nice to know

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
that no strategy can do better.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And it turns out that if we increase the goal

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and made a longer game than just playing to 40 points--

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
that the advantage for max wins over any of these other strategies

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
would only increase.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
In the betting game, we had different utility functions.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We tried out the linear utility,

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and we tried out the logarithmic utility.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What about here?

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Well, we defined our utility as a probability of winning,

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and the way the game is defined, that's really the only sensible one.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
If you're trying to win the game,

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
you should maximize the probability of winning.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But maybe your only goal isn't just to maximize

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
the probability of winning.

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Maybe you're in a big Pig tournament,

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and your seated at the Pig table, rolling the dice,

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and in the stands are lots of spectators,

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
watching the game with excitement.

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And you know that somewhere in the stands,

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
there's a scout from the NPA--the National Pig Association.

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And what you want to do is not just win the game--

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
because lots of people are going to win the games--

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
but you really want to get the attention of that NPA scout

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
so that you can move on and have a professional career.

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So maybe what your utility function would be

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
would not just be to win the game,

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
maybe your utility would be

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
to maximize the differential, to say, "If I just won the game by a couple points,

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
nobody is going to notice, but if I won by a lot--

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
if I really clobbered my opponent--

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
then maybe this guy would take notice, and that would be worth more to me."

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So you'd give up on the goal of just winning,

58
00:02:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and try to go for the maximizing your differential.
