00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,490
Let's start a recognition today. We're discussing some of the biggest

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:07,140
problems in AI. We obviously are not going to solve all of them today, but

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:12,460
it's good to start with a big picture. AI has several conundrums,

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:17,070
I'm going to describe five of the main ones today. Conundrum number one.

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,020
All intelligent agents have little computational resources, processing speed,

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,370
memory size, and so on. But most interesting AI problems are computationally

7
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:30,150
intractable. How then can we get AI agents to give us near real time

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,650
performance on many interesting problems? Conundrum number two.

9
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:40,770
All computation is local, but most AI problems have global constraints. How then

10
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,650
can we get AI agents to address global problems using only local computation?

11
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:50,190
Conundrum number three. Computation logic is fundamentally deductive, but

12
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,880
many AI problems are abductive or inductive in their nature.

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,620
How can we get AI agents to address abductive or inductive problems? If you do

14
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,290
not understand some of these terms, like abduction, don't worry about it,

15
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:06,730
we'll discuss it later in the later in the class. Conundrum number four.

16
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:12,090
The world is dynamic, knowledge is limited, but an AI agent must always begin

17
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,320
with what it already knows. How then can an AI agent ever address a new problem?

18
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,490
Conundrum number five. Problem solving, reasoning, and learning

19
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:26,540
are complex enough, but explanation and justification add to the complexity.

20
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:30,780
How then can we get an AI agent to ever explain or justify it's decisions?
