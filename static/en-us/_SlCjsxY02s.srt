00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,899
So, how did this happen? Pavlov always predicted meat powder in the dog's

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:09,115
mouth. The sight of Pavlov meant meat powder was coming. Pavlov wanted to test

3
00:00:09,115 --> 00:00:13,340
this experimentally, so what he did was he provided a neutral stimulus, a tone

00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:13,795
[SOUND]

5
00:00:13,795 --> 00:00:18,848
, followed by meat powder, and he did this repeatedly. Tone

00:00:18,848 --> 00:00:19,317
[SOUND]

7
00:00:19,317 --> 00:00:25,130
, meat powder, tone sss , meat powder. Then he wanted to see whether or not the

8
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:29,700
tone was able to produce salivation. Here he presents the tone alone.

00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,421
[SOUND]

10
00:00:30,421 --> 00:00:35,570
And the dog did salivate. The essence of classical conditioning is the pairing

11
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,622
process, where a formally neutral stimulus,

12
00:00:37,622 --> 00:00:38,000
[SOUND]

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,980
becomes a conditioned stimulus. Predictive ability is the key.
