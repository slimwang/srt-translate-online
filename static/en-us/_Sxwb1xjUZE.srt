00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,891
So one way to look at the term 11 times 2n is to
think that we're adding 2n to itself 11

2
00:00:06,891 --> 00:00:15,394
times. Okay great, we have 11 2ns added
together. However we know that 2n is just

3
00:00:15,406 --> 00:00:22,108
equal to n+n.
So we can write this yet another way.

4
00:00:22,108 --> 00:00:31,637
For each 2n we can instead write n+n, so we
end up with n+n plus. So, for every 2n

5
00:00:31,637 --> 00:00:37,584
that we had in this equation, I wrote n+n
instead. Now I actually already counted

6
00:00:37,584 --> 00:00:42,027
all these n's up and it turns out that
there are 22 of them. So we know that

7
00:00:42,027 --> 00:00:50,464
22n's added together is just equal to 22n.
So apparently 11 times 2n is equal to 22n.

8
00:00:50,464 --> 00:00:54,427
That means that we can come up to our equation
for the amount of money that Grant is

9
00:00:54,427 --> 00:01:00,882
going to earn and replace 11 times 2n right here
with 22n.
