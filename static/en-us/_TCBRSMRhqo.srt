1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:05,920
Following the hint, one way to do it
is to combine scatter and all-gather.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,050
So visually, that would look like this.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:12,690
First, scatter the input,
then do an all-gather.

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,970
The key assumption is that
all-gather uses bucketing.

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,240
Now there are many possible
ways to write the pseudo code,

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,780
which our auto grader probably
doesn't even really fully check.

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,220
But hopefully you came up with
something that looks like this.

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,830
Remember that these reshapes
are not actually physical copies,

9
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,259
they're just different
perspectives on their inputs.

10
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:38,030
This code uses a temporary array to
hold the result of the scatter, and

11
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,470
then sends that temporary array.
