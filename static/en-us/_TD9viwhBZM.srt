00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,530
So if we dig around the page with the developer

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,640
tools, we'd see a lot of pixel widths. Including the

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,290
main content of the page, which is inside this page

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,020
element. And you'll notice it has a width set in

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,290
pixels. If I turn it off, well, the page is

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:19,250
still not working properly. But at least we've started. Instead

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,270
of this fixed code let's use a different technique, Fluid

8
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,760
Layout. Fluid Layout means I should stop fixing all those

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,010
widths in absolute terms like pixels or points

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,330
and start thinking in terms of areas of screen

11
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,840
real estate. Percentages of the widths, for example, and

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,240
sizes based on the initial font or Em units.
