1
00:00:00,142 --> 00:00:03,250
And SelectkBest is probably going to be the right answer here,

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,600
because you know exactly how many you're expecting to get out.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,039
You're expecting to get exactly two, so

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,940
it will throw away all the features except the two that are the most powerful.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,448
Select Percentile isn't a great choice for this scenario,

6
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:17,570
because you don't already know exactly how many features you have.

7
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,160
Although in the case that we gave in the warm up example,

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,290
where you have exactly four features and you know you want two, you could

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:27,760
also just run Select Percentile with 50%, and that will give you two features.
