1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,123
Our database will contain 
weather forecast entries.

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,560
Our data model will use two tables:

3
00:00:05,641 --> 00:00:09,464
One table will be used 
to contain information about the location,

4
00:00:09,464 --> 00:00:13,467
while the other will contain 
the forecast data key to the locations.

5
00:00:13,467 --> 00:00:17,473
These will ultimately be tied back
to our view through the contract,

6
00:00:17,473 --> 00:00:18,861
and the content provider.

7
00:00:18,907 --> 00:00:23,417
We can use an inner join, to pull
the complete data for each forecast today,

8
00:00:23,417 --> 00:00:26,170
including all information about the location.

9
00:00:26,784 --> 00:00:29,164
This, is a big contract.

10
00:00:29,543 --> 00:00:33,580
Note that we store the location ID, 
which will be a foreign key

11
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,920
from the location table 
in COLUMN<u>LOC</u>KEY.

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,471
Note that the units aren't stored 
in the database.

13
00:00:40,471 --> 00:00:43,326
We expect all weather entries 
to be stored in metric units,

14
00:00:43,326 --> 00:00:47,103
and converted when needed 
by the UI, into imperial units.

15
00:00:47,103 --> 00:00:50,555
Since the column names 
don't actually contain data types,

16
00:00:50,555 --> 00:00:53,347
it's useful to annotate that 
in the variable names

17
00:00:53,347 --> 00:00:57,238
and/or the comments 
to make our contract more explicit.
