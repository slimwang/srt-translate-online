1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,940
We know a fractional exponent represents power divided by root, so this first

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,536
one will be the cube root of r squared, we have r squared here since the power

3
00:00:07,536 --> 00:00:13,635
is 2 and we take the third root since our denominator is 3. For our second

4
00:00:13,635 --> 00:00:17,417
example, we take the 3rd root of 4x, we don't need to write this exponent of 1

5
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:21,199
in here since anything raised to the 1st power is the same expression, 4x to

6
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:28,310
the 1 really equals 4x. For this third one we also have power divided by root.

7
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:32,872
So we take the third root of this expression raised to the 4th power. You might

8
00:00:32,872 --> 00:00:36,518
have distributed this 4th power to each of the factors inside of a radical. And

9
00:00:36,518 --> 00:00:41,298
you would wind up with this radical. Either one is correct. It turns out that

10
00:00:41,298 --> 00:00:45,109
we can simplify this radical but weren't getting into that yet. We're do that

11
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:48,680
in the next lesson. The other way you could have written the answer is like

12
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,730
this, you could have take the cube root of 5ab squared c and then raise that

13
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:56,836
quantity to the 4th power. We can take the root first and then raise the result

14
00:00:56,836 --> 00:01:00,490
to the 4th power or we can raise this expression to the 4th power and then take

15
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:05,972
the 3rd root. This is true because the exponent of 4 and the exponent of one

16
00:01:05,972 --> 00:01:10,908
third have the same priority in the order of operations. A root really

17
00:01:10,908 --> 00:01:15,673
represents a type of exponent so we could do either exponent first.
