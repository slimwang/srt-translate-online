00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,168
An easier model for rendering is the Pinhole Camera. With a Pinhole camera, you

2
00:00:05,168 --> 00:00:09,170
put a piece of photographic film at one end of a box and poke a hole in the

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,216
other end, then you cover up this hole. You do this in the dark so that the film

4
00:00:13,216 --> 00:00:16,894
was not exposed to light. Of course, just about no ones uses film anymore, but

5
00:00:16,894 --> 00:00:20,720
I'll assume you have some idea how camera film works. To take a photo, you point

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,672
the camera, open the hole for a short amount of time. Then go back to the dark

7
00:00:24,672 --> 00:00:28,336
room and develop the film. With the Pinhole camera, the light coming in from one

8
00:00:28,336 --> 00:00:32,140
direction is detected by a single location on the flat rectangle of the film.

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,358
Put these differing light contributions together, and you get a picture. Most

10
00:00:36,358 --> 00:00:40,072
cameras work the same way. They may have more complex lense systems, but they

11
00:00:40,072 --> 00:00:44,049
gather light in a similar manner with the image projected behind the lense. We

12
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:47,769
often simplify and think of our eyes as elaborate cameras that send images

13
00:00:47,769 --> 00:00:52,355
directly to our brains. It's better to think about the eye as part of our visual

14
00:00:52,355 --> 00:00:55,889
system, since ultimately it's the brains interpretation of the data that

15
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:56,423
matters.
