>> This might be a bit surprising but sometimes in math we can just ignore

2
00:00:04,014 --> 00:00:08,357
certain things. If we ignore the negative sign, what we're really doing is

3
00:00:08,357 --> 00:00:12,651
taking the absolute value of these. So we're just looking at the positive

4
00:00:12,651 --> 00:00:17,752
distance of each value from the mean. If we multiply each deviation by 2, we'll

5
00:00:17,752 --> 00:00:23,272
still have negative deviations, or negative double deviations now, and positive

6
00:00:23,272 --> 00:00:28,351
double deviations, and the negatives and positives will still cancel out.

7
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:33,138
However, we can square each deviation. A negative times a negative is a

8
00:00:33,138 --> 00:00:38,994
positive. If we multiply this number by itself, we'll get a positive number. And

9
00:00:38,994 --> 00:00:43,953
a positive times a positive is also a positive. So we'll end up with some

10
00:00:43,953 --> 00:00:49,592
positive square deviations. There's always something we can do, never give up.
