1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,210
For your final two levels of
competition, generic competition and

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:07,010
budget competition, think larger scale.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,510
Now, generic competition
includes products and

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,780
services that fulfill
the same customer needs.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,390
So, a generic competition for
our flavored water here,

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,970
would be any other drink that our
potential customer can choose.

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,890
So, regular water, sparkling water,

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:29,490
juice, tea, sports drink,
sodas, you get the picture.

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,500
Budget competition includes all
products and services that compete for

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,010
the same amount of money.

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,760
Okay, so wow, let's think about that.

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,740
This is a $2.50 water in the Bay Area,

13
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:44,370
so, everything else that's
$2.50 is our budget competitor.

14
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,880
So, this adorable stuffed monkey,
a sponge, pack of trading cards,

15
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:55,670
some breakfast cereal, some pencils,
some post-its, a hamburger and fries.

16
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,990
You get the picture.

17
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,240
Now, for more expensive items
in the budget category,

18
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,319
like lets say an engagement ring,
you might be competing for a car, or

19
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,242
a down payment to a house or
part of it or vacation.

20
00:01:07,242 --> 00:01:08,056
You get the picture.

21
00:01:08,056 --> 00:01:09,630
Just think larger scale.
