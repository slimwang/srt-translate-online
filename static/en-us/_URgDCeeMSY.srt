1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,240
All right Michael, you know the answer?

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:01,726
>> Yep.

3
00:00:01,726 --> 00:00:02,915
>> Okay, what's the answer?

4
00:00:02,915 --> 00:00:04,450
>> Do you want to know the value of the whole game?

5
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,430
>> No. I want to know the matrix.

6
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,372
>> [LAUGH] Okay. So right. So, if A goes

7
00:00:09,372 --> 00:00:11,840
left, it doesn't matter what B does. And at that

8
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,396
point there's a chance node, and it's 50/50 for negative

9
00:00:15,396 --> 00:00:18,394
20, which I feel like ought to be, negative eight.

10
00:00:18,394 --> 00:00:21,920
>> That's right. How'd you get negative eight? because half

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,470
of 2 is sorry, half of 4 is 2 and half

12
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,443
of -20 is -10. So -8.

13
00:00:28,443 --> 00:00:31,470
>> Right, so you just took the expectation of where you would end up.

14
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,520
>> Exactly.

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,860
>> Okay. What next? And that, it doesn't matter what b does. So

16
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,890
then negative eight is also in the upper right corner of the matrix.

17
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,416
>> Fair enough.

18
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:44,970
>> The next easy on to do is if both go right. A goes

19
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,460
right and b goes right then we get the three. It's just sitting there.

20
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:47,800
>> Mm-hm.

21
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,570
>> And the last thing requires me to do

22
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,250
some multiplication. So

23
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:52,290
>> Rrr.

24
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:57,630
>> -5 times 0.8 Is like -4.

25
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,982
>> Mm-hm.

26
00:00:58,982 --> 00:01:02,970
>> 10 times 0.2 is like 2 so -2.

27
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,410
>> That is correct Michael.

28
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:04,910
>> Shoo.

29
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:08,010
>> So now we have the matrix. Now, what did

30
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,940
we just notice here? Remember what I said about matrices before?

31
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,370
>> It has all the information that you need.

32
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,530
>> Right, so in fact none of this matters.

33
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,290
Who cares how we got here?

34
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:18,150
>> wait, but, but, oh.

35
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,160
>> [LAUGH] I love erasing stuff!

36
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,890
>> So here's the thing, we cannot reconstruct that tree from this matrix.

37
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,710
>> We can't reconstruct, well, actually we

38
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:27,900
could reconstruct that tree from the matrix.

39
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,440
>> No, we can't.

40
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,720
>> Yeah, we, of course we could.

41
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,170
>> No, we can't.

42
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,465
>> Yes, we can, because there's an infinite number of

43
00:01:33,465 --> 00:01:35,504
trees we could do, and one of them is that one.

44
00:01:35,504 --> 00:01:35,890
>> I see.

45
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,710
>> We just don't happen to know that its the right one.

46
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,710
>> I don't think that's really what people mean when

47
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,240
they say I could reconstruct this. Like I could reconstruct

48
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,150
the crime at this crime scene, it could be any of

49
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:49,910
a million things. Like no, we can't construct that specific tree.

50
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,260
>> But you know what it doesn't matter,

51
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,860
because the only thing that matters is the matrix.

52
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,370
>> Ahh.

53
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,990
>> And you will notice, Michael, that you did all that multiplication

54
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,710
and you multiplied 0.8 times 5 and after a couple of seconds of

55
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,760
thinking about which was probably edited out but I know how long

56
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,360
it took you do. You came up with the right answer. That's great.

57
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,410
But notice that the number you came up with doesn't say anything about

58
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,700
expected values and what the probablities are. It doesn't even matter that it's

59
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,680
nondeterministic, because once you have these

60
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,060
numbers, these expected values, that's what you're

61
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,700
going to end up with. So who cares what the original tree was? Who cares

62
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,880
if you can reconstruct it? Who cares what the rules of the games

63
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,270
are? All you know is I have a choice of two strategies. We

64
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,670
call them left and right here, but we could have called them one

65
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,420
and two, or Q and Z. It doesn't matter. For the purpose of solving

66
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,560
the game. So what is the solution for the game by the way?

67
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,890
>> Oh, A is trying to maximize right?

68
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:37,800
>> Yes.

69
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,700
>> So A would never, ever, ever, ever want to go left.

70
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,130
>> Mm-hm.

71
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:46,220
>> So A's going to go right and then B is trying to

72
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,100
minimize. So B is going to go left and we get the -2.

73
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,070
>> I believe that is correct. And it

74
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,120
makes sense the other way as well, right? That

75
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,160
B would not ever choose to go right because

76
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,100
then A would choose to go right as well.

77
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,980
>> Gotcha.

78
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,400
>> So you'll still end up here.
