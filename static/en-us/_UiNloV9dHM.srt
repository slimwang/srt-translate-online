00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,641
As I said in the past several videos and
quizzes, there are a ton of mathematically

2
00:00:04,653 --> 00:00:09,443
equivalent ways of writing any expression
we might have. For example, if I rearrange

3
00:00:09,455 --> 00:00:13,749
the factors within any of the terms here,
or rearrange the order of the terms

4
00:00:13,761 --> 00:00:18,210
themselves, or let's say, tack on a 0 at
the end. The value of the expression on

5
00:00:18,222 --> 00:00:22,156
the right side of the equation doesn't
change. However, there are certain

6
00:00:22,168 --> 00:00:26,541
convienient ways of writing expressions.
Ways that actually make them simplier to

7
00:00:26,553 --> 00:00:30,537
deal with that we're going to want to use.
We call this process of rewriting

8
00:00:30,549 --> 00:00:34,980
expressions; simplifing expressions. One
really useful tool that can help us start

9
00:00:34,992 --> 00:00:39,316
to simplify and expression, or see if we
can simplify it any further, is to change

10
00:00:39,328 --> 00:00:43,537
the order of the terms. We know that we're
allowed to do this because of the

11
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:47,780
communitive property of addition. So, how
could we do that here? Let's just

12
00:00:47,792 --> 00:00:51,790
rearrange the terms on the right side of
this equation so that both terms

13
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:56,180
containing w are in the first two slots
and the two terms containing n are in the

14
00:00:56,192 --> 00:01:00,985
last two slots. So please just type the
proper terms into the proper slots. These

15
00:01:00,997 --> 00:01:06,765
smaller spaces are for plus or minus signs
but you can also type in as you see fit.
