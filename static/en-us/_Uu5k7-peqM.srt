00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,350
Okay. We want to make this junction object called set time.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:04,415
>> Right.

3
00:00:04,415 --> 00:00:08,800
>> Because we want this menu to menu relationship between stages and bands.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:08,830
>> Mm-hm.

5
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,380
>> And cool. Okay, I'm going to go into Schema Builder. because I want to see

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,290
what we're working with now. And obviously right now we don't even have this set

7
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:22,360
time object, and band is related to stage. So, is it just as straightforward

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,990
as this looks? I have to delete

9
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,370
the existing relationship between band and stage and

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,590
then, you know, sort of create this new stuff?

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,410
>> Yup, just create that new object with

12
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,530
those relationships, and it's as simple as that.

13
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,610
>> All right, let me give it a shot.
