00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,540
So I've just gone ahead and put down Google Street View, Wikipedia, and

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,360
NY Times because those are the APIs I wanted to use with this project.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,620
But this is really awesome.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,790
This is the kind of brainstorm that leads to new businesses and

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,760
pushes the web forward as a whole.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,930
Seriously.

7
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,840
Doing something new or combining old pieces of information in

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,990
new ways is how the internet and technology gets pushed further along.

9
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,650
So good job for doing this brainstorm.
