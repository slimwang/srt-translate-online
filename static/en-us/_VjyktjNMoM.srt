1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The first logic we will consider is called propositional logic.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Let's jump right into an example, recasting the alarm problem in propositional logic.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We have propositional symbols B, E, A, M, and J

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
corresponding to the events of a burglary occurring, of\ the earthquake occurring,

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
of the alarm going off, of Mary calling, and of John calling.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And just as in the probabalistic models,

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
these can be either true or false,

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
but unlike improbability, our degree of belief in propositional logic

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
is not a number.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Rather, our belief is that each of these is either true or false or unknown.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Now, we can make logical sentences using these symbols

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and also using the logical constants true and false

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
by combining them together using logical operators.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
For example, we can say that the alarm is true

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
whenever the earthquake or burglary is true with this sentence.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:28,000
(E V B) E or B implies A.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So that says whenever the earthquake or the burglary is true,

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
then the alarm will be true.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We use this V symbol to mean or

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and a right arrow to mean implies.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We could also say that it would be true that both John and Mary call

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
when the alarm is true.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We write that as A implies (J ^ M)

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and we use this symbol ^ to indicate an and,

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
so that this upward-facing wedge looks kind of like an A

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
with the crossbar missing, and so you can remember A is for "and"

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
where with this downward-facing V symbol is the opposite of and,

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
so that's the symbol for or.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Now, there's 2 more connectors we haven't seen yet.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
There's a double arrow for equivalent, also known as a biconditional,

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and a not sign for negation,

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
so we could say if we wanted to that John calls if and only if Mary calls.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We would write that as J <=> M.

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
John is equivalent to Mary--when one is true, the other is true;

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
when one is false, the other is false.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Or we could say that when John calls, Mary doesn't, and vice versa.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We could write that as John is equivalent J<=> to not Mary,

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and this is the not sign.

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Now, how do we know what the sentences mean?

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
A propositional logic sentence is either true or false

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
with respect to a model of the world.

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Now, a model is just a set of true/false values for all the propositional symbols,

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:34,000
so a model might be the set B is true, E is false, and so on.

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We can define the truth of the sentence in terms of the truth of the symbols

45
00:03:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
with respect to the models using truth tables.
