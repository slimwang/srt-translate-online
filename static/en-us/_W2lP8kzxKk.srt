00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,092
As you start using IPC methods, it is
useful to know that Linux provides some

2
00:00:05,092 --> 00:00:09,880
command line utilities for
using IPC and shared memory in general.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,880
Ipcs will list all of the IPC
facilities that exist in the system.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,210
This will include all types of IPC,
message queues, semaphores.

5
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:24,640
Passing the -m flag will display
only the shared memory IPC.

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,880
There is also a utility to
remove an IPC construct.

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,285
For shared memory you use the m flag.

8
00:00:31,285 --> 00:00:34,188
And you specify the shared
memory identifier.

9
00:00:34,188 --> 00:00:38,290
Look at the man pages for both of these
commands for a full set of options.
