1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,890
In the last lesson, we saw the uniform kernel or the Parzen window kernel.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,140
Another kernel that is used often is called the Gaussian kernel.

3
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,790
The Gaussian kernel can be written in this form,

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:20,500
where uT is the transpose of the vector of values of u.

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,360
D being the dimension of the space.

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:31,640
The kernel density estimate is then given by this expression here.

7
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,130
It is very similar to our previous expression,

8
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,450
except now we have used the Gaussian kernel, instead of the Parzen, Render,

9
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:44,050
or the Uniform kernel, to make the density estimate.

10
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:49,520
Remember, the kernel density, is an estimate of the shape of the distribution,

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,900
using now here, the sum of Gaussians surrounding each data point.

12
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,990
We are now going to investigate what happens if we change this parameter h.

13
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:07,020
The h in this case is called the bandwidth for the kernel density estimate.

14
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,580
Let's now switch to the IPython notebook,

15
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,530
to see what happens when we change the bandwidth.
