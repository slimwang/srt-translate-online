1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,950
Now I know by now you most quite of thinking this is all obvious and simple.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:05,520
And that's exactly the point.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,730
That convolution on an averaged output with a box filter because

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,059
it's a flat average filter, would still result in just an average output.

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:22,340
And, again, for the case of the impulse with cross-correlated with

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,800
the Gaussian filter will also just result in a blurred output.
