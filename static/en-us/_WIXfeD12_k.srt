At Udacity we think responsive design

I've linked them all in
the instructor's notes.

00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,440
I'll give you a moment to
bookmark all the things.

00:00:14,175 --> 00:00:17,345
For further background on some of
the things we'll be working through with

00:00:17,345 --> 00:00:21,505
images, definitely check out
the Responsive Web Images course.

Next, we'll chat a little bit
about how you can optimize images.
