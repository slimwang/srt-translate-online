Given two normalized vectors, the cosine of the angle between them is computed

2
00:00:04,278 --> 00:00:08,362
by the dot product operation. So this is the dot, it's a big dot, and these are

3
00:00:08,362 --> 00:00:13,215
denoted as vectors by putting arrows over them. The dot product is equivalent to

4
00:00:13,215 --> 00:00:17,640
multiplying the x value of A times the x value of B and so on with y and z and

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,932
then adding these up together. Say I have these two normalized vectors, and I

6
00:00:22,932 --> 00:00:27,810
want to find the cosine of the angle between them. The dot product is then 0

7
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:33,328
times 0.8 and so on, next to values multiplied and so on. This comes out to be

8
00:00:33,328 --> 00:00:38,020
these three terms added together, which equals 0.6. So this is the cosine of the

9
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:43,768
angle between these two vectors. Out of curiousity, if we take the Arc cosine of

10
00:00:43,768 --> 00:00:48,740
this value, 0.6, we get 53.13 degrees. However, we don't really care about the

11
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,330
angle, we truly want the cosine. As this is how much we'll scale the light's

12
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,920
contrubution to the surface. The dot product is a little mysterious, and is so

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,560
fundamental to a large part of computer graphics, that it's worth buliding up

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:05,170
some understanding of what it really means. Why does this operation have any

15
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,312
connection with cosine?
