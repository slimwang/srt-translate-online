00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,560
For the Chinese Puzzle Pot is, is fun. You can

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,980
pour water in the bottom. And turn it upside down, and

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,960
no water falls out. How do you think it works? So

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,850
draw a picture of the inside of the pot showing how

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:15,320
it works. Now remember, you have to solve two problems.

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,330
First, if you pour the water in the bottom, it doesn't

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,920
come out of a spout. When you turn it around, the

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,360
water does not come out of the hole in the bottom.

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,760
But you can then poor it out of the spout. So, your

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,120
diagram, your answer to how it works. Has to solve both those puzzles.
