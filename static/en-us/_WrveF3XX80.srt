00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,969
I won't write all of them out, but I'll just get them started. For this first

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:09,110
group, we have observed minus expected squared divided by expected. We don't

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:13,670
have to go in any particular order since addition is commutative, but it does

4
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:17,040
help to go in some kind of sequence so that you remember which one you have

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,033
used in the equation and which one you haven't. If we do this one next, we get

6
00:00:21,033 --> 00:00:30,591
16 minus 9.67 squared divided by 9.67. And we'll go all the way to 44 minus

7
00:00:30,591 --> 00:00:39,339
40.33 squared divided by 40.33. This comes out to about 7.78.
