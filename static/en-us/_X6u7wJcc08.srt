00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now let's use the computer to learn what happens with different harvest rates.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
If we would not be harvesting at all, we would expect to see something like an exponential growth

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
at the beginning, but after a while the amount of fish would approach the maximum carrying capacity.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If you were harvesting too strongly, you would expect the number of fish

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
to quickly go down to zero and then of course stay zero--that's clearly over fishing.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Now, implement this using the forward Euler method and make sure that you stop harvesting

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
when the amount of fish reaches zero.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
All constants that you need are already set up in the code.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You only have to provide the implementation of the forward Euler method to fill the array called fish.
