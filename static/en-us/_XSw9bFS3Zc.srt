1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So this is great--we now learned a lot about cameras and images.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We learned the Law of Perspective Projection

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and we also know when things are in focus.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Now the first law is really important.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and the second law doesn't really matter that much--

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
but I put it in so you understand what the implications of using a lens really is.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Let's talk of when we're in Computer Vision

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and what type things we can do with images.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
One of the primary purposes is to extract information from these images,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
such as classify objects.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So here is one of my son's favorite objects.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And he might be interested in understanding that this is a car.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
A second purpose is 3D reconstruction.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So you might care to take many images of this object, from different perspectives

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
or with multiple cameras, like a Stereo Camera Rig

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and ask yourself what is the 3D model that we can reconstruct from these 2D projections.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Or you might care about motion analysis.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This is a common problem in Computer Vision

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
where things might move and are seen in the video of many images

20
00:01:09,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and you might, for example, care how do things move, over time.
