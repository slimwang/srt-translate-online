1
00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:03,602
Athena started interning at an architecture firm, to learn the basics of

2
00:00:03,602 --> 00:00:07,582
designing and planning for the construction of new buildings. This isn't just

3
00:00:07,582 --> 00:00:11,592
any architecture firm, though. It just so happens to be the firm that designed

4
00:00:11,592 --> 00:00:15,570
the new office for Grant's gleaming glasses company. So we're going to go back

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,535
in time to follow Athena through the work that went into creating Grant's

6
00:00:19,535 --> 00:00:23,359
awesome new space. Since Athena is just getting used to being a part of the

7
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,324
world of architecture at all, the firm gave her a pretty simple project to work

8
00:00:27,324 --> 00:00:31,564
on first. Since Grant's such a fun guy, he wanted his office to have a separate

9
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:35,880
space, just for having fun. Thus, the fun room, which Athena get's to plan.

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,360
Grant has picked out a very special wallpaper that he wants used in this room.

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,518
And has a pattern that he wants to make sure is fully expressed on every wall,

12
00:00:44,518 --> 00:00:48,514
but he also wants there to be natural light in the room. So he wants windows

13
00:00:48,514 --> 00:00:52,887
along two of the walls. However, since he's not willing to sacrifice any of that

14
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:57,175
wallpaper pattern, the two walls with the windows on them are going to have to

15
00:00:57,175 --> 00:01:01,844
be longer than the other two walls. Let's call the distance from one wall to the

16
00:01:01,844 --> 00:01:06,367
edge of a window x. And assume that each of these windows are placed in the

17
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:11,010
center of either wall. So that there's a distance of x on either side. Now,

18
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,916
since Grant loves natural light so much, he wants these windows to be really

19
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:18,758
big. In fact, he's already picked out, surprise, surprise, the exact windows

20
00:01:18,758 --> 00:01:23,565
that he wants. And they are each 3 meters across. Now, since we're calling each

21
00:01:23,565 --> 00:01:27,990
of these lengths of wall x, we know that this length of wall is going to be

22
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,640
equal to the sum of those two. So this is just 2x. Now, the thing that Athena

23
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,093
needs to figure out is how much carpet is going to need to be laid down in the

24
00:01:37,093 --> 00:01:41,330
fun room. So considering these side links and your understanding of, area of

25
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:45,685
rectangles, please come up with an expression for the number of square meters of

26
00:01:45,685 --> 00:01:49,941
carpet Athena's going to need for this room. You could either multiply or not

27
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:51,386
multiply out your answer.
