1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,600
So far, you've defined the profile entity class in

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,020
your application. We don't actually yet do anything with it.

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,348
The next step is to add the code to saveProfiles

4
00:00:08,348 --> 00:00:10,950
in the datastore. But you've already been working in the

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,190
conference api.java class and remember that it defines a saveProfle

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:19,170
method, which doesn't actually yet do any saving. But it

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,860
will, when we're done with it. The next step is

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,260
to actually write the code, that saves the entity in

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,700
the datastore. And it's marked in the file for

10
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,980
you as TODO 3. But before I set you

11
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,020
loose to do that, I just want to review

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,710
how to save entities in the datastore using objectify.

13
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,280
Okay. So, we're going to look at how to

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,200
save entities in the datastore using objectify. You use

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,530
your objectify service. The, the ofy method, you call

16
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,540
the save method, call the entity method passing the entity

17
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,250
to actually save and then, now. The now means,

18
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,850
go ahead and do it right now. It's usual

19
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,500
practice to define a static ofy method, so you

20
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,410
can simplify the code like this. Just call ofy. So,

21
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,060
if you remember we talked about recipes a little

22
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,890
while ago. Here's how you might save a recipe. So,

23
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,970
this assumes that we've created a recipe entity bound

24
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,720
with variable recipe one, so we just pass in recipe

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,270
one as the entity to save, and there it is.
