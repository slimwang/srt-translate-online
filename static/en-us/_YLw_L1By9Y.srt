00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,000
We claim that run.py is fast, very fast.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,610
So let's confirm this.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,670
But before that, we need to learn
how to time a particular operation.

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,460
We need to import a library for that.

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:17,280
We import the time library to help
us know how fast our operation is.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,810
We use the time function
from the imported library.

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,380
The idea is to capture the time
snapshot before the operation, and

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,820
then again capture the time snapshot
after the operation is performed.

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,100
We then subtract the two times.

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,420
Simple, right?

11
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,010
Let's check the code.

12
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:38,240
Here we will check how much time
a Python print statement takes.

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,266
So we capture the time before
the print statement and

14
00:00:41,266 --> 00:00:44,854
then record the time after
the print operation is performed.

15
00:00:44,854 --> 00:00:48,193
Then, finally, subtract t2- t1.

16
00:00:48,193 --> 00:00:50,490
Let's run the code, now.

17
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,690
Here, we get the time taken
by a print statement.

18
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,570
Oh, the number is really very small.
