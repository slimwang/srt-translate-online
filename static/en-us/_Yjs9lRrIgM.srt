1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,500
We have an app which has
a list of friends and

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,220
you can add those friends to the shared
list here just by clicking this button.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,460
And you can also remove them.

4
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,450
Pretty cool.

5
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,970
So, it looks like we're effectively
keeping track of who is shared on

6
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:11,770
what lists.

7
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,400
So now it's time to actually
change around the user lists

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,560
to add shopping lists when
they're shared with the user.

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,380
This is a fairly complicated task.

10
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,740
So here's some thoughts that I
had about how to break it down.

11
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:24,030
My recommendation is that the first
thing you should do is to add or

12
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,340
remove a list to a users list.

13
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,630
So when you press the plus button.

14
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,370
And becomes green.

15
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,650
You should actually take that list and

16
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,660
add it to the user list of
the friend that you're sharing with.

17
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,010
Conversely, if you press
the green check to unshare it.

18
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,960
To remove the list from
your friend's user lists.

19
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,610
Also, a quick reminder,
whenever you're changing around who's

20
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:47,265
shared on the list, it should update the
timestamp last changed for all users.

21
00:00:47,265 --> 00:00:51,010
Okay, so once you've got that working,
you can change or update map for

22
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,430
all with value to update the lists for
all shared users.

23
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,370
Right now, it's doing it pretty
effectively for the owner but you should

24
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:01,310
have this method also update for
anybody that's on the shared with list.

25
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:05,650
For updateMapForAllWithValue to actually
be able to do this, you might need to

26
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,490
change the signature to include
passing in a shared with list.

27
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:12,310
And since you're probably going to be
changing around that method signature,

28
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,980
you're also going to want to update
all the places that you call

29
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,050
updateMapForAllWithValue.

30
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,370
So that you can pass in
that shared with list.

31
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,730
You might find that you're calling
this method from Adapters and Dialogs.

32
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:23,870
And that gets a little bit more tricky.

33
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,790
Let me give you some tips.

34
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,260
For Adapters, you could set a list
of shared users much like you said

35
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,570
a shopping list in an Adapter.

36
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:32,860
Let me show you in the code.

37
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,910
In ActiveListItemAdapter of
a ShoppingList member variable.

38
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:40,330
And that shopping list member variable
is actually set here with this

39
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,950
setShoppingList method.

40
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,860
Okay, so now if I go over to
active list details activity,

41
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,720
I'm here in the onCreate method and
a lot of stuff happens.

42
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,230
I'm scrolling down.

43
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:55,130
But, one of the things is I get
a listener that grabs the shopping list.

44
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,490
So it's the activity shopping
list member variable.

45
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:01,570
And then passes in the shopping
list into the adapter.

46
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,110
So you could do something kind
of similar in the activity.

47
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,640
You can grab, in the activity,
you can grab the shared with list.

48
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,800
And then when that changes you
can pass that into the adapter.

49
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,680
Dialogs are similarly
a little bit tricky.

50
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,850
Now, you can pass in these shared
users into a new instance method,

51
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,970
much like you would a primitive value.

52
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,160
But shared users is a hash map,
and, if you remember,

53
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,060
in the new instance methods,we're
putting all those values into a bundle.

54
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,660
So, you might be wondering how
to put a hash map into a bundle,

55
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,440
well you can use Bundle's handy
dandy put Serializable method.

56
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,830
And similarly you can pull it out of
the bundle by using Bundle's handy dandy

57
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,580
get Serializable method.

58
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,850
You just have to remember to
also cast it to hash map.

59
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:44,900
All right so I'm not going to lie,
this is a pretty big update.

60
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,260
But I know you're ready for it.

61
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,070
Read the spec carefully,
work incrementally, and

62
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,470
reach out if you need help.

63
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,430
I'll also go ahead and

64
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:55,490
add a link to adding log level debugging
information in the instructor notes.

65
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,780
Okay, best of luck and
I'll send over the spec right now.
