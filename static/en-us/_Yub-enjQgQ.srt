00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,760
Now that we have all the participants, how do you think we should assign them

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,140
into the two different groups? Should we have each participant flip a coin and

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,310
put them in the experimental group that gets caffeine if their coin lands on

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:16,850
heads? And put them in the control group without caffeine if their coin lands

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:22,090
on tales? Should one group be males and the other group be females? Should the

6
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:26,430
first half of the participants who show up get caffeine and the second half of

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,830
the participants who show up not get caffeine? Should the people who normally

8
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:35,210
have caffeine be in the experimental group? And, the people who don't normally

9
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:39,909
have caffeine be in the control group? Select the best option.
