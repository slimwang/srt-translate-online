1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,220
Check out this awesome multitool.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,270
Consider the possibilities.

3
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:08,160
If I have this baby with me, I could eat
a steak on the go wherever I want to.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,040
On second thought,

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,450
it's going to be way more pleasant if
I just use this fantastic knife here.

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,860
Sure, it doesn't have all the bells and
whistles, but

7
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,230
it's really good at its main job,
being a knife.

8
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,060
And now we're talking IDE versus editor.

9
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,100
An IDE, short for
Integrated Development Environment.

10
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,320
Is an attempt to create a development
productivity Swiss army knife

11
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,810
that can do it all.

12
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:33,430
Editing, debugging, building,
compiling and even, optimizing.

13
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:37,250
But, IDEs come at the expense of
tools that do one thing really well.

14
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,870
That's not to say that IDEs never work.

15
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:40,950
Far from it.

16
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,300
For app ecosystems, such as iOS or
Android, the vendor offers official

17
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,980
support, and controls both
the programming language, and platform.

18
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,850
Which is why why so many native
developers use Xcode, Android Studio, or

19
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,440
Visual Studio.

20
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,270
But on the web, we already have
to live with fragmentation.

21
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,780
Different browsers,
devices and standards.

22
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,030
We could try to pretend that CSS,
HTML and JavaScript come in a beautiful

23
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,330
tightly controlled bundle and
build an idea around it.

24
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,930
Or we could do what most web
developers decide to do.

25
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,560
Embrace the chaos and
use individual tools best for

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,340
each job while ensuring that
they function well together.
