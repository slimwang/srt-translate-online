1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,210
Throughout this lesson, I'm going
to use examples from a new dataset

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,080
which contains information about
employment levels, life expectancy, GDP,

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,520
and school completion rates
in various countries.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,400
This data was collected by the site
Gapminder which is linked in

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,900
the instructor notes.

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,290
In this lesson I won't be going through
the data analysis process in order,

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:21,720
since I want to focus on how to
use NumPy and Pandas effectively.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,740
Instead you'll be doing a bunch
of analysis on this dataset, but

9
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,680
not necessarily in order.

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,600
I still want you to start off by
thinking of some questions though.

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,320
In the downloadable section there
is a file which explains what

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,390
data is available in more detail.

13
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,570
Take a look at that file and

14
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,440
try to think of at least five questions
that you could answer using this data.

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,220
Then share the questions you thought of
with your classmates on the forums, and

16
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,510
when you're done, check these boxes.

17
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,150
The csv files containing the actual
data are also available in

18
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,660
the downloadable section,
if you'd like to take a look.

19
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,070
But that shouldn't be necessary
since you'll be able to complete all

20
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,290
the programming exercises in this
lesson within the Udacity editor.
