1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,290
At this point, hopefully you feel like you can attack a new,

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,100
big investigation, bring it within the scope of a statistical inference problem,

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:12,140
and then apply iterations of the QMV process to gradually hone a solution.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,120
You've seen a taste of what model building and

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,040
data analysis problems looks like in the real world.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,380
And how it is a continual process of investigation, finding results and

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,180
then proposing new lines of investigation based upon those results.

8
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,590
Sometimes retrying and adjusting previous decisions.

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,400
Specifically we get the process going by iterating on an initial question,

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,500
until we arrive at answers to the following.

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,890
What metric will we be using to capture the phenomenon?

12
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,090
What statistical inference problem will we be examining?

13
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,970
What features will inform the inference problem?

14
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,840
Once we've determined how to measure the problem, as well as what form of

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,160
question we'll be answering, we enter the modeling phase,

16
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,030
in which we choose a method for answering this question.

17
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,830
Ideally, this method should take advantage of any

18
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:02,150
structure within the data that achieves the maximum effectiveness.

19
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,640
Lastly, once we've built a model.

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,630
We evaluate how good the model is at generalizing to the wider phenomenon in

21
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:09,870
the validation phase.
