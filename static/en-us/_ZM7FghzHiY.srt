00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,520
Well, there is three different things going on. There is the web browser that's

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,800
spacing the user and processing the immediate user events such

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,910
as clicking on the buttons. There is the web server that serves the page but

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,150
also receives back the information from the user and then there is a database

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,500
server. So at least three different processes are going on. Now these might be

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,420
on three different physical machines. It can even be on a single machine.
