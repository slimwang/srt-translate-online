Let's take some time to look at
a blogging app we've designed,

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,420
as well as some feedback on it.

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,510
In order to look at which
bits of feedback are useful.

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:08,780
So, here is the app.

5
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,770
What we're trying to figure out is
whether this app design works as

6
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,430
a blogging platform.

7
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,780
Can users easily find blogs they want,
and post their content easily?

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,380
When we asked users to
find a particular blog, or

9
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,410
to post their own content,
they were generally confused.

10
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,400
Users had a lot of things
to say about this design.

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,210
I find this really overwhelming,
and I'm not sure where to go.

12
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,790
I really like the title.

13
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,590
You should use Comic Sans for the font.

14
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,810
I can't find a way to post here.

15
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,150
Which icon is the blog I need?

16
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,190
Remember, valuable feedback is
any feedback that ties a feeling

17
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,240
from the user to a specific
part of the app.

18
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:51,390
Now, which of these bits of
feedback are useful for us?
