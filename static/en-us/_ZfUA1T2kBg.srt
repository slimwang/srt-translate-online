00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,436
When we put all these pieces together, what we get is actually a function. We

2
00:00:04,436 --> 00:00:08,670
can tell, since it passes the vertical line test. This kind of function is

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,927
called a Piecewise function because, well, it's defined in different pieces.

4
00:00:12,927 --> 00:00:16,227
Since different functions are defined in different parts of the domain, there

5
00:00:16,227 --> 00:00:19,427
have to be at least two different equations defined in different parts of the

6
00:00:19,427 --> 00:00:24,446
domain for a function to be considered a Piecewise function. What I'd like to

7
00:00:24,446 --> 00:00:27,935
know, is what part of the domain each of these functions occupies? I'm going to

8
00:00:27,935 --> 00:00:30,725
switch over to Piecewise function notation right now so that you can get an

9
00:00:30,725 --> 00:00:34,522
idea of what that looks like. So this is what typical Piecewise function

10
00:00:34,522 --> 00:00:38,186
notation looks like. You can see that instead of separate equations for each

11
00:00:38,186 --> 00:00:41,450
part of the line over here, we've effectively merged them into one using this

12
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:46,300
brace, this curly thing right here. This shows that all of these different

13
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,724
function pieces are part of a single function f of x. Now the other important

14
00:00:50,724 --> 00:00:55,384
feature of Piecewise function notation, is this section over here to the right.

15
00:00:55,384 --> 00:01:00,150
This is where we show the domain that each part of the function occupies.

16
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,186
Often, you'll see a comma used between the equations for the different parts of

17
00:01:03,186 --> 00:01:07,294
the functions and their domain. But sometimes you'll see the word for written

18
00:01:07,294 --> 00:01:11,450
in here instead like this. To save space, I'm going to use commas right now.

19
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,180
But either way is acceptable. Now, looking at the graph, and thinking back to

20
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,025
what you learned about Grant's tax brackets before. Please fill in the

21
00:01:19,025 --> 00:01:22,175
different numbers that belong in these boxes to show what the domain of each

22
00:01:22,175 --> 00:01:26,326
piece of the function is. Now I've been nice, and I've already filled in the

23
00:01:26,326 --> 00:01:29,749
inequality signs for you, so all we need here are the numbers.
