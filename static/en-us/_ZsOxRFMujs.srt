00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,670
Sunshine is a weather app, focusing on
the current and upcoming weather for

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,290
a selected location.

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,810
Given that focus, it is no wonder that
our main user interface is the weather

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,450
for the next seven days.

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,040
Tapping on a day brings
us to the details page,

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,650
which goes more into depth on
the forecast for that day.

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,130
On larger devices, such as tablets,
we used a master detail view, so

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,800
you could see the forecast and
the detail side by side.

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,170
In both cases, we also provide
a settings screen where users can change

10
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,200
the location they want weather for,
and switch between imperial and

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,000
metric units.

12
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,990
Even when the user didn't
specifically open the app,

13
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:38,830
we use notifications to bring
the latest weather information to them.

14
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,760
All this was made possible by the key
components, such as the content provider

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,959
and sync adapter for stable and battery
efficient data loading and retrieval.
