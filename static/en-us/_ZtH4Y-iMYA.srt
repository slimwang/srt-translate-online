00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:05,200
Let's open GraphPad QuickCalcs. We want to calculate p from the chi square

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,960
distribution. Again, we'll push continue, and we'll go to the bottom where we

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,814
input the our chi squared value and the degrees of freedom. If we compute p, we

4
00:00:15,814 --> 00:00:24,710
get that our p value is 0.0891. This is not significant at 0.01 or at 0.05.

5
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:31,230
Since our industry standard is an alpha level of 0.05 and this does not meet

6
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,960
that threshold, then we're going to guess that there is no reason hire Summit

7
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,590
Up over another guide company. While this would be significant at an alpha

8
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:46,160
level of 0.01 let's say, some might consider this marginally significant. But

9
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,510
this is a %9 chance of committing a type one error. Meaning that if we don't

10
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:57,810
conclude that Summit Up is better than average at getting climbers to the top,

11
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:02,470
there's about a 9% chance that we're wrong and that these differences are just

12
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:06,850
due to chance. We're just going to make our decision based on if we meet this

13
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,945
threshold of 0.05.
