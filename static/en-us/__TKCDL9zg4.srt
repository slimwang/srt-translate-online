1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,110
All right.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:05,033
So we've decided that we'll be getting
the earthquake data from the USGS

3
00:00:05,033 --> 00:00:06,431
earthquake catalog API.

4
00:00:06,431 --> 00:00:09,255
And we've got some polished
user interface designs for

5
00:00:09,255 --> 00:00:13,350
our app from our designer,
which means we're ready to get started.

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,815
So let's talk about the journey,

7
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:18,320
we'll be referring to this course
map to track our progress.

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,390
In lesson one,
we'll explore the USGS site and

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,840
figure out how to request
the data that our app needs.

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,420
We'll also learn about the structure in
which the data is returned to us, and

11
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,780
compose a plan for extracting that
data programmatically in code.

12
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,350
In lesson two, we'll start to unpack
the concepts you need to understand

13
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,830
in order to get information from
the Internet into an Android app,

14
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,630
things like permissions on Android,
and doing work on a background threat.

15
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:46,100
In lesson three, we'll dive into the
whole part if the networking topic and

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,910
you'll understand that end to
end path of an http request.

17
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:54,120
Then we'll update our quick report app
through quest data in the USGS real time

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,120
and display the most recent earthquakes
in the world within the app.

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,060
Okay, let's take a closer
look at lesson one.

20
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,160
In this lesson, we'll start building our
quake report app in incremental stages.

21
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,780
After you've spent some time
familiarizing yourself with USGS API,

22
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,540
we'll begin to prepare our app to
handle the earthquake information we're

23
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,920
interested in displaying.

24
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,381
You'll import some code that we
provided to get you started and

25
00:01:14,381 --> 00:01:17,000
practice becoming
familiar with code base.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,090
Next, you get some focused Java practice
by writing some utility functions

27
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,710
that will be key to extracting and
formatting the metadata

28
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,870
that we want to display about
each earthquake in our list.

29
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,680
You will then transition
to learning how to properly

30
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,580
parse the JSON structure contained
in http response from the server.

31
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,570
And to do this we'll take
a sample response and copy and

32
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:39,400
paste it into the app, pretending that
we got the response from the internet.

33
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,990
In the latter half of the lesson, we'll
update the list item layout to display

34
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,220
the key meta information about each
quake, things like the magnitude,

35
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,120
location details, date and time.

36
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,290
This will mostly be a review of
concept from the last course, but

37
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,920
this will form a nice foundation so

38
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,880
we can dive deeper into networking
on Android shortly after.

39
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,080
We've got a lot to cover, but
after completing this lesson we hope

40
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,860
you feel comfortable exploring the
Internet for external data resources and

41
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,660
approaching a Web API to figure
out how to request data using it.

42
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,288
Let's get started.
