When the switch sees the frame from host D, destined for host B, it doesn't

00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,998
know what to do with the frame, so it forwards that frame on all of

00:00:09,998 --> 00:00:12,610
its output ports. However, because it sees

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:16,360
a frame arrive from source D, it knows

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,751
that future frames that are destined for source D should be output on port four.
