1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,910
For each of these equations, m is just the coefficient in front of the term with

2
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:09,600
an x to the first. So, in the first equation, y equals 100 plus 50x, m is just

3
00:00:09,612 --> 00:00:14,296
50. There are two little potentially tricky spots here. Since in the second to

4
00:00:14,296 --> 00:00:19,268
the last equation, we have y equals 12 minus 3x, m is equal to negative 3. Since

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,996
you will recall that in the form of the equation, the general form, we have y

6
00:00:24,008 --> 00:00:28,730
equals mx and no sign in front of the m, so we need to include the sign as part

7
00:00:28,742 --> 00:00:33,565
of the coefficient. The second potentially tricky thing is for the equation, y

8
00:00:33,577 --> 00:00:38,343
equals 5. We don't have a term here with an x. What that really means, is that

9
00:00:38,355 --> 00:00:43,003
we have the term plus 0x added onto the end of this. Clearly, 0x is just equal

10
00:00:43,015 --> 00:00:47,535
to 0, but writing this lets us see that m, the slope here, is actually equal to

11
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:52,145
0. This actually makes sense, since y equals 5 is just a horizontal line, whose

12
00:00:52,157 --> 00:00:56,563
slope is 0. Moving onto our values of b, these are just the constant terms on

13
00:00:56,575 --> 00:01:01,425
the right side of each of these equations. Negative signs need to be included as

14
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:05,775
part of the b term, and then the equation y equals 5x, since we don't explicitly

15
00:01:05,787 --> 00:01:09,680
see a constant term added out here, b must be equal to zero. Having this

16
00:01:09,692 --> 00:01:13,940
information written out explicitly like this, makes writing the equations in y

17
00:01:13,952 --> 00:01:18,275
equals mx plus b form pretty simple. Hopefully, now you feel very confident that

18
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:21,430
all of these equations can be written in this precise form.
