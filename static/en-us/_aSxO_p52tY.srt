Here's our 3rd practice problem for the Pythagorean Theorem. I want you to try

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:08,365
to find the side lengths of a triangle whose hypotenuse is 4x and who's legs

3
00:00:08,365 --> 00:00:13,620
are 3x plus 1 and 2x plus 2. When you think you've found the numbers for each

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,090
of them, enter them here.
