1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,313
But now we have problem. We got 0 for our average deviation, and that's can't be

2
00:00:05,313 --> 00:00:10,343
a good measure of how spread out these are. I would think that, if we had the

3
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:15,655
same data point over and over again that the spread of this would be 0. But here

4
00:00:15,655 --> 00:00:20,821
we have a lot of data points all over the number line and there's got to be some

5
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:25,960
kind of spread there. So this can't be our measure of spread, if we're going to

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,967
get 0. The problem is that the negatives are cancelling out the positives. When

7
00:00:30,967 --> 00:00:35,900
measuring spread, we don't care if our data values are above or below the mean.

8
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,666
We just care how far they are from the mean. So how can we make sure that the

9
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:45,796
positive and negative deviations don't cancel each other out? Choose all that

10
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:50,590
you think could work. Ignore the negative sign, at least for those with negative

11
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:55,723
deviations. Multiply each deviation by 2. Square each deviation. In other words,

12
00:00:55,723 --> 00:01:00,564
multiply each deviation by itself, or is there nothing we can do? But first,

13
00:01:00,564 --> 00:01:05,634
this is very tricky, please think hard about this because measuring spread is

14
00:01:05,634 --> 00:01:07,969
crucial to statistics. Good luck.
