1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,859
Let's try a little experiment.

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:05,340
I want you to read the first
paragraph of Alice's Adventure in

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,540
Wonderland out loud.

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,460
It's a little weird right?

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,170
With only a few words per line,
it's kind of awkward to read.

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,690
Words or
phrases that might be read as groups,

7
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,350
end up getting broken
across multiple lines.

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,960
Making it hard to parse the sentences.

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,600
Why don't you try this one instead.

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,080
It's got a few more words per line, so
maybe we won't have the same problem.

11
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,530
It's the same content but with more
words and it still doesn't work.

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,470
If a line of text is too long,
readers get lost when trying to

13
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:44,680
find the next line and end up reading
the same thing over and over again.

14
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,760
Or they get lazy and

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,940
might read the first part of each line,
but by the end, they're skimming.

16
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,030
Over the last century,

17
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,680
there's been lots of research done
to determine the ideal measure.

18
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,020
That's the technical term for
the length of a line.

19
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,190
I've seen research ranging from
45 characters per line to as

20
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,440
many as 90 characters per line,
depending on the font used,

21
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,430
if it's in print, if it's projected,
or on a computer screen.

22
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,460
But, there seems to be a pretty solid
consensus around 65 characters per

23
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,990
line for the web.

24
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,730
It's not a hard and fast rule,
but it's a good place to start.

25
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,370
We need to consider the way people
read as we create our designs,

26
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,510
since it can affect our layout.

27
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,800
That's why line length is
an important factor to consider as

28
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,480
you're building sites, and
something I always take into

29
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,780
consideration as I
choose my breakpoints.

30
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,740
It's also important to make sure
that fonts are big enough to

31
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,520
read across any device.

32
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,140
I always set my base font
to at least 16 pixels,

33
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,210
and at least a 1.2em line height.

34
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:49,310
Depending on the situation, I may even
increase it for text heavy sites.

35
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,590
14 pixels is just too small.

36
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,500
That may sound big, but makes for
a much better reading experience.

37
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,690
Even on a desktop, it works quite well.
