1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,589
Congratulations.

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:03,870
At this point you've learned about the most important and

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,390
difficult language features in JavaScript, including scopes,

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,930
closures, the keyword this and prototype chains.

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,270
You also learned a lot of different code reuse patterns that are built on top of

6
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:18,480
those features, such as function decorators and all of the major classing and

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,639
subclassing patterns that are available within JavaScript.

8
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,200
Good luck applying them throughout the rest of your Frogger project.
