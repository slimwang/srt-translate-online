00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,510
More specifically, the actual OOA technique to apply is the following.

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:08,450
First off, obtain or prepare a textual description of a problem.

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,940
Underline in your textual description all the nouns.

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,720
Organize the nouns into groups to become candidate classes,

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,940
then underline all the adjectives.

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,529
Assign the adjectives as attributes of the candidate classes.

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:27,630
Then, underline the verbs, differentiating action verbs from stative verbs.

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,020
Assign the action verbs as operations of classes,

9
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:35,020
and assign the stative verbs as attributes of classes or relationships.

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,490
Sounds simple, but we will also see that there are some stumbling blocks along

11
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:43,400
the way, which we'll have to apply our own thinking to, to solve appropriately.
