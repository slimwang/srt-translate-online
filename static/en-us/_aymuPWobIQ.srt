1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Just to illustrate this example, imagine we'd start up with some graph H. It's a little bit of a mess.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
There's a lot of edges in here but we're going to do is convert this to a new graph G,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
which is the complement of H, and so every place in H where there is an edge we leave the edge out,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and every place where there is not an edge, we add an edge.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
For example, this node is not connected to this one or this one.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So in the complement graph, we connect it that one and that one.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This node is connected to three on the top, one on the bottom.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So we connect it to this one on the top and these two on the bottom.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This one on the top and these two in bottom.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So we carefully constructed this complement graph G and the thing that you need to realize now is that

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
G, this new graph, which is the complement of H has an S-clique

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
if and only if H has an S independent set.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
In fact, it's the same set of nodes. So here's our four clique for example.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This is similar to the graph that we looked at before.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This is our four clique in G and if we look that corresponds exactly to a four independent set in H

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
because it has all the pairwise edges in G and then it has to fail to have all those pairwise edges in H.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So that's how can use the solution into the clique problem to solve the independent set problem.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Now in this particular example, well it illustrates a general idea

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
which is we take instances of one problem and we transform them into instance of another.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
In this case the transformation is really very straightforward.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Maybe it wasn't obvious to you at first. Now that I putted that, it's probably pretty straightforward.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Some of these reduction actually can be much more involved.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This one actually is also really easily reversed.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So if we have an algorithm for independent set.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We can use that to solve the clique problem the same way.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Invert the graph where I complement the graph, look for the independent set and that tells us

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
what the clique is in the original graph,

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
but sometimes again the connection is not always so straightforward.
