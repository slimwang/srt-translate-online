00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,600
It's time to build our first networking
app, Sleeping in the Library.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,920
This app makes use of the Flickr API
to display images from a gallery of

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,630
images called Sleeping in the Library.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,240
Here's the final product.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,500
You open the app, and
then you press this button, and

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,820
voila, there's a picture of
somebody sleeping in the library.

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,310
By building this app, we'll learn
to make use of our first API call.

8
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:21,920
Let's get started.
