1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,180
Because accessibility is so
broad and the usership is so

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:09,020
diverse, we're going to need
a roadmap to guide us on our journey.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,140
Throughout this course we'll
be referring to WCAG, or

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,760
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
2.0.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,580
WCAG is a set of guidelines and best
practices which have been put together

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,650
by accessibility experts to try and

7
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,990
answer the question of what
accessibility means in a methodical way.

8
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,370
Several countries actually mandate
the use of these guidelines

9
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,035
in their web accessibility
legal requirements.

10
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:37,900
WCAG is organized around
four core principles.

11
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,220
The first is making sure
users can perceive content.

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,240
This helps us keep in mind that just
because something is perceivable with

13
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,530
one sense such as sight, that doesn't
mean that all users can perceive it.

14
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:55,330
Second, is it operable can users use
UI components and navigate the content.

15
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:59,010
For example something which requires a
hover interaction cannot be operated by

16
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,590
someone who can't use a mouse or
is using a touchscreen.

17
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,440
Third, can users understand the content?

18
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,940
Also, can all users
understand the interface and

19
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,520
is it consistent enough
to avoid confusion?

20
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,610
And finally, is it robust enough for

21
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:16,490
the content to be consumed by
a wide variety of user agents?

22
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,460
And does it work with
assistive technology?

23
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,547
Together this forms POUR.

24
00:01:21,547 --> 00:01:25,810
While WCAG provides an extremely
comprehensive set of guidelines to help

25
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:31,140
us keep many facets of accessibility in
mind, it can also be a bit overwhelming.

26
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,790
To help mitigate this, the Web aim group
has distilled the WCAG guidelines down

27
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:39,990
into an easy to follow checklist,
targeted specifically for web content.

28
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,710
The webbing checklist can give you
a short high level summary of what you

29
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,530
need to implement while also
linking to the underlying or

30
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,362
tag specifications if you
need an expanded definition.

31
00:01:50,362 --> 00:01:54,450
Both WCAG and the checklist cover
a lot of the accessibility space.

32
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,860
The guidelines can only
ever be a limited proxy for

33
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:01,460
actual accessibility what actually
matters is the user experience.

34
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,810
I'm just checking some box.

35
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,740
So while these guidelines
give us a framework for

36
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,729
thinking about accessibility, there may
be places where they're incomplete or

37
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,450
even give advice which
is a little out of date.

38
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,720
However, they're still
an excellent resource for

39
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,020
helping us integrate
accessibility into our process.

40
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,860
With these tools in hand we can chart
a direction for our accessibility work,

41
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,330
be confident that so long as our project
is meeting the outlined criteria,

42
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,490
our users should have
a positive experience.
