00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,500
All five of the personalty dimensions exist on a continuum. Meaning just like

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,658
with intelligence, if you plot the entire population, you'll only get a few

3
00:00:09,658 --> 00:00:15,622
people at the extreme highs or the extreme lows of each dimension. But most

4
00:00:15,622 --> 00:00:20,742
people would end up here, in the middle. If we plotted the frequency of the

5
00:00:20,742 --> 00:00:26,625
entire population, we would get a bell shape curve or normal distribution. So

6
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:31,855
most of us, about 68% of us, would score around the mean. But then we'll see

7
00:00:31,855 --> 00:00:35,755
that around 2% of people are either really high or really low in any given

8
00:00:35,755 --> 00:00:40,509
dimension. What this also shows us is that there's a high and the low in to all

9
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:46,820
the personalities dimensions. For example, let's look at extroversion. On the

10
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:52,600
high end we have, well extroversion, and on the low end we have introversion.

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,276
And now, look at agreeableness. On the high end we have, well, agreeableness

12
00:00:56,276 --> 00:01:01,465
and on the low end we have hostility or coldness. So, as you can see, the big

13
00:01:01,465 --> 00:01:05,560
five uses the high end as the labels, but there are still two sides to things,

14
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,630
the highs and the lows.
