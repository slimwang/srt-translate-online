1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,790
So we have two options.

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:08,760
Disable cookies, you can do that but
you do talk to this company's website,

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,670
they know where your request is coming
from, they know your IP address.

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,940
So they can still use that IP address.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,390
If you really want to
hide your IP address,

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,010
of course you have to anonymize
the communications so

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:24,830
they don't know where it's coming
from and for that use Tor to do that.
