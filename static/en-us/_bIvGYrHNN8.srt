00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,573
Since we're going to be doing a lot of math together in this course, a great

2
00:00:04,585 --> 00:00:09,325
place to start would be by talking about numbers, since we'll use them all the

3
00:00:09,337 --> 00:00:14,177
time. What is a number really? Well, it's not a thing out here in the world that

4
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:18,553
we can see and touch. I at least have never seen a three or a negative 15 and a

5
00:00:18,565 --> 00:00:23,664
half walking around anywhere. Instead, numbers are abstract and we use them as

6
00:00:23,676 --> 00:00:28,549
tools to talk about things that we find around us. A kindergarten teacher, for

7
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:33,365
example, needs to make sure that none of her students gets lost when she takes

8
00:00:33,377 --> 00:00:37,886
them on a trip to the zoo. One way she could do this would be by constantly

9
00:00:37,898 --> 00:00:42,677
looking at a list of their names and double-checking that every child on the

10
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:47,536
list is in the group, but this would get really tiring and probably wouldn't be

11
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:52,207
all that effective. What do you think might be a better way of doing this? Our

12
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:56,945
first quiz of the course will be a really kind of silly question, but, let's go

13
00:00:56,957 --> 00:01:01,683
with it. How could a teacher make sure that none of her students get lost at the

14
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:06,887
zoo? And here are a couple of answers that you get to choose from. Tell them all

15
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:12,233
to be responsible for themselves and not run off. Your second choice is hope for

16
00:01:12,245 --> 00:01:17,363
the best. Your third choice is count them. Your last choice is they probably

17
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:22,278
shouldn't go on the trip at, at all, just to be safe. Please click the circle

18
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,214
next the choice below, that you think is the best answer. When you've picked

19
00:01:27,226 --> 00:01:31,042
which one you think is right, press the Submit button underneath.
