1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,570
Okay, I'm going to answer these
questions before jumping into the XML.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,050
First thing's first,
is selecting the views.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,670
I'll draw boxes around
the ones that I see.

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,130
Okay, so there are five different views,

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,070
not including the view group,
which is technically considered a view.

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,610
But anyways, these five views
are two TextViews up here,

7
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,330
followed by three buttons.

8
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:24,480
And there are no ImageViews really here
anywhere, so I'd say no ImageViews.

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,300
Now you might be wondering why I decided
that these were two different TextViews,

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,940
well in the final product
the styling of team A and

11
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,050
the score look very different.

12
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,530
So I've decided to keep these
as two separate TextViews.

13
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,080
Moving on to step two,
which is positioning the views.

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,100
I'm going to select which
ViewGroup I want to use here.

15
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,830
And the two that are on my mind
are linear layouts and relative layouts.

16
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,450
Now this is a vertical column of views.

17
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,720
So it's pretty clear to me what I want,
and that is a linear layout.

18
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,310
Okay, finally I have step three
which is style the views.

19
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,320
And I'll tackle that one as
I'm working with the XML.

20
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,780
Okay, so let's jump over to the XML.

21
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,970
Okay, I want to be
looking at the Text tab.

22
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,740
Okay, so the first thing I'm
going to do here is just

23
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,760
delete some things that I don't need.

24
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,470
So I'm going to go ahead and
start by deleting this TextView.

25
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,597
And all of this paddingLeft,
paddingRight, paddingTop and

26
00:01:16,597 --> 00:01:19,750
paddingBottom, I'm also going to delete.

27
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,090
Being very careful not to delete
anything I don't mean to.

28
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,568
Okay.

29
00:01:24,568 --> 00:01:27,760
Now we had said that the ViewGroup we're
going to use is not a relative layout

30
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,370
but a linear layout, so
I'll go ahead and change that now.

31
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,590
And inside of this linear layout
I'm going to have two TextViews

32
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,800
followed by three buttons.

33
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,710
So I'm going to start making those.

34
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,460
Now I'm not going to be too specific
right now about what the width and

35
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,780
height of this TextView are going to be.

36
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,300
For now I'm going to just
leave it as wrap_content,

37
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,070
which will put the box of
the TextView right around the text.

38
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,490
I'll go ahead and set the text for
this TextView as well.

39
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,710
And this first TextView's
just going to say Team A.

40
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,710
Okay, lets see what this
looks like in the Preview.

41
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,800
Okay, I can see a little
TextView there that says Team A.

42
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,610
Now let's build out a couple more.

43
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:07,200
So the next one below that is the score,
and that's a TextView as well.

44
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,758
So we're going to start typing Text.

45
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,490
Okay, I see the word TextView,
so I press Enter.

46
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:15,590
And I am also going to
make this wrap_content.

47
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,860
And I'm going to add the text.

48
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,560
Well the score usually starts at zero,
so we'll have it start at zero.

49
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,580
Okay.

50
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,250
Now my Buttons.

51
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,510
So I'm going to start
typing the word Button.

52
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,230
Go ahead and wrap_content for
these as well.

53
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,002
Okay, now the first Button
is going to say +3 Points.

54
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:34,800
I'm going to go ahead and copy this and

55
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,780
paste it once,
paste it twice to get two more Buttons.

56
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,020
And we'll have a Button
that says +2 Points and

57
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,250
a Button that says Free Throw.

58
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,000
Okay, let's see what that
looks like in the Preview.

59
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,070
Well, I seem to have three Buttons.

60
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,420
I can see Team A and zero.

61
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,910
So I have all my views,

62
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:59,100
but this doesn't really look like what
the end goal is supposed to look like.

63
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,080
Remember, they're in a vertical column.

64
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,222
So I think I have to change
the orientation of my layout, so

65
00:03:03,222 --> 00:03:05,190
I'm going to go ahead and do that.

66
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:09,600
So I'll start typing orientation and
I want it to be vertical.

67
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,860
Okay, that's looking
a little bit better.

68
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:17,290
Now these Buttons were actually expanded
to sort of fill the width of the window.

69
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,950
So I probably don't actually
want to do wrap_content for

70
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,290
the Buttons,
instead I'm going to do match_parent.

71
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,470
So, let me change that right now.

72
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,030
Okay, so the widths of all my
Buttons are now match_parent.

73
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,740
Let's go to Preview.

74
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,470
Okay, that's looking better,
they expanded out.

75
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,270
All right.

76
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:39,220
Well, my text is still kind
of squished into the corner,

77
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,680
and to fix that I'm going to
use something called gravity.

78
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,430
Okay, here I am with a Google Drawing,

79
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,710
now let's make a text
box in Google Drawing.

80
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,350
Okay, so
this is a lot like the bounds of a view.

81
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,330
I could type the word Team A,

82
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,790
and by default it'll be
in the upper left corner.

83
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,780
And this is the same with TextViews,
when you put text in a TextView,

84
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,440
by default it'll be in
the upper left corner.

85
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,700
Now, with Google Drawings, I could
select this text and use basically

86
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,740
the equivalent of an attribute,
called a line, to get it to be centered

87
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:18,940
horizontally inside the text box and
centered vertically inside the text box.

88
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,190
Pretty cool.

89
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,980
Taking the content of the view and
moving it around inside of the view

90
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,340
boundaries is exactly
what layout gravity does.

91
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,330
And if you're thinking this might be
similar to some of the alignment methods

92
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,220
that you can use with relative layouts,
it is, but you can use the gravity

93
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,990
attribute with linear layouts,
which is what makes this powerful.

94
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,670
We'll take a look at it in code.

95
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,980
So, I'm going to take my first TextView
and I'm going to start typing gravity.

96
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,970
Okay.
With gravity, I have two options,

97
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,990
layout gravity and gravity.

98
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,570
I just told you about
the gravity attributes.

99
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,650
So that's the one we're going to use.

100
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,650
Okay.
And then I have a bunch of options here,

101
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,220
and I think I want it to
be horizontally centered.

102
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,088
So, that's what I'm going to use.

103
00:05:00,088 --> 00:05:02,620
And I'm going to go ahead and
see in the Preview what that did.

104
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:08,130
Doesn't look like it did much, but
actually there is a reason for this.

105
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,300
So if I click here, and let's zoom in
since it might be hard for you to see.

106
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,750
Okay, so

107
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:20,960
here we have Team A, and you can kind of
see the view boundary around it.

108
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,650
Well, if I were to tell you that this
was centered inside of the view,

109
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,950
you really couldn't argue with me.

110
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:31,510
It does seem to be centered inside of
the view, the view's just very small.

111
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,020
Going back to our Google Drawing,

112
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:38,940
it's kind of like if I decrease the size
to be just the size of the text.

113
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,450
It's centered, but

114
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:44,520
it doesn't really look very different
from if it were pushed to the left.

115
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,230
Okay, so
if I wanted to center within the phone,

116
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,090
I need to make the view stretch
the length of the phone.

117
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,170
Which is going to require
us to change the width.

118
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,970
Okay, so
back here I'm going to close my Preview.

119
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,840
And I'm going to go to the width here.

120
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,850
Instead of doing wrap_content,
I'm going to do match_parent.

121
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,150
Okay, let's look at our Preview again.

122
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:07,930
Zoom out.

123
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,610
Okay.
And that's looking a lot better.

124
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,200
It seems to be centered up.

125
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,420
So let's do the same thing
with the score here.

126
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,910
Okay, so I'm going to add
gravity to this as well, and

127
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,425
gravity in all the layout gravity.

128
00:06:20,425 --> 00:06:25,950
center_horizontal and I'm going to
change the widths to match_parent.

129
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,160
Okay, let's check it out again.

130
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,870
Cool!
So, everything is centered up.

131
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,190
It's looking pretty good.

132
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,400
Except it's all really
kind of squished together,

133
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,330
there isn't a lot of breathing
room between these elements.

134
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,020
I'm going to give each of
the TextViews a padding of 4.

135
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,875
I'll start typing padding,
I'm going to do 4dp.

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,360
Remember the dp?

137
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,010
And I'm using just padding, not
padding bottom or anything like that.

138
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,260
And that'll provide 4dp
around the entire TextView.

139
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,950
Let's see what that looks
like in the Preview.

140
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,850
Okay.
That gives me a little bit more space.

141
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,750
I'm going to do the same
to the Score TextView.

142
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,808
Okay, now I'm going to try to
do the same to the Button.

143
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:18,610
Hmm, well that didn't
seem to do too much.

144
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:23,693
What if I make it a little bit bigger,
like 8?

145
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,528
20?

146
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:29,820
Hmm, interesting, so it seems to be
making the Button itself larger.

147
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,740
I don't want the Button
itself to be larger,

148
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,980
I want the space around
the Button to be larger.

149
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,640
And actually, that's a better job for
layout_margin.

150
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,040
Remember, padding is actually
adding padding inside of the view,

151
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,930
whereas margin puts
space around the view.

152
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,310
So we're changing this to layout_margin.

153
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,890
I'm going to do 8dp.

154
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,850
Well that looks better.

155
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:53,120
Now there's space around the view
in between these two views.

156
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,019
So let's go ahead and
do that with the other buttons.

157
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,710
Margin, not padding, layout_margin.

158
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,440
Okay, so that's looking pretty good.

159
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,100
Now if you chose different
attributes than I did,

160
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,320
like maybe you had the padding
five instead of four, that's okay.

161
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,710
Remember, at this point I'm just
trying to make things readable.

162
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:15,409
We'll worry about all the font sizing
and pretty colors at a later stage.

163
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,920
Okay.

164
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,670
And awesome work.

165
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,860
You are done with that step.
