00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,410
Now there are three distinct memory systems. Each involve different things to

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:08,455
remember. First, we learn to do things such as implicit procedures. This is the

3
00:00:08,455 --> 00:00:12,253
procedural memory. The output for this type of memory mainly goes to the

4
00:00:12,253 --> 00:00:17,425
Cerebellum and Striatum. When we experience emotional events. The output mainly

5
00:00:17,425 --> 00:00:21,336
goes to the amygdala. When we consciously and explicitly remember a personal

6
00:00:21,336 --> 00:00:26,043
event, or if we're trying to recall an answer, for say an essay exam. The

7
00:00:26,043 --> 00:00:30,478
output goes to the hippocampus, which is just the first part of the process.

8
00:00:30,478 --> 00:00:35,066
Then, these long-term memories get sent to various parts of the cortex for

9
00:00:35,066 --> 00:00:40,429
long-term storage. So remember, elicit and procedural memory is involved in the

10
00:00:40,429 --> 00:00:45,114
cerebellum and striatum. The Amygdala is involved in emotional memories, and

11
00:00:45,114 --> 00:00:49,954
the Hippocampus is important for explicit and declarative type memories.
