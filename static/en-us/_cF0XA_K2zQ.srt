1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,902
I know when 4ths of the cake is frosted with vanilla icing and 2 5ths of it is

2
00:00:03,914 --> 00:00:08,138
frosted in strawberry icing, so I have 1 4th and 2 5ths. I need to add these two

3
00:00:08,151 --> 00:00:12,130
fractions together to figure out how much of the cake is frosted in total. My

4
00:00:12,142 --> 00:00:16,373
fractions do not have common denominators. I have 4ths and I have 5ths, so I

5
00:00:16,386 --> 00:00:20,308
need to get the same size pieces. To find the common denominator, I'm going to

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,824
do the least common multiple method. So, I'm going to list the multiples of four

7
00:00:24,928 --> 00:00:29,001
and the multiples of five. The smallest number that both four and five go into

8
00:00:29,013 --> 00:00:33,697
is 20. I could also find out by using my factor tree method. When I think about

9
00:00:33,709 --> 00:00:37,983
the factors that four and five have on common, the only factor that they share

10
00:00:37,995 --> 00:00:41,766
is one. I know the other factor of four must be four, since 4 times 1 is four.

11
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,735
The other factor of five must be five. Multiplying these together, I still get

12
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:52,195
20. So I know I need to change 4ths into 20ths, and 5ths into 20ths. To change

13
00:00:52,207 --> 00:00:57,575
4ths into 20ths, I need to multiply by 5 over 5. I know this because 20 is the

14
00:00:57,587 --> 00:01:02,745
5th multiple of four. I also know this because I have to multiply 4 times 5 to

15
00:01:02,757 --> 00:01:08,152
end up with 20. So 5 times 1 is 5 and 5 times 4 is 20. To change 2 5ths into

16
00:01:08,164 --> 00:01:13,661
20ths, I need to multiply by 4 over 4. Remember, I'm still multiplying by one. 2

17
00:01:13,767 --> 00:01:18,897
times 4 is 8 and 5 times 4 is 20. Now, this is great, I can actually add the

18
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:24,556
20ths together. I have 5 20ths and 8 20ths. I keep my denominator the same and 8

19
00:01:24,568 --> 00:01:29,970
plus 5 is 13. So I get 13 20ths. If you chose 13 20ths, nice work.
