1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,990
The price per gallon. The price per gallon is measured in dollars over gallons.

2
00:00:05,098 --> 00:00:09,980
And this makes perfect sense if we think about what quantities we're using to

3
00:00:09,992 --> 00:00:14,640
calculate this slope on this graph. y here, stands for the total price of

4
00:00:14,652 --> 00:00:19,709
solution, which is, of course, measured in dollars. And x here, stands for the

5
00:00:19,721 --> 00:00:24,422
number of gallons of solution that Grant has bought, or is willing to buy. And

6
00:00:24,434 --> 00:00:29,135
that's measured in gallons. We know that slope is equal to the change in y over

7
00:00:29,147 --> 00:00:33,379
the change in x, which is, just as we found here, dollars over gallons.
