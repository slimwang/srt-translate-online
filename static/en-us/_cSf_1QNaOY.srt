1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:07,379
Of the three paths on the Frontier,
we have ones with cost of 146,

2
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,164
140, and 118, and that's the cheapest.

3
00:00:11,164 --> 00:00:12,792
So this one gets expanded.

4
00:00:12,792 --> 00:00:18,981
We take it off the Frontier, move it
to Explored, add in its successors.

5
00:00:18,981 --> 00:00:21,027
In this case, it's only one.

6
00:00:21,027 --> 00:00:25,765
And that has a path total of 229.

7
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:27,522
Which path do we expand next?

8
00:00:27,522 --> 00:00:33,640
Well, we got 146, 140, and
229, so 140 is the lowest.

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,842
Take it off the Frontier,
put it on Explored.

10
00:00:36,843 --> 00:00:38,742
Add in this path.

11
00:00:38,741 --> 00:00:40,756
The total cost, 220.

12
00:00:40,756 --> 00:00:44,674
And this path with total cost 239.

13
00:00:44,674 --> 00:00:48,029
And now the question is,
which path do we expand next?
