00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,552
But what about this m, now we know the y and x are variables. If I plug in a

2
00:00:04,552 --> 00:00:09,145
value for x, I get a value for y. Just like for intercept if x is zero then y

3
00:00:09,145 --> 00:00:14,051
would be equal to three. So what about this m, what is this thing we've labeled

4
00:00:14,051 --> 00:00:19,119
m correspond to? Let's see, instead of looking at these graphs I'm going to look

5
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,341
at two different graphs. Graphs that have different m's.. Here is the line y

6
00:00:24,341 --> 00:00:29,334
equals 2x plus 3, and this is the line y equals one half x plus three. So what's

7
00:00:29,334 --> 00:00:34,294
different between these two graphs? Is it the steepness? The y-ntercept or the b

8
00:00:34,294 --> 00:00:36,426
in the equation y equals mx plus b.
