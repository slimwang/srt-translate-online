1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,040
So, here's one possible answer.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,050
Inside these parentheses,

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,400
is a select statement that
returns the average weight.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,270
We call this table subQ,
because SQL makes us give it some name,

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,470
even though we don't use that name.

6
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,410
And then we're joining that
back to player's table, and

7
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:18,930
then doing a where restriction for

8
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,280
rows where the player's weight,
is less than the computed average.

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,300
Let's look at that in more detail.

10
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,660
First, start with the sub query.

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,880
It does an average aggregation.

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,980
Producing this little one
by one table called a subq.

13
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,230
Then, that gets joined
to the players table.

14
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,500
Making this one.

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,060
This then gets filtered, for entries
where weight is less than average.

16
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,490
Finally, we just take the name and
the weight columns.
