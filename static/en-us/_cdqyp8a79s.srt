1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,310
Okay, let's take a look at the solution.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,600
I'm still over here at the MainActivity, and

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,990
I started off by defining two different arrays.

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,000
These arrays are related to one another, and

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,240
let's see a little bit more about that.

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,300
So this first array is a string array, and

7
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,560
it has the name of the columns that I want to bind.

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,310
What do I want to bind it to?

9
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,451
Well, they're the layout items in each of the ListView objects that I have.

10
00:00:22,451 --> 00:00:25,940
Each ListView item that I have has two text views, and

11
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,540
they're identified by text view number 1 and text view number 2.

12
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:33,340
So the value of the WORD column is going to go to the text view number 1 space.

13
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,175
And the value of the FREQUENCY column is going to go into the text view number

14
00:00:36,175 --> 00:00:37,390
2 space.

15
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,940
And this association is done purely by how I've ordered these arrays.

16
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,420
This is in position 0, this is in position 0, so they match up.

17
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,646
Okay, but I haven't actually done anything with these arrays, so

18
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:49,430
let's scroll down a little bit more and see where I actually do that.

19
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,170
Okay, so we're here the onCreate.

20
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,860
Notice how I'm grabbing a ListView instead of a text view.

21
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,430
These lines should look very familiar at this point.

22
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,320
And this right here is where I instantiate my SimpleCursorAdapter, and

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,760
it takes quite a few things.

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,930
Let's go through those.

25
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,959
Okay, so this first one is just the context.

26
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,340
The second line here is the XML for

27
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,970
the layout that I'm going to use for each of the items in the list view.

28
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,280
Cursor adapters are meant to be attached to list views, so

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,150
it's expecting this layout item.

30
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,370
Aha, and next over the cursor, which gives SimpleCursorAdapter its name, and

31
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,930
then I have those two arrays that I was talking about above.

32
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,150
And this last parameter is for

33
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,430
flags, and I'm not really passing any particular flags.

34
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,740
So I'm going to go ahead and scroll down a little bit more.

35
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,920
And just one more statement.

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,530
We're attaching the adaptor to the list view.

37
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,130
And if you did everything correctly,

38
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,060
it all comes together to look a bit like this.

39
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,710
Now, because it's a list view, there are some optimizations to get smooth

40
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,000
scrolling, and my list items look a little bit nicer than they did before.

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,020
Two more quick things that I want to point out.

42
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,090
If you're wondering what this is, it's a standard Android layout.

43
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,220
So, I didn't create this and neither should you.

44
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,190
But if you want to create your custom layout for the list view, go for it.

45
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,480
Also note, for compatibility's sake,

46
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,560
I'm using the Android support v4 version of the SimpleCursorAdapter.

47
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,460
Okay, so high five, [LAUGH] and congratulations on finishing the example app.
