00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,672
We know that the denominator of a fraction cannot equal 0. So, if we solve this

2
00:00:04,672 --> 00:00:09,370
for x, we know x cannot take on the value of 4. Now, I didn't show the steps of

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:13,150
adding 20 to both sides and then dividing by 5, but I think that you can easily

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,950
see that if x were 4, we would get 0, which can't happen for the denominator.

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:22,083
This idea of excluded values of x is really important. Later, when we solve

6
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:26,095
equations with rational expressions, we want to make sure we don't allow certain

7
00:00:26,095 --> 00:00:30,316
values for the variable or for x. We don't want the denominators to be 0.
