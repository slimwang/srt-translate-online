1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,261
Caesar's cipher is also
called shift cipher,

2
00:00:03,261 --> 00:00:07,741
because each letter is map to another
letter by fixed amount of shift.

3
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:14,858
So if we represent letters as numbers,
meaning A is 1, B is 2 and Z is 26.

4
00:00:14,858 --> 00:00:20,084
Then this encryption scheme or
cipher can be represented as the letter,

5
00:00:20,084 --> 00:00:24,379
meaning the integer plus n,
the fixed amount marked 26.

6
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:27,900
Here the shift amount n is a secret,
or the key.

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,210
And obviously,
there are only 26 possible keys.

8
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,490
Therefore, it is easy to
break Caesar's cipher

9
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,850
because you only need to
try 26 possible keys.

10
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,750
A generalization of
this scheme is to allow

11
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,230
arbitrary mapping of
one letter to another.

12
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,340
That is, we no longer require that
a letter is map to another letter

13
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,630
by always the fix amount of shift.

14
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:50,710
Now of course,

15
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:54,800
we need to avoid that two letters
are being mapped to the same letter.

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,184
Demapping, meaning how each
letter is map to another,

17
00:00:58,184 --> 00:01:00,150
it is now the secret key.

18
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,500
Can you tell,
how many possible keys are out there?

19
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,490
Meaning, how many possible ways
to map one letter to another.

20
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,250
The answer is 26 factorial,

21
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:15,380
because there are 26 factorial number
of ways to map one letter to another.

22
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,948
Please note that n factorial is
much larger than 2 to the n.

23
00:01:19,948 --> 00:01:25,153
For example, 26 factorial is
approximately 2 to the 88th,

24
00:01:25,153 --> 00:01:28,284
which is much larger than 2 to 26th.

25
00:01:28,284 --> 00:01:31,540
In other words,
this is very huge number.

26
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,800
If the attacker attempts
to use brute force, or

27
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,830
just blindly search all the possible
keys, it's going to take him long time,

28
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:43,730
because there are 2 to the 88th
number of possible keys.

29
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,410
So, what should the attacker do instead?

30
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,990
Instead of trying all of the possible
keys, an attacker can analyze

31
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,930
the statistical frequencies of
letters to break the schemes.

32
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:58,770
For example, in English,
the most frequently used letter is E.

33
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:03,190
And if in a cipher text,
the letter X is the most frequent,

34
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,660
then there's a high probability
that E is mapped to X.
