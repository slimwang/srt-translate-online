1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,400
So here's another game tree. We have, again, two

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,150
players, a and b, and a gets to make

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,530
a choice, first, to go left or right. And

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,750
b will find herself in a situation, perhaps, where

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,220
she gets to choose to go left or right

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,350
as well. I've drawn these little square boxes, though,

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,500
to represent chance. So what this means is that

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,200
if a goes left, you end up in a chance

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,950
box where you flip a coin and 50% of the time you end up over here, and 50% of

10
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,930
the time you end up over here. Along a similar

11
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,260
vein, if a goes right and then b goes left,

12
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,430
then you end up in another chance node, and 80%

13
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,540
of the time you end up here, and 20% of

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,960
the time you end up here. Alternatively, if b goes

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,470
right, you always end up here. Does that make sense?

16
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:45,970
>> I think so. Uh-huh.

17
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,580
>> So what we've done is we've gone from

18
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,150
a two player zero-sum deterministic game of perfect information

19
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,030
to a two player zero-sum non-deterministic game of

20
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,210
perfect information. Okay, so we've relaxed, we gone at

21
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,270
least one level up in complexity. Okay, so do

22
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,890
you understand this tree? Do you understand this setup?

23
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,300
>> Yeah, I think so. I mean here

24
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,370
the stochasticness is happening essentially at the leaves.

25
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,170
>> What does that mean?

26
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,150
>> That there's no choices to make for either player after this

27
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,070
randomness happens. But is that. That's not what you mean in general, right?

28
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,030
>> No, that's right. There could be,

29
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,880
after here, you end up in a different state

30
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,880
where you can then make more choices. But because

31
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,040
I don't have enough room, maybe because I want to

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,250
make it simple, it just sort of ends after that.

33
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:25,910
>> Okay.

34
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,390
>> But yes, this tree could keep going

35
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,140
on and there could be choice, random, choices chance

36
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,160
nodes happening everywhere. There could have been a

37
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,010
chance node that happened at the very beginning, even.

38
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,220
>> I feel like I could work out the value of this game.

39
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,730
>> Oh, well, how would you go about working out the value of the game?

40
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:41,080
>> I would

41
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,480
probably have it as a quiz.

42
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,580
>> Okay, but what would the quiz look like?

43
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,340
>> It would say, what's the value of this game?

44
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,490
>> Okay. Do you think that just having that be the quiz is the best

45
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:54,470
way for someone to learn or do you think maybe it can be done in stages?

46
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,660
>> Oh, I don't know. Do you have other questions that you want to ask?

47
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,790
>> Well, you know, how would you go about

48
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,852
determining the value of the game? I think the first

49
00:02:00,852 --> 00:02:02,490
thing that you would do, at least if you were

50
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,110
patterning after what we just did, is you would try

51
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,020
to write down a matrix.

52
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,150
>> Sure.

53
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:11,242
>> So, I'm going to write down a matrix. So

54
00:02:11,242 --> 00:02:13,426
that our students will get a chance to, to work out

55
00:02:13,426 --> 00:02:15,766
what that matrix looks like and then from there figure

56
00:02:15,766 --> 00:02:17,780
out the value of the game. Are you okay with that?

57
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,660
>> Sure.

58
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,860
>> Okay. So if we were going to do

59
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,526
that of course. The first thing we'd have to

60
00:02:22,526 --> 00:02:23,716
do is we'd have to figure out, figure out

61
00:02:23,716 --> 00:02:27,520
what the strategies are. So. What are a's strategies.

62
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,180
>> I would have called them left and right but it, but they're not labeled.

63
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,190
>> Yeah well let's

64
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,850
do that we can call them left and right. A can

65
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,010
go left or A can go right. What about B's strategies?

66
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,940
>> B can go left or right.

67
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,981
>> And B can go left or right.
