1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,250
If you chose this graph you're correct. As scores increase on the x-axis, they

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:11,290
decrease on the y-axis. This scattered plot would indicate no relationship.

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:16,320
Here we would have a positive relationship. As scores increase on x they also

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:23,840
increase on y. Note, the .4. It's not as we had a perfect correlation. Instead,

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,260
we have a moderate relationship.
