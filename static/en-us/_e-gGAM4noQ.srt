00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,410
As an example, let's take a look at Wikipedia.

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,870
As you can see, there is a lot on this page.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,140
There's text and lots of different images of different sizes and

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:15,350
shapes, but let's take a look at the inner structure of the site.

5
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,280
I'm using Google Chrome as my browser,

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,140
which includes really great Developer tools.

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,110
And you should be sure to follow along with me.

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,960
In Google Chrome, if you select this three-line icon at the upper right of your

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:32,110
screen and select Tools > Developer Tools,

10
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,080
an additional panel will open at the bottom of the browser.

11
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,030
This shows you the structure of the page.

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,280
And this is a really important fact to know.

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,440
What you see here is not the actual code itself but

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,520
rather the structure of the page as the browser interprets it.

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,400
If you mouse over the lines or

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,110
elements in the structure, you'll notice that parts of the page get highlighted.

17
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:00,440
If you click on the triangle to the left of a line, it expands.

18
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,489
And you can keep going deeper and deeper into this tree-like structure.

19
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:11,040
There is also a separate panel on the right side, which is called Styles.

20
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,270
And this contains a different type of information.

21
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:18,440
Go ahead and explore the site on your own and as you're exploring see what

22
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,760
observations you can make about the Wikipedia page and structure.

23
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,660
And when you're done, which of the following statements did you find true?

24
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,470
Are all elements of the structure visible on the page?

25
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,970
Are all highlighted elements rectangular?

26
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,620
Or, if you go deep enough in the structure,

27
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,990
can you read the same text as you see on the page?
