00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,650
An online first approach works
fine with good connectivity.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,620
In fact, it's no different.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,760
Things work great offline
because you provide

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,060
fallback content instead
of a browser error page.

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,570
Unfortunately, because we're waiting
on the network before we do anything,

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,400
things are still terrible
with live with lie-fi.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,210
With Offline first, we get a good
experience in all three situations.

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:26,160
In fact, we become faster even if
the user has good connectivity.

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,490
In the next chapter, we'll look at
how we can turn an existing app from

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,530
online only to offline first.
