1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,070
So, here is my code for the class movie, and behind it, is hidden

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,870
the other programming file, where we have

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,920
defined multiple instances of the class movie, namely

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,710
Toy Story and Avatar. So, what I will do, is go back to my

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,850
code for the class movie, and define

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,543
a new function or method there called, show_trailer.

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,530
Now, each instance method, whether it be init

8
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:28,740
or show_trailer takes the first argument as, self. So

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,140
I will add that. All, show_trailer has to do,

10
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,480
is open the web browser, with the correct URL.

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,940
And the link or the URL, is stored in

12
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,540
the instance variable. Trailer Youtube URL. The way to

13
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,060
access this instance variable, is through the self keyword.

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,760
One last thing I need to make this code

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:52,860
work, is to import web browser. [SOUND]

16
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,050
There, let me go ahead and save this file. Now that we have defined

17
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:01,510
the method, show_trailer. The next thing for us to do, is to call this method,

18
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:06,130
using our other programming file. So I will go there, and here, I already

19
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,375
have the instance or object called, Avatar.

20
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:11,680
[SOUND]. So I will use it, [SOUND] Avatar,

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,011
to call the show_trailer method. [SOUND] I'm

22
00:01:15,011 --> 00:01:16,240
going to go ahead and save this file.

23
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,240
And then I will run it.

24
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,211
[MUSIC]

25
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:33,135
Wow, that was outstanding.
