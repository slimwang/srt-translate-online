00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,056
Now, one important little gotcha here, which I'm sure didn't actually fall

2
00:00:04,056 --> 00:00:07,436
through your example, was the calling of this dot world dot clear forces every

3
00:00:07,436 --> 00:00:12,970
frame. Now this is an important point in our physics engine implentation.

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,593
Typically, in a physics engine, you'd set the velocity, toss around some

5
00:00:15,593 --> 00:00:19,309
objects and be on with your day. The reason for this is that box 2D assumes

6
00:00:19,309 --> 00:00:22,573
that you're in a two dimensional environment with the gravity vector always

7
00:00:22,573 --> 00:00:27,011
pointing down. As such if you were to create an object and throw it through the

8
00:00:27,011 --> 00:00:31,683
world, the gravity forces on it would actually move it downward. However in

9
00:00:31,683 --> 00:00:35,258
grids this is not the correct policy. What we'd like to do is for a projectile

10
00:00:35,258 --> 00:00:40,410
to move forward along a straight path without vertical gravity influencing it.

11
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,262
However, because we're a top down game and don't have a gravity vector, any

12
00:00:43,262 --> 00:00:46,390
small velocity vector gets accumulated on our physics object each frame without

13
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:51,316
friction allowing it to continue bouncing around in the environment. Or rather,

14
00:00:51,316 --> 00:00:54,826
you should think of gravity as something that produces friction on an object,

15
00:00:54,826 --> 00:00:59,132
slowing its velocity. We fixed this sort of gliding, hockey puck motion by

16
00:00:59,132 --> 00:01:03,628
reducing the influence of the physics engine on our world. Namely, we allowed

17
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:06,556
the velocity of an object to be set for a given frame, the physics engine to

18
00:01:06,556 --> 00:01:11,555
move that object and compute the position and rotation and collisions. And at

19
00:01:11,555 --> 00:01:15,328
the end of the frame, we erase and remove that velocity vector. Now unless we

20
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:18,160
reapply a velocity vector to the next frame, the object will sit in this

21
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,940
position not moving.
