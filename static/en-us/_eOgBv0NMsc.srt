00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:05,790
Our discussion of knowledge-based
agents in this CS7637 class is

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,670
organized around seven principals.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,570
Be on the lookout for the seven
principals, they'll occur again and

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,580
again throughout the course.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,684
Principal number one, agents use
knowledge to guide reasoning and

6
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:22,151
they represent and organize this
knowledge into knowledge structures.

7
00:00:22,151 --> 00:00:25,472
Principle number two,
learning is often incremental.

8
00:00:25,472 --> 00:00:29,464
This connects back to one of
the characteristics of problems,

9
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:32,946
where data and
experience was coming incrementally.

10
00:00:32,946 --> 00:00:36,629
Number three, reasoning is
top down not just bottom up.

11
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:38,400
We just don't reason from data,

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,120
we also use data to pull
out knowledge from memory,

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,070
then we use this knowledge to generate
expectations to make sense of the world.

14
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:52,120
Principle number four, knowledge-based
AI agents match methods to tasks.

15
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,254
We'll discuss a number
of different methods.

16
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:56,727
We'll also discuss several tasks.

17
00:00:56,727 --> 00:00:59,254
Later, we'll discuss how AI agents

18
00:00:59,254 --> 00:01:03,412
can select specific methods to
address particular tasks and

19
00:01:03,412 --> 00:01:07,662
even integrate different methods
to address complex tasks.

20
00:01:07,662 --> 00:01:09,061
Principle number five,

21
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:12,600
agents use heuristics to find
solutions that are good enough.

22
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,890
They do not necessarily
find optimal solutions.

23
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,415
This is because of a trade off
between computer efficiency and

24
00:01:19,415 --> 00:01:21,188
the optimality of solutions.

25
00:01:21,188 --> 00:01:24,666
Our focus will be on using
bounded rationality and yet,

26
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:29,627
giving near real-time time performance
on [INAUDIBLE] intractable problems.

27
00:01:29,627 --> 00:01:30,537
This happens,

28
00:01:30,537 --> 00:01:35,020
because agents use heuristics to find
solutions that are just good enough.

29
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,707
Principle number six,

30
00:01:38,707 --> 00:01:42,729
agents make use of recurring
patterns of problems in the world.

31
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:44,725
Of course,
there are a number of problems.

32
00:01:44,725 --> 00:01:49,362
But even this number of problems are
characterized the patterns that occur

33
00:01:49,362 --> 00:01:50,472
again and again.

34
00:01:50,472 --> 00:01:55,625
Number seven, reasoning, learning and
memory constrain and support each other.

35
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:59,222
We'll build theories that are not
just theories of reasoning or

36
00:01:59,222 --> 00:02:03,485
theories of learning or theories of
memory, but we'll build theories that

37
00:02:03,485 --> 00:02:06,760
unify the three of them into
one single cognitive system.

38
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,150
These principles will come again and
again in this particular class.

39
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:14,120
So we highly recommend that you
take a moment, pause the video and

40
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,730
read over the principles once again.
