00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,260
The factors of this polynomial function are each of these expressions that are

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:09,154
multiplied together. X minus 2, x plus 7 and x minus 1. The x coordinates and

3
00:00:09,154 --> 00:00:13,306
the x intercepts are the numbers we get if we set each of these factors to 0.

4
00:00:13,306 --> 00:00:18,402
2, negative 7 and 1. These are also the numbers that are the zeros. But what

5
00:00:18,402 --> 00:00:22,470
does all this information mean for us and mean for the graph of the function?

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,131
Well we'll figure that out pretty soon. You can start to think about it on your

7
00:00:25,131 --> 00:00:26,289
own for now though.
