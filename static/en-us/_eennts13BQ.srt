1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,920
On to if else statements.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:07,110
You saw several if else statements in
Swift when we talked about operators.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,800
If else statements take the form, if,

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,050
a condition to evaluate, a statement
to execute if the condition is met.

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,830
Else, a statement to execute
if the condition is not met.

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:23,050
Notice again that it's not necessary to
place the condition within parentheses

7
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,060
as you might do in C or Java.

8
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:29,290
It is necessary to place
the statements between curly braces.

9
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,600
Now let's revisit some of
the statements from lesson one.

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,810
Here we've got a bole called Hungry.

11
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,160
If hungry is true, let's eat.

12
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,610
Otherwise, let's wait.

13
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,600
We can use logical operators to
build more complicated conditions.

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,010
Here we're adding a second bole,
Vegetarian.

15
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,140
If hungry is true and
vegetarian is false let's eat steak.

16
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:54,270
If hungry is true and vegetarian
is true let's eat pumpkin curry.

17
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,940
Otherwise forget about it.

18
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,740
We can go for coffee or margaritas.

19
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,900
Similarly, in example three.

20
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:07,270
If hungry is true or if there is pie is
true, let's eat, otherwise, nevermind.

21
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,350
And that's it for now.

22
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,340
If else statements and
Swift are pretty intuitive.
