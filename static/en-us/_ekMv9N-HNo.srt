00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,540
Let's look at the solution
to our MSI quiz.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,370
Read X results in the same
behavior as in the previous quiz.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,000
Both of them have the state as I, and

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,350
then when read X occurs in C1's cache,
it sends out a read request,

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,930
gets the block from memory, and now
it has the block in the shared state.

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,510
C2 still has the block
in the invalid state.

7
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:32,350
Now when C2 writes to X,
it sends out a write miss request.

8
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,910
It will get the data and
then write to its cache, so

9
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,500
it gets the block now
in the modified state.

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,060
C1 meanwhile transitions
from the shared state

11
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,980
to the invalid state because it
observes the write request sent by C2.

12
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,190
And then when C1 wants to write,

13
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,270
it does pretty much the same
thing as C2 just did.

14
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:59,420
It puts a write miss request on the bus,
gets the block,

15
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,920
writes to it,
puts it in the modified state.

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,680
Meanwhile, C2 has to intervene and
provide the data that C1 gets,

17
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,988
and then, because we snooped a write, we
need to transition to an invalid state.

18
00:01:13,988 --> 00:01:18,195
Note that if a block is
in M state in any cache,

19
00:01:18,195 --> 00:01:22,705
all the other caches have to have
that block in the invalid state.

20
00:01:22,705 --> 00:01:27,345
If a cache has a block in a shared
state, all the other caches need to

21
00:01:27,345 --> 00:01:31,305
have the block in either the shared or
the invalid caches.

22
00:01:31,305 --> 00:01:35,775
So, pretty much we can have one has M,
all other have I.

23
00:01:35,775 --> 00:01:40,252
Or we have several can have S and
the rest have I.

24
00:01:40,252 --> 00:01:44,390
We cannot have M and
S in the system at the same time for

25
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,190
the same block, and
definitely we can not have M M.
