1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,790
Now I've gone ahead and
made the changes required for this quiz.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,250
So let's talk through them.

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,250
So starting off in our catalog activity,
I'll need to add code to start up

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,030
a new activity whenever the user
clicks on an item in the list view.

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,520
So I've done that here In the onCreate
method I've added this block of code.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,080
And what this does is it sets up an item
click listener that opens up the editor

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,020
activity whenever the user clicks
on a pet in the list view.

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,730
So notice the code here to set
up an onItemClickListener.

9
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:32,759
It is just our typical code to make an
intent and then pass it to the activity.

10
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,475
Now prior to starting the activity
I actually need to make a URI so

11
00:00:36,475 --> 00:00:40,230
that I can add it to the intent
that's sent to the next activity.

12
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,635
So to make our URI,
I'm going to use this line here,

13
00:00:44,635 --> 00:00:47,570
contentUris.withAppendedId.

14
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,013
So what this method does is it forms
the content URI that represents

15
00:00:51,013 --> 00:00:55,084
the specific pet that was clicked on,
specifically appending the id onto it.

16
00:00:55,084 --> 00:01:00,111
So for example, we're passing in
a content URI, which is this one here.

17
00:01:00,111 --> 00:01:03,027
And then depending on which
item the user clicks on,

18
00:01:03,027 --> 00:01:05,291
it appends the id of that specific item.

19
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:08,157
So once I have this URI,
I can call setData and

20
00:01:08,157 --> 00:01:11,350
pass in the URI that
was created up here.

21
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:15,730
Now all this should be done before
the activity is started down here.

22
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,358
So once this information is passed
through the intent to the next activity,

23
00:01:19,358 --> 00:01:21,859
then we can go on to
the receiving end of the message.

24
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:26,062
So the editor activity is what's
receiving our message intent.

25
00:01:26,062 --> 00:01:29,723
Now in the onCreate method
of the editor activity,

26
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:32,040
I'm going to get the intent here.

27
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,510
Also I'll get the data
from the intent and

28
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,899
remember our data was the URI
that we attached to it.

29
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,150
So now we're kind of
at a fork in the road.

30
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,730
because remember, there are two ways
that this editor activity can be opened.

31
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:47,090
So the first way is if the pet is
clicked on in the list view, and

32
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:51,600
the second way is if the user clicks on
the floating action button, or the FAB.

33
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,390
Now if the FAB were to be clicked on,

34
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,350
then we wouldn't actually receive
a URI through the intent.

35
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:00,450
So that means we need to check whether
there is or is not a URI passed in.

36
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,350
Now this if else block here
helps us take care of that.

37
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,350
So that means if there is no
URI passed in with intent,

38
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,919
then I know we're coming from
the FAB button being pressed.

39
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,860
So I should set my title to Add a Pet.

40
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,237
However, if there is a URI
passed in with intent,

41
00:02:15,237 --> 00:02:18,360
I know I'm coming from clicking
a pet in the Listview.

42
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,490
And that means, I need to
change the title to Edit a Pet.

43
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,279
So if we expand on
this by clicking on it,

44
00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:25,131
notice that the title
should be a string.

45
00:02:25,131 --> 00:02:30,192
And the string here is a new one that
I've added into my string resource file.

46
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:31,975
So let's see where that's set up.

47
00:02:31,975 --> 00:02:35,625
I'm going to right click,
head to Go To, and go to Declaration.

48
00:02:36,665 --> 00:02:40,895
So my strings XML file, I added this
new line, which is the title for

49
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:44,040
the activity to edit an existing pet.

50
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,530
And lastly,
in order to accommodate this,

51
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,390
remember that in our Android manifest
file, we setup the activity.

52
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,080
For our editor activity we've
given it a label for new_pet.

53
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,762
But because it can be a variable name
now, either edit pet or add a pet.

54
00:02:57,762 --> 00:03:00,060
I'm going to go ahead and delete this.

55
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,080
And this way the title of
the editor activity is dependent on

56
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,570
what URI is passed in.

57
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,690
So whether a URI was passed in or not.

58
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,119
So now let's check whether this worked.

59
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:11,311
I'm going to go ahead and
run it on my emulator.

60
00:03:11,311 --> 00:03:13,609
[BLANK_AUDIO]

61
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:15,956
So first let's click on the FAB.

62
00:03:15,956 --> 00:03:18,350
So this opens up the activity.

63
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,140
And the editor says Add a Pet,
which looks good.

64
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,880
Now let's head back.

65
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,870
And now let's insert our dummy pet.

66
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,760
So from here, let's try editing
this pet and see what the title is.

67
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:34,390
So clicking on a pet from the list view,
I pull up the editor activity, but

68
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,860
now the title of it is Edit Pet instead.

69
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,970
So it looks like it all works.
