1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Often we find in reality that the margin of error is wrong.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Which of these reasons could make us understate the true margin of error?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
If the poll is taken before the election at a different time, does that change the margin of error?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
If some voters are under-represented in our sample, could that increase error?

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Similarly, if some in our sample are less likely to vote than others, does that affect our error?

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Now, assume that we haven't somehow perfectly matched up the frequency of voting

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and their relative representation in sample.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And if the responses differ from what someone intends to actually do, could that cause more error?
