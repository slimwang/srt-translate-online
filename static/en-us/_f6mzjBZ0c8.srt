1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,560
Let's look at creating
an interstitial ad unit ID.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,310
So we go down and
create another ad unit ID.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,980
This time we select interstitial.

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:13,390
And first of all, for the ad type, you
can see that we also support video here.

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,928
That is because an interstitial
ad covers the entire screen.

6
00:00:16,928 --> 00:00:20,620
The interstitial timeout defines
the maximum number of seconds that we

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,370
are willing to wait to
receive the interstitial ad.

8
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:29,150
If this time expires, then the
onAdFailToLoad method will be called.

9
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,350
And then we also give it
an ad unit name and save it.

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,670
So now we created an ad unit ID
also also for an interstitial ad.

11
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,550
Let's click Done now.

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,630
And here we can see the ad
units that we've created.

13
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,569
There are also lots more options
that you can set for ads.

14
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,420
For example, which categories
of ads you want to display.

15
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,510
You can do that by going here,
Allow & block ads.

16
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,840
And you can see lots of
different categories here, and

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,870
whether your app allows that
ad category to be displayed.

18
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,060
But let's go back to the main page.

19
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,400
And this is our dashboard.

20
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,130
You can now see the estimated
earnings for your app displaying ads.

21
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,980
That's it for
the basics of the AdMob interface.

22
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,520
There are lots more options.

23
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,110
For example, how you can promote your
app, or analyze the behaviors of ads and

24
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:20,960
users.

25
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,700
But those are more advanced topics.

26
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,070
But now, you know the basics of
earning money to show ads in your app.
