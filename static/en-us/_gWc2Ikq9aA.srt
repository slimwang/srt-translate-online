This is just a fun quiz to get you thinking

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,520
about latency and throughput. I am sure that most of

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,920
you would have gotten that, the time to get to

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,580
the classroom, after all, from my office is one minute,

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,730
so that's the latency I'm going to observe, getting to my

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,130
classroom. The interesting thing is the throughput. The throughput is

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,830
five per minute, because the hallway is wide enough. For

8
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,940
five of us to walk side by side, so the throughput

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,930
that we can get is five per minute. The important

10
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,479
thing I want you to see is that, the latency

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,580
is not the inverse of throughput. On other words, if

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,940
tomorrow I widen the hallway to make 10 people walk

13
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,530
side by side to get to the classroom from my

14
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,150
office, that's going to increase the throughput, but it does nothing

15
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,970
to the latency, the latency is always going to be the

16
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,780
time it takes for me to get from my office,

17
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,960
to the classroom.
