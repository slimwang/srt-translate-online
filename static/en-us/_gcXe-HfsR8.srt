00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,517
When we have a greater than inequality, we get a union. Notice that f could be

2
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:08,836
greater than 5, or f can be less than negative 5. Just like in the absolute

3
00:00:08,848 --> 00:00:13,146
value equations, we have two inequalities. One with a positive answer and one

4
00:00:13,158 --> 00:00:17,481
with a negative answer. But for the negative answer we had to reverse the

5
00:00:17,493 --> 00:00:22,130
inequality sign. This will come up in problem solving. But, what about a less

6
00:00:22,142 --> 00:00:27,009
than sign? Here, we have the absolute value of a number is less than 5, so we

7
00:00:27,021 --> 00:00:31,505
want all the numbers whose distance is less than 5 from 0. So, let's have

8
00:00:31,517 --> 00:00:36,409
another check. What sets of numbers satisfy this less than inequality? Choose

9
00:00:36,421 --> 00:00:37,381
the best answer.
