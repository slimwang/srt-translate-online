1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,719
Now we can use this pooled variance, the same way we used each individual

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:09,213
variance before. But now instead of each individual variance we use the pooled

3
00:00:09,213 --> 00:00:14,710
variance. Now find this corrected standard error.
