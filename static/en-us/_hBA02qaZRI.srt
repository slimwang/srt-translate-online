1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the answer to this question is fairly straightforward.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In data we have 2 possibilities.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The median could either be 9 or it could be 15.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So we'll accept either of those.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In order for it to be unique, we just need to take their average,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and that's equal to 12.
