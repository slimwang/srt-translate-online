1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,160
The solution is to lauch 
an explicit intent

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,660
to the Detail Activity Class. 
We'll go to On Create View,

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,380
where our On Item 
click listener is defined.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,300
To pass in the Weather Forecast 
information, we can use

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,840
an intent extra, 
which is a key value pair

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,030
in the Intent.

7
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,790
We use the key name, 
Intent.extratext,

8
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,800
but we can use any string for the key,
as long as we use the same key

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,460
when reading the information out.

10
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,310
Just as in the toast, 
we obtain the forecast data

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,000
from the current list item 
by calling get item

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,560
on the adapter at the given position. 
Once we've added the intent,

13
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,350
we just start the activity.
