00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,130
My investors are my partners,
are my mentors, are my friends.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,080
Working with them is not only
getting money from them.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,450
They are financing you, and they
are helping you execute your vision.

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,710
They are also helping
you in everything else.

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,210
They're helping you in hiring, they're
helping you in business partnerships.

6
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,870
They're helping you in
surviving this mentally

7
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:28,440
challenging process which is
entrepreneurship and building companies.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,540
They've been there, and
if they haven't been there,

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,080
they are working with a lot of people
that are doing this right now.

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,640
And their advices are so good and

11
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:43,350
take you to a different level, that I
don't know what I would do without them.
