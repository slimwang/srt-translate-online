00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Dave] So for question 3, the question is which of the following sequences

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
of statements leaves the value the variable x refers to

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
the same as it was before running the statements?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You should assume that before the code runs,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
both a and x refer to integer values.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We don't know what they are. They could be any integer.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And the question is after the code runs, does x have the same value it had

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
before that code ran?

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So here are the choices.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
There are 5 different sequences of statements,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and you should check the box for each sequence where x

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
has the same value after executing those statements

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
as it did at the beginning, no matter what value x had at the beginning

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
as long as it was some number.
