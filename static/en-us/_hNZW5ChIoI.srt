1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,210
So now let's dive deeper and try to
understand what we can do with videos

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:07,330
and use them to generate a panorama.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,240
Of course, this is the video,
you've seen it before.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,040
And what we are interested in,
if you remember,

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,130
is when you talked about
video representation,

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,070
what really is happening is that
the local x y coordinates of each image

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:23,805
is stacked together in the time axis
to generate, of course, a video volume.

8
00:00:23,805 --> 00:00:27,790
All right so this is what we
refer to as a video volume.

9
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,150
In this case I'm just showing you
a few frames of the sequence here and

10
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:35,320
stacked on top basically kind of saying
that in time, this is a stack of images,

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,110
this is my video volume.

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,340
But what we are interested in
really is kind of creating a global

13
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,250
representation of this.

14
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,270
So lets come out with a global
coordinate frame capital XY, and

15
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,790
rather than worry about time,

16
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,410
lets try to kind of start seeing
what we can do with these images.

17
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:54,580
So, of course that basically means
is if I can take these images and

18
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,879
move them around a little bit.

19
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,860
So you know, for example, this would
be an image that would be here,

20
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,480
other images from the back would be
realigned in different regions here.

21
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,670
Some of them might be the same images
because, as you notice sometimes,

22
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,020
the motion might be slow.

23
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,860
And of course, getting all of these
images together in this format and

24
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,070
then doing what we actually know how
to do, that is registering images.

25
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,470
Remember the stabilization
algorithm could also be used for

26
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:24,300
doing this kind of registration or even
the kind of simple methods that we've

27
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,660
looked at that is finding features and
doing ransack and

28
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,655
all of that kind of stuff to align those
features together to create, of course,

29
00:01:31,655 --> 00:01:34,240
a wide field of view image like this.

30
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,320
Using this, we can of course generate
a panorama, which is shown here, but

31
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,410
more importantly what we also need to
do is identify regions that actually

32
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,150
are the ones that are dynamic.

33
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,070
That after I build this panorama,
those pixels are moving.

34
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:52,970
For example in this case the pixels will
be moving where all the water flow is.

35
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:57,000
In the case of this actual approach
by they actually suggested that you

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,960
can manually paint out the regions
where the dynamic motion was.

37
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,930
I leave it up to you to start thinking
about various methods we can come up

38
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,620
with to actually do this automatically,
and

39
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,070
in fact if you think about the kind of
stuff we did with video stabilization,

40
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,690
where we actually look for background
and foreground, some of those types of

41
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:18,500
approaches could also be used to
kind of generate this automatically.

42
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,850
That is finding which pixels are moving
after I will build the panorama, and

43
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,145
also asking questions about,

44
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:27,240
okay now I have a region
where just the motions are.

45
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,150
We would now actually use those to
generate, of course, moving parts.
