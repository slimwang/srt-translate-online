1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And even though I don't think Winston Churchill invented it,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
in the course of World War II the Germans tried to associate this quote

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
with him to make him less credible.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Be it as it is, the key lesson here is

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
statistics is deep and often manipulated.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
One of the tricks I'd like to teach you is to be skeptical of statistics,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
of your own results, of other people's results,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and really understand how to turn raw data

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
into decisions or conclusions.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I hope that this simple example made up think.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Stay tuned when we dive into the basics of statistics,

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
which is probability theory, in the next number of units.
