1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,680
So median filtering for

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,250
background subtraction does
exactly what you might think.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,560
All right, now we're going to
assume that the background

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,510
will be modeled by the last end framed
but I'm not going to take the average.

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,250
I'm going to take the median value.

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,550
What's kind of nice about that is
now n can be kind of nice and long.

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,360
Let's suppose the average, let's
suppose when I look at the, the road.

8
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,952
Let's suppose its value is 57.

9
00:00:28,952 --> 00:00:33,410
Plus or minus a little,
57, 58, 56, 52, 57, etc,.

10
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,502
Then comes along a white car.

11
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:38,866
[NOISE] And it's like got 112,
119, 194, fine.

12
00:00:38,866 --> 00:00:40,730
Then comes along a black Porsche.

13
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,350
Slowly because he's being cool,
you know it's three and not.

14
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,890
But if you take a look
at all those values,

15
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,950
the one that's going to dominate is
going to be the 57 to 56 etc, so

16
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:56,300
when I do a median filter, that's
the one that's going to get pulled out.

17
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,440
So now your foreground mask is we
just take the current image and

18
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,270
we subtract that the median
of the last end frames, okay?

19
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,459
And again, threshold.

20
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,490
Your n by the way now is
a little less sensitive.

21
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,480
I mean it has to be big
enough to capture it.

22
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,780
There is, as you know, those of
you know about in your computing,

23
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,530
a running average is easy to compute.

24
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,020
You just have to know how many frames
you've, you've added into the average so

25
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,980
far and the previous average and

26
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,740
then it's 1 over n of the new 1
plus n minus 1 over n of the old 1.

27
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,050
A median,
you have to actually keep them.

28
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:29,410
And then resort them, and
that can be expensive.

29
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:33,070
So, unless you'd play some interesting
tricks, median filtering can be

30
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,660
expensive, but it, but it's,
it's not too much of a problem.

31
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,580
All right.

32
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,510
When you apply the median, well,

33
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:42,410
it turns out if you use short n,
it might not be quite so great.

34
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,240
So, for example, here we have
the estimated background and

35
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,510
you can see a lot of stuff has gotten
cleaned up, but because of the small

36
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:52,450
n I still get this problem in terms
of where the van is and you're

37
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:56,070
doing a better job getting the van but
you still get a little bit of the stuff
