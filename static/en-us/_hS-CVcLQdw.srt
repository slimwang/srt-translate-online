1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,613
It's going to be some
number multiplied 6 times.

2
00:00:03,613 --> 00:00:06,585
So, the exponent is going to be 6.

3
00:00:06,585 --> 00:00:09,870
And n to the power 6
whatever that number n is.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,343
It's not the first option.

5
00:00:11,343 --> 00:00:15,961
So let's say 26 letters upper and
lower case will make

6
00:00:15,961 --> 00:00:20,686
that 26 times 2, or
52 digits, makes it 10 more.

7
00:00:20,686 --> 00:00:26,526
That's 62, and the special characters,
if you add 10 of them, that's 72.

8
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,620
The answer is going to be the last one.

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:34,440
It's 72 to the power of 6, because each
position we have 72 possibilities and

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,330
there are 6 positions in the password,
6 characters in a password.
