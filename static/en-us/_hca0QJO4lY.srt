1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,710
One of the main motivations for the rise

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:05,290
of virtual networking was the" ossification" of the

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,600
internet architecture. In particular because the internet protocol

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,060
was so pervasive, it made it very difficult

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,840
to make fundamental changes to the way the

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,210
underlying internet architecture operated. There was a lot

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,110
of work on overlay networks in the 2000's

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,470
but one size fits all network architectures were very

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,960
difficult to deploy. So rather than try

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,260
to replace existing network architectures, network virtualization

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,310
was intended to allow for easier evolution.

12
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:42,460
In other words, network virtualization enables evolution because

13
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,660
we didn't have to pick a winner for a replacement for IP. We could

14
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,360
instead let multiple architectures exist in parallel.

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,400
Now, this was sort of a green field

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:57,990
view of why virtual networking was potentially a good idea. In practice, network

17
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,675
virtualization has really taken off in multi

18
00:01:01,675 --> 00:01:04,580
-tenant data centers where there may be

19
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,980
multiple tenants or applications running on

20
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,010
a shared cluster of servers. Well know

21
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,540
examples of this include Amazon's EC2, Rack

22
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,490
Space, and things like Google App Engine.

23
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,380
Large service providers such as Google, Yahoo

24
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,780
and so forth also use network virtualization

25
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,460
to adjust the resources that are devoted

26
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,570
to any particular service at a given time.
