1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:06,220
So we have this hardware continuum from cell phones and PDAs to laptops,

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:12,460
to tablets, to desktop computers, all the way to nodes in

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:18,320
a data center that is providing cloud computing services. Regardless of these

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,160
different manifestations and sizes, the organization

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,380
of the hardware inside the computer

6
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:32,650
system is pretty much the same. You've got a CPU. And the CPU is connected to

7
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,160
a conduit, which we call the bus. And

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,080
you've got memory that has the instructions and

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,760
data that is needed for the CPU to execute. And the CPU can use it's conduit,

10
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,900
namely the bus, to access the memory. And

11
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:52,030
you need storage for persistance of files and

12
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:58,750
other data that your produce during the computation. And, once again the CPU can

13
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,450
access stuff on the student's device through

14
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,489
a controller that is also connected to

15
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:10,930
this conduit. And you may have other peripheral devices, like a microphone and a

16
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,490
camera. All of these devices, of course,

17
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,490
are accessible for the CPU through this conduit,

18
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,420
which is the bus. And of course in this day, and age a device has to be

19
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:27,220
able to communicate with the outside world. You have a network, and once again

20
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:32,300
the network is interfaced through a controller to the CPU via

21
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:37,880
this conduit. So this conduit for communication Which is the BUS,

22
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,700
serves the purpose of connecting the CPU to the

23
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,520
memory as well as all the iode devices that

24
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,780
it may need to interact with in order to

25
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,330
do whatever the intent is of the user and

26
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,010
the application that they want to run on the

27
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:57,908
computer. And depending on the sophistication of the device

28
00:01:57,908 --> 00:02:00,668
that we're talking about, and the speed of the

29
00:02:00,668 --> 00:02:04,580
device that we're talking about. These controllers that I'm

30
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,169
showing you may have different capabilities. So for instance a

31
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:11,200
network controller may have the ability to

32
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,510
move the data directly from the memory into

33
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,480
the network, or from the network into the

34
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,000
memory and this As you may have learned

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,700
in a computer organization course, is called direct

36
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,120
memory access for the controller to move data

37
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,700
swiftly between memory and the IO device. And

38
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,930
similar DMA facility may exist in the controllers

39
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,690
of other high speed devices, this is the high

40
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,560
speed device. So that's the capability that you got

41
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,580
for some of these controllers. Some of these controllers

42
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,680
may be slow enough, for instance a keyboard or

43
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,040
a mouse, that the CPU can directly query new

44
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,590
data that is coming from the controller that is

45
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,470
associated with slow speed devices, and move it into

46
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,160
memory or use it in any fashion that it wants.
