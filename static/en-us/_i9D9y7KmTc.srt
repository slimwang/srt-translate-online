00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,840
Now, you may be wondering
why we are spending so

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,660
much time talking about cameras and
how that relates to VR.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,830
Well, to answer that let me show you an
example of an image that gets rendered

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:11,840
on your smartphone screen.

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,870
See how there are two views of
the scene that look almost identical?

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,410
For VR, we need to generate
two slightly offset images.

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,170
One for each eye.

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,292
You can see that clearly if you look at
close objects like the 71 on the screen.

9
00:00:27,292 --> 00:00:31,750
When viewed through an HMD, our brain is
then able to magically fuse these images

10
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:36,110
into a single perceived image
through a process called stereopsis.

11
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,660
This process allows us to infer
the depth of objects in the scene,

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,590
which is super cool.

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,740
Now to actually create an image like the
one shown, we need to use not only one

14
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,670
but two cameras in unity to
render the scene for each eye.

15
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,780
In order to correctly
fuse the images together,

16
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:57,170
we need to make sure we also set the
cameras in unity by the same distance as

17
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,430
the distance between the center
of the two lenses on our HMD.

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:06,650
This distance is called the lens
separation distance or LSD for short.

19
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,880
And no, not the acid.

20
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,570
The LSD is tied very closely to
the interpupilary distance or

21
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,130
IPD, which is the physical distance
between the centers of our eyes.

22
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:22,010
IPD generally range anywhere
from 52 to 78 millimeters, but

23
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,869
average around 63 millimeters.

24
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,520
If a headset doesn't include
an adjustment for the LSD,

25
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,000
it will most likely be
around the average IPD.

26
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,260
This is because for maximum comfort, you
want your IPD to be the same as the LSD,

27
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,910
which should be the same distance
between the virtual cameras.

28
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,880
So when playing with VR,
those values are pretty important.

29
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,590
So let's measure them.
