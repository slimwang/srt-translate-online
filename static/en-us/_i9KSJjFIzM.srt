1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,863
Judging from how complicated this looks
right now, they're probably going to be a

2
00:00:03,863 --> 00:00:07,821
lot of steps involved in simplifying this
expression. So, let's just get started.

3
00:00:07,821 --> 00:00:11,538
The first thing I'm going to do is use the
Distributive Property to distribute

4
00:00:11,538 --> 00:00:17,451
multiplication of -3x to every term inside
the parentheses. Remember that it doesn't

5
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:20,813
matter how many terms are inside the
parentheses, we still multiply every

6
00:00:20,825 --> 00:00:25,008
single on of them. So, for now, that's the
only thing that I'm going to change. I'm

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,012
going to leave everything else, all the
other terms in the expression, exactly as

8
00:00:29,024 --> 00:00:32,723
they are. So now, we have this long
expanded expression. I'm really sorry. I

9
00:00:32,735 --> 00:00:37,354
had to erase your challenge warning sign,
but know that I still think this is a

10
00:00:37,354 --> 00:00:40,860
challenge problem. Now, we'll simplify it
within each term. You'll notice that I

11
00:00:40,872 --> 00:00:44,747
haven't switched any of these operator
signs to minus signs yet so I'll do that

12
00:00:44,747 --> 00:00:48,480
in this next step. So, wherever I'm adding
a negative term, I'm actually just

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,555
subtracting that term. So, instead of plus
-3xy, I'll actually just have -3xy. And

14
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:58,170
now finally, we get to rearrange our terms
so that like terms are next to each other

15
00:00:58,182 --> 00:01:02,368
and simplify. And so, here's our final
answer. You still have six terms, which

16
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:06,656
just goes to show you sometimes, you can't
do anything more to make an expression

17
00:01:06,656 --> 00:01:10,164
look any prettier. But it definitely is a
bit less complicated than it was at the

18
00:01:10,176 --> 00:01:14,218
beginning. I know this was a really tough
problem and again, there were many, many

19
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:17,957
opportunities for little mistakes to be
made. So, if you got even part of this

20
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:22,186
right, especially practicing the
distributive property, that is awesome.

21
00:01:22,386 --> 00:01:24,781
So, if you made a little mistake, go back
and try it again. The Distributive

22
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:28,587
Property will keep popping up at different
places throughout the course so it's super

23
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:31,992
important that you really, really
understand it. Although, probably not all

24
00:01:32,004 --> 00:01:34,871
the problems we do will be quite as
complicated as this one.
