00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,664
Now that we know the y intercepts for these 2 equations. We can actually find

2
00:00:04,664 --> 00:00:09,707
out something interesting about these forms. So, here's an equation y equals mx

3
00:00:09,707 --> 00:00:14,487
plus b. You might have heard about it. Which part of this equation represents

4
00:00:14,487 --> 00:00:17,655
the y intercept? Is it the y, the m, the x, or the b?
