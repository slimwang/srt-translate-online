00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,330
So here we are at the course map and I want to take a minute

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:08,320
to talk about some big ideas that we will learn together. In this course, we

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,600
will start out with ideas that we

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,300
are somewhat familiar with. This includes functions, functions

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,090
like the simple print ("Hello World"). Soon

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,595
however, we will move onto learning new ideas.

7
00:00:18,595 --> 00:00:26,290
[SOUND]

8
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:30,750
These ideas include classes and object oriented programming. Now, this

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,280
is a technique that's used by software engineers on a daily basis. And they

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,610
can use this technique to write and share code amongst each other. Now, while

11
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:43,640
we will start with functions in lesson one, we will spend most of our time

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,300
in the course right here, learning about

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,060
classes. Oh, but the way, all programs in

14
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,530
this course are written in the Python

15
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,490
programming language. So, let's begin by downloading Python.
