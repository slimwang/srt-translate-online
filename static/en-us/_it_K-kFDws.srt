1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,560
What if we make a function that does all of that work up front and

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,650
then we just let the Van and the Cop class do a tiny bit of customization for

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,470
whatever is left to make them different from regular cars.

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,380
We would call this new function we're building a superclass.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,290
That term includes the word class, because this function will be

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:20,610
creating a lot of similar objects and it includes the word super, because these

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:25,350
other classes will use the output from the superclass as their starting point.

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,960
Let's name the function Car,

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,010
since it's going to be creating objects that have the generic moving behavior.

10
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,220
And then Van and Cop will be even more specific versions of it.

11
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:38,030
Which parts of Van and Cop do you think could be moved up into the body of

12
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,320
the Car constructor function?
