1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,260
Lets say it takes me one minute to go

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,786
from my office to the classroom, but the hallway is

3
00:00:06,786 --> 00:00:11,110
wide enough that five of us can walk side-by-side going

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,530
to my office to the classroom. So the question to

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,690
you is to illustrate the difference between latency and

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,560
throughput. The question is, what is the latency incurred by

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,620
me to get to the classroom? And the second part

8
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,780
of the question is asking you, what is the throughput

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,010
achieved if I walk with four other

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,970
students side-by-side to get to the classroom?
