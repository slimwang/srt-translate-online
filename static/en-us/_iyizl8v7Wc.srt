00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:00,840
Hi there.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,250
So this is going to be an interesting,
fairly short course.

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,651
We've primarily built it to help
you learn more about Backbone.js.

4
00:00:07,651 --> 00:00:11,940
Backbone.js is a library that helps
you organize your web applications.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,640
If you're completely new to organizing
web applications consider going through

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,020
JavaScript design patterns first.

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,869
I've put a link to that course
in the instructor notes.

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,600
Now i'm going to be honest with you,
learning about backbone

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,950
is an important objective for this
course but it's not my only objective.

10
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,620
The other objective I have is for
you to refine your ability

11
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,380
to learn new things by exploring
resources on the internet.

12
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,710
This is a critical trait to have for
any professional web developer.

13
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,625
So here's how the course
is going to work.

14
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,350
We've created a list of
resources from the internet.

15
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,545
Things you might find in a Google search
to help you get more familiar with

16
00:00:47,545 --> 00:00:48,148
Backbone.

17
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:51,455
Spend the time to really
go through each resource.

18
00:00:51,455 --> 00:00:55,275
Now, trust me on this, these
resources will help you get better.

19
00:00:55,275 --> 00:00:57,935
I've read them all myself and
they're all pretty good.

20
00:00:57,935 --> 00:00:59,075
Also, don't rush.

21
00:00:59,075 --> 00:01:01,455
You'll be spending between 30 and
90 minutes on each one.

22
00:01:02,505 --> 00:01:03,315
For each resource,

23
00:01:03,315 --> 00:01:07,245
we also will give you the opportunity
to engage with your peers.

24
00:01:07,245 --> 00:01:09,265
Ask an answer each other's questions.

25
00:01:09,265 --> 00:01:13,315
Teaching is another incredible way
to solidify your own knowledge, so

26
00:01:13,315 --> 00:01:14,920
help each other out.

27
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,040
Once you're done with these resources
you'll be in a great place to tackle

28
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,560
your next project.

29
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,550
Now let's dive into those resources.
