1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,960
To build a great gaming community,

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,240
you might also want to involve your
players in the game creation process.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,060
>> Yeah, for our ball game I'm kind
of stuck on ways to improve it.

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,940
I can only get so
far by adding more rings of fire.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,820
Where else do you think I should do?

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,970
>> Well, you could add multiple
balls of different sizes, and

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,140
I'm kind of getting tired
of the rings of fire.

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,326
What about including different obstacles
like maybe walls that you want to avoid?

9
00:00:24,326 --> 00:00:26,820
>> Those are great ideas,
thanks for your feedback.

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,240
>> I'm happy to help.

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,210
>> None of us knows how to
build the perfect game.

12
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,040
But by listening to our players and
getting their feedback, you can

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,630
improve your game, and your players
will know that their input is valued.

14
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,220
So what are some ways that we can
include feedback in the game app?

15
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,170
>> There a couple of meaningful
ways to get feedback.

16
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,575
Most apps just use reviews and
ratings, but

17
00:00:45,575 --> 00:00:48,435
you could also add in-app
messaging systems.

18
00:00:48,435 --> 00:00:50,060
Surveys, forums and

19
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,620
whatever else you want to get to
increase player participation.

20
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,730
Recently, game developers
are actually inviting

21
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,140
fans to watch them on Twitch
as they're building the game.

22
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,506
This is really cool because developers
can get real time feedback from

23
00:01:04,506 --> 00:01:05,843
potential players.

24
00:01:05,843 --> 00:01:10,134
>> One great example of a strong gaming
and player community is the one for

25
00:01:10,134 --> 00:01:11,380
League of Legends.

26
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,220
League of Legends gets feedback from
players from direct messages and

27
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,790
from forums.

28
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,450
The game has great graphics and has
a number of strong social components.

29
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,881
Players can chat with one another,
teams compete.

30
00:01:25,881 --> 00:01:28,783
And there are even tournaments
watched throughout the world between

31
00:01:28,783 --> 00:01:30,710
the strongest players.

32
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:34,150
And with such involved players,
this game makes a lot of money

33
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:38,180
off of in-app purchases that let players
personalize their experience and

34
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,259
enhance their gameplay.

35
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,340
Lots of players get so

36
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,300
involved that they even create
fan art based off of the game.
