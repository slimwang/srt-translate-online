00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,737
Based on this long division we just did then, we can see that we divide x cubed

2
00:00:04,737 --> 00:00:11,729
minus 4x squared plus x plus 6, by x minus 2, we get what we wrote up here. x

3
00:00:11,729 --> 00:00:15,496
squared minus 2x minus 3. I wonder then, if there's a new way that we can write

4
00:00:15,496 --> 00:00:19,516
this original expression, the one we started out with. So, think about what we

5
00:00:19,516 --> 00:00:22,996
could do to both sides of this equation right here, to get our original

6
00:00:22,996 --> 00:00:28,476
expression, the cubic polynomial, by itself on the left hand side. What that

7
00:00:28,476 --> 00:00:31,220
would be on the right hand side of the equation? This will be a new way of

8
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,833
expressing what we have on the left.
