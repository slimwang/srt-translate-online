1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,685
So, let's just go through these answers 1 by 1 to figure out which ones are

2
00:00:04,697 --> 00:00:09,771
correct. Starting off with 2z, we see that this is something that is multiplied

3
00:00:09,783 --> 00:00:14,648
by 5x and by 7y in order to equal this term. So, this is definitely a radiance

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:19,270
here. Now when we look at 5, we need to remember, again. Invisible

5
00:00:19,282 --> 00:00:25,515
multiplication sign between the 5 and the x. If we multiply 5 by x and 7y and

6
00:00:25,527 --> 00:00:31,740
2z, then we get this whole term. So 5 is also a factor. Now 1 is where things

7
00:00:31,752 --> 00:00:37,605
get a little bit tricky and if you miss this one Not a big deal. This actually

8
00:00:37,617 --> 00:00:42,235
is a factor of this term, and actually, of any term. The reason that 1 is a

9
00:00:42,247 --> 00:00:46,860
factor for any term we might have, whether it's a number or a variable, is

10
00:00:46,872 --> 00:00:51,555
because if you multiply 1 by that term itself, you will end up with the term

11
00:00:51,567 --> 00:00:56,345
that you're looking for. So in our case, the thing that we need to multiply 1

12
00:00:56,357 --> 00:01:01,398
by, in order to get 5x times 7y times 2z is just this term itself. I know that

13
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,828
might seem a little bit complicated right now, but you'll have plenty of

14
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,766
practice in the upcoming quizzes, to sort this all out. Bottom line, 1 is always

15
00:01:10,778 --> 00:01:15,696
a factor. Now at first you might think that 0 is similar to 1 in this way. But 0

16
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:20,606
is actually not a factor here. We can't divide this expression by 0. That would

17
00:01:20,618 --> 00:01:25,422
actually give us a solution that we don't know how to interpret right now. And

18
00:01:25,434 --> 00:01:30,376
there's nothing that we can multiply by 0 in order to get this expression, since

19
00:01:30,388 --> 00:01:35,085
0 times anything is just equal to 0. So, 0 should not be checked off. We know

20
00:01:35,097 --> 00:01:39,420
that y is multiplied by 7. And also by 5X and 2Z to come up with this term. So

21
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:43,350
we should check that one off as well, and X works in the same way so we've

22
00:01:43,362 --> 00:01:47,735
checked everything off except for the 0. That was great, I know that factors are

23
00:01:47,747 --> 00:01:52,490
alittle bit trickier than terms so I hope that this vocabulary is starting to

24
00:01:52,502 --> 00:01:56,175
make a little bit more sense. We'll keep using it really frequently.
