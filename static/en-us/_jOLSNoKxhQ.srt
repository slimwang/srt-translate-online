1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,080
A quick fix for this is to be much more explicit in how we want to format our

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,780
dates, rather than using some intelligent default that Dimple chooses.

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,280
Going back to our editor, a quick fix for

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,630
this problem is to simply add a date parts format to our x-axis.

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,090
In this case, setting it to % capital Y.

6
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,440
And while these strings might seem mysterious,

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,890
it's actually an old Unix standard called strftime.

8
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:33,170
And most programming languages and libraries implement it.

9
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,900
So if you ever worked with a date in another language, such as R or

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,220
Python, this should seem familiar.

11
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:44,060
What this line tells us is to parse the date on the x axis,

12
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:48,094
which corresponds to year according to this format, %Y.

13
00:00:48,094 --> 00:00:51,415
%Y actually stands for

14
00:00:51,415 --> 00:00:56,646
a four digit year, for example, 1966, 1970, and

15
00:00:56,646 --> 00:01:03,080
there's many other ways to interpret your dates.

16
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,080
But I don't want to spend time now going over every possible way

17
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,840
to use this STRF time string.

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,340
So I've left a cheat sheet in the instructor note, and if we refresh

19
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,250
our page now, you'll notice that as we hover over any bar the dates are correct.

20
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,870
In this case 1962, in this case 1966.

21
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:29,790
One quirk of this is that there's stale placed at the first of the year,

22
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:35,260
in this case January 1st, which isn't the exact date the gain was at.

23
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:39,100
Or this World Cup was held, since most of them happen in the summers.

24
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,690
But for simplicity, let's not worry about this.

25
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,620
And as long as we have the year, that's all we're interested in.
