The answer is, it print jello on one line, and then hello on the next line. On

2
00:00:06,685 --> 00:00:11,270
the second line, when we just print out greeting, we can see that it hasn't

3
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:17,000
changed from the original. We say that it didn't mutate. Instead of modifying

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,920
the original string, the replace method returns a new one. This would be like

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,260
if you had a mean cat and you told your cat to be nicer. And instead of

6
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:30,230
becoming nicer, it just gave you a new, nicer cat. That's why we call replace

7
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,470
an accessor method, not a mutator.
