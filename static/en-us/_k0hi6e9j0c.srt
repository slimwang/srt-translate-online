1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,520
So let's say you found a font
that looks great on a bunch of

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,870
different screen resolutions and
different sizes, and even better,

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,870
it doesn't detract from
the overall theme of your app.

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,250
How would you use it?

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:16,650
So here's a small app that I
did to show you the different

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,790
typographical sizes that are available
in Android and their names.

7
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,280
Now, right now they're all
using the Roboto font.

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,220
Let's go and change that.

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,870
So here's the app that
we were just looking at.

10
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,020
So if you want to add your own font,
the first thing that you will need to do

11
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,560
is add an assets directory
under source main.

12
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:44,220
And we've included our font,
which is Courgette-Regular.

13
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,720
It was just a font that I
found on Google web fonts,

14
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,520
because most of them are available
with open source licenses.

15
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,550
So if we switch over to the Android
view, it will show up as assets and

16
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:58,140
resurrectory.

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,050
But those are the same location,
so you might see one or

18
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,670
the other depending on how you
set up your Android Studio.

19
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,664
If you're using your font inside
a fragment, due to the fragment life

20
00:01:10,664 --> 00:01:16,300
cycle, you need to instantiate
the type face in the onAttach method.

21
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,450
The reason for
this is there's a short period of time

22
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:24,690
after a fragment is created, but
before it's attached to a host activity.

23
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:29,560
So, if you can see in this
Typeface.createFromAsset function,

24
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,820
we have getActivity and then getAssets.

25
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,340
If this is called before it's
attached to the activity,

26
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,320
it will result in an error.

27
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,810
So, if we go to our onCreate method,
after instantiating our text views,

28
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:50,860
we just call the setTypeface function
with the object that we just created.

29
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,300
So if we look at this on a device,
we can see that our display4 and

30
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,830
our headlineView have changed.

31
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,100
So this is our display4 here, and

32
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,040
then if we scroll up a bit,
right here is our headline.
