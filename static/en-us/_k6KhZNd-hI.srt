1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:05,209
Well, we'd get 12r plus 3k for the numerator, and 12r minus 3k for the

2
00:00:05,209 --> 00:00:10,020
denominator. Nice algebraic skills if you got these two correct. If this gave

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,044
you some trouble, that's totally okay. Let's see how we can distribute this kr

4
00:00:14,044 --> 00:00:18,665
to each of these terms. If we distribute kr to each of these terms, we can see

5
00:00:18,665 --> 00:00:22,814
that we'll have this complex fraction. Now we need to simplify the

6
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:27,073
multiplication for each term. Some students are really great at doing it in

7
00:00:27,073 --> 00:00:31,349
their head from this step. Though, sometimes I think it's better to show this,

8
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,003
so you can really see which factors are cancelling in a numerator and a

9
00:00:35,003 --> 00:00:39,113
denominator. For example, we can see that k divided by k equals 1 here, r

10
00:00:39,113 --> 00:00:43,996
divided by r equals 1 here, and we repeat that process in our denominator. So

11
00:00:43,996 --> 00:00:51,818
we're left with 12 times r, or 12r, plus 3 times k, or 3k. For the denominator,

12
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:57,160
we're left with 12 times r minus 3 times k. Then, we should always ask ourselves

13
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,050
if we can simplify our answer. I've rewritten it here so we can see it better.

14
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,122
We don't want to make the mistake that this fraction equals 1. We have addition

15
00:01:05,122 --> 00:01:09,834
here, and subtraction here. Also, these are not opposite polynomials, so this

16
00:01:09,834 --> 00:01:15,518
fraction doesn't reduce to negative 1. The coefficient of r is positive 12 here,

17
00:01:15,518 --> 00:01:20,531
and positive 12 here. But, we can see that this term and this term share a

18
00:01:20,531 --> 00:01:25,456
common factor of 3. The same is true here. We factor a positive 3 from the

19
00:01:25,456 --> 00:01:30,920
numerator and from the denominator. This leaves us with 4r plus k divided by the

20
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,427
quantity 4r minus k, our final fraction. After multiplying by the LCD over the

21
00:01:36,427 --> 00:01:41,911
LCD, we really want to check if we can simplify. Sometimes this isn't always our

22
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:43,003
final answer.
