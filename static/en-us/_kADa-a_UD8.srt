00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,428
So, influential people have high Klout scores like the president and Justin

2
00:00:04,428 --> 00:00:09,210
Bieber. Now, let's say we looked up the Klout scores of 35 people who use the

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,280
app Bieber Tweeter, which automatically retweets Justin Bieber whenever he

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,268
tweets anything. If you don't know, a tweet is a message that people write on

5
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:22,752
the social networking site Twitter. And the Klout score is partly based off of

6
00:00:22,752 --> 00:00:27,676
people's Twitter activity. So, let's say that the average Klout score of these

7
00:00:27,676 --> 00:00:33,872
people is 40. Where does this mean fall on the distribution of sample means for

8
00:00:33,872 --> 00:00:39,714
other samples of size 35? So, just to recap, you found that the standard

9
00:00:39,714 --> 00:00:46,288
deviation of this distribution is 2.71. So, how many standard deviations above

10
00:00:46,288 --> 00:00:50,258
the mean of this distribution does this mean lie?
