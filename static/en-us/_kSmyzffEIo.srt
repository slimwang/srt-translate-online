1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,020
Now that we've configured
our repositories,

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:06,550
we can define dependencies on artifacts
contained in those repositories.

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,905
Dependencies that are resolved from
repositories are referred to as external

4
00:00:09,905 --> 00:00:10,935
module dependencies.

5
00:00:10,935 --> 00:00:13,622
Dependencies are assigned
to configurations.

6
00:00:13,622 --> 00:00:17,031
We'll talk more about configurations
in detail later, but for

7
00:00:17,031 --> 00:00:21,195
now you can simply consider them to
be groups of related dependencies.

8
00:00:21,195 --> 00:00:23,750
For the examples here,
we'll be adding dependencies to

9
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,670
the compile configuration,
which is added by the Java plugin.

10
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,050
Dependencies are configured in
the dependencies script block.

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,700
The syntax used is the name of
the configuration we want to add

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,250
the dependency to followed
by a dependency notation.

13
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,050
We can also use a Groovy map syntax
to identify dependencies, again,

14
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,630
by their group,
their name and their version.

15
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:47,480
In some cases, we simply have files
we want to add as dependencies.

16
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,070
File dependencies are declared very
similarly to manage dependencies,

17
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,760
however instead of a dependency notation
we simply use a file collection or

18
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,050
a file tree.

19
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,400
In this example, we are simply
adding two JAR files as dependencies

20
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,580
by creating a file collection.

21
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,570
We can also use a file tree,

22
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,580
which allows us to do things
like specify filters.

23
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,970
This is useful for including a number
of files within a directory.

24
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:13,920
Gradle also supports project
dependencies, which are dependencies on

25
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,440
other Gradle projects within
a single multi-project build.

26
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,300
We'll talk more about
multi-project builds and

27
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,060
project dependencies in the next lesson.
