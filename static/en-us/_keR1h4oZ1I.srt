1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's check your knowledge of that with a multiple choice quiz.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Here a number of times I've written the sentence "George Orwell was really Eric Blair."

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You might think I've written it, say, 1984 times, but really, just four.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I hear if you repeat something like this enough, it becomes true.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What I'd like you to do is mark in this multiple multiple choice quiz

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
which of these will end up showing the world "really" in bold.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
They can show other words in bold, but I want to know that they'll show "really" in bold.
