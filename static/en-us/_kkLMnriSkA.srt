1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,040
Is this principle applicable
to a trusted computing base?

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,250
Such a system has to
be basically trusted.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,867
Everything that we want relies on
trust that we place in the system.

4
00:00:10,867 --> 00:00:16,475
So, is this useful for
a TCB is the question that we have here.

5
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:19,478
We obviously talked about this
principle being useful for

6
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:21,448
applications and services and so on.

7
00:00:21,448 --> 00:00:24,275
So here,
the question is that useful for TCB?
