1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,060
And I would argue it's unclear.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,910
I mean, there might be a pattern.

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:08,029
Maybe the songs that are like fall into this set over here.

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,000
And as a result this point is included.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,090
Maybe instead they fall under the set over here and as a result is excluded.

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,330
I can't quite tell, it looks complex.

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,150
But one thing I can tell by looking at data like this.

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,760
They are also called scatter plot.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,980
I can learn a whole lot about my preferences and

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,100
possible results even before applying machine learning.
