1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,720
So the mediator, is essentially like watching over the, the height change of

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,490
the report and when that happens it will be reported to the mediator.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,650
And the mediator will make note of it.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,722
And then it will, I guess, request from the handle,

5
00:00:15,722 --> 00:00:22,490
its new position and of proportion based on that resizing.

6
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,590
And then, it will then go to the file manager because this has changed and

7
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,530
request for the new lines to be passed on to the b port.

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,800
Mediator is, is a very object oriented solution.

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,780
That is, there's an object responsible for that invariant, okay?

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,870
And you could imagine at,

11
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,780
at run time introducing new invariants and turning them on and off, and so on.

12
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:52,100
Because essentially associated with, with an object.

13
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:57,350
Okay? In our case the text browser we had three invariants to maintain.

14
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,140
We would have three mediators.

15
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,800
Each one of them would express the knowledge or

16
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,510
implement the knowledge having to do with updating that particular invariant.
