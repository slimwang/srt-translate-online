00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's start with the first one--let's try some experiments and I want to encourage you

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
to do all the experiments you can think of to try to answer a question about set.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And the quizzes that we're going to have, some of them in this unit are different

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
from the kind of quizzes that you had in CS101.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
All those quizzes were meant to be ones that you could answer based on what had been covered,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
but realize it's not like that.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
These problems you face don't follow directly from previously covered content.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Many of the course in this unit will be different, that you'll need to do some experiments

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
on your own, may be do some web searches, may be read some documents

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
to try to figure out how to answer them.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Then I'll talk about how I would find the answer to that question when I discussed the answer

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
not so much what the answer is but more importantly how do you find it.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The question is, is the result of set x or x as a list a mutable object or an immutable object,

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and you should remember that mutable objects are objects whose value can change

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
like list in dictionaries.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Immutable objects are objects whose value doesn't change like integers and strengths.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What's the result of set x.
