Natural selection has caused drastic physical changes in human evolution.

2
00:00:04,615 --> 00:00:09,479
Including the ability to walk upright, the development of skin with far less

3
00:00:09,479 --> 00:00:16,032
hair, and most importantly, the growth of a very large brain. Of course, the

4
00:00:16,032 --> 00:00:22,044
evolution of a larger brain has many benefits. But it also has many costs. So,

5
00:00:22,044 --> 00:00:25,524
here's a question, what are some of the physical costs of having a bigger

6
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:30,973
brain? The ability to store decades worth of information. The need for more

7
00:00:30,973 --> 00:00:36,190
food or energy. Childbirth becoming more painful because of bigger heads. Or,

8
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,749
problem solving skills begin to develop. Go ahead and check any and all that

9
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,339
you think apply.
