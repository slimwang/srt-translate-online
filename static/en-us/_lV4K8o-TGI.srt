1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,900
Well the answer here is clearly d, and the reason is, is that basically when I

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:10,030
move my camera, since essentially cap X, capital X,

3
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,200
capital Z don't change, all right?

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,600
Where the image, where the point of the moon lands on my,

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,060
on my image plane, it doesn't change either.

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,480
Now it'll change if I rotate, of course, but

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,700
we're just talking about translating.

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,294
Now, pretty soon I'll translate right out of the field of view and

9
00:00:26,294 --> 00:00:28,582
Megan's going to get unhappy because I'm going to come back here.

10
00:00:28,582 --> 00:00:31,062
But if you've ever been driving along and you see the moon and

11
00:00:31,062 --> 00:00:32,729
it just sort of follows you, okay?

12
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:34,902
That's because the X and Z,

13
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:37,560
well the Z's not changing at all if I'm going this way.

14
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,150
And the X is changing maybe by miles, okay?

15
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,310
But the moon is, what is it?

16
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,560
It's like 200, I don't know.

17
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,300
It's really, really far away.

18
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,100
Somebody look up the, the, I think it's a quarter million miles,

19
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:48,720
something like that.

20
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,200
Anyway, a lot's, lot, a lot shorter than the distance between here and Roswell.

21
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,320
So, as I go all the way from here to Roswell, the X hardly changes,

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,100
the Z hardly changes, so where it appears on my image doesn't change.

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,150
And basically, this is why things that are very far away don't move as,

24
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:03,700
as I move.

25
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,230
The only thing that matters are the angles, so this is true for the sun or

26
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,750
the North Star or these kinds of things.

27
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,390
And that's, and, and it's because of this perspective projection.
