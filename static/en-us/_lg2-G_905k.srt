It turns out that we subtract the exponents. We do a minus b. We can see that in

2
00:00:05,448 --> 00:00:10,396
the first example, we have 3 to the 4th divided by 3 squared. So 3 to the 4

3
00:00:10,396 --> 00:00:15,514
minus 2, or 3 squared. The same is true for f. We have 8 minus 5, or f cubed.

4
00:00:15,514 --> 00:00:21,100
For the last one, we leave our numbers in the front as a fraction, and then we

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:26,238
have w to the 8 minus 3, or w to the 5th. We saw the fraction was reduced to 2

6
00:00:26,238 --> 00:00:28,523
3rds. This gave us our final result.
