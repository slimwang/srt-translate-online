00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,051
We talked to Keith Smiley, an iOS
engineer from Lyft, and Izmir Sing,

2
00:00:04,051 --> 00:00:05,639
an iOS engineer from Venmill,

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:10,128
about what it was like to migrate
their apps from Objective-C to Swift.

4
00:00:10,128 --> 00:00:13,090
Keith and Izmir are intimately
familiar with the challenges and

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:16,710
triumphs of achieving interoperability
between the two languages.

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,200
So we asked them about the problems
they encountered most frequently.

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,950
To wrap things up, in Lesson 6 we'll
review the most common challenges for

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:28,780
interoperability between the languages
of iOS, and you'll complete a set of

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,330
coding challenges to sharpen
your interop skills.
