1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,230
Since the side bar will appear
on every page of the site,

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,630
a new entry in the router isn't needed.

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,130
A template absolutely needs to be made.

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,600
Remember that a template
is a bit of html.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,480
The sidebar will need html, so
we should create a sidebar template.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,020
We won't need a service since this
new feature won't be used anywhere

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,560
else on the site.

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,500
We will need a controller though.

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,240
Remember that a controller sets
the initial state for a view.

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,060
What will the deal of the day item be?

11
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,140
Will it have a description or a price?

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,390
All of that information will be
stored in the controller and

13
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,650
passed to the template to be displayed.

14
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,560
A module is a container for
all of these things.

15
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,230
Since we just need a sidebar feature,
we don't need a unique module.
