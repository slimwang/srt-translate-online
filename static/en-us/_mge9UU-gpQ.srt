1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,160
Okay, so to change this logo
to the new one, the white one,

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,610
we'll need to select this element and
then change the source attribute.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,160
We'll start with our D3
select statement, and

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,720
we'll use the header logo ID to
select the parent element A tag.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,590
And then we'll pass on the image
to select the nested image below.

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,902
We want to change the attribute and
in particular,

7
00:00:23,902 --> 00:00:29,860
the source attribute will change
it to assets/udacitywhite.png.

8
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,520
And sure enough, our logo changed.

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,410
Note there were slough of other answers
here, so if you did something else and

10
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,300
it worked, great work.

11
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,870
Just keep in mind how many
different selectors or

12
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,660
how complicated your
selection syntax is.

13
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,480
Usually the more simple you can make it,
then the easier will be for

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,990
others to understand
what you're trying to do.

15
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,950
A couple other solutions
are included here.

16
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,920
You might have used
the class of navbar-brand,

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,760
and then selected the image,
that would've worked.

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,010
Or you might have used
the class of logo, and

19
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,530
then selected the image,
that would work as well.

20
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,010
And as some additional information,
you're also able to include the HTML tag

21
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,700
name before the class or
the ID name in order to select it.

22
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,400
So we could've added a in
front of the logo class, and

23
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,680
selected our child image tag.

24
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,414
The same would've worked for
the class navbar-brand.
