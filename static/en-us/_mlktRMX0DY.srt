00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,660
At this point many of you have probably
fixed the problem in the break

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,950
point debugging scene.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,180
I'm referring to the one
where when we tap,

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,570
way too many bugs
are appearing on the screen.

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,870
So if you haven't fixed the bug,
even if you've already fixed the bug.

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:13,640
It's okay.

7
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,270
I want you to take a moment and use your
new skills of the new things that we've

8
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,990
gone over with Breakpoint actions
to find and fix the problem.

9
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,370
Or think about how you would've
found and fixed the problem.

10
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,090
And once it's resolved, check this box.
