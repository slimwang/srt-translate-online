00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,602
We actually worked through a problem pretty similar to this at the end of the

2
00:00:03,602 --> 00:00:07,592
previous lesson. It was a different equation, and the leading coefficient was 1,

3
00:00:07,592 --> 00:00:11,362
so things were a little bit simpler, but the same sort of technique that we used

4
00:00:11,362 --> 00:00:15,285
there applies here. I'd like you to complete the square, with the expression on

5
00:00:15,285 --> 00:00:18,705
the left side of the equation, and to get this equation to the point where

6
00:00:18,705 --> 00:00:22,410
there's a non-zero integer on the right-hand side, and a term with our perfect

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,180
square in it on the left hand side.
