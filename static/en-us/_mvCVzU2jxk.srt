00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,310
Now that you've got the files and folder setup that you'll be working with,

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,640
how are you going to actually write the CSS to define your framework?

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,940
I suggested using a 12 column grid because it's really easy to create all of

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,980
the columns that you need, but what else do you think you'll need to define?

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,160
Well you'll need to create a CSS class that includes a row of 100% page width,

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,970
a CSS class for a row of one-twelfth of the page width.

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,790
Remember, 12 here is coming from the number of columns.

8
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:30,710
Will we only need to create one column class of one-twelfths of the page width,

9
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,250
to define our columns.

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,360
Will we need to create multiple columns of everything between 1 over 12 and

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,420
12 over 12 page widths.

12
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:43,366
That means we'll need to create a column class for 1 over 12 page widths, 1 for

13
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:47,236
2 over 12 page widths, 1 for 3 over 12 page widths, 1 for

14
00:00:47,236 --> 00:00:51,822
4 over 12 page widths and so on, or will we only need to create columns of 2

15
00:00:51,822 --> 00:00:57,060
over 12, 3 over 12 and 4 over 12 page widths to create our framework.

16
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,490
Oh and by the way,

17
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:03,300
the reason I put these dots here is because when you're writing CSS you'll need

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,680
to identify that something is a class by putting a dot in front of it.

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,830
So it's good to get used to that notation now.

20
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:12,420
Think about this question, and when you're done check all that apply.
