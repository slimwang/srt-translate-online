When thinking about an expression that includes an exponent, let's start with

2
00:00:04,429 --> 00:00:08,650
one of these squares. I have a 2 by 2 square. I know I can write 2 times 2 as 2

3
00:00:08,662 --> 00:00:12,957
squared, but, I don't have one square in my book of stamps, I have five, so, I

4
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:17,189
need to multiply this by 5. This would be the amount of stamps on one book of

5
00:00:17,201 --> 00:00:21,970
stamps, but I have two books of stamps. So, we multiply this expression by 2. If

6
00:00:21,982 --> 00:00:26,225
you chose the first one, nice work. This was a pretty tough quiz, so just hang

7
00:00:26,237 --> 00:00:29,680
in there and keep trying with these order of operation problems.
