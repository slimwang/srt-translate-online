1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:05,270
HTTPS helps prevent intruders from
tampering with the communication

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:09,210
between your progressive web app and
your user's browser.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,960
It's also a stricter requirement
to use service workers.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,440
Your app must be served over HTTPS in
order to register a service worker.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,490
And many older APIs that may reveal
sensitive data are being updated

6
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:30,090
to require HTTPS, such as the geo
location API and gate user media.

7
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,500
For deploying your weather app,
there are a number of options.

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,430
You can add HTTPS to your own server.

9
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,560
There's a great source free
certificates in the instructor notes.

10
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:47,660
Or you can use one of the hosting
providers that offer HTTPS by default.

11
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:53,580
GitHub pages and Firebase both
support static hosting over HTTPS.

12
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,860
And the Google Cloud
platform offers app engine.

13
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,400
Which can support HTTPS and is useful
if you need any back end logic.

14
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,280
One thing I really like
about Firebase's hosting

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,310
is that it redirects
all requests to HTTPS.

16
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:13,033
Even if a user types in HTTP://,

17
00:01:13,033 --> 00:01:17,900
it will automatically
redirect to the secure url.

18
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,310
Lets walk through the steps
to deploy the Firebase.

19
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:25,570
I've already created my account and
added a new project.

20
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:29,540
And I've already installed
the Firebase command line tools.

21
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,920
If you haven't worked with Firebase
before, check out the link to

22
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,890
the hosting docs in the instructor notes
for a quick getting starting guide.

23
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,640
First, I need to authenticate to
the Firebase command line tool

24
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,010
using Firebase login.

25
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:49,300
Next I need to initialize my Firebase
app by running Firebase init.

26
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,580
I'll give it the app name
that it should deploy to,

27
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,740
the directory I want it to upload and
so forth.

28
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:01,590
Finally, I can run Firebase deploy and
it will upload everything to Firebase.

29
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,080
Let's give it a try.

30
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,040
&gt;&gt; If you haven't worked with Firebase
before, check the link to the hosting

31
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,280
docks and the instructor notes for
a quick getting started guide.

32
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,387
First, I need to authenticate
the Firebase command line

33
00:02:14,387 --> 00:02:16,050
using Firebase log in.

34
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,730
Great, success.

35
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:22,790
Next, I need to initialize my
Firebase up by running Firebase init.

36
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,280
I'll give it the name of
the app it should use.

37
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,390
The directory I wanted to upload and
so forth.

38
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:32,860
Finally, I can run Firebase,
deploy and it'll upload everything.

39
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,740
Let's give it a try.

40
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,860
Looks perfect.

41
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,690
&gt;&gt; Perfect.

42
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,190
Seems like everything
worked exactly as I expect
