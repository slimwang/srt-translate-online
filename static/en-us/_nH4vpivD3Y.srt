1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,190
It's typically regarded as
a best practice that you not

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:04,590
use the SU command.

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:05,390
Why?

4
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,039
The rule of least privilege
that we discussed earlier.

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,930
Do you really need to switch your entire
working context over to the root user

6
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,880
to run a single, or
even a few, commands?

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,367
What happens if you forget that
you are currently within SU?

8
00:00:18,367 --> 00:00:21,602
You could potentially do some
extremely damaging operations, and

9
00:00:21,602 --> 00:00:24,220
there's no safety net there
to warn you when doing so.

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,340
Now, not every user has the ability
to work as the superuser.

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,689
You have to give that user
those permissions specifically.

12
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:35,470
We'll cover that in more detail
when we start adding new users.

13
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,220
For now, you know how to perform
operations as the root user, and that's

14
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:44,670
all we need to start managing software
known as packages on this machine.

15
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,690
So let's dive into that a bit.
