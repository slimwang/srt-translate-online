The question is asking you to differentiate

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,780
between pointers in in Modula-3 and pointers

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:12,750
in C. And the choices I have for you are, there are no differences between

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,370
pointers in a language like Modula-3 and

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:19,062
C, C pointers are more restricted, or Modula-3

6
00:00:19,062 --> 00:00:21,590
pointers are type-specific. So these are the

7
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,390
three choices. And one right choice. Good luck.
