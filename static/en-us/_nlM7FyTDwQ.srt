We haven't talked about graphs at all, so let's think about them for a minute.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,173
How do you think graphs of logarithmeic functions of different bases relate to

3
00:00:08,173 --> 00:00:12,980
one another? Well, here's just an example, but this line right here shows the

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:20,840
graph of Y equals log base 10 of X. And this one shows Y equals log base 2 of

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,560
X. Since we've been talking about change of base so much. How about we try to

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,640
convert log base two of X to an expression with log base 10? How would you

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,689
rewrite this with this change of base?
