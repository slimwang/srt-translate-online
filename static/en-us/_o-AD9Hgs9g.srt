1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,820
So an important consideration
in what we're doing here

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,050
is that our state is a single number.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,850
It's an integer.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,660
That way we can address
it in our cue table.

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,620
It is certainly the case that some
reinforcement learning methods

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,300
are able to treat the state
as a continuous value.

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,970
But just to get started here,
let's use state as an integer so

8
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,560
we can work more easily with the data.

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,220
Now we have to do a little bit of work
to get our state to an integer and

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,380
here is the general way to do it.

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,060
Our first step is to
discretize each factor.

12
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,240
It's a weird word,
I'll explain it in a moment.

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,696
But it essentially means convert
that real number into an integer.

14
00:00:43,696 --> 00:00:48,021
Next is combine all of those integers
together into a single number.

15
00:00:48,021 --> 00:00:51,632
We're assuming that we're using
a discrete state space and

16
00:00:51,632 --> 00:00:55,948
that means more or less that our overall
state is going to be this one integer

17
00:00:55,948 --> 00:00:59,390
that represents at once
all of our factors.

18
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:03,760
So consider that we have four factors
and each one is a real number.

19
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,500
Now we have separately beforehand

20
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,610
figured out how to discretize
each one of these factors.

21
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:16,530
So we run each of these factors through
their individual discretizers and

22
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,600
we get an integer.

23
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,620
Now I've happened to select
integers between 0 and 9 but

24
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:31,160
you can have larger ranges, for
instance 0 to 20 or 0 to 100 even.

25
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,390
It's easy if we just go from 0
to 9 because then we can stack

26
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,420
them together into a number.

27
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:41,500
But it's not too hard to think of
algorithms will enable you to combine

28
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,650
larger ranges of integers together.

29
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,310
In this case we're just able to
stack them one after the other

30
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:51,630
into our overall discretized state.
