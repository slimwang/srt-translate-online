1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,775
So, let's look at the speed versus power

2
00:00:02,775 --> 00:00:06,028
versus weight versus cost quiz answer. We were

3
00:00:06,028 --> 00:00:07,884
asked, which one of these is the worst

4
00:00:07,884 --> 00:00:12,348
laptop processor? The crawlium, slowium, laptium, fastium, hotium, and

5
00:00:12,348 --> 00:00:15,408
burnium, where performance is growing, the but the

6
00:00:15,408 --> 00:00:18,672
battery life is decreasing, the weight is growing, and

7
00:00:18,672 --> 00:00:21,910
the cost is growing. Well, most of these

8
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,950
are actually not very good processors. Laptium seems reasonable.

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,302
It gives you good performance. Five hour battery life is

10
00:00:29,302 --> 00:00:32,216
not too bad, four ounces for the processor you can build

11
00:00:32,216 --> 00:00:35,390
a laptop with that, and about $100 for the processor.

12
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,100
The laptop will probably be about $1,000, so that's fine. Going

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,940
with the slowium, it's not too bad. It's going to be

14
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,880
half as fast. But you can still do a lot of

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,104
things with it. It gives you excellent battery life. Possibly even

16
00:00:48,104 --> 00:00:51,062
a lighter laptop, and it's going to be cheap. So, these two

17
00:00:51,062 --> 00:00:55,570
are probably reasonable laptop processors. Fastium is a lot

18
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,630
faster. Very little battery life. You'll probably have to keep

19
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,970
it plugged in. It's relatively heavy, so this is

20
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,660
going to be a very heavy laptop. And it's going to be

21
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,910
more expensive, but it's still not an unreasonable laptop.

22
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,046
So clearly, the designs in the middle are actually better

23
00:01:10,046 --> 00:01:13,544
laptop processors than the ones on the extremes. So, we

24
00:01:13,544 --> 00:01:16,360
really have to do, is decide whether the Crawlium or

25
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,800
the Burnium is the worst laptop processor. Here we have

26
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,400
something that is about one tenth of a performance of

27
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,110
a reasonable laptop processor. Extremely good battery life. Probably you

28
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,780
could make this as big as a cell phone, and

29
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,738
very, very cheap. So, this is not such a bad

30
00:01:32,738 --> 00:01:35,300
processor. There are still things you can do with it,

31
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,510
and some people might want a lot of this, of

32
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:41,404
this kind. In contrast, here we have something that has

33
00:01:41,404 --> 00:01:44,900
four times the performance of the Laptium. The

34
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,700
battery life of all of two minutes. 20 pounds

35
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,930
for the processor including the heat sink and

36
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,386
so on. So, probably this is not really going to

37
00:01:53,386 --> 00:01:56,480
be portable. And it's going to be extremely, extremely

38
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,812
expensive. So, as you can see, the highest performance

39
00:02:00,812 --> 00:02:04,960
processor here is actually the worst laptop processor.

40
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,030
So as you can see, between the crawlium and

41
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:11,240
the burnium, here we have something that is very slow but also very light and

42
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,511
has a long battery life. Which is

43
00:02:13,511 --> 00:02:17,307
probably better than having something that is significantly

44
00:02:17,307 --> 00:02:20,008
faster with almost no battery life, spinal

45
00:02:20,008 --> 00:02:23,731
injuries from carrying it around and extremely expensive,

46
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:28,980
so when you drop it, you drop $15,000 worth of laptop. And you will drop it.
