You've already seen what the graph of x cubed looks like. So if we made the

2
00:00:04,198 --> 00:00:07,614
coefficient at the front of the term 3 instead of 1 but keep it positive the

3
00:00:07,614 --> 00:00:12,809
overall behavior will still be the same. It's still going to start low on the

4
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:18,240
left and reach up way high on the right. Since 5 x to the 4th times x squared

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,662
has an even degree. We know that the left and right side are going to point in

6
00:00:22,662 --> 00:00:26,296
the same direction. Since the leading coefficient is positive it's going to

7
00:00:26,296 --> 00:00:29,818
start way up high on the left hand side. And then also rise up high on the

8
00:00:29,818 --> 00:00:33,737
right hand side. For this function with a negative 2 x to the 5th, since the

9
00:00:33,737 --> 00:00:38,872
degree is odd the ends are going to point in opposite directions. And since

10
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,732
this leading coefficient is negative, it's going to start up high on the left,

11
00:00:41,732 --> 00:00:44,830
and reach way down low on the right.
