1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's get back stereo rig.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We have two pinholes with a known focal length f,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and we wish to recover the depth z of a point p.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We happen to know that the projection of p on the two image planes is somewhat different.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Over here we call it x1 for the first imager.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Over here we call it x2 for the second imager.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The question is what is the formula that allows us to look at this rig over here

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
with two images with a known baseline b to recover the depth z

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
from the relative displacements x1 and x2.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
There happens to be a relatively simple answer.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
If you look at this big triangle over here, that triangle has the same proportions

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and the triangle put together by this little thing over here and this thing over here.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You move these two triangles over here together into a single triangle.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It looks like this.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The proportions of this triangle over here are the same

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
as the proportions of this triangle over here.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Specifically, the length back here is x2 minus x1.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This distance over here is f, the length over here in the baseline b,

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and this length over here is the unknown depth z.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If we transform this and solve it for z,

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
we get z equals f times b over x2 minus x1.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
If we look at the relative displacement of a point in these two different camera images,

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
which is x2 minus x1, you'll find the the actual depth is inversely proportional,

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
but in this case linearly with the focal length f and the baseline b.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
These are all things we know. The baseline and the focal length are constants.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
They're called intrinsics.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
These are measurements, and from this we can actually recover the real depth.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's just try to practice this.
