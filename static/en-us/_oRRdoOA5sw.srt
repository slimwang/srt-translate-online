00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,530
Here's another company with a problem.

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:06,010
Swanky Chat is a start up that
makes communication software for

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:09,910
awesome people, but sometimes
their awesome users start sending

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,470
weird new messages that cause
their servers to crash.

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,840
Swanky Chat operations team calls
these messages of oncoming doom,

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,120
or MOODS for short.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,930
Ops tries to get the development
team to fix the mood bugs, but

8
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,990
the devs are usually busy
writing awesome new features.

9
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:31,580
So in order to keep the servers up, ops
puts an application level firewall in

10
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,170
place that filters the bad messages out.

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,950
That works just fine, but so

12
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:39,339
as a consequence, nobody worries
about the MOOD bug anymore.

13
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,750
But then the developers release
a new feature, Perky Soundtracks for

14
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,010
video chat, and it works great in
their development environment.

15
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,310
It's fast and it's awesome and
the QA testers even love it.

16
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,720
But when it launches in production,
it turns out that the firewall rule for

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,880
the MOOD messages also blocks
the traffic for the soundtracks, so

18
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,220
the new feature doesn't work at all and
the launch is a big flop.

19
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,880
Debugging it takes a long time, and

20
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,110
the next three feature
releases are all delayed.

21
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,540
So what do you think
are the causes of this problem?

22
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,870
Is it that the development and
production environments don't match?

23
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,540
The new releases aren't tested for
performance?

24
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,210
That a workaround relieved the pain and
hid the severity of a bug?

25
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,730
That firewalls are unreliable and
should never be used?

26
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,830
Or that the operation
staff should be fired and

27
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,840
replaced with more
developers to fix bugs?
