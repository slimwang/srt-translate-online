00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,506
The first step is to pull a factor of 10 out from each term. So, that gives us

2
00:00:04,506 --> 00:00:08,970
10 times x squared minus 3x minus 4. All we need to do now is factor what's

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,988
inside the parentheses here. When we do that, we get 10 times x minus 4 times x

4
00:00:13,988 --> 00:00:17,749
plus 1. Great, we are fully factored.
