Hi Michael.

2
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:02,060
>> Hey Charles. How's it going?

3
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,820
>> It is going quite well. Thank you very

4
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,250
much for asking. How are things going with you?

5
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,210
>> I can't complain because I've been barred by a, a judge.

6
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,820
>> [LAUGH] I'm pretty sure you can still complain. Complaining is a

7
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,030
fine art that requires lots of practice. Guess what we're going to do today?

8
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,120
>> I'm reading decision making and

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,880
reinforcement learning which is very exciting.

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,060
>> It is.

11
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:21,700
>> Except the hyphen.

12
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,620
>> Except for the hyphen?

13
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,500
>> Yeah the hyphens wrong.

14
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,250
>> Why?

15
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:25,460
>> because

16
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,430
it's not decision dash making.

17
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,280
>> You're right. I normally don't do that

18
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,850
but people always want to put a dash

19
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:31,990
so what I'm going to do is for your

20
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,150
Michael. Just for you. I'm going to remove the dash.

21
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,050
>> Thank you.

22
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,969
>> And I'm going to put it over here where it belongs.

23
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:43,720
>> [LAUGH] No. There. Well, Michael, this is

24
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,490
the first of our discussions on the last

25
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,830
mini course of machine learning, Reinforcement Learning, which

26
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,370
I believe you know a little bit about.

27
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:50,720
>> I

28
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,150
am very interested in Reinforcement Learning.

29
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,200
>> Excellent. So I'm just going to do

30
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,260
a little bit of background. It's going to

31
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,560
be relatively short and straight forward. We're

32
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,770
going to do a couple of quizzes, because

33
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,930
I know how much you like quizzes. And then we're just going to go back

34
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,180
and forth and see what we get to learn about Reinforcement Learning. Sound good?

35
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:04,938
>> Excellent.

36
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:07,470
>> Excellent, okay so, let's get started.
