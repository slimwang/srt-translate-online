1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Google app engine has a number of

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
different options for the types of the properties of an entity,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
or if we were to use our old verbiage,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
the columns of our table.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Some of the popular ones are

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
integer, which is for storing integers,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
float for storing floating point numbers,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
string for storing strings,

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and we've got a date for storing dates,

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
we've got time for storing times,

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and then we've got date times

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
for storing both dates and times.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
These are pretty handy.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
They even have properties that are things like

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
email, a link, a postal address.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
App engine has all sorts of handy types you can use.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So what I would like to do really quick

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
is have a little quiz.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,050
We are going to have a couple of properties on our art class.

20
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,250
Properties remember are basically what we have been calling columns.

21
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,120
We're going to have one for the title,

22
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,190
we're going to have 1 for the art,

23
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:02,530
and I'm going to have another one, I'm going to call it created,

24
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,330
and this is going to be when

25
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,170
the art was submitted to our site.

26
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,700
What I would like you to do is decide

27
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,700
which of these types we should use for

28
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,240
each of these properties,

29
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,240
and oh, by the way, this has turned into a quiz.
