00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,620
Earlier you learned that every element on the Wikipedia web page seemed to

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,940
be a box, even the completely not-rectangular images.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,000
But wait.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,380
How can everything be a box?

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,380
I mean, there are other shapes in the world like circles, right?

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,010
Well, that is very true.

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:23,220
On a website, something may look like a circle or

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,150
a triangle or something a little more irregular, but, in fact,

9
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:33,130
it's still just a box, it just looks like a circle.

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,200
Don't believe it?

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,880
Neither did I the first time.

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,140
Let's take a look at this demo site.

13
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:43,590
On this site we have three very nice circles, and we've even got a triangle.

14
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,050
I mean, these can't just be rectangles, right.

15
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,160
Or can they?

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,540
Right clicking on the first circle and

17
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,820
selecting inspect element brings up Google developer tools

18
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,530
in the exact location where the circle is located in the structure.

19
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,310
Wait.

20
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,556
What?

21
00:01:04,556 --> 00:01:07,470
My mind was just blown.

22
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,820
So, what exactly is going on here?

23
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,530
In this left panel we have the structure that we are already so

24
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:20,170
familiar with and this part seems to define our circle.

25
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:25,870
If I highlight this line in Developer tools it highlights a rectangular

26
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:31,700
shape on the page but where does the visible round shape come from?

27
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,660
I talked a little something about style earlier.

28
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:39,490
So the answer is probably in the style panel here on the right.

29
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:43,950
What you see here are the styles used to display the element selected in

30
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,010
the left panel.

31
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,980
The very cool thing is that you can change the style and

32
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,800
immediately see the result.

33
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:55,240
So, for example, maybe I don't want an even number of pixels for within height.

34
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,589
Maybe I want to change this 200 to 100.

35
00:01:58,589 --> 00:02:00,070
What happens?

36
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,690
Looks like we have more of an oval then a circle.

37
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,820
And, maybe, I don't like the color green.

38
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,008
But I don't know what color I want my circle to be.

39
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:14,900
If I click on this little color square, it brings up a selection tool,

40
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,860
where I can select any color in the visible spectrum.

41
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,020
Let's go with blue.

42
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,280
Now, go ahead, open this page.

43
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,750
The link is provided to you in the instructor notes section.

44
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,680
And play around with the style of the circles on your own.

45
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,070
Particularly, take a look at what happens if you uncheck the border radius

46
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:38,230
property and if at anytime you decide that your change has got a little

47
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,550
too crazy and you want to go back to normal, you can just refresh the page.

48
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,640
So, what did happen when you unchecked border radius?

49
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,940
Did the circle disappear?

50
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,820
Did the circle turn into a square?

51
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,820
Did the circle become smaller?

52
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,280
Or, did nothing happen?
