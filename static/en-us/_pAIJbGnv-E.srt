00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,000
All right, welcome back to Computer Vision.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,749
This is going to be our last lecture or lesson or

3
00:00:04,749 --> 00:00:07,375
whatever this is on frequency analysis.

4
00:00:07,375 --> 00:00:11,216
And I bet you're happy about that because it's kind of off in the ozone of

5
00:00:11,216 --> 00:00:14,098
mathematics and it's going to, hard to pull it back to

6
00:00:14,098 --> 00:00:18,030
the work that we'll be doing in terms of manipulating the images.

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,980
But it's important and in fact today we'll finally get to the,

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,704
what is coup de grace, piece de resistance my, my french is terrible.

9
00:00:24,704 --> 00:00:28,000
The fine, what I really wanted to get to is the notion of how

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,660
frequency explains the notion of aliasing.

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,237
So if you remember we've been talking about Fourier basis sets where we

12
00:00:34,237 --> 00:00:37,171
decompose things in terms of sinusoidal basis.

13
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:39,810
And this is a picture that we've been using to represent that.

14
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,010
And then we talked about the relationship between convolution in

15
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:47,080
the spacial domain giving you multiplication in the frequency domain.

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,310
And we showed it with the math here.

17
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:52,470
We said that if g was the convolution of some functions f and h,

18
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:57,040
that we could derive that convolution in the spacial domain was

19
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,730
multiplication in the frequency domain.

20
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,770
And that was shown like this.

21
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:05,160
And, by the way, then this is really important for today that

22
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:10,810
multiplication in the spacial domain is convolution in the frequency domain.

23
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:14,600
And you might ask, when do we ever multiply functions together.

24
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,210
>> When do ever multiply functions together?

25
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,260
>> Today.

26
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,570
It'll be some very special functions, but we'll do that today.

27
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,450
We also showed some Fourier pairs.

28
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,290
We talked about how the Fourier of a Gaussian is a another Gaussian.

29
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,230
We talked about an impulse is straight.

30
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,210
We spoke about the box filter giving you this sink thing that

31
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,665
explained ringing in that like.
