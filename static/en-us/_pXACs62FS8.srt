1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So the answer is: it prints out the numbers, from 1 to 10.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And if we follow through the code, we can see why.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So initially, the value of "i" is zero.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The test says, well "i" is not equal to 10,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
so zero is not equal to 10--

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
so we go through the Block,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and the Block adds 1 to "i".

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So that will change the value of "i".

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Now "i" refers to "1".

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And then the next statement prints the value of "i".

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The value of "i" now is 1, so it will print, "1".

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And then, because it's a while, we go back.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We do the test again--I'm not going to step through every time, so we keep doing this.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
As "i" gets bigger, we're going to keep going.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Eventually--let's say "i" is 9,

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and by the time "i" is 9--well, after "i" was 9--we print "9".

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So we've printed the numbers from 1 through 9.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
At this point, "i" is still not equal to 10,

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
so we still go through the loop body.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Now we add 1 to "i"--that will make the value of "i" 10.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Then we do the print, so that will print out, "10".

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Then we go back to the "while" test.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Now the value of "i" is 10, so: "i" not equal to 10--"10" not equal to 10--

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
is False, because 10 does equal 10.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That means we're done with the "while" loop

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and we're going to continue,

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
but there's nothing to continue with, so we're done.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So the net result of the code is printing the numbers from 1 to 10

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and that's all that happens.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So now the test is False.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We don't execute the Block anymore, we would continue with the next statement.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
There isn't one, so we're done

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and what the code did was print out the numbers from 1 to 10.
