Cognitive psychologists suggest that we use mental representations to represent

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:09,760
our knowledge, memories, or ideas in order to store and maintain our mental

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,489
processes. Mental representation is defined as a structure in our mind, such as

4
00:00:15,489 --> 00:00:20,720
an idea or image. That stands for something else. Such that an external object,

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,694
or things that was sensed in the past or future. But whatever it is, it's not

6
00:00:25,694 --> 00:00:30,012
something in the present. These mental representations, allow us to think about

7
00:00:30,012 --> 00:00:35,004
things that are abstract, and have no physical existence. Earlier in this

8
00:00:35,004 --> 00:00:39,600
lesson when we talked about language, we asked about love and passion. We can

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,816
also include things such as truth or justice, as abstract ideas that we can

10
00:00:43,816 --> 00:00:49,863
represent in our mind visually and verbally. So visual imagery involves visual

11
00:00:49,863 --> 00:00:54,285
representations created by the brain after the original stimulus is no longer

12
00:00:54,285 --> 00:00:59,360
present. Now if you recall, the visual system is mostly located in the

13
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,580
occipital occipital lobes. One interesting thing to note is that while we're

14
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,580
visualizing something, our brain is active in much of the same ways it is

15
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:12,105
during visual perception. That is, visual imagery has similar brain activity to

16
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:16,924
visual perception. In fact, because of this, if you imagine doing your very

17
00:01:16,924 --> 00:01:22,462
best at a task, it may actually help you improve in your performance. Sports

18
00:01:22,462 --> 00:01:26,053
psychologists are aware of this, and use visualization techniques to help

19
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:30,584
improve athlete's performance. Researchers have noted that both visual

20
00:01:30,584 --> 00:01:34,244
imagination and visual imagery are the most important to many creative

21
00:01:34,244 --> 00:01:37,990
accomplishments, both in science and in art.
