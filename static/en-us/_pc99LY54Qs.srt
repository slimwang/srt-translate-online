00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,130
Of course in this instance what I was referring to

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,950
was basically the image from my camera here.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,320
So for example, this is a picture I took on my iPhone and

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,577
an 8 mega pixel is basically the resolution of a iPhone 5S camera.

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,530
And if you look at the resolution of this one,

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:23,421
this is the resolution of this camera, which is about, you know,

7
00:00:23,421 --> 00:00:29,590
3200 wide and 2400 high makes about an 8 megapixel camera.

8
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,710
I should add here that actually if you were to do this multiplication,

9
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:37,435
you would find that the number of total pixels in this image are about

10
00:00:37,435 --> 00:00:44,720
7,990,272 pixels.

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:51,170
So of course 8 megapixel is an approximation of this camera resolution.
