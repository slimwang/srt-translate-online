1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,850
So, first things first to get the page we need the generic HTML, so

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,120
let's start with that.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,340
That'll give us a nice shell of the page.

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,610
Then, as we're getting that generic HTML, we can fire off requests for

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,340
unique HTML.

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,720
We can start to load the page with that generic HTML.

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,610
And then finally finish it up with some unique HTML.

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,460
The point being here that you can actually separate this generic from

9
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,120
unique HTML and you can start rendering the page.

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,510
You know, rendering favorite cereal, favorite pasta.

11
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,080
Maybe putting up some space for an image.

12
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,160
Even before you start getting the unique HTML for

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,970
things that are specific to me.

14
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,920
This is a really useful technique for

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,010
quickly rendering a page when custom content is involved.

16
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,070
There's almost always going to be some type of generic HTML that

17
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,910
the browser's going to need.

18
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,260
So, if we return it as fast as possible and

19
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:54,140
render it as fast as possible, it'll make our app feel really, really fast.

20
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,730
We can always fire off the request for unique HTML down the road and

21
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,780
then just fill in that data once it arrives.

22
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,880
You'll notice with your Facebook news feed when it first loads you'll

23
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,540
see some empty stories.

24
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,710
That's Facebook following the technique you see right here.

25
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,800
And the same thing is true for Google searches.

26
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,340
When you search for something, you'll see the header come back before the search

27
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,430
results start filling in, because this is a really great trick for

28
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,740
getting content on the screen as fast as possible.
