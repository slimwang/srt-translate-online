1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460
Here's Xcode and is currently open to

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,279
our PitchPerfect app. I'm going to go

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,170
over some of the basic parts of Xcode

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,940
and we'll be diving into the code in

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,700
just a moment. On the left side, you see

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,559
the navigator panels, starting with the

7
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,680
Project Navigator. In the middle is the

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,630
content area and it's currently showing

9
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,130
the settings for our PitchPerfect project.

10
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,980
On the right side you have the

11
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,140
utility area with the inspector panels.

12
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,570
The file inspector is what's currently open.

13
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,269
On the bottom, you can see the debug

14
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:31,949
and console windows.

15
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,260
Unlike other IDs and editors you may

16
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,550
have used in the past,

17
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,380
Xcode only requires a single click

18
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,920
- select a file or item. Starting with the

19
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,719
Navigator panel on the left, there are

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,489
many different ways to view the files

21
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:46,410
and other parts of your project.

22
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,510
There are even more ways to move through

23
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,469
these panels using just the keyboard.

24
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,690
As an example, you can use the command or

25
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,690
apple key + 0 to toggle the Navigators

26
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,510
panel on and off. And if you're like me,

27
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,370
I think you'll find this useful when you

28
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,690
need more screen space. On the right side

29
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,490
in the inspectors panel, the number of

30
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,180
available inspectors currently to

31
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,549
depends on the content or item you have selected.

32
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,300
In the case of the project settings,

33
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,890
we can see the file and quick

34
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,799
help inspectors. As you progress with

35
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,210
this app, you'll be using other

36
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,400
inspectors too. Just like the Navigator panel,

37
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,229
you can toggle the Inspector panel too.

38
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:27,450
You can use this button here in the

39
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,290
top right, or you can use this menu item

40
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,299
to show and hide the utilities also

41
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,930
called the inspectors. Or you can use the

42
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,210
hotkey alt+command+0. At Udacity, we have

43
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,399
a saying that content is king and with

44
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,500
Xcode that is also true.

45
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,659
Anytime code or user interface

46
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,610
Storyboards are selected, they're always

47
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,890
in the center view and in the prime spot.

48
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,159
Again at the very bottom of the screen,

49
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,320
you have the debug and console panels.

50
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,180
The console panel, the one on the right

51
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,50
is where you saw Hello World printed.

52
00:02:10,50 --> 00:02:12,540
In Xcode, the center content editor is where

53
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,770
you're going to spend a lot of your

54
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,260
time as an iOS developer. It can help you

55
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,90
to edit any part of your project, from

56
00:02:18,90 --> 00:02:20,280
project settings to code to user

57
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,680
interface elements. Knowing that it's

58
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,630
context-sensitive can help you a lot

59
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,400
when you're looking for how to change a

60
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,100
particular setting in Xcode. When we

61
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,990
select the PitchPerfect project which

62
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,910
is the little blue icon here in the top

63
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,860
of the project navigator, we see the

64
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,400
settings for the entire project. We can

65
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,350
see the version of iOS that this app is

66
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,100
targeting and the main interface file is

67
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,470
conveniently called Main, which stands

68
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,100
for Main.storyboard. That's the file

69
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,500
that we see over here. We can also use

70
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,120
the project settings to decide which

71
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,640
orientations to support and to launch in.

72
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,620
Here you can see that we're supporting

73
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,900
the Portrait orientation as well as

74
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,890
Landscape Left and Landscape Right. If we

75
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,720
select the AppDelegate.swift file,

76
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,880
we can see that the Xcode content editor

77
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,160
changes to let us modify the Swift

78
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,580
source code. Something you'll also notice

79
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,100
is that Xcode automatically highlights

80
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,350
specific syntax to make the code easier

81
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,520
to read.

82
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,600
So by default, certain things like types

83
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,600
are highlighted in purple and keywords

84
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,120
are highlighted in this pink magenta ish color.

85
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,300
Let's take another look at that

86
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,100
Main.storyboard file we were talking

87
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,860
about earlier. When you select it the

88
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,690
Xcode editor changes to show you the

89
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,200
interface for this application.

90
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,600
Within Storyboard, you can scroll around and

91
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,520
adjust the zoom to see and modify user

92
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:54,690
interfaces in your app. Right click to

93
00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:00,68
adjust the zoom level.

94
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,239
This is where we'll set up UI elements

95
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,670
for the app. I know it seems like a lot,

96
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,50
but we're going to walk you through step

97
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,870
by step and touch every essential part

98
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,700
of Xcode by the time you've completed

99
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:16,000
this course.
