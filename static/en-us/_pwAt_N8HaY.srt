1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,640
So, the process that now we want to
leverage is called Tone Mapping.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:08,250
Tone mapping is an attempt to be able to
take an image, and high radiance image,

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,720
like the one we talked
about the radiance map, and

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,400
converting it to a space where we
can now actually visualize it.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,200
So what basic thing we need to do is we
want to map one set of colors to another

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,580
in a reduced space.

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,210
And we want to basically account for

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:26,260
being able to display it on a medium
that has a limited dynamic range.

9
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:30,350
So again even displays actually
are built the same way as sensors.

10
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,500
They could, they should actually
be able to go from 0 to 55.

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,830
We don't want to be able to dynamically,
and get the colors

12
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,810
in the space that a display can show it,
and again as a set-up printer.

13
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,400
And a variety of things exist
on this kind of technology.

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,650
And of course, we want to be able to
display these things on printers,

15
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,300
monitors, and projectors.

16
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,380
This is primarily to address the fact
that printers and most of the displays

17
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,460
right now are inadequate,
in terms of how they can represent it.

18
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,750
And of course, these days with 4k
displays and all that kind of stuff.

19
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,570
We can actually really display a lot
of high dynamic range information.

20
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,010
But, of course the content for
those types of displays is hard.

21
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:10,550
So Tone Mapping addresses the problem
of being able to get this contrast

22
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,020
reduction from the scene radiance image,

23
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,680
which is captured in the radiance
map to a displayable range.

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,240
It preserves the image details and color
appearance, because remember, what we

25
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,880
did with the HDR process was really
capture the radiance map from a scene.

26
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,150
But we can't display it, so what we
want to do is basically convert it

27
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,730
into a form and
that's what tone mapping does.

28
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:34,710
Many, many well known algorithms are
existing for this kind of an approach.

29
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,490
We'll be discussing some of them
in detail in this class also, and

30
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,540
I just list a few of them.

31
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,260
I encourage you to look at them.

32
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,350
Now before we go on,
there's one thing that I wanted to add.

33
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,720
If you look at this image,

34
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,330
I actually get bothered by both
Tone Mapping and HDR on the web a lot.

35
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:54,000
Sometimes, and
this is one of the perhaps most overused

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,280
imaging technology out there
on the internet these days and

37
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,140
people are actually generating images,
that to me look ghostly.

38
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,620
So this image of course,
is capturing all of the detail.

39
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,335
But with the clouds and
all of that kind of na,

40
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:10,000
natural lighting it
actually feels unnatural.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,170
In fact this scene would have never
been naturally done like this.

42
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:18,600
So that is one of my problems with doing
over you know, use it of things like HDR

43
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,590
as we are actually generating a lot of
images that don't look natural anymore.

44
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,320
So my recommendation, use it carefully.

45
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,230
Hopefully, you like
the example I showed you.

46
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,980
Here is another example of
a similar type of an image.

47
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,650
I mean yes, it's a dark image.

48
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,590
It's a nice image.

49
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,510
It looks artistic, but even in the most
natural situations you would not have

50
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:42,560
seen lighting like this in a square,
a popular square, where ever you are.

51
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,740
So what we're really doing with tone
mapping for high dynamic range images is

52
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,140
taking again this whole dynamic range,
which is shown here in the real world,

53
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,880
and what we want to do is squish
the whole range into a 0 to 255,

54
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,930
and in essence,
that's what tone mapping does.

55
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,790
It takes the whole range and, based
on the display characteristics, and

56
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,320
perhaps, a few things
that I want to emphasize,

57
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,490
it compacts it out into this range.

58
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,670
So yes, you do lose information,
but if you save the radiance map,

59
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,460
you already have that information
that you can use later.

60
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,130
Things that does, it basically takes
the limited contrast information and

61
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:23,650
maps it to the medium, display medium
that you're using and preserves details.

62
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,510
Again, we'll be covering
a little bit more of tone mapping

63
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,760
online in the class.
