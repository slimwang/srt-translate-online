1
00:00:00,496 --> 00:00:04,750
In the ForecastAdaptor bindView method,
we have to traverse a view hierarchy to

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,480
find the views in order
to set data onto them.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,890
If it's a recycled view,

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,450
meaning it's been used in the list
previously to display other data,

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,129
we still have to traverse the view
hierarchy to find all the views.

6
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,930
To remove unnecessary
find view by ID calls,

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,810
we can use the view holder pattern.

8
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,290
For a list item layout that
contains different views,

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,270
we can create a view holder object.

10
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,740
It contains member variables that
reference each view in the layout.

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,009
The view holder object is stored
in the tag field of the view.

12
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,022
The next time that the view
is recycled and used again,

13
00:00:35,022 --> 00:00:38,113
we can just immediately set
the data onto these fields.

14
00:00:38,113 --> 00:00:40,667
You don't have to go
find all the views again.

15
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:43,779
This is our ViewHolder class,
you can name it anything you want,

16
00:00:43,779 --> 00:00:44,974
it's just a java class.

17
00:00:44,974 --> 00:00:48,794
Given the list item layout,
we do all the fine view by ID calls.

18
00:00:48,794 --> 00:00:51,778
That way, we can hold references
to all the child views.

19
00:00:51,778 --> 00:00:53,020
In the newView method,

20
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,620
after we've inflated the view, we create
a new viewHolder object from that view.

21
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,190
Then we set the ViewHolder
as the tag of the view.

22
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,120
The tag can be used towards any object,
but don't abuse it,

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,650
because when you read it back, you
have to know what you stored in there.

24
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,720
Then in the adapter bindView call,

25
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,170
we read from the tag to get
back the viewHolder object.

26
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,300
Now we immediately have references to
all the individual views that we need to

27
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,040
update, such as the icon view,
date view, description view, and so on.
