00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,450
Let's break through the word count example by writing

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,780
a mapper and reducer in Python. Recall that the mapper

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,720
will take in a document. In this case, a collection

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,380
of words that appear in Alice in Wonderland, and will

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,580
return various intermediate key value pairs. In this case, each

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,410
word in the value one. These key value pairs will

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,480
then be shuffled to ensure that every key value pair

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,630
with the same key ends up on the same reducer.

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,020
And each reducer will perform some operation

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,000
on all of the values corresponding to a

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,160
particular key. In order to produce one

12
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,230
final key value pair. In this particular case,

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,080
we're counting up how many times each

14
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,170
word occurred. So for Alice, Wonderland, Caterpillar, and

15
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,930
Of, the final key value pair is Alice

16
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,320
one, Wonderland one, Caterpillar one and Of, one.

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,890
Whereas two appeared twice, so the final key value pair there is Was two.
