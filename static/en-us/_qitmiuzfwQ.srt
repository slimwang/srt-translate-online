1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,969
Today I'm speaking with Dr.
Doug Fridsma.

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:07,850
Doug is an internal
medicine physician and

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,170
also has a PhD in
Biomedical Informatics from Stanford.

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:15,840
Starting in 2009, he joined the Office
of the National Coordinator for

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:21,270
Health IT, was there for
some five years and

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,140
is now the President of the American
Medical Informatics Association.

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,760
So, Doug, thank you for
being here with me today.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,260
>> Thank you, I'm delighted to be here.

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,830
>> So you were there from
the beginning of high tech,

10
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:38,740
effectively through the end,
although ONC is still in operation.

11
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,460
From my point of view you
guys accomplish a great deal.

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,190
More maybe than I would have imagined,
that many people would have imagined.

13
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,190
So can you tell us what you
feel the high points and

14
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,320
the major accomplishments were?

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,940
>> Well I think if you take a look
at the adoption of electronic health

16
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,690
records in a country.

17
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,280
When we started in 2009 there was about
a 17% adoption of electronic health

18
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,230
records.

19
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,336
Just last year it's at least larger
medical centers, It's close to 80, 90%.

20
00:01:07,336 --> 00:01:10,365
And even among the physicians
in the smaller practices,

21
00:01:10,365 --> 00:01:12,860
it's probably in the range of 60 to 70%.

22
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:18,810
So in the course of 5 years we took
20% of the largest GDP in the world.

23
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,340
And we convert it essentially
from a paper-based system to

24
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,590
an electronic system.

25
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,920
And I think It's not the end.

26
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,090
That actually is now the beginning
as we begin to figure out how to

27
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,830
connect the pieces and how we can refine
and make them better for the doctors and

28
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,590
patients that use them.

29
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,910
>> So, as I speak about things today,
I say that

30
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,820
the first big challenge was adoption,
and that has been largely overcome, not

31
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,840
entirely overcome And predictably, the
next big challenge is interoperability.

32
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,630
And as you read about physician
frustrations with EMRs,

33
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,620
the difficulty of getting these systems
to talk to each other is usually

34
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,400
high on their list,
if not at the top of their lists.

35
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,240
So, where do you feel we are on that and
what does your crystal ball tell us?

36
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,940
>> Well, I think interoperability
is probably the next big challenge.

37
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,520
I think there are issues in usability.

38
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,920
I think there are issues in safety and
security.

39
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,640
All of those things,

40
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,090
I think, are going to be important
now that we've got adoption.

41
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,160
But, when it comes to
interoperability,the thing that is so

42
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,900
critical is to really define
what it is that you want to do.

43
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:28,190
So when somebody complains that
their systems are not interoperable,

44
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,410
my first question to them is well
what were you trying to accomplish?

45
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,270
The definition of interoperability
is about the ability to exchange

46
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:38,260
information, and then the ability to use
the information that's been exchanged,

47
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:44,680
so you can't separate interoperability
from the thing you want to do.

48
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,380
We think sometimes that interoperability
is this green pasture that we're

49
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,520
eventually going to get to.

50
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,780
This state of being that
everything is going to work.

51
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,790
But in fact, interoperability
is one of those things that's

52
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,510
based on the things you want to do.

53
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,950
It's incremental.

54
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:05,056
It's iterative, and we will never
probably ever get there entirely

55
00:03:05,056 --> 00:03:08,592
because there will always do a new
thing that we want to do for

56
00:03:08,592 --> 00:03:10,946
which the capability doesn't exist.

57
00:03:10,946 --> 00:03:16,324
>> So this course in the informatics
world in general there's a lot

58
00:03:16,324 --> 00:03:22,770
of excitement about FHIR, as maybe
the solution to interoperabilities.

59
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,100
What are your views on that?

60
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,970
And do you see FHIR as the sort of
tool that can evolve as people's

61
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,820
requirements become more
sophisticated over time?

62
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,390
>> So, the great thing about
FHIR is it solves a problem.

63
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:40,280
And when you've got a standard, or
if you've got a technology that solves

64
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,560
a problem people are going to
use it because it helps them.

65
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,140
A lot of times we create
standards in committees and

66
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:51,370
have the expectation that if we
build it, people will then use it.

67
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,310
And we've got that wrong.

68
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,220
What we need to do is
find the problems for

69
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,160
which we can develop standards
that solve those solutions.

70
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,770
HL7, which is sort of the place
that FHIR has developed,

71
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:07,420
it had their first set of standards
really to help create interoperability

72
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,250
within the enterprise, and
many of the vendors adopted it,

73
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,980
it was wildly successful, it was able to
connect all of the pharmacy systems to

74
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,654
the laboratory systems and things,
using those kinds of messages.

75
00:04:19,654 --> 00:04:24,350
FHIR stands to transform the same
thing between enterprises, and

76
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,660
because it's aimed at
the implementer and

77
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,720
geared towards the person who's
actually going to have to use it.

78
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,210
It's simple, it's easy to use,

79
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,990
it uses the best technologies
that are out there.

80
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:39,910
And a standard isn't a standard because
you say it is, it's a standard because

81
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:43,700
people use it, and this is a standard
that people actually are using, so

82
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,350
I think it's going to
have tremendous impact.

83
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:52,060
So shifting gears a bit,
we've emphasized in this course,

84
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,040
and are emphasizing, the chronic disease
patient who's got multiple problems and

85
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,710
multiple doctors.

86
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:02,470
There's an obvious need for
information sharing there, and

87
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:07,990
the role that the patient might and
arguably should play in their own care.

88
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,400
As you look out to the future,

89
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,700
how do you see the patient fitting into
the whole spectrum of informatics and

90
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,620
where the data is stored and
how the data is accessed?

91
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,010
>> You know,
you can take a look at what's happened

92
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:26,330
in other parts of a person's life,
an individual's life, to get a sense for

93
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,730
what may be happening in healthcare.

94
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,380
So, it used to be that
to get a airline ticket,

95
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,110
you had to call up a travel
agent who would then

96
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:38,200
access this system that you had no
way of knowing what was in there.

97
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,880
Now, all of those things are available
for individuals and they can make

98
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,100
their own hotel reservations,
and their own plane tickets.

99
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,590
I think the EHRs right now
are kind of in that same rule.

100
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:52,030
You go there, there's information in
there that the doctor tells you about,

101
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,930
and then you'll use that
information in your healthcare.

102
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:59,010
As we begin to open that up, not only
in the terms of having access for

103
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:02,380
the patients, but for the patients
to put their information into it.

104
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,710
You suddenly have one more information,
and you empower the patient to have

105
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,110
a whole lot more knowledge
about what's going on.

106
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,360
So, to me, it's not a matter of if,
it's a matter of when.

107
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,380
Because the things that are happening in
the rest of society are going to begin

108
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,780
to impact healthcare
in a substantive way.

109
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,830
And as it becomes easier and cheaper for

110
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,860
patients to have access to their own
information, that's going to happen.

111
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,060
>> So if adoption was the first big
challenge, and interoperability is

112
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,150
the second, and the least in my view of
the world, the third is the analytics.

113
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,120
Where do you think we
are in analytics and

114
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,029
where do you think we're going to
go in the next few years.

115
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,080
>> I think, again, there's a lot of good
work that's been done in bioinformatics.

116
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,600
I think we're starting
to see it in other

117
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,520
areas in which people are beginning
to aggregate that data.

118
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,000
Part of the challenge that we have in
health care is that not only do we have

119
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,690
knowledge about healthcare and
medicine and the associations there.

120
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,750
We need to be able to apply
that to the data that we see.

121
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,760
And so, it isn't simple
mathematical relationships.

122
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,950
It isn't necessarily,
simple associations.

123
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,380
But there's sort of a deep
understanding of medicine and

124
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,960
care delivery,
that's embedded in the data there.

125
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,030
So, it's an exciting
time because as more and

126
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,980
more of this data becomes available,
we're going to be able to apply

127
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:22,790
those informatics techniques to
be able to extract information.

128
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,790
But to do it in a way that is

129
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,150
understanding of how
the cure is delivered.

130
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:31,620
And if we can leverage the best that's
happening in the engineering field and

131
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,990
computer science and

132
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,300
marry that with what we understand
about healthcare delivery.

133
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,710
I think we're going to
make some good progress.

134
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,000
Are we there yet?

135
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,610
No.

136
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,510
I think there's still a lot
that needs to be done.

137
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:46,120
We're seeing some areas of excellence,

138
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,850
sort of centers that are doing some
of that, hospitals like Geisinger and

139
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:55,930
Kaiser and others that
are doing some analytic work.

140
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:59,490
But I only see this accelerating
at an incredibly rapid pace.

141
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:04,950
Storage and the movement of the data
is becoming less and less expensive.

142
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,799
And as a result I think more and
more analytics will be applied.

143
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:13,610
>> Is the lack of structure
in a great deal of medical

144
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,040
record information a barrier to that?

145
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,690
Do we need to keep pushing toward
a goal that many of us had years and

146
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,640
years ago of everything
being structured,

147
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,700
or Are we okay with where we are at,
in terms of nature of the data?

148
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:31,160
>> I actually think that you need
structure when you need to make

149
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,500
decisions or help for an individual
patient, or a small group of patients.

150
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,909
It's difficult to determine
a drug-drug interaction through our

151
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:43,750
data analytics on a single patient.

152
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,260
So you need to be able to categorize
that stuff so that rules can fire and

153
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,080
alerts can be sent.

154
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:53,500
But when you start to have
hundreds of millions of patients.

155
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,340
I think the need for

156
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:59,420
structure actually goes down,
even technologies like IBM Watson

157
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,210
unstructures structured data to be
able to do the analytics that they do.

158
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,060
So, I think we need to be very
comfortable with the ability to have

159
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,310
unstructured data.

160
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:12,580
Part of the challenge that we're going
to have is that if what we do is we

161
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:17,760
require structure as a barrier
to exchange of information.

162
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,690
We're going to sell ourselves short
in our ability to do analytics.

163
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,901
We need to get all the data out there so
that we could apply those analytics.

164
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:29,785
>> If you could rewind the clock and
spend your five years at

165
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:34,670
ONC all over again, what are one or
two things you would do differently?

166
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:39,850
>> You know, it was a remarkable time
to be in the federal government,

167
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:45,380
with the passage of the HITECH Act, and
just the excitement that was going on.

168
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:49,680
Obviously if all of the standards
had been baled, and had been ready.

169
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,810
That we could have just picked them
off the shelf and put them out there.

170
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,530
That would have made
our job a lot easier.

171
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,160
What we need is going to be a portfolio.

172
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,140
We have the beginnings of a portfolio.

173
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:05,010
I think we did a grand experiment that
was different than any other country in

174
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,600
terms of how we tried to
approach this problem.

175
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,070
We didn't engineer it from the top down,
we created the building blocks and

176
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,540
allowed the market to
sort of drive that.

177
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:19,260
Now, it's resulted in some innovative
companies sort of getting lost.

178
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,750
I wish there was a way that we could
have created a playing field that

179
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,040
allowed everybody to equally compete.

180
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,480
But sometimes that's hard, and
when you use a market-driven approach,

181
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,320
there are some Winners and
losers in all of that.

182
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,460
The challenge that we
have I think is that,

183
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,380
as we have all of these
products out there,

184
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:42,200
we've reached a level of saturation and
adoption in the market place.

185
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,880
We're going to start to
see some consolidation.

186
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,290
What's important is that we
don't lose that innovative and

187
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:51,510
entrepreneurial edge as that happens.

188
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:55,860
And I think things like FHIR, that
produce the ability to create apps and

189
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,420
to create other kinds of
functionality are going to be

190
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:03,040
really important as we go into that next
level, where we take where we have now,

191
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,300
and we begin to refine it and
add the analytics that we need.

192
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:12,156
>> The Jason report essentially paints
a picture of EHRs as a database.

193
00:11:12,156 --> 00:11:16,790
And most of end-user work,
particularly in the physicians and

194
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:21,170
patients, is done through
apps that access data,from

195
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:25,490
that database using FHIR,and also,
of course, can add data to it.

196
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,920
Is that the world of
the future that you see?

197
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,880
>> I think increasingly the electronic
health record is going to be a data

198
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,770
store in the sky.

199
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:37,080
I think that patients
are going to be the principle

200
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,620
health information exchange,
in that they'll be the hub for

201
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,940
all this information that's
going to be exchanged.

202
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,640
I hope that at the end, all of this
technology doesn't create additional

203
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:52,120
barriers for patients, but makes them
first order participants in their care.

204
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,030
I think when that happens,

205
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:57,230
we are actually going to be able
to have tremendous innovation.

206
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:01,630
Perhaps the biggest underutilized
innovative force in medicine

207
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,980
is the patient.

208
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,420
And I think their needs are going to
probably drive more innovation that

209
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,660
anything we could ever think of and
think about with regard to

210
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:14,640
physicians and nurses and others who
are using the electronic health worker.

211
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,340
>> So the exercise that students in
this course are going through, and

212
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:22,150
it aims to learn FHIR and
develop fire apps

213
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:26,390
toward the future world where
that's the primary vehicle for

214
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,780
use by physicians and patients
makes sense to you, it sounds like.

215
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,840
>> Yeah, it does.

216
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,390
I think that's a great approach
to kind of set the stage.

217
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,850
I mean, if you want to know what
the future is, you have to be there and

218
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,360
try to invent it.

219
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,760
>> Well, great.
Thank you so much.

220
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,720
>> Thank you.
>> For being with me here today.

221
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,220
>> Thank you.
