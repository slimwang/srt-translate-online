The ultimate value of the clock radio to its user is how it responds to these

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:08,140
listed events. Each of the events we have listed should have some effect on

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,220
the radio state. Consider what happens when you turn the volume knob.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,900
Certainly you would expect the sound coming from the speaker to be louder. But

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,770
there is another response. The rotational position of the knob will also have

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,480
changed. This is an important piece of feedback to the user,

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,630
who may be adjusting the loudness, in the dark of the night.

8
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:31,070
We can fill this in, this information into, into a table of responses.
