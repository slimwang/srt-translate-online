00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,526
Here, a equals negative 3. Amazing work if you found this solution. This

2
00:00:04,526 --> 00:00:08,744
problem is a lot like the ones we've seen before. We want to move this radical

3
00:00:08,744 --> 00:00:13,616
to the other side of the equal sign. We do that by adding the square root of a

4
00:00:13,616 --> 00:00:18,655
plus 12 to both sides. Next we square both sides of the equation to undo these

5
00:00:18,655 --> 00:00:26,130
square roots. This gives us a linear equation of 2a plus 15 equals a plus 12.

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:32,274
Next, we subtract a from both sides to get a plus 15 equals positive 12. Then

7
00:00:32,274 --> 00:00:38,126
we subtract 15 from both sides to isolate a, so a equals negative 3. Finally,

8
00:00:38,126 --> 00:00:41,774
we check our a value of negative 3 by replacing a in the original equation with

9
00:00:41,774 --> 00:00:47,425
that value. On the left-hand side of our equation, this simplifies to root 9

10
00:00:47,425 --> 00:00:52,947
minus root 9. We know this is 0, or we could say 3 minus 3, which also equals

11
00:00:52,947 --> 00:00:57,060
0. This means our solution checks so we have our answer.
