1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,640
>> Okay, I enabled reports.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:01,790
>> Yep.

3
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:03,945
>> I just want to make one of these

4
00:00:03,945 --> 00:00:07,300
charts though, make my Gauge, my Gauge Monitor.

5
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:07,300
>>

6
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:07,964
[LAUGH]

7
00:00:07,964 --> 00:00:09,440
Well, we're almost there.

8
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,980
>> Okay, so, New Report. Now I'll search for attendees again.

9
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,310
>> And there it is.

10
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,190
>> Festivals with Attendees.

11
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:17,740
>> Yeah.

12
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,780
>> Oh, Create. Alright, and this is again?

13
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,560
>> It's a lot to look at, at first.

14
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,700
So, think of a report at it's lowest common denominator.

15
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,331
>> Mm-hm.

16
00:00:26,331 --> 00:00:27,340
>> It's just like a spreadsheet.

17
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:27,840
>> Okay.

18
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,700
>> So down here in the little preview area.

19
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:29,900
>> Yeah.

20
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,140
>> This is going to show you some of the records. Not all

21
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,100
of them. Like, right now it's showing festival

22
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,740
name, attending names. It's not showing you all

23
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,420
of them. It's just doing a little preview

24
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,280
of what the report would look like now.

25
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:40,950
>> Okay.

26
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,690
>> So, on the left side bar, you

27
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,370
can drag all of those different fields, which are

28
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,670
fields on festival and attendee into your report, so

29
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,480
we can see summarized data about those two objects.

30
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,870
>> So, what would dragging a field be? If I dragged in.

31
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,880
>> Well, what's something we care about in our Gauge report?

32
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,760
>> Money.

33
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,570
>> Right.

34
00:00:58,570 --> 00:00:59,710
>> Total Spent.

35
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:02,640
>> So, grab that off of the Attendee object.

36
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,230
>> Okay, and there's just a few places where I could drag it, does it matter?

37
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,220
>> you could put it anywhere. And you could

38
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,580
keep dragging and dropping, reordering this as you go.

39
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,920
>> Okay. Okay, I get it. So this is basically

40
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,460
a spreadsheet and I'm just choosing which columns to show.

41
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,530
>> Exactly. So let's pick a couple other

42
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,470
fields like. What are a couple of other

43
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,650
fields that you might want to show in this

44
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,690
report? Like maybe they wouldn't necessarily come up

45
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:27,040
on the Dashboard or the graph that we're trying to show, but if you were to hand

46
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,780
off this report to an executive or a

47
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,670
manager, what are things they would care about seeing?
