1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,800
Okay, we're in the home stretch here. Let's figure out

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,630
how to build the HTTP request such that we can

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:09,090
pass all seven of these form elements. Now, the question

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,610
is where do these elements come from? In most cases

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:16,200
when you see form elements showing up that aren't obviously

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,930
part of the form itself, and by that I mean

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,260
aren't part of the user interface. Now what's gotta be

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,180
going on here is that we have hidden form elements.

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,840
So, let's figure out where they're at. So, here's the start

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,020
of the form. If, we look down through, I don't obviously

11
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,830
see any other elements. So, I bet it's in some of

12
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,530
this stuff that's zipped up here. So, let's take a look.

13
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:42,910
And, sure enough, right here we find three hidden form elements.

14
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,480
So, now we've accounted for six of the seven elements we've

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,940
got to pass along, the Carrier, the Airport, the Submit button

16
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,370
and then these three. And we can see that right here,

17
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:58,155
Viewstate okay, is one of those with a very long value. If I open this up, I see

18
00:00:58,155 --> 00:01:01,349
that here we have one of those other values.

19
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:04,169
The other one in fact, that makes scrolling through all

20
00:01:04,169 --> 00:01:06,029
the form data in the network tab such a

21
00:01:06,029 --> 00:01:09,820
long and tedious process. Okay, so now we've identified

22
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,940
where all seven of the form fields are. The

23
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:17,000
question then becomes, how do we build our HTTP requests,

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,570
such that this data is included? Because that's really

25
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:22,070
what we have to do here. In addition to the

26
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,490
Carrier, the Airport, and the Submit button, we've gotta

27
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:28,550
send these along as well. So in this exercise what

28
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,350
I'd like you to do is write some code

29
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:34,660
here that uses the Beautiful Soup Module, and assigns values

30
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:39,160
to Event Validation and View State such that they

31
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,182
have the correct values. The values that this data source

32
00:01:42,182 --> 00:01:46,320
is expecting to see come across. In a little bit, we'll talk about why

33
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,560
these values are necessary. For right now,

34
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,820
let's just focus on building the request properly.
