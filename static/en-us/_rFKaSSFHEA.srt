00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,800
First let's take a look
at the security of iOS.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,310
The iOS security architecture
combines both software and

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:14,830
hardware features to provide security to
an iOS device such as an iPhone or iPad.

4
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:19,120
It has built in crypto capabilities
to support data protection,

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,830
such as confidentiality and integrity.

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,310
For example,
notice that the crypto engine and

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,310
the crypto keys are embedded
in the hardware.

8
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,430
And of course, beta protection is
applied to not just the system files but

9
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,160
also application data.

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,100
The security architecture also provides
various strong isolation mechanisms, for

11
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,260
example, it uses App Sandbox
to protect app security.

12
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,750
This enables the apps to run securely.

13
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,310
For example, apps cannot
interfere with each other and

14
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,480
also this ensure
the integrity of the system.

15
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,450
That is, even if an app is compromised,

16
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,310
it's damage to the system
is very limited.
