1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,730
Lets imagine that you've just finish
the friendlychat app and published it.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,070
At first you see that your
user base is growing, but

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,703
then you look over the analytics and

4
00:00:07,703 --> 00:00:10,608
you start to notice a drop on
active users and user engagement.

5
00:00:10,608 --> 00:00:15,002
For instance, in the database you notice
that some of the users are sending very,

6
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:16,155
very long messages.

7
00:00:16,155 --> 00:00:19,490
When users are chatting with friends,
there´s a good chance they don´t want to

8
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,535
read the dissertation, yeesh,
just look at these messages.

9
00:00:22,535 --> 00:00:25,089
These users are trying to coordinate
plans to go to the movies.

10
00:00:25,089 --> 00:00:27,420
But at this rate,
they'll never make it on time.

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,020
Currently in the main activity, you can
see that there is this variable default

12
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,409
message length and it's set to 1000.

13
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:36,189
I wonder if these long messages
might be reducing user engagement.

14
00:00:36,189 --> 00:00:40,070
And this would be actually be a great
thing to consider doing an AB test for.

15
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,100
You could run one to try to help you
find the best message limit length.

16
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,969
But for simplicity sake,
in this example at least, we're going to

17
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:49,655
use remote config to change the friendly
chat message length for all users.

18
00:00:49,655 --> 00:00:52,310
Okay, here I am in the console, and

19
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:57,290
I'm going to go head over here,
scroll down, and open up remote config.

20
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,619
The first thing that you need to do
when starting out with remote config

21
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:03,589
is to create a parameter
in the Firebase console.

22
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:07,493
I'm going to scroll down and
click add your first parameter here.

23
00:01:07,493 --> 00:01:10,609
I'm going to make a nod
towards text messaging and

24
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:13,819
set my friendly message
length to be 140 characters.

25
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:16,076
That seems like a tried and
true amount of characters for

26
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,381
friends to use while chatting.

27
00:01:17,381 --> 00:01:21,081
I'll then go ahead and click add
parameter, and publish my changes.

28
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,551
[BLANK_AUDIO]

29
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:26,930
Now this is actually everything you
need to set up in the Firebase console.

30
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,100
But I won't know it's happening for
sure until I check the analytics and

31
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:32,156
see if my user engagement has increased.

32
00:01:32,156 --> 00:01:34,759
Anyways, we're done with the Firebase
console stuff for now, so

33
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,250
let's go ahead and
jump into the app code.
