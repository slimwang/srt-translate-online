>> Because functions are so unique and have an input and output, we have another

2
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:10,042
way of representing it. Instead of using y, we'll use something else. We'll use

3
00:00:10,042 --> 00:00:14,809
f of x, or a function of x because the output relies on the input x. F of x is

4
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:19,397
the name of the function that represents the output. And x is our input

5
00:00:19,397 --> 00:00:24,540
variable. And this side of the equation describes how we change x. To find the

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:29,580
value or output of a function, we use substitution. For example, we could

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,826
evaluate this function for x equals 3. My input is 3, so I plug it in. I want to

8
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:39,967
find the output, or f of 3, by carrying out this math. So, here, the output,

9
00:00:39,967 --> 00:00:45,101
when x is 3, is 7. When you see a statement like this, you really want to think

10
00:00:45,101 --> 00:00:50,214
of it in terms of the outputs and inputs. When the input x is equal to 3, the

11
00:00:50,214 --> 00:00:55,167
output of the function or the y value is 7. We don't have to evaluate our

12
00:00:55,167 --> 00:01:00,538
function for just numbers though. We could also use another expression. For

13
00:01:00,538 --> 00:01:05,908
example, if my input x was 3 x squared, I would plug it into my function. So,

14
00:01:05,908 --> 00:01:12,909
the output of 3 x squared would be 6 x squared plus 1. This would be the answer

15
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:18,057
containing a variable. Notice, it's not just a number.
