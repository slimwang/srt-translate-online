1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,100
The question we're asking now is, can we distinguish the patterns in the data?

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,970
First of all, do we have enough data to distinguish the patterns?

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,240
And are the features good enough to see a pattern?

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,160
To do so, we will now visually inspect the patterns in the data.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,790
In fact, human beings are incredibly good at distinguishing patterns.

6
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,400
In problems where we are trying to recognize patterns,

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,640
it is often useful to visually inspect the data.

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,080
Often it is not possible to look at their entire data set.

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:38,660
In that case, take a subset of the data and take a look at the scatter plots.

10
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,910
When the data is multi-dimensional, this becomes difficult to do.

11
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,670
However, sometimes it is useful to take a look at

12
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,230
the data two dimensions at a time.

13
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,920
Let's go to our iPython Notebook, and make some scatter plots.

14
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,470
We had previously plotted a histogram of the inter-sampling times.

15
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:04,670
Now, let's make a scatter plot of the x and y coordinates of all the data.

16
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,320
Depending on your computer, this might take a little while.

17
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,610
However, at the end you would get a graph that looks like this.

18
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:17,720
This is a simple scatter plot of x and y for all the data.

19
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,160
This image, however,

20
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:24,570
does not give us very much information about an individual's driving patterns.

21
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:30,830
Moreover, you will see there are regions where the data is clustered around.

22
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:36,840
What we will do here is look at the region between minus 1 and plus 1.

23
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,670
Most of the data seems to be concentrated around in this region.

24
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,160
In the next part of the code we do exactly that.

25
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,960
After we have the restricted regions,

26
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,490
we want to make a scatter plot with the restrictions in place.

27
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,510
Let's go ahead and run this part of the code.

28
00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:00,360
Again, depending on your computer, it might take a while to produce this plot.

29
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,790
However, now you see that we are in a much different scale then we were before.

30
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:14,140
We can see a lot more points distributed between minus 0.5 and 1.

31
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:19,890
Next, we want to plot the location of each person on a separate plot.

32
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,230
We want to see if the patterns of their locations are distinct.

33
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,380
To do so, let's run this line of the code.

34
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,600
Running the above line should give you graphs that look like this.

35
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,310
We can try and scroll through the graph

36
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:39,370
to see what each individual person's location patterns looked like.

37
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,630
In this case, we're looking at the location pattern of person A.

38
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:48,660
We can try to scroll down to look at the location pattern of the other people in

39
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,510
the data.

40
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:56,570
This is the location pattern of person B, person C, D, E, F and G.

41
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,290
Notice for person E,

42
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:05,200
the location patterns are clustered around two very disjoint points.

43
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,750
In this case, we're certain the scaling will work to reveal to us,

44
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,640
a much better pattern in this region.

45
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,170
In this part of the code,

46
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:20,030
we're going to take the location of each person within their restricted region.

47
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,850
We have run the code, and we have the following scatter diagrams.

48
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:28,870
Let's try to scroll down and look if the patterns for E are better.

49
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:33,700
You see, by restricting the scale of the plot within a certain region,

50
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,510
a pattern for the location of person E has emerged.

51
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:42,570
We now have distinct location patterns we can use to build our model.
