00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,278
Since we factored the numerator, we can see that we have a common factor of x

2
00:00:03,278 --> 00:00:07,742
plus 5 in both the top and the bottom here. So, if we cancelled that out, the

3
00:00:07,742 --> 00:00:12,234
only factor that's left is x minus 2 in the numerator. That means f of x

4
00:00:12,234 --> 00:00:17,050
reduces to just x minus 2. Of course keeping in mind that x is not allowed to

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,038
equal negative 5. Now on our graph when x equals negative 5, we're just going

6
00:00:21,038 --> 00:00:25,705
to see a tiny little point size brick, that's all this domain restriction does.

7
00:00:25,705 --> 00:00:29,173
It's pretty amazing considering what a complicated function we started out with

8
00:00:29,173 --> 00:00:33,911
to see that it reduces to just x minus 2, something linear. Rational functions

9
00:00:33,911 --> 00:00:35,390
are very fascinating.
