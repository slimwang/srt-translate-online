00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,470
The answer is that the RAM is just going to take a single time step, one time step,

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:10,460
to execute these 2-lines of code because for this line up here--this is just a memory access

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,060
and we get memory access for free.

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:19,420
That's 0 steps and down here, that is a simple operation, which takes one time step.

5
00:00:19,420 --> 99:59:59,999
So a total of one time steps.
