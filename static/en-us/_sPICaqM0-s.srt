Let's take a look at another example program. Look at the program carefully and

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:05,790
tell me what its output will be.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,230
Will this program create a segmentation fault? Will

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,580
it print out null, the empty string? Will it print out a message from

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,390
the created thread? Or will it complain

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,210
about how a joinable thread is not joined?
