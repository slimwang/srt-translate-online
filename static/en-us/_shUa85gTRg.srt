00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,420
Okay, last one.

2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:03,830
But this time,
let's make it interesting.

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:05,520
Here's an example layout.

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,740
You've got a large app bar at the top of
the screen with icons along the top and

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,710
text along the bottom.

6
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:17,280
There's content below it and whoa
there's this button straddling the edge

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,970
between the bar and the content and
it's along the right side.

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,520
Now you're pretty familiar with layout
hierarchies at this point, right?

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,270
To check that you understand, take
a look at these possible hierarchies and

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:33,160
select the ones which you think might be
appropriate to create this kind of UI.
