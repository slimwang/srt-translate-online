00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,650
Let's talk a bit about perspective camera control. The parameter with the most

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,452
obvious effect is the field of view. As mentioned before, this value is the

3
00:00:07,452 --> 00:00:11,310
angle from the bottom of the view frustum to the top. It also adjusts the side

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,922
to side angle, factoring in the aspect ratio. The field of view parameter acts

5
00:00:14,922 --> 00:00:18,630
something like a zoom lens. As you set this angle smaller and smaller, whatever

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,217
is in the middle of the screen grows larger and larger. For these images, what

7
00:00:22,217 --> 00:00:26,346
I've done is have the field of view match the camera move more or less. In

8
00:00:26,346 --> 00:00:29,526
other words, as I zoom in on the model, I also move farther away so that the

9
00:00:29,526 --> 00:00:34,260
model takes about the same amount of room on the screen. As we zoom out the

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,264
perspective distortion gets less and less. At the limit, that is, as we attempt

11
00:00:38,264 --> 00:00:41,116
to go infinitely far away and have the field of view approaching an angle of

12
00:00:41,116 --> 00:00:46,148
zero degrees the view becomes an orthographic projection. If you're practically

13
00:00:46,148 --> 00:00:48,878
infinitely far away, everything you're looking at is at essentially the same

14
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,330
distance, as far as relative size goes. Which is how the orthographic

15
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,906
projection treats this scene. This effect of having the field of view and the

16
00:00:55,906 --> 00:01:00,660
camera movement offset each other, has become a go-to effect in cinematography.

17
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,558
If you want to express something that's weird or dreamlike happening in the

18
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:07,888
scene you zoom in while moving backwards at the same time, or vice versa. Give

19
00:01:07,888 --> 00:01:11,283
this demo a try yourself and see how it looks.
