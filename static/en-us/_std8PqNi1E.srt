00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:05,170
In the previous lesson, we talked about object-oriented analysis, the process by

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:09,790
which you can begin to come to understand the problem you're trying to solve.

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:14,530
Today, we're going to talk about how would you express the results of

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:19,770
that understanding using the Unified Modeling Language, UML. In particular,

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,110
we're going to talk about UML's Class Model Diagram, which is the most popular

6
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:30,960
form of UML. Besides being popular, it's also the most complex

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,070
of the diagramming types in UML. However, there's no need for you to use all of

8
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:40,550
its features, particularly at the start of the modeling process.

9
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:45,150
There's nothing wrong with having an abstract version that you refine over time.

10
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,259
Nevertheless, I'd like to introduce you to all of the features, so

11
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:53,370
that when you need them you're aware that they're there. UML class diagrams

12
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,745
are also sometimes called Static Structure Diagrams. They're one of UML's

13
00:00:58,745 --> 00:01:03,770
structure diagrams as opposed to the diagrams which you used to model behavior.

14
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:09,040
Despite being called Class Model Diagrams, besides classes, they also have

15
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,340
iconic representations for interfaces, objects, relationships, and so on.

16
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,600
The official specification for UML can be found on the Class Resources page.

17
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,620
And we're also going to be taking some examples from the UML reference manual,

18
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,690
which is referred to on the resources page as well.
