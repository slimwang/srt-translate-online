00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's go through the answer together.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We definitely want to name our procedure t_string,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and now the real trick to this is just writing a good regular expression.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Here I've written a regular expression that starts with a double quote,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
ends with a double quote, and can have anything that's not a double quote--

6
00:00:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
remember that super useful carat character--0 or more times.
