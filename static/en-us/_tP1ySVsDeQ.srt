1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,410
So you now know how the recipient
can trust that the message

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,350
actually came unaltered from its sender,
but how do the sender and

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:13,030
recipient each know that the other
is who they say they are?

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,030
Could a hacker be
masquerading as a doctor

5
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:20,860
in order to get access to health data
and use it to file fraudulent claims?

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,580
Assuring trust to prevent this is
the job of the Registration Authority.

7
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,750
Their job isn't particularly
technically complex.

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,600
It's driven by policies intended to
assure that the background of people or

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:37,170
entities is thoroughly verified before
they're issued a pair of certificates.
