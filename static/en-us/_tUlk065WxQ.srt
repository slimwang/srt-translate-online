1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,790
Now we'll start building the app itself.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,730
First, take some time to create
a single blank activity app.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,280
There is a mapping template available
that you might want to make use of later

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,110
but, in order to learn the ins and
outs of mapping,

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,580
let's create one from first principles.

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,860
Next, you want to edit your build
up gradle in the usual way.

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,070
In your Android manifest there's a few
things that you'll need to set up.

8
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,280
First of all is the meta
data with the references for

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,390
Google services,
just like in Build.gradle.

10
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,090
Then there's the meta for the API key.

11
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,600
Now you created the API key in
the developer console earlier on,

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,980
and you need to put the API key as
a meta tag in your Android manifest.

13
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,240
To see where you do that, take a look
at the developer documentation,

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,670
or we'll show you the answer
in the next node.

15
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,820
You're also going to need permissions
for internet, network state, and

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,850
write external storage.

17
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,560
And then finally you're going to
need a mega tag for OpenGL, as well.

18
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,865
Now most of this should be review to
you, but we've linked some Documentation

19
00:00:55,865 --> 00:01:00,785
in OpenGL and the API key metadata
tag in the instructor notes below.

20
00:01:00,785 --> 00:01:03,865
When you've done all of this and you're
ready to go, you've added each piece to

21
00:01:03,865 --> 00:01:07,325
your manifest, you've edited your
Build.gradle, check this box.
