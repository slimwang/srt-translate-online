00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,980
Say you look at just two polygons from the side. A red one and a yellow one.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:09,050
Because they interpenetrate. The draw order will always be wrong for one pixel

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:13,855
or another. If the yellow object is drawn first, this upper pixel will have the

4
00:00:13,855 --> 00:00:18,335
wrong order of yellow, then red. If the red object is drawn first, the lower

5
00:00:18,335 --> 00:00:22,895
pixel has the same problem. Red than yellow. For the first answer, with the

6
00:00:22,895 --> 00:00:27,537
yellow object being rendered first, there's no red object for it to blend with.

7
00:00:27,538 --> 00:00:31,699
So this answer is correct. Blending has not been turned off for the yellow

8
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:35,714
object since you can see the grid lines through it. So this answer is wrong. The

9
00:00:35,714 --> 00:00:40,066
yellow object blocks the red object at the top so it must have been drawn first

10
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:45,121
and written to the z-buffer. So this answer is also wrong. The fourth answer is

11
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:49,616
correct. The transparency algorithm states that the more distant object, the

12
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:53,790
yellow one, is drawn first. Another way to think about it is that you can have

13
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,323
red over yellow, or yellow over red, but not both at the same time.
