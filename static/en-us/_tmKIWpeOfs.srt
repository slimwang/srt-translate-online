1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,240
The most important thing to know

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,810
when selling is knowing who you're
selling to and what they care about.

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,820
So understanding who is standing in
front of you, whether it's an investor,

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,320
an employee, or customer, or partner,
and what they truly care about

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,510
really dictates the tone of what
you're selling and how you sell it.

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,640
For that you need to be
able to know everything and

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,080
anything about your business.

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,620
So you can tune your pitch to
whoever is standing across from you.

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,340
So if in a networking event,
it's an investor and

10
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,680
you pick it up very quickly you
can have a very specific pitch

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,940
that is different then if across
from you is a potential new hire.

12
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,590
So knowing who that person is is
probably the most important and

13
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,920
first step of developing
your pitching skills and

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,220
then obviously the thing that will get
you good at it is just again practicing.

15
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,710
The more you practice the better you'll
be good at it and you can probably

16
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:01,690
measure it because your pitches
will become significantly shorter.

17
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,849
It's really easy to sell something
using lots of sentences and

18
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:11,140
many minutes.

19
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,940
It's really hard to do so
with a few words and a few seconds and

20
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,410
the more you practice the better
you'll become at selling.
