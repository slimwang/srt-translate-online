00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,390
In the Andrew file system, the sequence, client sending a

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:11,070
newly generated, random number, and the server responding with

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,430
an increment of that random number back to the client. This

4
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:21,170
exchange establishes one of two things. Either that the

5
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,901
server is genuine or the client is genuine. The second

6
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:31,960
question is the sequence, the server sending a newly-generated random

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:38,390
number, Yr, and the client responding by taking the random number, incrementing

8
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,470
it by 1, and giving it back to the server That

9
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,650
establishes, that the server is genuine, or the client is genuine.
