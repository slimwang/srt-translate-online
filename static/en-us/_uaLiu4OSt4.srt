00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,689
We talked a bit about different
monetization models in the last lesson,

2
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:07,590
but let's refresh your
memory with the highlights

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,230
of some of the most popular models.

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,700
>> First, there are ads,
serving advertisements provide a way

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,140
to make money while you are giving
your content or app for free.

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,580
Ads are very popular on the Web,
but they aren't the only model.

7
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,873
Let's see another common
way to make money.

8
00:00:24,873 --> 00:00:27,367
>> There's also
the one-time charge model.

9
00:00:27,367 --> 00:00:30,477
Now in this model, it's similar
to what you would experience in

10
00:00:30,477 --> 00:00:33,610
the real world if you went
to a brick and mortar store.

11
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,320
You go to a shop, pay a certain
amount to the shopkeep, and

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,490
you walk away with a t-shirt, let's say.

13
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,780
Now in apps you can do this
in two different ways.

14
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,690
First you can charge a fixed price.

15
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,870
So the user pays a price, and
they can download the app.

16
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,950
Or you can charge a price
after a trial period.

17
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,530
Now in both cases there are two things
that you want to pay attention to.

18
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,950
One, make sure that payment is quick and
easy, and

19
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,690
it doesn't require the user to log in.

20
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,120
Second, use an established
payment model, Stripe,

21
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,810
PayPal, GooglePay,
ApplePay, what have you.

22
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,580
This will make sure that your
users have a convenient and

23
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,280
consistent checkout flow.

24
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,480
>> The subscription model is another
option there are many cases where

25
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,240
we wish to sell our service
on a monthly or yearly basis.

26
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,880
The big advantage that made this
model so popular is the fact that

27
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,270
you get to earn more due to the increase
in the lifetime value of your users.

28
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,230
And they feel more comfortable
because in that pay-as-you-go model

29
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,250
they got full control on their expenses.

30
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,660
>> Lastly, there are in-app payments,
and this is

31
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:43,300
a very popular model these days, as it
combines two main user preferences.

32
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:47,430
Free apps as the starting point, and
then a way to monetize on that user

33
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,010
after they've decided that
your products worth it.
