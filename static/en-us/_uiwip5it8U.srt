1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,270
Here are the values we get after
surging to level two of our game tree.

2
00:00:04,269 --> 00:00:06,879
We can see that the values
are significantly different from when we

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,609
surged to level three.

4
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:12,509
Previously, we would have chosen
one of these three nodes,

5
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:15,640
because they received the highest
value in our evaluation function.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,789
But after only surging to level two, we
see that it's actually the other nodes

7
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:22,739
that get a higher value in
our evaluation function.

8
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:27,070
So in this case our computer player
would choose one of these two moves.

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,750
And if it takes the move on the left
first, it would choose this move, which

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,320
is a different choose than we would
have made after surging to level three.
