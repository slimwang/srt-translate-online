00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,429
Chances are the relationship between
you and your will be a long one,

2
00:00:04,429 --> 00:00:07,730
and like with any good relationship, you
need to work on it and invest early on.

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,620
If you don't, you'll frustrate each
other and things get complicated.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,070
In the first couple of days of using it,
try on lots of built-in shortcuts and

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,310
features, even if they seem overkill.

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,770
Try them all out and observe yourself.

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,170
Which shortcuts stick?

8
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,610
Which do you have to
force yourself to use?

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,700
You'll get a pretty good feel for
what matters.

10
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,868
But let James give you a quick
little glimpse of the little tricks

00:00:29,868 --> 00:00:30,400
he likes best.
