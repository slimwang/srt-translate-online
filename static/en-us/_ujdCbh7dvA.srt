[Evans] We're not going to get into the details of how AES works,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
but I want to talk a little bit about the main components of it.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
There are 2 main things that go into AES and go into almost all modern block ciphers.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
They all involve XORs--we saw that in the one-time pad--

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and they're XORing some round key which is generated by a key schedule,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
some process of generating new keys for each round.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And then what's going into that, there are 2 main operations.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:37,000
One is shifts, so permuting bits, and there would be a map that would move bits around.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This is better than just doing only XORs

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
because we're moving data around instead of just XORing and changing it.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The other thing that's really important for a cipher to be hard to cryptanalyze

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
is to have some nonlinearity, something that is very difficult to analyze

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and mixes up data in a way that is nonlinear.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This is done basically by having lookup tables.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So what's called an S-box is something that takes in 8 bits--

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
in this case it could have different numbers going in--

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and basically has a lookup table.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So that's going to have 256 entries mapping each set of 8 bits to some other set of 8 bits.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And designing that lookup table is a challenge.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We want the lookups to be as nonlinear as possible

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and make sure there are no patterns in the data in this table.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And so the way AES works is combining shifts and S-boxes with XOR

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
to scramble up the data.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And it's going through multiple rounds,

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
so we'll take the outputs of this, put them back through a series of shifts and S-boxes again,

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and keep doing that.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The number of rounds depends on the key size.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So for the smallest key, for the 128-bit key, which is the smallest key size for AES,

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
we would do 10 rounds going through the cycle, getting the output cipher text for that block.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So the details are definitely more complicated than this, and getting them right is very hard.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
There's lots of great resources that explain AES in detail, though.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
For our purposes we're going to think of it as a black box--

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
that we can use encryption in our protocols.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We're going to assume it has the properties that we want it to have

35
00:02:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and not need to look in more detail at how to actually implement that in a modern cipher.
