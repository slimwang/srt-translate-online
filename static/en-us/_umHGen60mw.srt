00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,209
Our tearout for

2
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:05,580
this lesson shows you visually how
items in our RecyclerView get recycled.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,640
We set a different background shade of
green to each item as it's created,

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,669
along with saving an integer
ViewHolder instance so

5
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:15,810
you can see the order in
which each item was created.

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,320
We use one of the views to show
the index in the underlying data source.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,620
Cool stuff.

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,530
You can see that recycling in
practice is more complicated

9
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:27,880
than our animation shows it to be, but
ultimately, it works in a similar way.

10
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:32,118
There are a bunch of steps to
get RecyclerView working at all.

11
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:36,189
Rather than having you do all these
steps all at once, we're going to give

12
00:00:36,189 --> 00:00:41,009
you an almost working bit of
RecyclerView code each time, and

13
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:44,539
you'll fill out a single
section in each exercise.

14
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:49,359
This allows you to verify that each
change that you've made works correctly.

15
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:50,839
For these four steps,

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,095
the app should work exactly the same
at the end of each exercise.

17
00:00:55,094 --> 00:00:58,875
We'll begin by creating the
RecyclerView, then we'll add the list

18
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:02,795
item layout and ViewHolder,
then we'll add the adapter and

19
00:01:02,795 --> 00:01:05,915
finally we'll wire things
out with the layout manager.

20
00:01:05,915 --> 00:01:07,575
We'll explain this as we go along.
