1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,180
For this quiz, I want you to take
a look at the hometown hero image and

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,500
the navigation links, NEWS,
EVENTS, CULTURE, and BLOG.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:13,380
Start with a small viewport and
resize the page to make it larger.

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,890
Pay attention to the size
of the hero image, and

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,580
the spacing between the nav links.

6
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,260
As you play with it I
want you to ask yourself,

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,370
where would you add a breakpoint?

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,970
Type your answer in here and
just to be clear,

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:30,690
there's not just one right answer, this
is as much of an art as it is a science.

10
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:35,720
Oh, and here's a hint, if you open
up DEV Tools and resize the page,

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,490
you'll notice that the resolution is
displayed in the top right-hand corner.

12
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,800
That'll help you find out where
you want to put your breakpoint.
