1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,220
All right, you're done.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,130
Let's take a look at the solution.

3
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,330
Adding support for the location
insert looks almost identical

4
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,100
to adding the support for weather.

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:14,620
We just have to select the right table
name, and return the right location URI.

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,570
Remember, at the end of the function,
we can just call notify change on

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,584
the content resolver to notify
all of the registered observers.

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:27,210
Note that we must use the past in URI,
and not the return URI,

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,540
as that will not correctly notify
our cursors of the change.

10
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,980
Since we also uncommented
test insert read provider,

11
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,910
lets run our test just to make sure
everything's still working well.

12
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,820
Note that nothing appears
on device screen.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,420
And, our test passed.

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,850
We're well on our way to
building our content provider.
