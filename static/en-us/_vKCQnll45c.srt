00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:09,032
Positive and negative 2.33 is called the critical value of Z for 98% confidence.

2
00:00:09,032 --> 00:00:16,234
And if you remember, positive and negative 1.96 are the critical values of Z for

3
00:00:16,234 --> 00:00:21,054
95% confidence. If you worked your way through lesson 6 and really understood

4
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:25,234
it, then finding the critical values of Z should be pretty easy for you. But

5
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:31,088
it's still a pretty difficult conceptual idea. So don't get too discouraged if

6
00:00:31,088 --> 00:00:35,546
you're finding this pretty confusing. I would suggest watching these videos and

7
00:00:35,546 --> 00:00:40,249
pausing them all the time to really think about what I'm saying and writing.

8
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:45,017
There are also a lot of really important definitions. So you have to remember

9
00:00:45,017 --> 00:00:49,362
what a Z score is, and what the standard deviation is, the sampling

10
00:00:49,362 --> 00:00:54,184
distribution. And you have to remember that the standard deviation of the

11
00:00:54,184 --> 00:01:00,252
sampling distribution is called the standard error. And then you need to be able

12
00:01:00,252 --> 00:01:05,894
to express values of sample means in terms of standard errors away from the

13
00:01:05,894 --> 00:01:10,365
population mean. If you can do all those things and you understand these

14
00:01:10,365 --> 00:01:15,204
concepts, then you'll be fine in this lesson. If not, do go back and review

15
00:01:15,204 --> 00:01:20,038
those videos. And do the problems that's in quizzes. Because that will really

16
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:20,794
help you.
