00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,050
Let's use sum of square differences to find the best match.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,500
Let's initialize a couple of variables we'll need, and

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,740
then let's run through the strip, placing the patch at every valid location.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:17,350
We extract the second patch of the same size from the strip at each location.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,290
And then compute the sum of square differences, and

6
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:26,170
keep track of the x coordinate that gave us the minimum difference.

7
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,590
And that's about it.

8
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,310
Let's see how it works.

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,106
Okay, so the best x coordinate found was 145.

10
00:00:33,106 --> 00:00:36,200
The top patch is from the left image.

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,690
Here's the strip from the right image you saw earlier.

12
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,280
And the bottom patch has been extracted from the right image.

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,850
Notice that the appearance of the top of the house has changed a little bit, but

14
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,830
our algorithm is still able to find it correctly.

15
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,370
Now, instead of using sum of square differences,

16
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,300
you could have also used cross-correlation.

17
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,240
Feel free to try out alternate methods.
