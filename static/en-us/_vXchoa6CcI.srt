00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,506
Quick question.
How many eigenvectors are there?

2
00:00:02,506 --> 00:00:05,652
If I had more than D images.

3
00:00:05,652 --> 00:00:06,523
Okay.

4
00:00:06,523 --> 00:00:10,285
So D is 10,000, 10,000 dimension,
let's say, or a million.

5
00:00:10,285 --> 00:00:14,866
So if I had, you know, 10,000 images and
I was looking at all those,

6
00:00:14,866 --> 00:00:17,726
I could get 10,000 eigenvectors.

7
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:21,465
But clearly the sum of
those outer products.

8
00:00:21,465 --> 00:00:24,541
If I've only got a small number, right?

9
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,851
The whole idea is that M is
going to be a lot less than D.

10
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:28,883
So how many of them are there?

11
00:00:28,883 --> 00:00:32,897
Well your intuition might say,
well I've got M independent things,

12
00:00:32,897 --> 00:00:35,270
so there must be M of them.

13
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,070
But actually your intuition was wrong,

14
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,720
and in fact, a better intuition
would be the following.

15
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:44,540
Suppose I gave you two points
in three dimensions, okay?

16
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,180
How many vectors can span those?

17
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,450
Just one, right?

18
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,390
Wo, I go between them.

19
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:58,091
And the reason is, I have to think
about subtracting off the mean.

20
00:00:58,091 --> 00:00:58,823
Right?

21
00:00:58,823 --> 00:01:00,215
And once I subtract off the mean,

22
00:01:00,215 --> 00:01:02,421
actually I only have one
degree of freedom, right?

23
00:01:02,421 --> 00:01:05,568
Because the origin is going to be
halfway between those two points.

24
00:01:05,568 --> 00:01:07,286
So once you tell me where
one of the points is,

25
00:01:07,286 --> 00:01:08,424
I know where the other one is.

26
00:01:08,424 --> 00:01:10,246
So there's only one degree of freedom.

27
00:01:10,246 --> 00:01:14,008
So with two points,
there's only one possible eigenvector.

28
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:15,447
Let's think about it this way.

29
00:01:15,447 --> 00:01:20,940
If I have three points in space, okay?

30
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,100
How many vectors does it
take to span those points?

31
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,740
Well, they lie in a plane, don't they?

32
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,330
Of course they do.

33
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:26,961
Three points to find the triangle.

34
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:30,003
So with three points,
there's only two eigenvectors.

35
00:01:30,003 --> 00:01:34,800
In general,
there are M minus 1 eigenvectors.

36
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,300
And the reason there's M minus 1 is,
I take my endpoints and

37
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,560
I subtract out the mean.

38
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,351
So that removes a degree of freedom.

39
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:43,730
So that's a trick question that I
always give on the final of my course.

40
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,644
So if anybody's taking the final,
now you know the answer.

41
00:01:46,644 --> 00:01:48,914
Okay, there's M minus 1.
