00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,520
The classes, that, come with this course, such as the Picture class here, all

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,050
have an owner's manual. Here is how you can find it. Select the Tools menu,

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:17,070
Project Documentation. And a browser window will pop up. Here it is. As you can

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,470
see, we have the documentation of the Picture class. As you scroll through it,

5
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,140
you will find a method summary. For example, here's the grow method and you can

6
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,630
see it says resizes this picture both horizontally and vertically. When you

7
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:37,220
click on the link, a detailed explanation pops up. And here it explains that

8
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:42,450
you need to feed two numbers that are called dw and dh. And they're further

9
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,910
described down here. The first number is the amount by which to re size the

10
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:52,560
width on each side. and the other the amount by which to re size the height on

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,720
each side. That's how it works for the classes that we give you. If you use a

12
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,880
standard library class such as the String class, you instead want to look at

13
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,900
the official documentation. I've made a bookmark for it and I suggest you do

14
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,350
the same. Here it is. On the left, you have a listing of all of the various

15
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:16,987
classes. They're many of them, most of which you never need to know. Let's find

16
00:01:16,987 --> 00:01:22,080
the String class. Here it is. Click on it. On the right, the documentation for

17
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,445
the String class is displayed and again, you can scroll through it. You will

18
00:01:26,445 --> 00:01:32,455
find a summary of all of the methods. There are many methods, most of which you

19
00:01:32,455 --> 00:01:36,970
don't need to know, and when there's one that interests you, you can click on

20
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:41,490
it and get a detailed explanation. You will have lots of practice with that

21
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,440
during this lesson.
