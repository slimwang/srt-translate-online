Thanks, Chris, for teaching us how to find and factor out the greatest common

2
00:00:04,422 --> 00:00:09,043
factor or GCF. For this practice problem, I want you to factor out the GCF and

3
00:00:09,043 --> 00:00:13,950
put the GCF in front, and the remaining terms in parentheses following. So we

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:21,696
have 27 q squared p cubed, minus 18 q squared p squared, plus 45 q p cubed. Put

5
00:00:21,696 --> 00:00:23,939
your answer in this box.
