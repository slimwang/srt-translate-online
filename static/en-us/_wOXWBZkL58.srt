00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,125
You just created a histogram with bin size 20, but we can create a histogram

2
00:00:05,137 --> 00:00:10,150
with any bin size, or also called the interval size. This is interactivate

3
00:00:10,162 --> 00:00:15,450
histogram software, which I really like. You can just input the data here, and

4
00:00:15,462 --> 00:00:20,650
then you can see how the shape of the histogram changes when you change the bin

5
00:00:20,662 --> 00:00:26,332
size. So here, we're getting bigger and bigger bins. And you see that there are

6
00:00:26,344 --> 00:00:31,766
more observations now within each interval. If we keep making the bin size

7
00:00:31,778 --> 00:00:36,979
bigger and bigger, eventually it gets kind of hard to see the shape of the

8
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:42,923
histogram because the bin sizes are too big. So here, the bin size is about 23.

9
00:00:43,682 --> 00:00:50,283
And if we keep going, of course, eventually, we get way too much data in each

10
00:00:50,295 --> 00:00:56,821
bin, and the shape of the histogram isn't even recognizable. So, let's get a

11
00:00:56,833 --> 00:01:03,359
smaller bin size. Here, you can kind of see better the shape of the histogram,

12
00:01:03,495 --> 00:01:09,463
that it peaks at around age 20. And so, it's really up to you to decide what bin

13
00:01:09,475 --> 00:01:15,200
size you want, and it all depends on what questions you want to answer. How much

14
00:01:15,212 --> 00:01:20,721
detail you want. because at some point, the bin size is probably too small, but

15
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:26,058
at some point the bin size is probably too big. In this software, you can also

16
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,900
see that the sample size is 50. You can see the average. And we're going to get

17
00:01:30,912 --> 00:01:36,030
to these statistics later. The link to this software is on the right, so you can

18
00:01:36,042 --> 00:01:40,559
click on it and input the data. We shared this data with you in a Google

19
00:01:40,571 --> 00:01:45,542
spreadsheet. And then, you can see for yourself how the shape of the histogram

20
00:01:45,554 --> 00:01:47,877
changes when you change the bin size.
