1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,070
Here's the answer.

2
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:05,720
The lower bound analysis says you take
the bisection width of logical network

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,930
and divide it by the bisection
width of the physical network.

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,732
So for example,
let's take fully-connected to hypercube.

5
00:00:12,732 --> 00:00:15,040
Fully-connected is o of p squared.

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:21,340
Hypercube is o of p, so the ratio of
fully-connected to hypercube is p.

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,820
So the lower bound suggests you
should expect some congestion.

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,820
What about complete binary tree to ring?

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,110
Complete binary tree has a bisection
of 1, and ring has a bisection of 2.

10
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:37,020
So the ratio,
one half is less than or equal to 1.

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,000
That tells us there might be a way
to do a congestion free mapping

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,600
from complete binary tree to ring.

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,900
So you can do the same
exercise on all the options.
