1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,950
Here is an awful picture.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,750
But, its picture comes from the paper
and I'll show you what we're doing.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,458
So this is our original picture.

4
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:09,200
I equal G0.

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,470
And in Laplacian pyramid,
the zero level is the finest level.

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,400
And that way, you always have the zero
level, and one would be filtered down

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,310
once, level two is filtered
a second time, level three.

8
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,140
And you can filter as many
times as you want to, up to n.

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,830
For n being some big number.

10
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,370
Okay, but the idea is you start at zero.

11
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,510
Sometimes people don't like that.

12
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,630
They typically want the,
the zero to be this most compact one.

13
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:33,347
But that doesn't make any sense.

14
00:00:33,347 --> 00:00:35,400
because really smart guy.

15
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,515
He wouldn't do that.
You start with your original image of

16
00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:39,630
zero and then you,
you keep filtering it down.

17
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,434
All right.

18
00:00:41,434 --> 00:00:43,760
So, that's our original image.

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,800
The first thing we have
is this reduce operator.

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,461
Okay?

21
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:50,623
And we're going to go over
these in some detail, but

22
00:00:50,623 --> 00:00:53,939
the reduce operator
essentially takes a Gaussian,

23
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:58,930
that's the convolution signal,
blurs it, and then this down arrow?

24
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,450
Down arrow here means down sampling.

25
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,660
So just taking every other pixel.

26
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,700
That would give you level one,
do it again,

27
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,080
you would get level two,
etc., etc., etc.

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,730
That one's sort of straightforward.

29
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,950
And like I said, we'll go
through the numbers in a minute.

30
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,790
The one that's a little less
clear is the expand operator.

31
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:20,660
Remember we have to expand these things
up so if I expand up the coursed one and

32
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:25,380
then I subtract that from G1,
that gives me L1.

33
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,940
That gives me the first Laplacian,
all right?

34
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,480
The expand operator is a little less
intuitive than the reduce operator.

35
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,460
Let me show you what they are.
