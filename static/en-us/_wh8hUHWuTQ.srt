00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,025
There are variety of ways that we could start this problem. But we're going to

2
00:00:05,037 --> 00:00:10,350
start by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4 and then distributing the 3

3
00:00:10,362 --> 00:00:15,650
with the quantity x plus 2. You can continue simplifying the problem combining

4
00:00:15,662 --> 00:00:21,660
like terms. This gives us negative 62 equals 9x. You can now divide both sides

5
00:00:21,672 --> 00:00:27,509
by 9, and our solution is negative 62 divided by 9 equals x.
