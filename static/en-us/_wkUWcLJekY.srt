1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,770
So a color image is also a function.

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:05,480
It's just that the value at each location is no

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,460
longer a single number that represents the light intensity.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,740
Instead, it can be a vector.

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,660
A vector that holds three different intensities for three color components.

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:23,100
For instance, each location in an RGB has values for Red, Green, and Blue.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,350
These values can be separated into three different channels or planes.

8
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,070
If you take all of the red intensity values in an image,

9
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,930
you have your red plane.

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:39,430
Similarly, if you take all the green intensity values, you get your green plane,

11
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,140
likewise, for blue.

12
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:47,400
Given this scheme where each location is associated with a tuple of three values

13
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,710
and assuming that each of these intensity values is a real number, and

14
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,940
so are the values for x and y.

15
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,810
How would you represent this image as a functional mapping?

16
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:05,110
Mark the expressions that correctly represent the desired functional mapping.
