1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,560
You know that the derivative of
one-half of x square in one dimension,

2
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:06,019
is simply x.

3
00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:07,609
So when you take that derivative for

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:11,690
each of the components of your vector,
you get the same components.

5
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:13,919
Therefore the answer is the third one.
