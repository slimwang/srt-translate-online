1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,450
The user defaults in the document
directory are valuable tools, but

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:04,400
they're not very inspiring.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,290
A complex app has a lot of
state while it's running.

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,700
I live in San Fransisco and I use an app
to keep track of the bus schedule.

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,100
While it's running, it's full of objects
that represent bus lines, bus stops and

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:14,880
schedules.

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,990
It even keeps a list
of my favorite lines.

8
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,980
These model objects are allocated in the
device's RAM while the app is running,

9
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,810
but I expect it to keep track of them
when the app is turned off as well.

10
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,180
That wouldn't be very good if it
couldn't persist some of the state.

11
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,375
If you have a sense that NSUserDefault
isn't a sophisticated enough system for

12
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,655
adding persistence to these apps,
you're right.

13
00:00:32,655 --> 00:00:35,415
The next two technologies we're going to
look at provide a more complete

14
00:00:35,415 --> 00:00:36,065
sense of state.

15
00:00:36,065 --> 00:00:38,405
In this lesson, we'll look at NSCoder,

16
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,915
and after that we'll be ready for
Core Data.

17
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:43,215
First, let's take a minute to consider
what state really looks like in

18
00:00:43,215 --> 00:00:43,735
a running app.
