1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,830
Suppose I start here.

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,968
I look to the left, and it goes down.

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,849
I look to the right, and it's going up.

4
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:10,089
So I'll take a step in that direction.

5
00:00:10,089 --> 00:00:11,619
>> And
what do you do when you reach the top?

6
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:16,769
>> Well, we will get stuck, just like
we did with the n-Queen's problem.

7
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:21,219
There's no immediate step that I can
do that has a positive gradient.

8
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:22,679
Everything is negative.

9
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:23,679
That's a bummer.

10
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:24,710
>> Is that a problem?

11
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,449
Didn't we want to get to a maximum?

12
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:29,280
>> We actually want to get
to the global maximum.

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,189
Looking at the graph we can see
that there's actually a taller

14
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:33,490
peak over here.

15
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,870
>> I see but
our computer agent doesn't know that.

16
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,609
It can only see what's one
step away from it, right?

17
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:40,570
So how are you going to get on stock?

18
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,780
>> Well, what if I just
start again somewhere else?
