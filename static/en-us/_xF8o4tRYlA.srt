00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,250
Here's an example of a connection table.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,665
As we can see each record contains the
most basic information about connection.

3
00:00:06,665 --> 00:00:10,770
In particular the source IP address,
source port, destination IP address,

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,010
destination port, and most importantly
the current connection state.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,060
For example whether it's established or
not.

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,500
Internally to the firewall,

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,090
there could be another data structure
that is linked to the connection table.

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:26,070
For example, for web traffic,
since a page can spend multiple packets,

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,520
this internal data structure
of the firewall can maintain

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,820
the contents of a page that
it has received so far.

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,060
That is, this data structure which
is linked to the connection table

12
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,200
will allow the firewall to perform more
specific analysis of the connection.
