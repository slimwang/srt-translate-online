1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,380
Early data standards were a list,
such as medical diagnoses,

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,370
laboratory tests, or medications.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:14,110
We refer to standards,
that is such a list as a classification.

4
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,960
More recently, attention has been
paid to describing more detail and

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,000
even relationships among
entities within a standard.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,750
We'll refer to a standard that can
code for relationships as an ontology.
