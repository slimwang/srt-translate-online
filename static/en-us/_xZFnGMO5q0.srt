1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,550
Remember the only way you can
really know which one is fastest is

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:04,510
by measuring.

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,828
So that's exactly what I'm going to do.

4
00:00:06,828 --> 00:00:09,720
I've got the site open and
I will click the click me button.

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,720
And you can see the times pop up.

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,672
The first one is about 3.3
milliseconds the second is 1.4, and

7
00:00:16,672 --> 00:00:19,840
the last is almost 400 milliseconds.

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,680
The middle selector is
the clear winner here.

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,810
However, things get a little
bit more interesting.

10
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,440
In fact, while we were filming this
course, we came to find out that

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,540
this last selector's awful
time is actually just a bug.

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,990
In fact, let me show you these same
numbers using web kits nightly build.

13
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,380
So this is the bleeding
edge version of web kit.

14
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,728
And I will click the same button.

15
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,050
Can you see those numbers?

16
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,170
Let me zoom in.

17
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,250
Holy cow!

18
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,280
These numbers speak for themselves.

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,410
The middle one is still the fastest, but

20
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,558
that 400 millisecond operation is
now only about 0.06 milliseconds.

21
00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:57,773
This goes to show just how important
it is to measure your performance,

22
00:00:57,773 --> 00:01:01,080
because, as times change,
so do the numbers.

23
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,500
So, this means that, for the moment,
the middle answer's the fastest.

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,670
But hey, that can change some day.

25
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,910
Make sure that you use the tools at
your disposal to keep measuring.
