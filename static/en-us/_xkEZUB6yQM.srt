1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So let's say we have a slightly more complicated grammar.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
T is our start symbol; it goes to (p Q r)

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
or (p Q s), so there are two strings in this grammar.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It will 100 percent increase, over the previous grammar--

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
(p Q r) and (p Q s) are both there--

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and the input is: (P q r)--wow, that's really lucky!

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That's one of the strings in the grammar.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's almost as if we planned these things in advance.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So now we'll give you a chance to try this out.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I have written down, here,

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
five possible facts about the parsing chart

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
for this grammar, on this 3-token input.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Chart[1] has this, chart[1] has that.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This is an element of chart[1], this is an element of chart[2].

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And what I'd like you to do in this multiple multiple choice quiz

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
is check all of the boxes that are correct.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So if we do see: big (Q) goes to little (q) dot,

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
from 1 in chart[2], check this box.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check all the boxes that apply.
