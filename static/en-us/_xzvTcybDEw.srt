1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We've just been talking about getting customers in a physical channel, but what's really interesting is

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
most startups kind of forget that it's much more expensive to get a customer than it is to keep one.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yet, we seem to go from order to order or user to user forgetting about thinking about all the time

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
is how can we extract more dollars or usage or whatever is

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
important to us from our existing customers.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
How we do that is the first thing we need to do is make sure our existing customers we've just gotten

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
don't go away, and so if you're in business long enough,

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
you'll start thinking about how to keep customers.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Some examples, well the airlines are the perfect examples of keeping customers.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
They run something called the loyalty programs.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
They give you points, they give you rewards, etc. for staying with their airline.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Credit card companies--boy, they love to keep you using their credit card because you know what

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
it's just a piece of plastic and they're loaning you money--anybody can do that,

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
but they want your business full-time, so they'll make up programs and things that make you think

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
about--oh, it will be terrible to leave this credit card with this airline because I loose all the points.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That's a great example of a loyalty program.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Or product updates, here's a way to keep me loyal is instead of just this one-time purchase,

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm getting these updates or newsletters or something useful through the lifetime of the product

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and Smart Companies not only do loyalty and product updates, sometimes they send me

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
newsletters and here's what's going on and here's whatever and how can we help you, etc.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Even though on day 1 you're not thinking about keeping customers

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
because you're desperately worried about getting them, just understand the next thing

23
00:01:50,000 --> 99:59:59,999
you're going to be doing is worrying about how to keep your most valuable customer.
