1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now, I'd like to give you a number of situations where you might be able

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
to use hypothesis tests.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
In which of these situations would it be helpful to use a hypothesis test?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Comparing crash rates of two different airlines with 100 flights each.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
In case you don't know but I assume most of you do, planes don't crash very often.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Comparing five-year auto repair rates on 100 vehicle samples.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Comparing the heights of the tallest buildings in two different cities.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And determining if a course improved test scores in some sample of students.
