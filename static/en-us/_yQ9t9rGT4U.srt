1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,370
Throughout this course we'll be using
an example application called app.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,070
In our app we have three applications.

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:10,110
Monolith, Hello and Off Service.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:15,130
The Monolith service combines
authentication and Hello micro services.

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,030
Let's run the monolithic application
now to see how it works.

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,840
Our application is built and we can
test this functionality using curl and

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,540
we can see we got a response back.

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,920
It's working.

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,630
Now let's try the secure end point.

10
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,920
The request fails because
we need to get a JWT token.

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,410
From the log in end point.

12
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,000
So let's do that now.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,640
I'm going to tie password at the prompt.

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,240
Now that I have a JWT token, can I can
hit the secure end point using curl and

15
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:43,890
it should work.

16
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,120
As expected everything is working now.

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,210
A couple of things about the example
service I should point out.

18
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,960
While it's a monolithic application.

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,060
It does leverage many principles
found in 12 factor applications.

20
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,780
For example,
we are logging to standard output so

21
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,750
logging tools can pick up our logs
without touching any log files.

22
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,160
You'll also notice the model of
application is self-contained.

23
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,939
We are but only all of our
dependencies in the vendor directory.

24
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,620
Following these practices make our
application easier to maintain and

25
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,420
deploy to the cloud, something
we're striving for in this course.

26
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,380
I'll kick it over to Carter to
explain more about 12 factor and

27
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,740
micro services in depth.
