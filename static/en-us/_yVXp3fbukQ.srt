00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,740
In the last lesson you
saw the ping command.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,370
Here's something else that it does.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,260
If you take the name of a host,
say a website like yahoo.com, and

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,320
ping it, you'll see an IP address
along with the ping results.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,650
The ping command has to look up
the IP address of the host first

6
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,520
before it can actually
send it a ping message.

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:26,854
Now ping keeps running forever
until you stop it with Ctrl+C.

8
00:00:26,854 --> 00:00:30,847
Alternately, as we saw before,

9
00:00:30,847 --> 00:00:37,208
you can tell it how many
pings to do with a -c option.

10
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:41,000
For instance, -c 7 will have it
send just 7 pings and then exit.

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,458
So now for an experiment.

12
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:48,323
Run ping google.com to see how long
it takes to get to a well-known host

13
00:00:48,323 --> 00:00:49,142
at Google.

14
00:00:49,142 --> 00:00:51,060
Type CTRL+C to exit ping.

15
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,684
What IP address is your ping using for
Google?

16
00:00:55,684 --> 00:01:00,117
And do you expect that everyone
who's doing this quiz is getting

17
00:01:00,117 --> 00:01:01,359
the same answer?

18
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,060
Yes or no.
