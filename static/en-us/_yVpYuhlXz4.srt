00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,300
This equation really represents a hyperbola. And it opens up and down. Nice

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,766
thinking if you got that correct. Now remember, we want to get the x squared

3
00:00:10,766 --> 00:00:15,070
and y squared term on the same side of the equation. So, I'm going to subtract

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:20,234
2x squared from both sides of the equation. This will leave us with 18 on the

5
00:00:20,234 --> 00:00:25,203
right, and 2y squared minus 2x squared on the left. Since we have a subtraction

6
00:00:25,203 --> 00:00:28,161
sign between the y squared and the x squared term, we know the conic is a

7
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:32,902
hyperbola. And since this y squared term comes first, we know that our

8
00:00:32,902 --> 00:00:38,588
hyperbola opens up and it opens down. We can put this equation into the general

9
00:00:38,588 --> 00:00:43,591
form that we recognize, by dividing each term by 18. We'll have y squared

10
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:48,260
divided by 9 minus x squared divided by 9 equals 1. And just to be sure, I can

11
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:53,068
show you that each of these equations represent the same exact hyperbola. The

12
00:00:53,068 --> 00:00:55,740
equations are just written in different forms.
