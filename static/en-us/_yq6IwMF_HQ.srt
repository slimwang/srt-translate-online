00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,800
Now that we have seen how, the semantic network knowledge representation,

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,250
enables problem solving, let us return to that earlier problem that we

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:14,280
were talking about. The problem of A is to B, as C is to 5.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,390
Recall that we have worked out the representations for both A is to B and

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:22,690
C is to 5. The question now becomes, whether we can use this representation,

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,520
to decide whether or not 5 is the correct answer. If we look at

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,630
the two representations in detail, then we see part of the representation here,

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,980
is the same as the representation here. Except that, this part is different from

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,080
this part. Here we have y expanded and right here, we have s remain unchanged.

10
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,776
So this may not be the best answer. Perhaps there is a better answer. Where

11
00:00:44,776 --> 00:00:47,950
the representation on the left, will exactly match representation on the right.
