1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,800
So this concludes the lesson on calibration.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,830
In the homework, you're going to use the theory we developed for direct linear

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,450
calibration, and we'll give you those images that have the three-dimensional

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:14,070
locations of the points and the two, and you get the images.

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,710
And you have to solve for the calibration.

6
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,170
And it's, it's interesting that you

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,130
can actually recover that relatively precisely.

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,500
In the next lessons, what we're going to do is we're going to move away

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,320
from the notion of rigidly calibrating the camera to the world.

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,550
And instead, we're going to talk about the relationship between

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,000
multiple cameras, specifically starting with two cameras.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,740
And that's going to eventually get to the point,

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,990
where we were talking about in stereo, that if you know the relationship between

14
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,950
cameras, that you can know where the epipolar lines are.

15
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,800
So basically, if I gave you some corresponding points,

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,050
you should be able to solve for the relationship between the cameras that will

17
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,280
allow you to find those epipolar lines.

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,930
And that's what we'll be doing over the next three or four lessons
