1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,952
So yeah, every aetional document starts with html. <<

2
00:00:03,952 --> 00:00:06,650
Okay. << Browsers are very forgiving. They will often just

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:08,610
like try to make something work, even if you don't

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,865
have the appropriate structure. But, it's best to follow it

5
00:00:11,865 --> 00:00:15,017
[CROSSTALK]. So then you've got your heading. << Header, heading,

6
00:00:15,017 --> 00:00:17,654
okay. << Yeah, so this is stuff that's not really,

7
00:00:17,654 --> 00:00:20,690
necessarily displayed on the page. So you've got the title,

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:24,690
you've got some some sort of like loading of attributes.

9
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:26,170
>> Okay, so wait.

10
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,120
This linking style/main. That's where it gets

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,480
the CSS that we were modifying earlier?

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,140
>> Yeah. This stuff seems to be about like mobile.

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:34,510
>> Okay.

14
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,370
>> Stuff, so it's not super relevant to figuring

15
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,610
out how things work. At least on the web

16
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,510
page. And then we've got the beginning of the

17
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,310
body, which is really like what's shown on the page.

18
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,825
>> Okay, and so, I mean this is, every time I look at

19
00:00:47,825 --> 00:00:51,390
html, I just see this wave of, you know, like indent and less.

20
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,570
More indented and less indented. How, how are you,

21
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,390
what do you thinking about when you're seeing this?

22
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,120
>> Yeah. So basically I want to look for two

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,930
things that are at the same indentation level. And that

24
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,570
tells me that, that's, so this is the beginning of

25
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,190
the block, and this is the end of the block.

26
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:04,709
>> Okay.

27
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,480
>> You also get this little closing guy, to say, you

28
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,550
know, I opened this div and now I closed this div.

29
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,460
>> You know, what is a div, why is it called a div, like...

30
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,670
>> I actually don't know why it's called a div, but.

31
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:14,930
>> Right.

32
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,690
>> Divs are sort of the basic building block

33
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,610
of websites. They're, they're just sort of

34
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:23,770
a thing. A a container for stuff. [LAUGH]

35
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:31,460
they're, they're sort of special kinds of things, like A is usually a, a link.

36
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:31,670
>> Okay

37
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,010
>> You've got forms.

38
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,695
>> What about, so, can you go back up a bit.

39
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:35,980
>> Mm-hm.

40
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,760
>> I mean, they all have this thing, this class.

41
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,850
Class container, class heading. So is that class just for

42
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,780
the, so when I'm writing the CSS file, and I want to

43
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,620
say everything that's a container is blue. Is that what it's for?

44
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,710
>> Pretty much, yeah. the, the JavaScript can also use these classes.

45
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,330
>> Okay.

46
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,970
>> It's, it's basically just a shorthand for saying

47
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,670
like, these are, these are similar things they should have,

48
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,350
they should look the same. You could have more specific

49
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,115
rules for like just a single one with an ID.

50
00:02:03,115 --> 00:02:07,040
>> Mm-hm. But mostly yeah, it's for, it's for

51
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,720
the CSS. You could just have all of the styles in line, but that's...

52
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,190
>> That's messy.

53
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:12,347
>> Yes.

54
00:02:12,347 --> 00:02:13,755
>> So that would be like, every time I had

55
00:02:13,755 --> 00:02:15,890
a, what I wanted to be container, I'd have to say.

56
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:16,980
>> You'd have to have all. Yeah.

57
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,035
>> Okay. Yeah. I don't want to do

58
00:02:18,035 --> 00:02:22,390
that. Okay so, paper divs. What are these H1's?

59
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,140
>> That's a header.

60
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,600
>> Okay P, what's P?

61
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,390
>> Paragraph.

62
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:27,890
>> Okay

63
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,600
>> I just sort of mixed the spacing around it. Standardized.

64
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,060
>> But it seems

65
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,550
like the Div is the more, like the really structural thing, and

66
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,770
this is the P's and the A's are just sort of like...

67
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,820
>> Things that go inside Divs usually, yeah. So, so Divs

68
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,320
can just be like a blob of text. They can be

69
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,150
a container that holds a bunch of different blobs of text.

70
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,070
It's really, sort of like the basic building block of HTML.

71
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,220
>> Okay.

72
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:52,480
>> Right.

73
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,450
>> Let me play around a bit and see if I can, you know, make some changes.

74
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:56,950
>> All right.

75
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:57,170
>> Thanks.
