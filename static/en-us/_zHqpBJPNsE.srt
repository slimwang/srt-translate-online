1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,940
So that's all of the things that the keyword this doesn't refer to.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,480
What is it that the keyword this will refer to?

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,990
Going back to our example of calling a function,

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,470
we notice that there's a dot to the left of this example.

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,030
When you notice a dot to the left of a function invocation,

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,720
meaning it was looked up as a property of an object,

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,690
you can look to the left of that dot and see what object it was looked up upon.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,490
The object that a function is looked up upon when it's being invoked,

9
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,800
that object is what the keyword, this, will be bound to.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,640
I'm giving you an approximate definition that is useful to get you out of 90%

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,980
of situations, because of course,

12
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,820
it may not be the case we use a dot to access this function.

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,920
We may, for example, use brackets.

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,770
And of course, in this example, it's also the case that,

15
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,950
that object to the left of the dot is the very same one that it

16
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,330
was defined originally to be a property of.

17
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,880
The fact that it's defined up here is a coincidence.

18
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,320
We could just as easily have called that same function as a property of

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,010
a different object provided it's stored as a method of that

20
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:59,400
second object as well.

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,030
In any case, it's not true that the object you

22
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,720
find a given function stored within will be what the keyword this refers to, nor

23
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,880
is it the case that an object, a function,

24
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,320
was originally defined with is going to be what the keyword this refers to.

25
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,530
In fact, it has everything to do with that call time dot and

26
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,410
the object that we find to the left of it.
