1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,930
So you're going to need to tell the back-end API which client apps are allowed

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,391
to use it. So here I am in

3
00:00:07,391 --> 00:00:12,397
the ConferenceAPI.java class, up where I'm specifying the,

4
00:00:12,397 --> 00:00:17,290
the endpoints API. And you'll notice that it has the client IDs. And this one

5
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:21,810
here, the Constants.API.EXPLORER_CLIENT_ID is the client ID for

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,822
the APIs Explorer and then this one here,

7
00:00:24,822 --> 00:00:29,115
Constants.WEB_CLIENT_ID, this is where we're specifying the client

8
00:00:29,115 --> 00:00:31,968
IDs of other apps, not the APIs Explorer,

9
00:00:31,968 --> 00:00:37,570
but other web apps that are allowed to use this application. And if you knew the

10
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,340
client ID, you could just write it out here if you wanted, but we're using this

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,630
Constants class to hold our, our WEB_CLIENT_ID. So,

12
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,530
lets take a look at the constants class.

13
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,440
And you'll see here in the Constants class that we

14
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,763
define the client ID and to start with, there's no value,

15
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:58,470
so lets replace this with your client ID. So, yeah,

16
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,501
it is a value, but it's not a real value. So

17
00:01:00,501 --> 00:01:02,640
you're going to need to go ahead and put your client

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,110
ID in here. And just a reminder that you get your

19
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,930
client ID in the developers console. And the client ID

20
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,150
includes everything. It's not just the number. It's the whole thing

21
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,440
that you see in the developers console up to

22
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,740
the .com part, if you see that on yours. And

23
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,740
you can just copy and paste the client ID from

24
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,730
the developers console. What we've done is that we've set

25
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:29,930
that the applications with web client ID as specified

26
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,840
are allowed to access our endpoints APIs, so we basically

27
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,400
granted permission to the UI to use our endpoints. But

28
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,920
another thing you have to do is that on the

29
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,314
client side, on the JavaScript side, on the web,

30
00:01:43,314 --> 00:01:46,260
the web app UI side, you have to, when

31
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,700
the, when the user logs in, you need to

32
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:53,260
run the authentication process, so you need to identify yourself.

33
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,100
So you'll need to go into the web app

34
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,800
folder and then into the js folder and this time

35
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,960
you're going to have to go to app.js. One of

36
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,920
the things that this file does is that it runs

37
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,768
your authentication process when, when a user logs in.

38
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,719
And you're going to need to set the appropriate client

39
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:13,595
ID in here, so you can go ahead and

40
00:02:13,595 --> 00:02:19,710
search for CLIENT-ID. And it's uppercase CLIENT-ID. And you'll

41
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,509
see here again that the CLIENT-ID is just a,

42
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:25,164
a placeholder. So you're going to need to put

43
00:02:25,164 --> 00:02:27,554
your client ID right here. And again, that's a

44
00:02:27,554 --> 00:02:30,650
client ID that you get from the developers console.

45
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,300
Here it's being used for the client ID to

46
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,860
identify itself during the authentication process. So, here's my

47
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,540
client ID and then of course, save it. And

48
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,110
it hasn't mattered until now that the client ID wasn't

49
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,540
set here because we haven't been using the webpages

50
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,570
in the Conference Central application to test our functions. I

51
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,354
think if you try to log in using the

52
00:02:53,354 --> 00:02:56,580
webpages, you will have found that it didn't work because

53
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,190
it didn't have its CLIENT_ID set. Another thing you

54
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,570
need to make sure is that your consent screen

55
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:05,639
has a product name. So again, you'd go to

56
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:09,285
your project in the developers console, go to APIs &

57
00:03:09,285 --> 00:03:13,461
auth. Then you click Consent screen here, down here.

58
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:15,394
And then first thing you see is it shows you

59
00:03:15,394 --> 00:03:18,670
what your consent screen would look like. And this

60
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,010
is the screen that gets shown to users when they

61
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,360
go to use your application. And you do need to

62
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,364
scroll down. Don't be put off that it's a little

63
00:03:26,364 --> 00:03:30,130
bit faded. Just go ahead and scroll down. The email

64
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,000
address does need to have a value. And then specify

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,830
a product name for your application, basically your application name.

66
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,730
Okay, one last thing you need to do is to

67
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,530
add the JavaScript Cross-Origin in the client application. So for

68
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,540
this, you're going to go back to the credentials screen in

69
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,520
the developer console, and your client ID for

70
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,750
web application. You're going to add your JavaScript origins.

71
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,340
So click Edit Settings. Make sure you're in the

72
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,410
right box for JavaScript Origins and then you need

73
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:05,750
to add two here. You need to add the URL for where your app is when it's

74
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,440
running on appspot and you need to add the

75
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,660
URL for localhost. You'd go ahead and add those.

76
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,460
If your app running on appspot, you do

77
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,660
need to specify HTTPS for secure connection. For the

78
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,340
app running on localhost, it's just HTTP, because

79
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,690
the dev server running on localhost doesn't support HTTPS.

80
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:30,040
So you go ahead and you add those and you say Update, and basically what this is

81
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,080
doing is it's giving permission to these URLs

82
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,760
to run JavaScript to access your app. And you

83
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,300
need to do this even though this is the app itself, right?

84
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:47,040
I'm in here. My app is cake-hut and I'm giving permission to cake-hut

85
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,010
to run JavaScript to access cake-hut. And after you've done all of

86
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:56,400
these things, you should find that the My Profile page works for you.
