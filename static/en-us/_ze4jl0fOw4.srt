00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,350
We have actually come across the notion of frames earlier,

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,550
when we were talking about production systems.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,700
You may recall we had a diagram like this, where we had procedural, semantic and

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,240
episodic knowledge, and the working memory container structure like this.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,570
You can see this is really a frame, here are the slots, here are the values for

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:21,150
the slots. We can think of these frames as capturing conceptual knowledge,

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,650
that is stored in the semantic memory. So let's take an example.

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:29,250
Suppose an input is a shark ate a frog. Remember the word ate there, and

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,160
that verb ate gets returned to working memory, and the entire frame for

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,750
ate gets pulled out. Once this frame is pulled out of semantic memory,

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,520
it immediately generates expectations. So we now know, that ate is likely to

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,210
have a subject, an object and location, perhaps time utensils and so

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,400
on. So we can ask ourselves the question, well what will go, under subject here?

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,480
What will go under object here? And in the sentence a shark ate a frog.

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,950
This frame tells us, what to look for. As a result of which, the processing is

16
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,420
not just bottom up, coming from natural language or the world in general, and

17
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,750
going into mind. Also, mind provides knowledge structures like frames,

18
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:11,830
which, structured knowledge representations, which generate expectations and

19
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,480
make the processing, partially top down.
