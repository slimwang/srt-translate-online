1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,780
So in workflows, we were able to say whenever an entry is created or whatever,

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,140
we're not doing that here, and that's because

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,140
we're manually hitting the submit for approval button.

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:08,620
>> Exactly.

5
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:13,270
>> Okay. Okay, so select approver using the options below.

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:17,830
Who should this approval request be assigned to? So this again

7
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,380
is something that would be a lot more dynamic if we

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,600
had a lot of users in our orginization that had roles.

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:22,950
>> Okay.

10
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,180
>> You could assign it specifically based off of the role

11
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,840
hierarchy in the company. Because maybe you want certain managers to approve it.

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,020
>> So that would be the hierarchy field, I assume?

13
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,240
>> Yep. Or you could, you know, choose that

14
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,150
Approver manually. Assign it to a queue. In this

15
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,460
case we're just going to automatically assign it to ourselves

16
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,280
since we're the only user that could approve anyway.

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,520
>> So what does that mean. Who should I?

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,940
>> Automatically Assign Approvers, and then just choose Yourself.

19
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,640
>> Save?

20
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,100
>> And

21
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,750
Save. So, I just want to call out, that that's really not the

22
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:58,560
most realistic, as far as, you know, we would always be the approver.

23
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,990
The real dynamic, you know, power behind approval processes, is that you could

24
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:06,140
get anyone that needs to approve it, based off of their role, or.

25
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,780
>> Their position in the company, yeah.

26
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,750
>> Mm-hm. Alright. So this is explaining how

27
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,610
you're going to build out the approval process. So this

28
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,490
is another one of those setup windows that, if

29
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,260
I weren't here right now, this is how you'd

30
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,160
teach yourself how to do it.

31
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:16,500
>> Sure.

32
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,500
>> But let's just go to the Approval Process Detail Page.
