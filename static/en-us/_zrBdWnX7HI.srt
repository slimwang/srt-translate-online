00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,370
We'll write a new test suite
called Async Address Book and

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:09,400
within that test suite, we'll have a new
spec, it should grab initial contacts.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,870
I've instantiated my variable again,
new address book, and

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:17,060
then I call my
getInitialContacts method.

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,100
Now remember this is
an asynchronous function.

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,310
After I call that,
I have an expectation here, that,

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,220
I expect addressBook.initialComplete
to be true.
