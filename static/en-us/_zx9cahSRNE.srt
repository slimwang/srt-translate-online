00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,888
Well, most of the students are from China, but it was probably really difficult

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,733
for you to tell from only having the table for 4 seconds. You were probably able

3
00:00:09,745 --> 00:00:14,331
to glance at the table and see a lot of China written there and so, you might

4
00:00:14,343 --> 00:00:19,305
have had a sense of which country occurred most frequently. Your brain naturally

5
00:00:19,317 --> 00:00:24,540
does this, but with statistics We need to be able to formalize this procedure in

6
00:00:24,552 --> 00:00:29,526
an easy way. That's okay if you didn't get it right this time. The whole point

7
00:00:29,538 --> 00:00:34,318
was to show you that by just having the table, it's difficult to make quick

8
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,653
conclusions. So what's a better way?
