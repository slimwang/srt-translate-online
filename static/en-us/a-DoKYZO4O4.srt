1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,210
>>I'm here with a good friend of mine, Becky, who has narcolepsy and we're

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,100
going to talk to her a little bit more about it. So when were you first

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,470
diagnosed with narcolepsy? >>Probably it was the end of my freshman year of

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:16,420
high school and I was, had good sleep habits. Like I had younger siblings so I

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:21,910
still went to bed 9 o'clock at night, 10 o'clock at the latest. And I was still

6
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:26,010
so tired, like, I would come home from school and I would take a nap right

7
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,360
away. And I was playing soccer, so, sometimes I'd be at soccer practice and

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:36,200
then take a nap, wake up and go to my next soccer practice. And, I was also

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,150
falling asleep in a lot of my classes. We went and saw Finding Nemo and I fell

10
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,450
asleep in it, and I wasn't tired, it was the last day of school, I was super

11
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,690
excited to be summer break. And then I went and saw it a couple of weeks later

12
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:51,240
and fell asleep almost the same time in the movie again. For only like 10

13
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:56,200
minutes and then I woke up, so that's when I realized, why am I so tired? And

14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,490
then I, my parents just kind of thought I was being a lazy teenager and then I

15
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:06,420
started to show the signs of cataplexy, where you lose muscle control during

16
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,650
strong emotions. So when I'd laugh, my mom started noticing my facial features,

17
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,710
they kind of like droop, because you just can't control them, and my neck

18
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:18,210
would, like, drop. And she started noticing that, so that's when we decided to

19
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,470
go to a doctor. So we went to a general practitioner that we'd never used

20
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,430
before, and we told him my symptoms, and he's like, have you done drugs? And

21
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,040
I'm like, no, I've never done anything. I had never even drank alcohol at all

22
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,500
yet. And he was like, so you've never done this, this, this, listed like ten

23
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,970
drugs, and I'm like, no, no, no, no, and he's like, then I don't know what you

24
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:41,460
have. So then we went to my pediatrician and we told him like, she's tired all

25
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,460
the time and she loses muscle control and he was like, I think you have

26
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:49,855
narcolepsy. And then I went to a pediatric neurologist.

27
00:01:49,855 --> 00:01:53,370
>> By the way, she's like, you can't drive anymore. And I was like, right when I

28
00:01:53,370 --> 00:02:00,490
got my permit, so I was really upset about that. And then I did the EEG and 24

29
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:05,930
hours sleep study at a center and lastly they did an MRI on my head and then I

30
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,575
got diagnosed with narcolepsy.

31
00:02:07,575 --> 00:02:12,300
>> What is it like to live with narcolepsy? It's kind of just something that's

32
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,120
always in the back of my head, like and my parents, and my fiance, like

33
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,670
whenever I'm going to drive anywhere they're like make sure you're not too

34
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:25,110
tired. Every day is different, like sometimes I'll have to take a nap at 2

35
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,240
o'clock or sometimes I'll want to take a nap at work like at 10:30 in the

36
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,010
morning. And usually when I do take a nap I really only need to sleep for like

37
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:39,500
ten minutes and I'll feel refreshed. So I'll just literally lay my head down on

38
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,550
my desk and I'll fall asleep in like 20 seconds and I'll set a timer, and then

39
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,430
I'll wake back up. Luckily, at my job I have right now, I have my own office so

40
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,400
I'll just like close the door to my office and just lay down on my desk. But

41
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,670
it's something I always think about. Like, the other day I wanted to like rush

42
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:58,180
and go to the gym and then rush and meet my mom somewhere, and it was kind of

43
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:03,030
across town and I was like, can I drive? Like, should I lay down for 15 minutes

44
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,630
and take a nap? So I always have to think about that. When I was working at my

45
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:11,600
job before this I was like clocked out on a break and I went into like a back

46
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,750
room and I set my timer and I fell asleep in like a chair, like this. And my

47
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:21,330
boss came in and she suspended me for taking a nap at work. And I was like, so

48
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,965
upset. I was like, here's my timer, it was going to go off in like one minute.

49
00:03:24,965 --> 00:03:29,350
>> And I was like I have narcolepsy which I wrote on the application and then the

50
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:34,910
next day I brought my note from my neurologist that said I have narcolepsy and

51
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:38,860
they like paid me for the hours that I missed and everything but I was very

52
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,044
upset when I got in trouble for taking a nap.

53
00:03:41,044 --> 00:03:45,650
>> Is there anything you want to tell people about the disorder. I kind of want

54
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:50,692
people to know that there are a lot of different levels and like extemetires of

55
00:03:50,692 --> 00:03:54,270
narcolepsy. Like a lot of people when I tell them I have narcolepsy they're

56
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:58,920
really surprised and then they bring up that one Deuce Bigalow movie where the

57
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,085
girl's like trying to bowl. And I guess some people can fall asleep like

58
00:04:04,085 --> 00:04:08,180
mid-sentence but I can't, so it sometimes, it kind of annoys me that people are

59
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:12,680
like, oh, can you fall asleep right now? I'm like, no, I can't. If I try to

60
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:19,019
fall at any time I will but not while I'm doing something. It really bothers me

61
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:24,110
when people that, I guess don't know I have narcolepsy or forget I do Think

62
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:27,960
it's funny when I do fall asleep somewhere. And I guess another thing I want

63
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,820
people to know is a really odd symptom of narcolepsy is that it's really hard

64
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:38,580
to sleep at night. because I guess since you go into REM sleep so fast that I

65
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,330
never sleep for more than like three hours straight. I always will wake up So

66
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:48,590
I'd like get a good nights sleep but I would wake up at least like ten times a

67
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,430
night, and just be awake for like a minute and then I'll fall back asleep.
