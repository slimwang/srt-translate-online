00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,460
Let's look through a few more of these problems on complexity classes.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,029
Again I would like you to check whichever ones you think are true

3
00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:09,800
and leave unchecked the ones you think are false.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,580
The first one, all problems solvable in exponential time by a deterministic RAM

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,160
take polynomial time on a nondeterministic RAM.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,250
Number 2, it is likely that randomization algorithms can solve some NP-complete

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,250
problems in expected polynomial time.

8
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:30,790
And finally, if Pâ‰ NP, some NP-complete problems do not have constant-factor

9
00:00:30,790 --> 99:59:59,999
approximation algorithms that run in polynomial time.
