1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,310
Let's take a look at the code in
the UIViewController (Record) category

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,570
in the Objective C project.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,280
To create this ActionSheet,

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,660
first we'll need to rewrite the method
presentVideoOptions.Then we need to

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,385
connect that method to the record button
instead of launch a video camera.

6
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:19,715
So let's switch back to
the swift project and

7
00:00:19,715 --> 00:00:23,865
rewrite this method in our
uIviewController swift extension.

8
00:00:23,865 --> 00:00:27,060
Okay, here we are back in
the swift version of GIF maker.

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,080
In our UIViewController swift extension.

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,290
We've created the function
presentVideoOptions and

11
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,060
first we need to check if
the camera's available.

12
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,660
If the camera's not available,
we want to launch the photo library

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,290
which we'll just put in comments for
now.

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,945
If the camera is available we create an
action sheet of type UIAlertController.

15
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,540
Next, we need to create three
actions to add to the ActionSheet.

16
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,950
Here's the first one, recordVideo.

17
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,850
It'll have the default style and

18
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,170
the completion handler will call
the method launchVideoCamera.

19
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,170
Here's the second action,
chooseFromExisting.

20
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,010
It also has the default style and
this action will call the method

21
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,570
launchPhotoLibrary, which again,
we'll just put in comments for now.

22
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,440
The third action is cancel.

23
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,860
There's a designated style for

24
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,470
cancel, and
we can leave the completion handler nil.

25
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,464
Then we add each of the three
actions to the ActionSheet.

26
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,990
Finally, we present the ActionSheet and

27
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,820
set the tint color of
the titles to pink.

28
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,410
In the end, the ActionSheet
will look something like this.
