1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,220
All right, so I downloaded the play
arrow icons from the material design

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:07,630
site, and included all the versions
in their respective drawable folders.

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,000
Now I need to change the layout
to include these play arrows.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,170
And we need to make this change
in our list item layout.

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,620
So this is going to be kind
of a tricky layout change.

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,780
Because currently I have a horizontal
linear layout as the root element for

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,600
my list item layout.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,380
So if I were to add the play icon
as a third child in this layout,

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,150
then I won't get the colored
background behind it.

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,795
In order to have the play arrow
overlap the color background,

11
00:00:31,795 --> 00:00:34,335
I switch my layout to a relative layout.

12
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:37,425
Now figuring this out took me a couple
rounds of trial and error and

13
00:00:37,425 --> 00:00:39,675
I didn't get all the attributes
correct at first.

14
00:00:39,675 --> 00:00:43,445
Also there are multiple ways that you
could've implemented the same layout and

15
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:45,280
this is just how I decided to do it.

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,180
So in our case I made the image view
the first child in the relative layout.

17
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,030
And since the views get added to the top
left by default, I didn't need to add

18
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,800
any special attributes related
to positioning this view.

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,470
Then here we have two vertical linear
layouts that contain the two text views.

20
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,460
So they'll have the same
colored background according

21
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,310
to the theme of the category.

22
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:09,620
So these text views should be aligned to
the parent's top right and bottom edges.

23
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,470
We also must specify that it's
located to the right of the image.

24
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,140
Otherwise, they would end
up overlapping the image.

25
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,000
Next, we can place the player
on top of the LinearLayout.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,470
And so we add this as an image
view where the source

27
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,480
is pointing to the image drawable
that we added to the app.

28
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,900
Now in terms of positioning,

29
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,268
we want the play icon to align to
the right edge of the relative layout.

30
00:01:32,268 --> 00:01:35,110
We also want to center
it within the parent, so

31
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:38,560
we specify here center
vertical equal true.

32
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,560
Now according to the red
lines in the quiz,

33
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,150
we want 16 dips of space from
the right edge of the screen.

34
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,630
So to do that we added a right
margin of 16 dips on the ImageView.

35
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:51,750
So when you make those changes in
the code, this is what the XML for

36
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,780
those items should look like now.

37
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,680
So here we have a RelativeLayout as
the root view for the layout and

38
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,370
then we have our ImageView followed
by the vertical LinearLayout

39
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,910
with two TextViews inside of it.

40
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,070
So to the LinearLayout we just added,

41
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,598
we need to add some new
RelativeLayout parameters to it.

42
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,300
And what I mean by that is that I
fix the height of the list item

43
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,740
to be a list item height dimensions.

44
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,190
Otherwise the color background wasn't
stretching across the entire list item

45
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,100
though I wanted it to.

46
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,350
And I did that with the three
aligned parent attributes here.

47
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,360
So align parent bottom,
align parent right and

48
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,220
align parent top are all set to true.

49
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,240
And last but
not least our relative layout.

50
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,890
We have a new ImageView for
the play arrow.

51
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,690
So it has a height and
width of both 24 DPs.

52
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,872
It's also aligned to
the right of the parent.

53
00:02:40,872 --> 00:02:45,248
It's vertically centered and
has a right margin of 16 DPs.

54
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:49,335
And when you're done making these code
changes, don't forget to reformat that

55
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:53,750
xml to make sure that the attributes
follow the Android code cell guidelines.

56
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,240
And so here's how you do that.

57
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,870
From the project view,

58
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:01,630
highlight the file that you want, head
up here to Code, and then Reformat Code.

59
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,110
And when this pop-up pops up asking, do
you want to reformat the selected files?

60
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,927
Go ahead and click OK.

61
00:03:07,927 --> 00:03:11,710
All right, so now we want to
run the app on our device.

62
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,340
Let's tap into the Numbers activity and
see how that looks.

63
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,860
Whoa, it's looking a lot better now.

64
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,770
So now we have the player showing up for
all the items in the list.

65
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,490
Let's double check for
all the other categories as well.

66
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,967
All right,
play arrows are in the Family activity.

67
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:27,650
We have play arrows in
the Colors activity and same for

68
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,740
the Phrases activity.

69
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,300
So now let's go back through and

70
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,760
test the audio playback to make sure
that it still works in each list.

71
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,287
>> [FOREIGN]

72
00:03:38,287 --> 00:03:40,642
[BLANK_AUDIO]

73
00:03:40,642 --> 00:03:42,070
[FOREIGN]

74
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,102
[BLANK_AUDIO]

75
00:03:44,102 --> 00:03:45,379
[FOREIGN]

76
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:48,142
[BLANK_AUDIO]

77
00:03:48,142 --> 00:03:51,930
[FOREIGN]
>> All right, so it's all sounding good.

78
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,990
And lastly we want to test that
the layout looks fine when we rotate

79
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:58,550
the device and end up taking more
horizontal space on the screen.

80
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,870
So let's check that for
all our activities.

81
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,230
All right, fantastic.

82
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,550
So the audio playback feature
is now more easily discoverable,

83
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,720
leading to a better user experience.

84
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,190
So a new user can tell that
clicking on a list item

85
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,440
will play the pronunciation
of each word.

86
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:12,940
Great job.
