00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,860
I hinted earlier in the lesson about architectural description languages. These

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:10,590
are, as it sounds, notations for describing architectures. They provide an extra

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,990
modicum of formality and precision, that goes beyond just having a diagram.

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,718
Moreover, by having that extra precision, it then enables some tool support. For

5
00:00:20,718 --> 00:00:25,990
example, building to diagram the tool. Diagram a solution in such a way,

6
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:30,360
that the diagramming tool can check for whether you've done things well.

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,980
Analyzers, okay, for determining the structural properties and

8
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,060
behavioral properties of your system. And even simulators.

9
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:43,470
I've listed here some of the popular architectural description languages.

00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,090
The one that we'll be looking at a little bit later is called Acme.
