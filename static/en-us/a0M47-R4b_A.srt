00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,482
Now that we know that f of x is equal to x minus 2 times x squared minus 2x

2
00:00:03,482 --> 00:00:07,142
minus 3, let's see if can go from here to writing the function in its fully

3
00:00:07,142 --> 00:00:14,800
factored form. Lucky for us, we know how to factor x squared minus 2x minus 3.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,198
So, please factor this and write the two factors in these two boxes. That will

5
00:00:19,198 --> 00:00:21,479
give us the fully factored form of f of x.
