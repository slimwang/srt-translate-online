1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, so the first thing we'd like to do is

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
take this form out of the temporary file we were playing with before

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and put it in our application.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Okay, so what we're going to do is we're going to create a new variable

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
at the top of this file called "form."

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We'll use triple quotes, which allows us to enter longer strings,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
paste in our form, close this up, save it.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Now, instead of printing out the string "Hello, webapp World!"

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I want to print out the string of our form, so let's make that change.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We're going to just return form instead of that string.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Let's go to our browser and see how this looks.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Okay, here we are in our browser, and we're going to reload,

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and we should see probably the form from our little text file.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
A-ha, this is not what I was expecting.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I was expecting to see the form from our previous HTML,

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
but instead we've got the HTML itself.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Why do we see raw HTML instead of our text box in the browser?

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Is it because Google App Engine can only send raw HTML?

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Our browser is misconfigured?

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We're sending the wrong Content-Type header?

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Or our HTML is invalid?
