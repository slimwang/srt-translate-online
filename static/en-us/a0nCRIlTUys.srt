1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,529
All right, without further ado, let's
write our first two lines of Swift code.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,580
In the box below,
you see these two lines.

3
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:10,550
Press the Test Run button and
see what happens.

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,740
You should see this output
below the code area.

5
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:17,609
Okay, now I'm going to write a response
just by copying the same syntax.

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:23,600
I'll change up the names used here, and
here, and then I'll use a new string.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,670
I'll say, yeah, I'm ready.

8
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:28,820
Now you try, and write your own
custom response between the quotes.

9
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,280
Once you have both lines written
try pressing Test Run again.

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,195
[BLANK_AUDIO]

11
00:00:37,195 --> 00:00:38,539
And now I see this output.
