1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,770
Now, you're going to
set up your cluster.

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:07,360
Open a browser, go to the public
hosting of the server on port 8080.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,540
You can see mine here.

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,560
If you can't connect check
the security rules for the server and

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,110
make sure the port
eighty eighty is open.

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:21,160
Log on with username admin and it's
pretty clear what you should do here.

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,070
Launch install wizard,
name your cluster.

8
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,190
Next, select the stack,

9
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,470
this determines the software
versions installed on the cluster.

10
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,030
Choose the newest one HDP2.3.

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,540
This stands for
hurting works data platform.

12
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,970
Here, you list the host names of
the computers in the cluster or

13
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:40,970
the internal host names.

14
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,040
I had a copy.

15
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,850
Copy goes into here.

16
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:48,840
Upload your SSH private key and
change the user account to Ubuntu.

17
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,020
Okay, hit register and

18
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,710
confirm, everything should
install register just fine.

19
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,930
You should see a big list of services
that you can install on the cluster.

20
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,109
For now, just do HDFS, Yarn,
Zookeeper and Umbari Metrics.

21
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:06,880
Now, you can choose the hosts
that the various services run on.

22
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,010
Umbari has reasonable suggestions, but

23
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:14,260
you can see here that there
is one service per computer.

24
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,760
Instead let's move the metrics
collector to this computer, so

25
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,350
it runs with the zookeeper server.

26
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,450
So, this is 172.31 15 30,

27
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,730
Metrics collector, so
let's put it there, then hit next.

28
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,250
Now, you need to assign data nodes and
clients.

29
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:35,360
Node manager here worked with Yarn to
keep track of the data node resources.

30
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,980
Client, installs all these
clients on machines.

31
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:42,140
Since these hosts are running
master components,

32
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,330
make these three data
nodes with node managers.

33
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:50,730
And next, you shouldn't need to
customize any services right now.

34
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:55,560
But look around to see which options
you can change okay, and ignore this.

35
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,830
Okay, finally you can deploy it.

36
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,460
This might take a few minutes, so take a
break by visiting your favorite website.

37
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,910
All right, and there we go.

38
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:05,790
Everything is running.
