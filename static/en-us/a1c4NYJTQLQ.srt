00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,560
The purpose of this lesson is not
to teach you how to do analytics.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,960
We've got other courses for that.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,590
Here we'll look at the end results that
are being achieved by aggregating and

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,270
then analyzing data, at least in
part from digital health records.

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:19,130
We're clearly heading into a new
era of medicine and healthcare.

6
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,310
And this lesson's intended to
give you at least a feel for

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,550
what it might be like.
