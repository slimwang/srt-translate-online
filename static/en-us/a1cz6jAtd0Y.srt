00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,017
Let's see what would happen if the order of rotation and scaling were reversed.

2
00:00:04,018 --> 00:00:08,186
That is, first we rotate and then we'd scale our sphere. For our clock exercise

3
00:00:08,186 --> 00:00:13,045
the result would look like this, the rotation seems to have had no effect. Think

4
00:00:13,045 --> 00:00:17,486
about what the order off operations actually does to the object. First we rotate

5
00:00:17,486 --> 00:00:21,310
the sphere. This has little effect of what we see on the screen. The sphere

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,033
looks pretty much the same from any angle. So by doing the rotation first, we've

7
00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:29,415
essentially lost its effect. Stretching the sphere afterwards gives us the shape

8
00:00:29,415 --> 00:00:33,505
we want but the rotation's already been done. At this point, I want to show you

9
00:00:33,505 --> 00:00:38,038
a great program for experimentation. The Three.js Interactive Scene Editor. See

10
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:42,234
the additional course materials for link to this program. To start, let's add a

11
00:00:42,234 --> 00:00:46,950
sphere to the scene. It comes in black as there's really no lightning of scene.

12
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:52,848
So let's add a directional light, put it over here. And select our sphere. We

13
00:00:52,848 --> 00:00:56,550
can move our sphere around. And you can see the change of position over here.

14
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,389
You can also rotate it. And obviously, it doesn't look very different, because

15
00:01:01,389 --> 00:01:05,660
it's a sphere. But you can also non uniformly scale it. So here, we've scaled it

16
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:09,740
a bit. And I can rotate it, and you can see the effect. Give this program a try.

17
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:14,156
It's really excellent for figuring out how rotations, scales, and positions work

18
00:01:14,156 --> 00:01:14,773
together.
