1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,450
Throughout this course, we're going to
use Xcode's debugging tools to fix

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,580
problems in the So Many Bugs app.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,080
That's what you see here.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,210
When you launch the app you should
see this scene selection screen and

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,110
it contains buttons for
different buggy versions of the app.

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,170
I'll go ahead and run the final
version that contains no bugs.

7
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,590
At least, no bugs that I know about.

8
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,010
The app's pretty simple,
it starts with this main screen and

9
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,630
has this ominous spider
web in the background.

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,910
And if I tap the screen,
a spider should crawl on.

11
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:32,740
So there's our first spider, and I'll
go ahead and spawn a couple more, so

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,900
that you can see them all
animating at the same time.

13
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:36,790
And one more.

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,080
If I select the gear icon in
the upper right-hand corner,

15
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,410
then I can adjust the types of
the spiders that we're spawning.

16
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,320
So I'll pick this angry
red spider here and

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,390
go ahead an spawn an angry red spider.

18
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,670
And let's spawn some of
the other types as well.

19
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,070
So I'll spawn a blue one.

20
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:58,930
And spawn a green one.

21
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:01,040
There's our green one.

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,750
So as you can see,
the black spiders are basic.

23
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,740
The red spider here is pretty fast,
kind of angry looking.

24
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,920
The green spider's smooth,
calm, and collected.

25
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,020
And this blue spider is just
kind of dorky and slow.

26
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,410
If you want to know more about
how the animations are done,

27
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,180
