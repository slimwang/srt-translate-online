00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,080
If you recall when we looked at the
application, we had three buttons across

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,520
the top of the screen, and we had
the map fragment itself underneath them.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,860
And the basic UI that Android Studio
created for us had a single text view.

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:12,800
So delete that and

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,770
replace it with the layout code
that's in the instructor notes.

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:21,170
This is made up of a LinearLayout which
is set to be in vertical orientation.

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,490
And within this LinearLayout I then
have another LinearLayout at the top

8
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,490
which contains the three buttons.

9
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,960
And as you can see my three buttons
are Button Map, Button Satellite, and

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,530
Button Hybrid.

11
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,950
And then underneath this LinearLayout
for the buttons is the fragment itself

12
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:40,080
containing the map fragment similar
to what we've been doing earlier on.

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,770
So I have a linear layout putting the
buttons on top and the map underneath.

14
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,010
And then the second linear layout
within the first has the buttons

15
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,980
horizontally stacked side by side,
as you can see here.

16
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,770
So now if I run the application
you'll see I have the basic map

17
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,960
with the three buttons.

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,510
They won't do anything yet, because I
haven't written the code behind them.

19
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,630
Try it out yourself, see what happens,
and check your error log for details.

20
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:05,530
Typically if you have problems it's
the API key hasn't been setup properly.

21
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,990
And after we wire up the buttons
we'll take a look at how to do that.
