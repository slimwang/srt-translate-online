00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,906
Well, we can easily see that ten students are from the US. To find out how many

2
00:00:05,918 --> 00:00:11,284
students are from the US, China, or Pakistan, we'll just add 10 plus 1 plus 12,

3
00:00:11,296 --> 00:00:17,291
which is 23. And finally, the two countries with the fewest students look like

4
00:00:17,303 --> 00:00:22,728
they're Pakistan and Sweden. See how easy it is to quickly analyze data when

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,864
it's organized in a coherent way? By doing so, we can quickly describe data, see

6
00:00:27,876 --> 00:00:28,565
patterns, and make decisions.
