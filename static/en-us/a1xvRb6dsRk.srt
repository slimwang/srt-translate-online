1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:06,160
Now let us consider another situation. Suppose that our pitcher actually

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,210
was able to walk the batter. So, now, there are runners on the first, second,

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:14,730
ands third bases. Not just on the second and third bases, but one on the first,

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:20,410
also. So the picture succeeded in accomplishing it's goal in the last shot.

5
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,990
So the current situation then is discard, but this side of percept and

6
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:28,840
this goal. The confidence of the working memory have just changed. Of course,

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,580
the production rules capturing the pursuit of knowledge have not yet

8
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,300
changed. So these are exactly the same productions that we had previously.

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,670
Only the contents of the working memory has changed.

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,560
We now have a runner at the first as well as the second and

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,690
the third. And this exercise is very intrusting because it will lead us

12
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:51,060
to a different set of conclusions. Given the set of precepts in this goal and

13
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,030
the set of production rules, what operator do you think the picture will select?
