1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,630
The Reduce operation is pretty clear.

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:07,610
So the idea is that, this level,
we have a full resolution, or,

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:11,140
or whatever level, and then we
want to take the next level down.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,960
So here's a way of thinking about it,
we'll just number these.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,560
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,150
Nine pixels across.

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:24,020
I actually don't have to produce the
pixels that would go under two, four,

8
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,030
six, and eight.

9
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:25,990
Because I'm just going to,

10
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:30,890
I only want half the number of
pixels that I had to start with.

11
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:36,120
So in fact what this does is, it simply
says I'm going to take some location,

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,310
here I use the middle, and I'm going to
take what's called a 5-tap Filter.

13
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:43,519
And here are the filters,
see it's one-sixteenth, four-sixteenth,

14
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:46,807
six-sixteenth, four-sixteenth,
one-sixteenth.

15
00:00:46,807 --> 00:00:50,703
And that's, that's what these numbers
are, one-sixteenth, one-fourth,

16
00:00:50,703 --> 00:00:53,086
three-eighth one-fourth, one-sixteenth.

17
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:55,367
Okay?
That's the filter that I use to get

18
00:00:55,367 --> 00:00:58,000
the odd pixel here in the middle.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,180
Now that's just in one scan line.

20
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,130
I'm working with images.

21
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,530
How do I do this?

22
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,349
Okay.
Go way back in your notes,

23
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:07,070
because I know you all are taking co,
copious notes.

24
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,040
I almost said y'all.

25
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,360
When I say y'all, Megan's going to
throw that monitor at me.

26
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:12,920
Okay?

27
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,220
Nothing against my friends from
the south, but I come from New York,

28
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,200
went to school in Boston.

29
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,320
If I actually said y'all,
I think I'd get shot by my relatives.

30
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,850
Anyway, You all have seen this before.

31
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,190
We talked about Separable Filters.

32
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,890
Right?
So a separable filter was, instead of

33
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,210
applying a square filter, to the filter,
I apply one, one dimensional filter

34
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,310
horizontally and then often it's the
same one dimensional filter vertically.

35
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,040
So go back up and
remember about separable filters.

36
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,920
The reduce operator uses
a separable filter,

37
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,800
a 5-tap separable filter first in
the rows, then in the columns.

38
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,400
All right.

39
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,410
That one was straightforward.

40
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,850
The Expand operator is
a little bit trickier.

41
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,760
And you can tell that by
looking at this awful picture.

42
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,430
In fact I'm going to pull that
awful picture off by itself.

43
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,080
Here's the deal.

44
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:07,280
The idea is that on this picture
only pixels that are, were real.

45
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,470
The question is, how do you make
finer pixels from a coarser levels?

46
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,130
So here's the coarser level,
here's the finer level.

47
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,920
And it turns out you do
it two different ways.

48
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,460
Okay?
So we're going to start with

49
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,480
the odd pixels.

50
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,400
All right?

51
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,740
So the odd pixels occur underneath
pixels that are actually there.

52
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,700
So there are a couple of
ways of thinking about this.

53
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,010
One is we're just going to
assume that we're going to,

54
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,965
I'm just going to tell you what
the filter is right there.

55
00:02:34,965 --> 00:02:37,985
It's one-eighth,
three-fourth, one-eighth.

56
00:02:37,985 --> 00:02:40,430
Okay.
That seems a little bit arbitrary until

57
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:46,610
you realize that's just kind
of like if these were zeroes.

58
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,320
Okay.

59
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,820
And I took in all the values here, and

60
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,326
I made it the same 5-tap a four,
but now doubled it.

61
00:02:53,326 --> 00:02:55,140
So one-eighth, one-half, three-quarters,

62
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:00,550
one, these will be in the same ratio of
one, four, six, four, one, as before.

63
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,200
Okay?

64
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,210
But I'm only pulling
it off the odd pixels.

65
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:04,820
All right.

66
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,450
And so these points go away and

67
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,530
I'm only left with one-eighth,
three-quarters, one-eighth.

68
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,560
By the way,
we're going to provide the original

69
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,460
Burton Edelson paper that
talks about reducing expanse.

70
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,875
You'll be able to, to look at that a,
a little bit more carefully.

71
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:20,605
All right.

72
00:03:20,605 --> 00:03:23,125
That's to reproduced a pixel, it's
actually underneath one that's there.

73
00:03:24,185 --> 00:03:27,245
Slightly trickier are the even pixels.

74
00:03:27,245 --> 00:03:31,865
We have a pixel here that's underneath
something that didn't actually exist.

75
00:03:31,865 --> 00:03:34,830
So if I still do the six, four, one.

76
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,881
All right?

77
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:39,035
One, four, six, four, one above me.

78
00:03:39,035 --> 00:03:39,570
Okay?

79
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:43,460
Well, when I'm on one of these even
pixels, there's nothing directly above

80
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:47,360
me, and there's nothing to my ends,
there's only these two here.

81
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,730
That's this one, and this one.

82
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:55,650
So looking five above me,
only two of them are really there,

83
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,760
they're equally distant from me,
what coefficients am I going to use?

84
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,180
I'm going to use one-half.

85
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,102
So to produce this finer value,
I take one-half of that pixel and

86
00:04:06,102 --> 00:04:08,230
one-half of the other and
that actually sort of makes sense.

87
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,400
If you think about it,
if I'm blowing up a picture, so

88
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,700
I'm going to go from say,
seven pixels to, to 14.

89
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,250
I have to get space between
two pixels that were there.

90
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,769
What value should I put in that space?

91
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:24,240
Halfway between the ones
that were there before.

92
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,510
The one that's a little trickier to
understand is if I'm blowing it up,

93
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,420
how come I just don't leave
this original pixel alone.

94
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,490
And you can read in the paper,
this is for the odd pixels,

95
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,410
you can read in the paper the motivation
in terms of frequency theory.

96
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,250
In terms of how they do that.

97
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,160
All you need to know is that you
now have a reduce operator and

98
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,270
an expand operator.
