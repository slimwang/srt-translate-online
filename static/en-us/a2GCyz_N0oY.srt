00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,870
In R we can create models using the lm function. We need to

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:09,420
supply a formula in the form of y~x.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,180
Here, y is the outcome variable and x is the explanatory

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:19,785
variable. Which of the following formulas would we use inside the lm function?

5
00:00:19,785 --> 00:00:25,740
Price~Carat. Price to the cube root~log Carat

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:33,983
log price~carat to the third, log price~Carat to the 1/3, select one.
