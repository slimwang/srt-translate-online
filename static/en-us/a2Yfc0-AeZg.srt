1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,310
Now it's your turn to setup the client ID's, so

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,850
that you can use the My Profile page in your Conference

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,570
Central application. After you get everything hooked up, you'll find

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,350
that more and more of the web pages start to work,

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,920
as you add more functionality in the coming exercises. So

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,870
I'm just going to go over the things that you need to

7
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,940
do to hook up the web UI to the backend

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,440
API. going to need to get the client ID. To do that,

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,600
just go to the developer's console and in your

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,350
web, in your client ID for web application, you

11
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,110
can get your client ID. And then you're going to

12
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,820
set the web client ID in Constants.java so that your

13
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,000
end points API knows which client IDs are allowed

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,630
to access it. Then you're also going to add the client

15
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:47,290
ID in app.js so that your web UI can

16
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:51,140
identify itself properly when it goes through the authentication process.

17
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,000
Then you're going to need to make sure that

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,390
the developer email and the product name are set

19
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,530
in the consent screen. And then also in

20
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,340
the developers console, you're going to need to set

21
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,030
the JavaScript cross origin so that the client

22
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:10,570
application knows which URL's are allowed to access it

23
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,110
when they run JavaScript. So this you do

24
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,300
in the developer's console. These two are in code.

25
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,680
And these again, you do back in

26
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,770
the Developer Console. So after you've gone through

27
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:27,450
these steps, then deploy your app. And you

28
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,020
could do it on localhost or on appspot.

29
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:38,050
And then go to, to My Profile page, and test it. And as you go through

30
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:42,870
each of these steps, come here and just check off the step, as you do them.
