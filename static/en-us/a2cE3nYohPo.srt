1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
One trait shared by programming languages and natural languages is ambiguity.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Consider the sentence "I saw Jane Austen using binoculars."

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's relatively clear what this means, right?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Here's me. I have binoculars or perhaps pants, but let's image that they're binoculars.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm looking through them. Over here in the distance I see Jane Austen.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We can tell it's Jane Austen, because she's in a park. Mansfield Park, let's say.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I am using the binoculars to see Jane Austen.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
However, if you think about it there's an alternative implementation

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
or an alternative interpretation of this sentence--

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
another way to look at it that's also perfectly valid.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Here in this alternative interpretation, I see with my naked eye Jane Austen.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
She is using binoculars to look at something else.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Maybe she's spying on an Abbey over here. Let's call it Northanger Abbey.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Actually it looks a bit more like a barn that was badly painted, but let's imagine.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Both of the interpretations are correct or the sentence is ambiguous.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's not clear whether using binoculars modifies Jane Austen.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Is she the person using binoculars?

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Or whether using binoculars modifies "I saw." The picture on the left that's how I'm seeing.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's quiz time--a quiz on ambiguity.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Consider the expression 1 minus 2 plus 3.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Keeping ambiguity in mind, if this were a Python or JavaScript

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
or even just on the whiteboard or on a piece of paper in mathematics,

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
this is a mathematical expression. What might it evaluate to?

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I've got four choices in this multiple multiple choice quiz.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check all that apply.
