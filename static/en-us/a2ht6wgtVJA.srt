00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Here I just wanted to show that even very short sequences can be identified quite easily

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
with language ID models based on letter frequencies.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So for the 3-letter sequence T-H-E, I have trigram models for 3 different languages.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And you can see that in language A there's a 1.1% chance of representing T-H-E,

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
which is 4 times more than B and quite a bit more than C.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
For the 3-letter sequence D-E-R, that's 10 times more likely to be language B

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
than to be language A and quite a bit more than language C.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
For the letter sequence R-B-A, that's 50 times more likely to be C than it is to be B and even moreso than A.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What I want you to tell me is what are each of these languages?

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Where did this column of numbers come from?

11
00:00:55,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Is language A English, German or Azerbaijani, and the same for B and C?
