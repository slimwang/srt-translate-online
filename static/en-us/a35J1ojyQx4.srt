1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,910
So now, using that idea,
let's talk about coded photography.

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:07,760
Coded photography is really going to
get us into depths of kind to now

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,160
create different ways of
looking at the coded patterns.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,300
The aperture in this instance,
how we can control it, and

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,070
how can we embed that information to
allow the camera to be able to see

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:22,130
additional bits of information that will
actually allow us to capture images.

7
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,800
Some of this should remind you of
what we did when we talked about

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,370
the light field camera.

9
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,480
Right?
In the light field camera,

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,350
we wanted to capture more information
than just the pixel information on

11
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,350
the sensor.

12
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,250
We wanted to capture more
information about the light field

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,880
that would allow us to
now generate new images.

14
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,400
The question now is,
can we actually do a lot of this, and

15
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,190
again we touched on it a little bit when
we talked about the light field cameras,

16
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,920
by controlling this, how we can actually
capture a novel image representation

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,150
that would allow us to do more
than a standard image would.

18
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,760
We've looked at how to do this
with projector camera systems for

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,110
lighting control.

20
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,480
So the coded exposure
basically kind of says,

21
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,459
is we want to be able to control light
that enters a camera in time by using

22
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,720
different types of exposure controls.

23
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,570
Coded aperture then, actually,
also impacts how much light goes in.

24
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:15,580
Remember aperture is the opening,
the size, we can control this.

25
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,889
This one we controlled the amount of
light goes in over time, this one we

26
00:01:18,889 --> 00:01:21,990
controlled the amount of light goes
in by the size of the aperture.

27
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,240
Of course, we can control
the illumination, as we know about how

28
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,725
to do with among other things,
with controllable projectors.

29
00:01:29,725 --> 00:01:34,355
We can also do a lot of control right
on the sensor itself of the camera.

30
00:01:34,355 --> 00:01:35,245
An example of that,

31
00:01:35,245 --> 00:01:39,505
that we've actually kind of seen also is
when we talked about the camera itself.

32
00:01:39,505 --> 00:01:43,265
We looked at the bare sensor, which
was actually doing coded information.

33
00:01:43,265 --> 00:01:47,890
Remember, the bare sensor,
basically, was coding how RGB was

34
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:52,180
captured at the sensor and then allowed
you to read it off with that code itself

35
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:56,020
helping us figuring out how to get
the right color at the pixel level.

36
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:00,280
So coded photography is basically the
concept, now how can we actually learn

37
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,810
more about how we can code these things
it-selves and put them on the image

38
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,100
representation that would allow us
to showcase newer forms of images.

39
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,590
What are these examples or
what we mean about that in a bit
