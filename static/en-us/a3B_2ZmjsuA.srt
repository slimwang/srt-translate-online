00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,550
I hope this session's given
you a better foundation for

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,860
design and problem solving.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,760
Indeed, sometimes the best way to attack
these issues is to step back, simplify,

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,030
and go one step at a time.

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,760
See you in the next session.
