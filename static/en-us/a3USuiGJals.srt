1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,550
So before we go into how predication works

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,945
in hardware, let's first look at the technique called

3
00:00:05,945 --> 00:00:08,600
if-conversion, which is how the compiler creates the

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,430
code that will be executed along both paths. So

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,805
let's say we have a relatively small if-then-else

6
00:00:15,805 --> 00:00:19,330
here, where depending on the condition, x gets either

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,505
the value from array of i, or array

8
00:00:21,505 --> 00:00:25,950
from j, and y gets either incremented or decremented.

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,039
If-conversion, transforms this code into the work of

10
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:33,780
both paths, followed by a selection of some sort,

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,670
between the results of the two paths. But there

12
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,290
is still a question of how do we do

13
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:42,245
this. If we convert this into some sort

14
00:00:42,245 --> 00:00:45,845
of a conditional expression that still branches based on

15
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:48,470
the condition and then does the move of x2

16
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,170
into x, otherwise, does the move of x into

17
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,380
x1, then we really haven't done much. Because we

18
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:59,040
converted one branch into another branch and now we

19
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,208
have this branch twice. So unless we have some

20
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:04,135
sort of a correlating predictor like, for example, the

21
00:01:04,135 --> 00:01:07,247
global history predictor, we will possibly have two missed

22
00:01:07,247 --> 00:01:09,750
predictions here. Instead of the one we might have

23
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,037
had. So if this is all you can do,

24
00:01:12,037 --> 00:01:17,165
then you don't do if-conversion. What we need for if-conversion

25
00:01:17,165 --> 00:01:21,575
to work is some sort of a move instruction that will

26
00:01:21,575 --> 00:01:26,280
do something like move x1 into x, if a flag is true.
