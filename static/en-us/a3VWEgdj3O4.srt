1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,668
All right, I hope that went well. We

2
00:00:02,668 --> 00:00:05,560
will now talk about the most flexible query mechanism

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:11,010
in Datastore. Query by kind, filter by property. Let's

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,400
say you would like to query for all conferences

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,600
that are in a particular city, for example

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,620
Halloween, and with a specific topic like movie making,

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,080
and then sort the matching entries by conference name.

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,360
For example, if we were to write this out

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,620
it could look like this. Retrieve all conferences that

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,990
are in the city Halloween, and has moving making

11
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:36,180
in the topic. Sort the result by name. This

12
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,650
is an example of query by kind, filter by property,

13
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,060
since we are using property values in the search

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,810
and the sort. Let's look at this a little

15
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,760
bit closer. We want to have an exact match

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,625
for the city since we are only interested in conferences

17
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:53,930
in Halloween. This is called an equality filter.

18
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,210
Then, we want to further restrict the queries

19
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,960
so that only entities which has movie making

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,510
in the topic are displayed. This is called a

21
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,900
member of filter. We are combining these with

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,820
the and operator, meaning that both of these conditions

23
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,800
must be true. And finally, we are sorting

24
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,030
the result by name. Let's look at filters and

25
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,100
how you can use them to construct a query in

26
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,950
more detail. The first filter is the equality filter, that

27
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:25,020
we used for city in our example. Then, we have

28
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,640
the member of filter, which has the same symbol as

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,530
the equality filter. This filter, we use to sort by

30
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:34,100
topic. Then we have a set of inequality filters, not

31
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,870
equal to, less than, less than or equal to, greater

32
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:41,100
than, greater than or equal to. And all of these can

33
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,470
be combined using the Boolean operators and, and

34
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,860
or. That's enough theory to get started. So

35
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,910
now it's time for you to add query

36
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,800
by kind, filter by property, to conference central.
