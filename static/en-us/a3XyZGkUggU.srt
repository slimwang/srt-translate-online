1
00:00:00,092 --> 00:00:01,810
Before we leave you, one more thing.

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:04,078
You now seen what you can
do with App Engine and

3
00:00:04,078 --> 00:00:05,827
the Google Cloud platform today.

4
00:00:05,827 --> 00:00:08,010
But what about five years from now?

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,887
Let's hear what Urs HÃ¶lzle,

6
00:00:09,887 --> 00:00:14,105
Senior VP of infrastructure at
Google has to say about the future.

7
00:00:14,105 --> 00:00:16,833
In this course,
we learned a lot about App Engine.

8
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:20,856
Urs, what can we expect from
Google Cloud platform and

9
00:00:20,856 --> 00:00:22,789
App Engine in the future?

10
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:26,815
A lot of innovation because what I'm
really most excited about, is that

11
00:00:26,815 --> 00:00:31,171
we're just at the beginning of something
that, I think, is going to be really,

12
00:00:31,171 --> 00:00:35,593
you know, we're proud of what we have
today, but what we're really aiming for

13
00:00:35,593 --> 00:00:39,422
is getting to something that five
years from now, is so much better.

14
00:00:39,422 --> 00:00:43,186
I think the rate of innovation that
we're going to see in the cloud is

15
00:00:43,186 --> 00:00:45,935
going to peak up and
we hope to be a big part of that.

16
00:00:45,935 --> 00:00:48,956
But our goal really is to take
what we have and make it so

17
00:00:48,956 --> 00:00:52,312
much easier to scale, and so
much easier to program, and so

18
00:00:52,312 --> 00:00:56,162
much easier to be on mobile, so
much easy, easier to analyze data.

19
00:00:56,162 --> 00:00:59,785
And then really get a,
get a, get a platform for

20
00:00:59,785 --> 00:01:04,778
you that is everything that it is today,
but much, much better.

21
00:01:04,778 --> 00:01:08,069
Really to the point where if you
remember, what you thought was

22
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:12,415
great today, and we really have a great
product, that, you know, five years from

23
00:01:12,415 --> 00:01:16,263
now, you'll kind of remember and
say wow, you know, I'm, I'm kind of,

24
00:01:16,263 --> 00:01:20,330
I was naive to think that this was great
because if I look at today's product.

25
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,673
It, you know,
was really just the beginning of it.

26
00:01:23,673 --> 00:01:26,252
I, that's what I'm,
I'm most excited about.

27
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:29,852
>> Do you have any final words to
the students that have now learned a lot

28
00:01:29,852 --> 00:01:30,872
about App Engine?

29
00:01:30,872 --> 00:01:32,397
>> Now that you know App Engine,

30
00:01:32,397 --> 00:01:36,305
you're actually in a great position to
try out other parts of our platform.

31
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:41,295
And one of the things that we're really
going to work on is make it very easy to

32
00:01:41,295 --> 00:01:46,446
combine App Engine with VMs or with Big
Query or with Storage, so that you can

33
00:01:46,446 --> 00:01:51,469
mix and match and implement your
application not just in pure App Engine.

34
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:55,266
But really combine it with any other
part that we have in our infrastructure.

35
00:01:55,266 --> 00:01:59,440
And still, have it be very easy for
you to both write and run.

36
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,400
That's the path we're on.

37
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,330
And I hope you enjoyed App Engine and
you'll enjoy the other parts even more.

38
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,246
>> That's right.
This has been just the start of what you

39
00:02:08,246 --> 00:02:10,889
can do with Google App Engine and
with the Google Cloud tools.

40
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,446
>> So
keep your coding fingers up to date.

41
00:02:12,446 --> 00:02:16,073
And stay on the cutting edge of
what's possible with cloud computing

42
00:02:16,073 --> 00:02:19,900
because every day the Google Cloud
platform becomes better and better.

43
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,882
>> So now you have all kinds of
tools to build great applications.

44
00:02:22,882 --> 00:02:24,682
>> And scale them on the Google Cloud.

45
00:02:24,682 --> 00:02:26,597
>> So go out there and
build something cool.

46
00:02:26,597 --> 00:02:28,025
And we'll see you around.

47
00:02:28,025 --> 00:02:28,525
>> Bye.
