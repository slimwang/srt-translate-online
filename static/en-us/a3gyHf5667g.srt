1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the answer is crossover C is 1 million,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and if I ask for the quality of C gambling

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
versus hold with the log10 utility function--

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and that's a two-value tuple--

5
00:00:12,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and we see, in fact, they're the same.
