00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,090
So far,

2
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:04,320
we've been focusing on the technology
aspects of information security.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,390
However, the organization
note as assigned to aspects

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:08,910
are also very important.

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,650
In the next few lectures Dr.

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,190
Mustaque Ahamad is going to
cover several of these topics.

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,150
>> We're going to start with managing
cyber security in the context of

8
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,590
an organization.

9
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,400
So what is it cyber risk?

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,360
How can it reduce that risk with using
technical solutions that we discussed,

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,510
and what are the cost benefit
trade offs for example?

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,360
Once we do that, we're going to move
on to how can we have consequences for

13
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,590
the bad guys.

14
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,690
Well laws, or cyber laws in particular,
are one way to do that.

15
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,540
So we'll discuss some of
the US cyber laws and

16
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,700
then also some ethical considerations.

17
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,410
Then we're going to wrap up with online
privacy which is a topic that is

18
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,120
of great deal of interest to many of us.
