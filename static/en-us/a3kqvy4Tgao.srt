00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,040
Along with labels, placeholders
like this one are super useful for

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,500
text or numeric inputs.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,330
Use placeholders to give
users a concrete idea

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,080
of exactly what they should type.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,450
For example, an input on a city field
show what is the expected value

6
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:25,010
telling users they should use
a full name of the city, like here.

7
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:29,870
But remember that placeholders disappear
as soon as the user start typing

8
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:35,260
in the element, which means they
are not a replacement for labels.

9
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,180
They should be used as
an aid to help guide users.
