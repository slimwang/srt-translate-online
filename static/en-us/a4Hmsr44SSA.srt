Good job.

2
00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:03,825
Now, as we noted before, loading an image is comprised of three steps. We

3
00:00:03,836 --> 00:00:07,450
actually declare a new image object, then, we specify the function to be called

4
00:00:07,462 --> 00:00:10,850
when the image has been loaded and finally, we set the source of the image

5
00:00:10,862 --> 00:00:15,240
itself. Down here, we specified our onImageLoad function, which simply prints out

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,175
a statement to the console alerting us when this image has been loaded.
