1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,969
Let's see another comparison
of updates and invalidates.

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:07,780
This time let's look at two cores
that execute the following program,

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:13,110
core 0 will read and then write A and
this is repeated 500 times.

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:19,230
And then core 1 will read and then write
A, and this is repeated 500 times.

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,360
And meanwhile nothing else
happens in this core.

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,030
So nothing gets replaced.

7
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:27,430
The question for you is again, how many
bus uses do we get with the write-update

8
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,750
protocol and with the write-invalidate
protocol in this case?
