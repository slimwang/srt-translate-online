1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's walk through a possibility together.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's handle A times 0.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In such a case, we want to return B

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
or the number 0, whichever you prefer.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Anything times 0 is 0. [return tree]

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And the other thing I am supposed to handle is A + 0,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
at which point I just return A.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I could have been more complicated potentially

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and changed the if condition up here

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
so that we're returning A in only 1 place,

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
but for optimizations, readability is more important.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
because we really want to make sure we're getting the right answer.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So we've added in support for 2 new optimizations.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And presumably--now you can imagine how if we had a bunch of these

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
we could just write them all out here,

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
or maybe we could have a slightly more concise system

17
00:00:41,000 --> 99:59:59,999
for checking patterns and replacing them.
