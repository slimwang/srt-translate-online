1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,070
We first went to our design team to get
a design that not only better reflects

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,620
material, but provides substantial
improvements in utility.

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,920
Weâ€™ve looked at the material
design specification.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,150
Specifically, how colors, elevation, and

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,320
animation can be used to create
delightful user experiences.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,360
We covered tools and technique to
help create both material design and

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,955
responsive designs, including Toolbar,

8
00:00:26,955 --> 00:00:32,470
CardView, Recycler view,

9
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:36,060
and GridLayout.

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,730
We've looked at using dimensions,
graphs, and

11
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,300
included layouts to simplify our
responsive designs for tablets.

12
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,310
Finally, we've covered some simple
techniques to create L specifics and

13
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,599
L style animations in your applications.

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,010
With all of this, we've implemented
a new, completely refreshed design for

15
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,420
Sunshine that brings us much closer
to a production application.
