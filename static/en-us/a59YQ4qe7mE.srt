1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:01,830
What about rotation?

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,220
So here,
I'm basically showing a simple example.

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:08,135
I have two points, x and, this would
be the original points here, and

4
00:00:08,135 --> 00:00:11,590
x prime, y prime, where I want
the transformation to happen.

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,400
Of course, in this case,

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,850
these two vectors kind of show how the
transformation would be, and of course,

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,700
there would be an angle
associated with this.

8
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,130
Let's call that theta.

9
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,140
So in case now,

10
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,430
just looking at the simple 2D example,
let me ask the question.

11
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,271
So in this case of the simple
2D rotation by a theta,

12
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:30,510
where I have transformed points x and
y to x prime, y prime.

13
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,558
Question comes up is, how would I now
figure out the values of x prime,

14
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:37,840
y prime, given x and
y and this angle theta?

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,550
Now, if you may remember this from
your old trigonometry classes,

16
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,040
this can be done, and I encourage you
to look it up again if you haven't,

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,532
looked at such things recently.

18
00:00:45,532 --> 00:00:50,288
And this would basically say that x
prime would basically be computed by

19
00:00:50,288 --> 00:00:54,647
taking the cosine of the angle
theta here, with x the original x,

20
00:00:54,647 --> 00:00:56,012
minus y sine theta.

21
00:00:56,012 --> 00:01:01,780
And similarly y prime would be given
by x sine theta plus y sine theta.

22
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,080
So this basically now gives us an input,
interesting way.

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,640
Now of course I can write
this in a matrix form,

24
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,540
which basically would
mean I would move x and

25
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:13,400
y into a column, which would now give
me the elements of the M matrix.

26
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,764
So M in this case would be cosine
theta minus sine theta, sine theta,

27
00:01:16,764 --> 00:01:17,570
cosine theta.

28
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:18,395
And if of course,

29
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:21,755
knowing this angle I can apply
this as an image transformation.

30
00:01:21,755 --> 00:01:26,285
Again, I encourage you to look this up
or try to kind of do the derivation.

31
00:01:26,285 --> 00:01:27,995
Just as a hint, to do this derivation,

32
00:01:27,995 --> 00:01:30,905
you'd also need to
represent this angle and

33
00:01:30,905 --> 00:01:34,145
then basically come up with equations
to kind of compare all of these.
