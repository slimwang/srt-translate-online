Some of the revenue model questions:

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What is it my customers are paying for?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What's the value? What is it when they look at my company and my products?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
By the way, what capacity do they have to pay? They might love it.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In fact, everybody who looks at a Ferrari or a Tesla model S

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
might say, yes, I'd love to pay for that, but—you know what?—my wife won't let me

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
or I just don't have the money.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That is, is the total available market of potential users your needs for revenue?

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You might have built a product so expensive

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
that the customer segment you've targeted just can't afford it.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Then how will you package your product?

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
By package I don't mean what kind of pretty box is it in.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Another mistake startups make, particularly engineering-driven startups,

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
is putting every possible feature into the first product,

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
not thinking that perhaps—well, wait a minute.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Maybe we could decompose the product—that is, take it apart—

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and offer these as add-ons or as ancillary products

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
or separate products, etc.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How you package your products should not just be an engineering functionality decision.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It should be a value-based decision.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
As we said, the same with pricing.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
How will you price? What kind of tactics will you use?
