Let's do one more quiz to practice simplifying terms. This time, please simplify

00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:11,645
4x times y times negative 3x. Remember that this negative sign right here, in

3
00:00:11,657 --> 00:00:17,471

00:00:17,483 --> 00:00:23,004
y. We're multiplying 4x times y by negative 3x. So, keeping that in mind, please

5
00:00:23,016 --> 00:00:26,863
write the most simplified version of this term that you can over here.
