00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,360
Why do we need, a language that goes beyond the diagrams?

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,750
The diagrams are great, at describing structural relationships.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,816
We'll see with state charts, that they can also describe some behavior, but

4
00:00:13,816 --> 00:00:18,280
there's, there're times when you need to be more precise, particularly about

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:23,010
the functional details. Of exactly what it means for this particular component,

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:30,140
to do this particular task. OCL extends UML, with class in variance.

7
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:36,040
With descriptions, precise descriptions of operations in terms of pre and

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:41,240
post conditions. And they can also be used as guards on transitions in

9
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,320
state chart diagrams, which we'll see, subsequently in the term.
