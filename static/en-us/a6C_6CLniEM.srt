Absolute value of positive a is just the distance from that to 0, a minus 0is

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:09,615
just a. But the same is true of negative a. It takes just as much distance to

3
00:00:09,615 --> 00:00:14,103
get from negative a to 0, as it did from a to 0. So that's the absolute value of

4
00:00:14,103 --> 00:00:18,412
negative a is a. So if a number is positive, it's absolute value is just equal

5
00:00:18,412 --> 00:00:23,357
to itself. And if a number is negative, we get the absolute value by multiplying

6
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,047
that number by negative 1.
