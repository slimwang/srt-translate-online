00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,040
Here I have a chair. Which affords

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,090
sitting. This affordance exists, because of the

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:10,810
shape of the chair. Combined with the abilities and shape of the human body. The

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,370
same chair does not afford sitting for

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,330
an elephant. An affordance is the relationship between

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,970
an object, such as a chair. And

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,610
a person. Affordances enable particular kind of interaction

8
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,430
between people and objects. And the presence of

9
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,220
an affordance, is jointly determined by the properties

10
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,700
of the object. And of the abilities of

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,180
the person who is interacting with the object.
