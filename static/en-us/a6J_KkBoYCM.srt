00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,713
So now that we've worked step by step through how to simplify terms, I want you

2
00:00:04,725 --> 00:00:09,317
to try simplifying this term on your own. So, in this box to the right, please

3
00:00:09,329 --> 00:00:13,662
write the most simplified version that you can find of negative 5s times

4
00:00:13,674 --> 00:00:17,823
negative 2r times 3t. Remember, that these parenthesis just indicate

5
00:00:17,835 --> 00:00:23,369
multiplication. So that means that negative 2r is being multiplied by negative

6
00:00:23,381 --> 00:00:00,000
5s, and by 3t, not subtracted from them. Good luck.
