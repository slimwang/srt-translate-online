00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,956
>> So you've now seen these two equations that look pretty similar to one

2
00:00:03,956 --> 00:00:08,538
another several times. We have y equals Ax squared plus Bx plus C. And we have 0

3
00:00:08,538 --> 00:00:12,879
equals Ax squared plus Bx plus C. What I want to do with this quiz is make sure

4
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:17,512
that we understand the difference between the two of these equations. When do we

5
00:00:17,512 --> 00:00:21,343
use each one, and what purpose do they each serve? So I've given you some

6
00:00:21,343 --> 00:00:25,342
different options over here, four different options. And each one of these

7
00:00:25,342 --> 00:00:29,298
describes either this equation or this equation. So for each of these four

8
00:00:29,298 --> 00:00:33,538
things, please pick the equation that it describes. Which one of these graphs a

9
00:00:33,538 --> 00:00:37,828
parabola? Which one finds the x-coordinates of the x-intercepts of a parabola?

10
00:00:37,828 --> 00:00:42,677
Which one relates y to x? And which one can be solved? Please pick the equation

11
00:00:42,677 --> 00:00:45,347
for each that best fits this description.
