00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,730
So, in the 1950s and 60s, British psychologist by the name of John Bowlby

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:10,430
developed a theory called attachment. And this was based on two observations.

3
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,936
The first observation was made by the animal behaviorist Konrad Lorenz. And

4
00:00:13,936 --> 00:00:20,651
Lorenz had seen in baby geese that whoever cared for them became their mother.

5
00:00:20,651 --> 00:00:23,518
it's not all that weird until you realize that the mother could be a human,

6
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:27,845
didn't have to be a goose. And this is what he called imprinting. The second

7
00:00:27,845 --> 00:00:33,372
observation was made by Sigmund Freud. And Freud had observed that when mothers

8
00:00:33,372 --> 00:00:39,571
go away from babies that the baby becomes really distressed, really upset. And

9
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:44,601
this, he called separation anxiety. So, it was imprinting on the one hand and

10
00:00:44,601 --> 00:00:48,249
separation anxiety on the other hand that led John Bowlby to develop a theory

11
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:53,596
for why attachment to the caregiver is. So important in early stages of human

12
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:54,710
development.
