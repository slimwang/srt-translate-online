Hello, and welcome to Lesson 4. In Lesson 4, you will be working with numbers

2
00:00:03,828 --> 00:00:08,722
and with strings. You already know that you use integers for whole numbers and

3
00:00:08,722 --> 00:00:14,410
the type called double for numbers that can have fractional parts. So far, that

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,766
seems pretty easy, but there's some things that you need to know so that you

5
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:21,004
stay out of trouble. Let me give you an example. Have a look at this statement

6
00:00:21,004 --> 00:00:26,670
over here. We initialize the variable one million with well, one million. We

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,190
multiply one million by itself, that gives us one trillion, which is a number

8
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,307
with a lot of zeroes. And we put this into mystery, now you can already tell

9
00:00:34,307 --> 00:00:38,112
that something is going to go wrong. Otherwise, I wouldn't have name this

10
00:00:38,112 --> 00:00:42,980
variable a mystery. So go ahead, fire up BlueJ and type these statements into

11
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:48,083
the code pad. Or if you prefer, use the Udacity ID. When you're done, tell me

12
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:49,700
what you got for mystery.
