Okay, so time for a quick quiz. What I'd like

2
00:00:03,059 --> 00:00:05,804
you to do is implement this function make_secure_val. This just takes

3
00:00:05,804 --> 00:00:08,492
a string, which in this case is going to be our cookie

4
00:00:08,492 --> 00:00:11,884
body and returns that format we were describing before which is

5
00:00:11,884 --> 00:00:13,996
going to be S comma and then the hash of, of

6
00:00:13,996 --> 00:00:18,370
that string. And we're going to use this function, hash_str, which right

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,870
now is just using MD5. We're going to, I know I told

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,920
you MD5 is secure, so we are going to improve this,

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,470
but for right now we're just going to use

10
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,370
MD5. So go ahead and implement this function. Good luck.
