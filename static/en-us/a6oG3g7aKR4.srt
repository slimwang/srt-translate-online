1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,410
Again, I'll first think about how
to standardize a single data point,

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,689
say the value at position zero.

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:10,260
First, I'll calculate the distance
of that value from the mean,

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,100
which I can do by subtracting.

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,680
Then to convert to a number
of standard deviations,

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,640
I'll need to divide by
the standard deviation.

7
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,970
And again,
parentheses are important here.

8
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,440
So this will calculate
a single standardized value.

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,920
And I could use a loop to
standardize all the values, but

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,690
instead I'm going to use
vectorized operations.

11
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,759
Again, vectorized operations make the
code to operate on an entire array very

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,130
similar to the code that
operates on a single value.

13
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,690
I'll simply change this
variable from a single value

14
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,010
to the entire array of values.

15
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:45,090
Now values is the entire array, and
the mean is still a single number.

16
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,170
So this subtraction subtracts the mean
from each value in the array.

17
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,100
Then the standard deviation
is still a single number, so

18
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:57,180
this division divides each element of
the array by the standard deviation.

19
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,410
And since this standardized all the
values in the array, I will change this

20
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,580
variable to standardized values,
and I'll delete this line.

21
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,070
And finally,
I will return the standardized values.
