00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,494
Another distinct way we can remember information is through Schemas. We can

2
00:00:04,494 --> 00:00:08,134
define Schemas as a mental framework that develops from our experiences with

3
00:00:08,134 --> 00:00:12,588
particular people, objects or events. In other words you can think of schemas

4
00:00:12,588 --> 00:00:16,608
as framework for representing some aspects of the world. That tells us how

5
00:00:16,608 --> 00:00:21,418
people, objects or events are most likely to look like or act like. Schemas

6
00:00:21,418 --> 00:00:25,948
influence our attention, and the absorption of new knowledge. In fact, we're

7
00:00:25,948 --> 00:00:29,547
more likely to notice things that fit into our schema once we have a schema

8
00:00:29,547 --> 00:00:34,728
formed. So they help us to understand and organize experiences. They can also

9
00:00:34,728 --> 00:00:38,568
aid in our memory and recall. However, it's important to note that schemas have

10
00:00:38,568 --> 00:00:42,751
a tendency to remain unchanged. Even if we're presented with new information

11
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:46,162
that contradicts our schema. Let's say you have a schema of a college

12
00:00:46,162 --> 00:00:50,270
professor, that is, you have a conceptual idea of what a professor looks like.

13
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:54,214
Perhaps if they're a man or a woman, how old they are. How tall they are or how

14
00:00:54,214 --> 00:00:58,940
they dress. So, it may be that someone's schema for a professor is that they're

15
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:03,560
old. They wear sports jackets with patches in the elbows, they have glasses,

16
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,220
they carry a briefcase, they're male and other identifying features of a

17
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:12,737
professor. So, if that's a person's schema for a professor, research shows that

18
00:01:12,737 --> 00:01:16,580
if he or she is presented with new information that is contradictory of that

19
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:21,902
schema. For example, if being a young woman who dresses rather casually,

20
00:01:21,902 --> 00:01:26,752
carrying a back pack rather than a brief case and so on. The person with the

21
00:01:26,752 --> 00:01:30,356
developed schema will be less likely to remember the female professor. So

22
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:34,325
schemas can aid in our ability to remember, but they also bias our memory and

23
00:01:34,325 --> 00:01:36,329
our perception.
