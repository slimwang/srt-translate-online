1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,055
So other than the description, hm, it
looks like you changed style1 to style!

2
00:00:06,055 --> 00:00:08,250
.
>> [LAUGH] Huh, oh, yeah, I did do that.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,330
That wasn't intentional.

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,630
I was going to change my stylesheet, but

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,090
then at the last minute,
I decided not to.

6
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,202
I think I made a mistake.

7
00:00:14,202 --> 00:00:15,850
>> Yeah, sounds like a typo.

8
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,560
So what happens if you fix that?

9
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,060
>> Let's try it.

10
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,150
Cool, it worked.

11
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,260
>> Great.
>> You know,

12
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,950
it's kind of annoying doing it manually.

13
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,750
Is there any way to get
the computer to help me?

14
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,760
>> Yeah, there are some built in tools
that can automatically compare files.

15
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,820
I'll go over how to
use these in a minute.

16
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,220
>> Good thing I saved the old one then.

17
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,770
>> Yeah, I'm glad you did.

18
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,420
In a bigger project, having an old
version saved can mean that you

19
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,740
spend a few minutes finding
your mistake instead of hours.
