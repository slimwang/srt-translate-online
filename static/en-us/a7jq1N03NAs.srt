1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,760
There's really not much you need to do to get

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,740
your application to use Memcache to save and get entity data,

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,640
if you're using Objectify. But it's still useful to know

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,540
how to write code to use Memcache. So we're going to use

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,149
Memcache to save and get announcements, about conferences that are

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:19,610
nearly sold out. You can imagine, for example, that your web

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,970
app might display a banner ad to encourage people to

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,570
sign up. For conferences that are nearly sold out. There might

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,620
be other things you want to announce on your website, too.

10
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,720
Maybe if you get a special speaker for a particular conference.

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,160
Or you want to announce a special promotion. But for the

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,080
sake of simplicity, we're just going to create announcements that conferences

13
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,790
are nearly sold out. Because the goal here is to learn

14
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,590
how to use Memcache. Announcements though, are a good example of

15
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,550
the kind of thing that you might want to save in

16
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,580
Memcache, without saving them to the Datastore. If the announcement gets evicted

17
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,620
from Memcache, there's no loss of real data, and it

18
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,480
doesn't really matter. No business transactions are affected, no one loses

19
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,380
their place at a conference. And the next announcement will likely

20
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:05,129
come along very soon anyway. Announcements are very transient, and don't

21
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:07,100
need to be saved for the long term and they

22
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,790
don't need to be backed up. So, they're perfect candidates to

23
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,810
be saved in Memcache, and only in Memcache. They don't need

24
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,050
to into the Datastore, that way you get all your announcements

25
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,800
without using any quota. So, you're going to

26
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,640
adding the announcement class to your project. It's

27
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,430
a very simple class, we need it because

28
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,250
n point functions can't return string objects. So

29
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,080
they're going to put the text for the announcement,

30
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,840
in the message field. Note that this class

31
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,930
is not annotated as our entity. We don't

32
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,060
want to save the announcements in the data store.
