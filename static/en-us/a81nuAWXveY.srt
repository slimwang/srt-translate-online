00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,086
When solving the equation, we want to multiply these terms, and then combine

2
00:00:04,099 --> 00:00:08,224
like terms on the same sides of the equation. Negative 4 times x is negative 4x,

3
00:00:08,319 --> 00:00:12,386
and negative 4 times negative 4 is positive 16. This is one of the most common

4
00:00:12,398 --> 00:00:16,655
mistakes in algebra, forgetting to multiply a negative by another negative when

5
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:21,750
distributing. Be careful with that. Next we combine like terms, so, negative 4x

6
00:00:21,762 --> 00:00:26,668
positive 2x make negative 2x. Here I'm going to try and keep my variable

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:31,969
positive. I'm going to add 6x to both sides. Adding 6x to both sides leaves me

8
00:00:31,981 --> 00:00:37,143
with 8 equals 4x plus 16. Subtracting 16 from both sides gives me negative 8

9
00:00:37,155 --> 00:00:42,135
equals 4x. And then my last step is just to divide by the coefficient, or the

10
00:00:42,147 --> 00:00:46,572
number in front of the variable, which is 4. This leaves me with x equals

11
00:00:46,584 --> 00:00:49,270
negative 2. Great work if you got negative 2.
