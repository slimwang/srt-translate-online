00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,732
>> So when we see the word and, it means that both of these inequalities must be

2
00:00:03,732 --> 00:00:07,594
satisfied for the value of x. What I'm curious about is what changing this word

3
00:00:07,594 --> 00:00:11,306
to or does to the relationship between these two inequalities and how that's

4
00:00:11,306 --> 00:00:14,844
going to affect our number line, or our range of values that x is allowed to

5
00:00:14,844 --> 00:00:18,659
equal? Does it mean that neither of these inequalities needs to be satisfied?

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,412
Does it mean that only one of them at a time is allowed to be satisfied, not

7
00:00:22,412 --> 00:00:26,239
both? Does it mean that at least one of them needs to be satisfied, but that

8
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:29,827
both could be? Or does it mean that both of these inequalities need to be

9
00:00:29,827 --> 00:00:30,480
satisfied?
