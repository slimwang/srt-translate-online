00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You should be using 1.8 times the original number of steps.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The original error before I change the number of steps would be something like this.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Let's call it the old error would be a constant times the old step size to the fourth power.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What I want to achieve is that the new error with the new step size is just the 10th part of this,

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and at the same time, because this is supposed to be a solver of order 4,

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
this is the same constant as before times the new step size to the fourth power.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So now we've got two equations that involved the old error and that constant C,

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
this is the first one, this is the second one,

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
we can solve for the new step size which is just basic algebra

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and you'll find that the new step size is the old step size divided by the ⁴√10

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and the ⁴√10 is about 1.8.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So we are reducing the step size by a factor of 1.8

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:22,000
which means that we are increasing the number of steps by that very factor of 1.8.
