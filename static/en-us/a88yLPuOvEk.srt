1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,520
So the reason why the movie quote is still being played,

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,320
is inside PlaySoundsViewController.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,450
Here, we have hard coded the audio player, to always play a movie_quote mp3.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,770
Since I'm not playing this movie quote any more.

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:19,210
What I will do is, I will take these two lines and then I will bring those out,

6
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,110
outside of the if statement, like that.

7
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:26,660
And then I will just comment, my legacy code.

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:31,110
And I can use Cmd+/, to comment a whole bunch of lines together.

9
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,410
Okay. In here when I'm initializing the AVAudioPlayer,

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,410
I have to provide the NSURL to this parameter, contents of URL.

11
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:43,310
Now here, I can use the variable received audio, as this has received some data.

12
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,690
So I can say, received audio.

13
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:50,870
And this has a property called, file pad url.

14
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:51,380
All right.

15
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,340
Let's run this project and see if the code is working.

16
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,032
I'm going to hit the record button.

17
00:00:57,032 --> 00:01:01,208
Swift is fast, but learning it can be slow.

18
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:03,198
And now let me play the sound.

19
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:05,178
Swift is fast but learning it can be slow.

20
00:01:05,178 --> 00:01:07,560
All right, that worked for the first time.

21
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,450
Let's try the other button.

22
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,100
Swift is fast, but learning it can be slow.

23
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,545
Cool, so we have both of these buttons working with our recording now
