00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,910
Let's look at the answer to our
quiz about the relationship between

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:06,833
the block size and the miss rate.

3
00:00:06,833 --> 00:00:08,270
The question was,

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:12,590
which of the three Cs are really
reduced when the miss rate goes down?

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,880
Obviously, some misses
have been eliminated.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,940
The question is which type
suffered the elimination.

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,340
Let's first look at
the compulsory misses.

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,430
If we have a small block size,
and this is our memory,

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,580
we'll bring in this block and
suffer a miss for the first time.

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,250
We bring in another block and
suffer a miss.

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,470
Now let's say we bring this block and
suffer a miss.

12
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:40,280
If the cache line size was
twice of what it is now,

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,650
then this second one would not have
been a miss because when we fetch

14
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:49,800
the first one, this second one would
have also been in the same cache block.

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,160
So as you can see, the increase in
the block size, assuming there is enough

16
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,450
locality, will result in
a reduction in compulsory misses.

17
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:03,240
Another way to look at this is to
note that we get the compulsory miss

18
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,370
when we access the block for
the very first time.

19
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:10,090
Well, if you have larger blocks,
there are fewer blocks, so

20
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,790
there are fewer blocks to access for the
very first time, and that will guarantee

21
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,930
a reduction in compulsory misses,
assuming there is any spatial locality.

22
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,300
Now let's look at capacity misses.

23
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:27,040
Let's say that the program is accessing
a relatively large array that doesn't

24
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,150
fit in the cache, and then,
we go back and access it again.

25
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:37,140
On the second set of accesses,
we're having capacity misses.

26
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,390
The first set of accesses were
compulsory misses because these blocks

27
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:41,840
were never in the cache.

28
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,460
Because they don't fit in the cache, by
the time we get to the end of the array,

29
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,280
the beginning of the array is
kicked out of the cache, and

30
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,430
now we're suffering capacity misses.

31
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,282
These blocks will be in
that infinite cache,

32
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:59,060
they are not in the cache
because it was not large enough.

33
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:04,010
But how many misses we will have for
this array depends on the block size.

34
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:09,840
WIth smaller blocks, the size array
will be occupying more blocks.

35
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,490
WIth larger blocks,
we will have fewer blocks.

36
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:15,690
The number of misses will be
equal to the number of blocks.

37
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:20,030
So as you can see,
if we increase the block size, and

38
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:24,060
our miss rate goes down because
there is plenty of spatial locality,

39
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,500
we are also reducing
the number of capacity misses.

40
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,370
And finally,
if we look at the conflict misses,

41
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:36,290
we can construct a similar example where
two blocks are kicking each other out,

42
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,840
and because,
each time we fetch a larger block,

43
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,710
if the block size goes up,
we will be having few conflict misses.

44
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:49,480
So the increase in block sizes
can improve all types of misses.

45
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,870
That is, it can reduce the number for
all three types of misses.

46
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,100
When we increase the block size,

47
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,550
the compulsory misses are almost
always going to go down.

48
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,110
The capacity misses
are going to go down,

49
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,740
as long as there is enough locality, and

50
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,720
the conflict misses are likely to
stay similar, but might go down.
