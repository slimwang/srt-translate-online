00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,780
We know that we're going to write a loop that searches for long words. And we

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:09,513
know that it should stop if you find one. Or if you run out of words. If I just

3
00:00:09,513 --> 00:00:12,994
worry about running out of words at first, I might write my loop as while

4
00:00:12,994 --> 00:00:18,407
in.hasNext. Keep looking. But now, there is an other condition that I have to

5
00:00:18,407 --> 00:00:23,301
meet as well. I have to not have already found the word. So, i want to keep

6
00:00:23,301 --> 00:00:28,260
looping as long as there's an other word and the wrong word is not found. Now

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,774
inside the loop, we need to actually get the next word. And then, if this word

8
00:00:32,774 --> 00:00:36,312
we just got is long, then we want to save the word for later, and also make

9
00:00:36,312 --> 00:00:41,872
sure to mark that we've found it, so that we can exit the loop. So far, I

10
00:00:41,872 --> 00:00:44,816
haven't created a variable for saving this, but if I scroll down a little bit,

11
00:00:44,816 --> 00:00:48,927
I can see that I want to print out long word. So, let's make a variable called

12
00:00:48,927 --> 00:00:52,773
long word. Now, in my if statement, I'll update long word and set found to

13
00:00:52,773 --> 00:00:57,228
true. Let's try. It says that the first long word in Alice In Wonderland is

14
00:00:57,228 --> 00:01:01,041
ADVENTURES. That sounds appropriate and I'd say that's an important word to

15
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:02,559
Alice In Wonderland.
