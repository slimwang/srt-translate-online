00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:09,449
If we first take 8 times 8 we get 64, and if we
calculate 12 times 12 we get 144. If we then add

2
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:17,800
these together, we get 64+144 are 208,
great. We will make sure that we give you

00:00:17,816 --> 00:00:21,419
plenty of opportunities throughout the
course to practice doing calculations like

00:00:21,419 --> 00:00:24,509
this just in case you found this tricky.
