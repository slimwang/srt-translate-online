1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,130
Okay, let's take a look at this sample.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,939
When I change this,
the width of this green block and

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:08,720
then click this button,
all the paragraphs will change size.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,700
You see, it took a really long time for
that to work out.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,170
To understand why, we need to
look again at the pipeline and

6
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:18,530
specifically the order of
the tasks that it contains.

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,090
The order is pretty clear.

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,020
We do want JavaScript here.

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,588
Then we do our style calculations and
then we do any layout.

10
00:00:25,588 --> 00:00:28,328
Maintaining this order is important.

11
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:29,163
And this is the code.

12
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:33,428
First we select all the paragraphs,
and then the green block.

13
00:00:33,428 --> 00:00:37,028
And then we step through each
of the paragraphs in turn.

14
00:00:37,028 --> 00:00:40,975
For each paragraph,
we request the green block's width, and

15
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:44,710
then we set the width of
each paragraph to match.

16
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:50,210
Now the problem is this, to answer the
question of the element's width, using

17
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:56,070
offsetWidth, the browser must first
calculate it, which requires layout.

18
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,960
But see what that does to the pipeline.

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,200
It moves the layout task into here, and

20
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,850
that puts the layout before
the style calculations.

21
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,560
Now this is not a problem unless
you now make a style change,

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,500
which we did when we set
the width of the paragraph.

23
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,310
Look again at the code.

24
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,740
We request the width,
and then we set a style.

25
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,040
We do layout and
then we do a style calculation.

26
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,340
Every time we change a style,

27
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,729
the layout pass that we just did is
invalidated because you changed things.

28
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,550
So now,
the browser has to do it all again, and

29
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,460
this can be an expensive
mistake to make.

30
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,960
If you trigger a forced
synchronous layout,

31
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,260
DevTools will denote this with
this little exclamation mark here.

32
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,300
In you're in flame chart view,

33
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,870
you'll see a little red triangle
in the corner of a layout record.

34
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:53,660
That's the same thing as the exclamation
mark from the waterfall view.

35
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,270
If you see this warning,

36
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,750
then you need to look at where it was
forced in your code and remove it.
