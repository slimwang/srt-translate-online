1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,870
You've done it.

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,390
Over the last couple of modules,

3
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,270
you've learned how to add Google
sign-in to your Android app.

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,749
You saw how to use the default
sign-in button for Google+, and

5
00:00:10,749 --> 00:00:13,520
how to access the plus APIs using it.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,570
You then saw how to modify that for
a more generic sign-in with

7
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,600
Google experience if you
don't want to use plus.

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,960
You also saw how different scopes give
you access to different information

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,360
With your users permission and
how to implement that.

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,730
To wrap things up,

11
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,810
you saw how this technology allows for
cross device logins.

12
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,380
Improving your users
experience with your apps.

13
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,250
That's it for signing in,
so I'm signing off.

14
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,490
Feel free to add some of
the functionality to your final app and

15
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,590
keep us informed of what you do.

16
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:45,090
Thank you.
