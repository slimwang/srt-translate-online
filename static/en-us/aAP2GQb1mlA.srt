1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,290
The change goes in the octopus for a few reasons.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,010
First off, we don't want to mess up the data that we already have.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,830
And second of all, we don't actually need to change the data itself.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,740
It's just the way we're getting the data from the model to the view.

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,220
Now, why not the view; why not put this in the view?

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,860
Well first of all, the view shouldn't pull things directly from the model.

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,030
Remember, they shouldn't talk directly.

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,530
So as long as we're going through the octopus,

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,750
it makes sense to give the view only what it needs.

10
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,800
Now that being said, technically you could put this functionality in the view.

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,220
But for my model view octopus example, I'm going to leave it in the octopus.

12
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,060
The octopus is where I want all of the real smarts to

13
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,670
live in this organizational paradigm.

14
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:47,720
Whereas the model and the view themselves, are relatively simple.

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,950
Now if you use other organizational libraries, they all have

16
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:55,410
different opinions about where exactly different functionalities should live.

17
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,650
But in all of those cases, they're consistent and well thought out.

18
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:03,360
So for MVO, we're going to keep all of the smart functionality and

19
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,470
the filtering and everything, in the octopus
