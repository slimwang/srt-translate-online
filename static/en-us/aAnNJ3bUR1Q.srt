Remembering that these three points that lie above the X axis, were the points

00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:11,082
we started out with. These three below the X axis are the ones we and up with,

00:00:11,082 --> 00:00:17,052
after reflection in the x-axis. Their coordinates are (1,-1), (4,-2) and

00:00:17,052 --> 00:00:18,029
(9,-3).
