00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,164
Now, as with any fractions, we have a common factor in the numerator and the

2
00:00:03,164 --> 00:00:07,987
denominator. We can divide them by that factor and cancel it out. I'd like to

3
00:00:07,987 --> 00:00:11,578
find the greatest common factor shared by the top and bottom of our rational

4
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:17,088
function here and get rid of it to write the function in simplest terms. Please

5
00:00:17,088 --> 00:00:20,208
note that I've included our domain restriction over here, so you don't have to

6
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:22,279
worry about writing that in.
