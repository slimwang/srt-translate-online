00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,912
>> Let's do a quick overview of the method we used to get from this quadratic

2
00:00:03,912 --> 00:00:08,071
polynomial, which does not have 1 as its coefficient of the first term, to its

3
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:12,266
fully factored form. So you started off by finding two numbers that add to equal

4
00:00:12,266 --> 00:00:16,413
this middle coefficient. And then multiply it equal the product of the two outer

5
00:00:16,413 --> 00:00:20,773
coefficients. Let's see if we can try that method out with another problem. What

6
00:00:20,773 --> 00:00:24,588
if we have the expression 5x squared minus 28x minus 12? How would you fully

7
00:00:24,588 --> 00:00:28,877
factor this quadratic polynomial? Remember the method that we used for the last

8
00:00:28,877 --> 00:00:32,955
one. And if you need to review it, just go back and peek at the past videos.
