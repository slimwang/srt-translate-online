1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
And the answer is,

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
the prior isn't affected by the measurement,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
so the probability of 0 is at red,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and the probability of 1 at green,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
despite the fact that it's all red.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
To see this, you find the joint of seeing it red and seeing red

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
is 0 times 0.8, that's 0.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
That's the same join for green is

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
1 times 0.2.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So you have to normalize 0 and 0.2.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The sum of those is 0.2.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So let's divide 0 by 0.2, gives us 0,

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and 0.2 divided by 0.2 gives us 1.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
These are exactly the numbers over here.
