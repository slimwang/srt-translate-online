00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,190
Welcome back to Computer Vision.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,620
Well actually, we're done.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,890
It's been kind of a long road, but
we just covered a bunch of material.

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,333
I apologize if I talk too much.

5
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:12,375
I do that and
my kids tell me that all the time.

6
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:15,976
But i think you got a bunch of good
grounding on the fundamentals of

7
00:00:15,976 --> 00:00:17,430
Computer Vision.

8
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,310
We manipulated images as functions,

9
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,490
everything from frequency content
to talking about filtering.

10
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,230
We talked about how cameras and camera
models work that allow you to reason

11
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,910
about the geometry
between multiple views.

12
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,780
We talked about finding features in one
image, and how you would find them in

13
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,960
another image, so
that you could relate them, either for

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,640
doing image manipulation, doing for
recognition, or just doing the geometry.

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,260
We talked a little bit about image
formation, in terms of how light

16
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,200
interplays with material in order
to make a picture to begin with.

17
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,860
We talked about how in video
images change and, and

18
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,250
the motion happens in doing tracking.

19
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,300
Then towards the end, we focused a bit
more on recognition, classification.

20
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,630
And we talked about how to do sort
of more serious work in that area,

21
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,450
you would have to know more
about machine learning.

22
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,500
And in fact, that's a good
sort of jumping off point for

23
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,070
where you might go from here.

24
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,910
If you actually wanted to do some
high-end work in computer vision

25
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,610
involving recognition,
classification, labelling,

26
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,340
you probably would have to get well
grounded in machine learning methods.

27
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,970
At least, grounded enough that you
could understand the methods that

28
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,800
are currently being applied.

29
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,090
There's another side, in fact,

30
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,130
one of the other Udacity Georgia Tech
courses on computational photography,

31
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,260
which thinks about the manipulation of
images with respect to creating new

32
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,570
images, or thinking about it sort
of an advanced media perspective.

33
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:36,930
And in particular, even though this
feels like a somewhat comprehensive

34
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,870
course in computer vision, if you were
to sort of go out there and you know,

35
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,610
try to do work in
a computer vision world,

36
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,050
there are some things you'll
see that you didn't see.

37
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:51,660
We were very, shall we say, careful in
many of the images that we gave you.

38
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,208
Images are much less well-behaved
than the images that we gave you.

39
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:56,634
And one of the first things
you find out is that wow,

40
00:01:56,634 --> 00:01:59,737
I wasn't getting the types of
images that I was expecting, and so

41
00:01:59,737 --> 00:02:03,008
you have to think a lot more about how
you get the images to be the way you

42
00:02:03,008 --> 00:02:06,620
want them to be, and
then in order to do the computer vision.

43
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,710
The flip side is consuming the
information that comes out of computer

44
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,538
vision, all right?

45
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:13,640
Is that going to go into some system
that's going to do more reasoning

46
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,640
about the nature of what's going on?

47
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,792
Are you going to set off alarms?

48
00:02:16,792 --> 00:02:17,583
Are you going to mark things?

49
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:18,910
Are you going to go shopping?

50
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,480
What's going to be the output,
how's that output going to be used?

51
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,030
So, I'm sure at this point,
you feel like you've learned some stuff.

52
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,190
There is a lot more to do, but

53
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:34,500
a lot of what needs to be done is really
the applications of these basic skills,

54
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,990
to sort of the specific set of
imagery that you're working with.

55
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,510
So, I hope you will do some of that.

56
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,060
If you do and it works well,
please send us a note.

57
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,050
I love it when I hear
students come back and say,

58
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,280
you know,
I I thought your class was okay.

59
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,350
It's kind of a lot of work.

60
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,670
But man, am I glad I took it,

61
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,290
because I'm now doing this sort of
imagery analysis of aerial imagery, and

62
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,050
all of a sudden I find myself
using stuff that we learned.

63
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,650
So if you have any of those experiences,
please share them with us, with me.

64
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,150
And we look forward to
talking to you again.

65
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:04,650
Bye.
