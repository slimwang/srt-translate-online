1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,575
So, as we talked about in our example
before, we need to use the distributive

2
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:08,328
property here to figure out how this minus
sign affects all of the terms inside the

3
00:00:08,328 --> 00:00:12,632
second set of parentheses. First off
though, since nothing is happening outside

4
00:00:12,632 --> 00:00:15,778
of the parentheses, on the front end at
least, for this first part of our

5
00:00:15,778 --> 00:00:18,775
expression, we're just going to rewrite
that without the parentheses. And then, we

6
00:00:18,775 --> 00:00:23,216
remember the trick that we talked about
before that a minus sign actually means

7
00:00:23,228 --> 00:00:29,019
plus -1 times whatever you want
to subtract. So instead of the minus sign

8
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:32,765
right here, that's what I am going to
write, we're adding -1 times

9
00:00:32,765 --> 00:00:37,554
this entire thing in parentheses. And now,
we need to use the distributive property

10
00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:42,177
to multiply -1 by every term in
here, this is going to affect the 4x^2 and

11
00:00:42,177 --> 00:00:48,319
the -2x and also the 4. So, going one
step further, you'll notice that for right

12
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:52,512
now, I've let there be an addition sign
between all of the terms over here, and

13
00:00:52,512 --> 00:00:56,114
then their sign is being determined
within the term before I change any of

14
00:00:56,114 --> 00:00:59,399
these to subtraction signs if they're
going to be them eventually. So, now we

15
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,586
can carry out the simplification within
each term. Remember that if you have two

16
00:01:03,598 --> 00:01:08,772
negative numbers multiplied together, they
equal a positive number. So, -1 times -2 is

17
00:01:08,784 --> 00:01:12,526
actually equal to positive 2. And now,
since we have two terms where I'm adding a

18
00:01:12,526 --> 00:01:17,168
negative, I'm going to switch these to
negative signs or minus signs. And then,

19
00:01:17,168 --> 00:01:21,760
last but not least, we rearrange and
combine like terms. So our final answer is

20
00:01:21,775 --> 00:01:27,225
3x^2+4x-3.
Awesome job. There are a ton of steps as

21
00:01:27,225 --> 00:01:31,204
you can see in this problem, and there are
a lot of places where it's really easy to

22
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:35,123
make a silly mistake, so that's why it's
super important that we write every single

23
00:01:35,135 --> 00:01:38,735
step down. I know this probably feels
really tedious, but, in the end, as you

24
00:01:38,747 --> 00:01:42,502
keep practicing getting more proficient,
it's going to be the thing that gives you

25
00:01:42,514 --> 00:01:46,191
the right answers. So please just keep
taking the time to write out all of your

26
00:01:46,203 --> 00:01:48,524
steps and don't take any shortcuts quite
yet.
