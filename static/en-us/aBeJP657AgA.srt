00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,120
Let's talk about calendars.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,040
Many forms need the concept of a date.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,920
It shows up everywhere,
ordering plane tickets, movie tickets,

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,600
setting a doctor appointment, and
probably a million other examples.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:20,090
You could turn dates into a three or
four parts process with time,

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,350
day of month, months, and a year.

7
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,670
Or you could use a calendar widget.

8
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:30,560
I like calendar widgets because they are
much simpler, and more straightforward.

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,810
You've got a few options for
displaying calendars.

10
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,980
You could use the browser's
implementation by setting the attribute

11
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,380
type equal daytime locale
on an input element.

12
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,990
But, you might find that it
doesn't match the visual theme

13
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,810
of your app, that's fine.

14
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:52,580
You could always edit it styles or
simply roll on your own CSS,

15
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,180
using web components or
a JavaScript widget.

16
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,880
See the instructor notes, for

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,040
some more info about styling or
building calendars.

18
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,800
Other way, the most important thing,

19
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,950
Is to show your users a full calendar
when they need to set a date.

20
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,590
If not, users will never get away
from your form to look up dates

21
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,580
which only increase the odds that they
will abandon the form all together.

22
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,760
Here is another example.

23
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,720
When I wish to book a flight,
I can see clearly what are the dates

24
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,520
that this flight is going
to take off and land.

25
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,820
Dates are common.

26
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,570
Show your users calendars
when they need them.
