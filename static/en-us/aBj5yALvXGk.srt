00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,166
So here's our guide, our steps that we could follow to add rational expressions

2
00:00:04,166 --> 00:00:08,674
together. First, we want to factor the denominators and find the LCD. Next, we

3
00:00:08,674 --> 00:00:13,820
multiply each fraction by the missing factors of the LCD to get equivalent

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:18,775
fractions. Finally, we add the numerators together and then we check if we can

5
00:00:18,775 --> 00:00:23,587
simplify this by cancelling any factors. And again, don't make the mistake of

6
00:00:23,587 --> 00:00:27,832
canceling terms. We can't cancel these since this is addition in the numerator.

7
00:00:27,832 --> 00:00:30,433
We can only cancel factors.
