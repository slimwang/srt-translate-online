1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,510
It's okay to use such an algorithm if the stakes are low.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:07,900
It's also okay if no better algorithm is available, I mean if you need to solve your problem,

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,720
better have a suboptimal solution than no solution at all.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,560
Only if you don't know better, that was probably the only answer where I would argue with you

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,260
because even if you don't know better algorithm for a problem, you should ask around.

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,790
So, for example, when you're working on a problem like shortest tour,

7
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:27,540
there are lots of specialized solutions, specialized algorithms, special cases,

8
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,630
so better talk to an expert before settling for a suboptimal algorithm,

9
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,110
but of course I realized that this quiz is a bit subjective

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,440
and you might object to some of my answers.

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,090
For example, saying that the stakes are low is something that is rather dangerous

12
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:45,350
because sometimes even a small improvement can be worth a lot of money or save lives,

13
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,800
so you have to be careful with this one, and also here if it's a high-stake problem,

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,420
well, maybe it's worth putting some thought into it and designing your own better algorithm

15
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,280
especially if it's not one of those famous problems here,

16
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,420
chances are that maybe nobody has looked at it closely enough.

17
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,460
In any case, and I think you remember my point from the beginning of this unit,

18
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:08,570
using a randomized algorithm without any guarantees or detour in sight is always a gamble.

19
00:01:08,570 --> 99:59:59,999
So you need to think about if you want to take that gamble. It might be okay, it might not be.
