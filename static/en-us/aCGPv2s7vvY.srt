1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's examine a type of auction called the second price option.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This is popular in various internet search and auction sites.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The way it works is that we have a line of possible prices--

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
higher prices at the top--and bids come in.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Different players can bid whatever they want,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and whoever bids the highest is the winner,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
but the price that they pay is the price of the second highest bidder.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Now let's say you're participating in this auction,

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and something is for sale, and you place a value on that.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We'll call that value "V", and say V is here.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Your bid we'll call "b", and the highest other bid we'll call "c."

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Now the payoff to you if your bid is higher than all the others

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
then the payoff is you get the value of the auction,

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
because you won the item, and you get V,

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
but you have to pay the second highest price, which is c.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You get b minus c. Otherwise, you lose the auction.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You don't get anything, and you don't pay anything.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The value to you of the auction is zero.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What I want you to do is fill in this chart to look at different strategies for different possible bids.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We'll say that the value to you of the item for sale is V equals 10.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You have the option of bidding, say, 12, 10, or 8,

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and we'll consider the cases where the highest other bid is 7, 9, 11, or 13.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What I want you to do is fill in this chart with the value to you

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
of this game according to your strategy and the strategies of the other players.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Tell me if one of these strategies is a dominant strategy.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Then tell me is that dominant strategy, if there is one, a truth revealing strategy?

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I should have one note about dominance.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
When we talked about it before, we glossed over the possibility of ties.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
If some policy is better everywhere than any other policy,

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
then we say that that policy strictly dominates the others.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
On the other hand, if there are some ties and some places where its better

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
but none where it's worse, then we say it weakly dominates.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Either way, it's a case of dominance.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Now I'll do the first entry to get you started.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
If you bid 12 and the highest other bid is 7,

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
then you have the high bid, so you win.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's a second-price auction, so you pay 7.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The value of the goods is 10, so the total value of the outcome is 10 minus the cost of 7 for 3.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I want you to fill in the rest.
