00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,110
So when it comes to putting
ads in a native app,

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,480
there's actually a lot of different
things we have to consider.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,980
Especially because the screen
size on a phone or

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,810
a tablet is a lot smaller than it
might be on a desktop application.

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,190
So what do we have to keep in mind?

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,149
>> There are several things.

7
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:19,190
Every app offer a different type
of experience to its users.

8
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,110
So it's important that your ad
format match that experience.

9
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,270
While a banner ad may work well for

10
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:31,020
a flashlight app, a gaming app could
benefit much more from a full video app.

11
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,720
In other words,
you need to take into consideration

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,520
the placement within your app and
the different ad formats.

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,489
You could try the two leading platforms.

14
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:41,390
Adsense or double-click.

15
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,930
However, there are other platforms
out there for you to check out.

16
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,890
>> And we've linked them in
the instructor notes below.
