00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,657
>> We can actually use slope intercept form to graph this line as well. We can

2
00:00:04,657 --> 00:00:09,489
graph this equation by starting with the y-intercept or the b. So, I look on my

3
00:00:09,489 --> 00:00:14,579
y-axis, and I go to 20 units. 0,20 my y-intercept. You can start at this point

4
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:19,362
because we begin graphing with the letter b. Now that we have the point of the

5
00:00:19,362 --> 00:00:24,337
y-intercept, we can graph using our slope. Positive 2. I know slope is rise

6
00:00:24,337 --> 00:00:28,705
divided by run. So, I'm going to write my number 2 as 2 divided by 1. Both of

7
00:00:28,705 --> 00:00:33,474
these numbers are positive, so I need to move in a positive direction. I'm going

8
00:00:33,474 --> 00:00:37,806
to go up two units and then right one unit. These are my directions for how I

9
00:00:37,806 --> 00:00:42,414
should move from this point on the graph. I should move up two units, and then

10
00:00:42,414 --> 00:00:46,941
right one unit. Notice that my y-axis is in increments of 4. So, I only need to

11
00:00:46,941 --> 00:00:51,192
move up half that amount. Half that amount would be two units. Then, on my

12
00:00:51,192 --> 00:00:55,493
x-axis, I move one direction to the right. So, I moved two units up, and then

13
00:00:55,493 --> 00:00:59,949
one unit to the right. That gets me to my next point on the graph. If I repeat

14
00:00:59,949 --> 00:01:04,507
this process, I can continue getting other points on the graph. I go up two

15
00:01:04,507 --> 00:01:08,482
units, right one unit. Up two units, right one unit. I know it looks a little

16
00:01:08,482 --> 00:01:13,086
funny on this graph, but it's because we've used a scale here. So the coordinate

17
00:01:13,086 --> 00:01:16,728
grid doesn't match these numbers. It looks a little different.
