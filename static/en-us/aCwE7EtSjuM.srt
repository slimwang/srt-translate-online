00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,440
Payments, or exchanges, have been around for a long time.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,310
And digital payments, or wallets, are becoming increasingly popular. We're

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,190
going to take this idea of a digital wallet, and give

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,460
it a twist. You're going to be designing the user interface

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,330
for a new time bank, mobile device. So what's a

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,110
time bank? Well, that's our challenge. What if people could exchange

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,570
their time, and expertise, for others' time, and expertise, all

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,900
hours being equal? We'll create a portable time bank that enables

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,290
you to exchange your hours with someone else's. In

10
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,920
this case, the time bank is a credit card size

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,330
touch interface, and it will fit in the wallet,

12
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,590
like this. So you can carry it around with you.
