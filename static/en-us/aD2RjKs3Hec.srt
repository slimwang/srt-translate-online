00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,719
Alright. In this project, we're actually going to

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:06,590
build something. So here's what we're going to do.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:10,150
We're going to take a box, any box. And do anything you want to it. So

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:14,820
that the box, if you put in on a table and anyone passed by. They would be

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,160
invited, without any instructions. To rub it and turn it. And grab it.
