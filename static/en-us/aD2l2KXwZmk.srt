00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Dave] So welcome to Homework 1.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Homework is going to be a little different from quizzes,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
so unlike the quizzes where you get instant feedback for each question,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
in the homework you'll submit your answers,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and you won't see feedback on them until you submit your answers,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and after the deadline for the homework, we'll be posting answers

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and having discussion about the questions.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So for Question 1, we want to see that you understand

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
how web pages are constructed and what a web crawler will do.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The goal for Question 1 is for you to find all the target links

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
in the sample web page that we've provided.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So for each potential answer here,

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
check the box if that corresponds to a URL

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
that's a target link in the sample page.
