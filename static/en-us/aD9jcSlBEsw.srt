00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,220
Well, the answer, as I said, is a, right?

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,860
We have, the f can be multiplied by a for

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,120
the two different scales or we can have the two different scales.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,540
But there aren't three numbers there.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,600
There's actually only two.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,780
And so the answer is a.
