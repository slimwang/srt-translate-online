Paul just explained how he used Flip
to create a pretty snazzy animation.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,330
He performed all the hard calculations
up front, so that he would touch

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,880
as little of the pipeline as possible
during the actual animation.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,570
This is how he kept it going at
a silky smooth 60 frames per second.

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,590
When he applied opacity and transform
changes to reverse the animation,

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,600
what steps in the rendering
pipeline did Paul trigger?

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,050
Did the HTML need to get
converted to the DOM?

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,330
Did the CSS need to get
converted to the CSSOM?

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,490
Did the DOM and CSSOM need to be
combined into the Render Tree?

10
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,200
Did the browser have to run Layout
again, Composite again, or Paint again?

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:34,870
Check all that apply.
