1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:05,740
Congestive heart failure occurs when the
heart is no longer an effective pump.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,230
It's the single most
expensive ICD-9 code, so

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,240
there's great interest in
improving our care of it.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,700
Early on, the symptoms are subtle,
so it may not be diagnosed for

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,720
some time, even after they begin.

6
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:24,810
Since earlier treatment can
forestall expensive complications,

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,510
earlier diagnosis is preferable.

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,750
To help with this, researches first
analyze electronic patient records,

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,395
including the parts that were free text,
such as the patient reported symptoms.

10
00:00:38,395 --> 00:00:43,740
They developed feature extraction
algorithms, as illustrated here,

11
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,430
that use the structured and

12
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:51,120
text components to develop a set of
from 10 to 100,000 clinical features.

13
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,460
These were classified using
both logistic regression,

14
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,860
a statistical technique commonly used
to predict whether a patient has

15
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:03,700
a condition based on characteristics
of the patient, and random forests.

16
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:08,300
Which is a method that uses multiple
methods to classify objects.

17
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:12,280
This determined which features
are in fact predictive.

18
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,280
As shown here, the resulting
model substantially outperforms

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,650
the diagnosis of CHF based solely
on the medical literature, when as

20
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,900
few as 50 features with high predictive
power based on the model are added.
