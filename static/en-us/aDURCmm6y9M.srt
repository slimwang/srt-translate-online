00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,209
>> Our second option, however, is to solve this just algebraically. We've solved

2
00:00:04,209 --> 00:00:08,327
quadratic equations before, when we're trying to find x intercepts. The only

3
00:00:08,327 --> 00:00:12,295
difference between those situations, and this one, is that we have a 3 over

4
00:00:12,295 --> 00:00:16,639
here. Remember that a quadratic equation, is anything that can be written in the

5
00:00:16,639 --> 00:00:20,793
form Ax squared plus Bx plus C equals 0. The issue here, is that we don't have

6
00:00:20,793 --> 00:00:25,250
0, on this side of the equation, so let's make it happen. How do we do that? You

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,597
know you just subtract 3 from both sides, that gives us X squared plus 8x plus

8
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:34,101
twelve equals 0. Since you know how to solve this using factoring, I'd like you

9
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:38,359
to tell me the possible solutions for X. In the event that you find X can take

10
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:42,575
on multiple values to make this equation true, please just write all those

11
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:45,428
values in this box but separate them with commas.
