00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'm working with acceleration here other than the force

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
because acceleration is already offered by the rest of the program,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and I said before, I can reuse one of these accelerations,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
which is why I start the initial acceleration in this variable code, well, initial acceleration.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Here comes Euler as we know it, these two lines,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and then I'll form the average of the velocities to go to the next step

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and I'll form the average of the accelerations to go to the next step and that's all.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If you run that program, you see two series of data.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The upper one is the one that we know, the errors of the forward Euler's method,

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and the lower one are the errors of Heun's method and you see these are really low.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So this method really rocks out.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
On top of that, you see that this seems to be a parabola.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
While Euler's method almost forms a line here, Heun's method forms a parabola.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So it's good and it even gets better as we shrink the step size.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
There is a price to pay--we call that acceleration function twice.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
If you look at what we get for that price, that really pays off.
