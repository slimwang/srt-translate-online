1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,140
What did you come up with?

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:07,059
>> So I'll just go in order,
been or have not yet

3
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:11,849
been, get, put, a couple of is', take,

4
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:16,639
examine, consists, increment, throw,

5
00:00:16,639 --> 00:00:22,600
throw away, split,
put them back and display.

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,960
>> Okay, first off, what happened
to keep, the very first word?

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,820
>> Oh, I missed it.

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,340
I guess I was assuming.

9
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,490
Most sentences start with nouns.

10
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,960
I probably just over looked it.

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,640
>> Okay, so keep is clearly a verb.

12
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,200
And then you had been, or has been.

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,060
But really that's just part of
the construction of has been counted.

14
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,850
It's counting that is the verb there.

15
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:53,250
You might want to add that to your list,
replace been with count.

16
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:59,270
So in the same sense that we dealt with
nouns by stemming, we might stem here as

17
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:04,290
well so the verb is count, and
counting is just one form of that.

18
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,811
And then you had get and put [COUGH].

19
00:01:09,811 --> 00:01:12,920
Is, on the surface,
is a linking verb but

20
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,430
it was part of a phrase that
says is set and set is a verb.

21
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,590
And I don't see you
having set in your list.

22
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:23,586
>> Okay.
>> So

23
00:01:23,586 --> 00:01:26,580
we want to add set in as a verb here.

24
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,615
And you've got take, you've got examine,

25
00:01:33,615 --> 00:01:36,380
you've got consists.

26
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,000
Do you have increment?

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,250
Yes, okay, throw or throw away.

28
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,650
You've got split and you've got display.

29
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:48,070
Okay, you've got put twice and just like
before, we're going to combine those

30
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,210
together so that we only have
a single occurrence of that.

31
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,240
This is a list of candidate operations
and of course we're going to want to

32
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,130
associate them with the class
that they belong to.

33
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,550
And you have to use your knowledge
of the English language in order to

34
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,140
determine what that is.

35
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:10,210
But if you start with,
did you write down keep there?

36
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:10,716
>> I did not write down keep.

37
00:02:10,716 --> 00:02:11,336
>> You might want to put that down.

38
00:02:11,336 --> 00:02:11,836
>> Okay.
