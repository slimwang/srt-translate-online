1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,110
And there you have it.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,980
The final lookup yields nothing more interesting than

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,250
the previous calls to the first of the saga functions.

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,310
It's as if this second saga function had never been called, or

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,200
at least it doesn't matter whether it has been called or not.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,030
The two operate so much in isolation that it is unimportant whether or

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:23,160
not other calls to other functions from other contexts ever happened.

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,510
Our last call to the saga functions has finished,

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,500
the context jumps back out to the global context and

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,480
you've finished everything there is to know about closures.
