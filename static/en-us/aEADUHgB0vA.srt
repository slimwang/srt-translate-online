00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,969
I've designed another class, that I call the Simulation class, that puts all

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:06,958
the information together. It keeps a list of all the cars in the simulation and

3
00:00:06,958 --> 00:00:11,885
all of the people. I'm giving you a method to read in all of those data, and

4
00:00:11,885 --> 00:00:15,533
that's not the part that I'm most interested right now, so we'll glance right

5
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:21,156
past it. Now the simulation has two phases. In the first phase one loads all

6
00:00:21,156 --> 00:00:24,756
the passengers into the cars and in the second phase we drive all the cars

7
00:00:24,756 --> 00:00:29,902
until they have arrived. So go ahead and implement this method, what you

8
00:00:29,902 --> 00:00:33,382
going to have to do is for each passenger you want to find a car that can hold

9
00:00:33,382 --> 00:00:36,982
it, that means you need a loop over all the cars until one of them says yes,

10
00:00:36,982 --> 00:00:41,260
this passenger can be added
