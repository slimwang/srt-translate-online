00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In this table what I've done is I've taken samples of text in 3 languages

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and just counted to the frequency of the letter bigrams,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and then ordered them from top to bottom.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And so for language A, TH was the most frequent letter bigram,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
TE was the second most frequent, and so on

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
In language B, EN was most popular, ER was the second most popular, and so on.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And the same for language C.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What I want you to do is just try to guess which language is which.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Is language A English, German, or Azerbaijani?

10
00:00:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And do the same for B and C.
