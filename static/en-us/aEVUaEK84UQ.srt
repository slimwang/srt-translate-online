1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So, what are the chances that D2 is sunny?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Suppose the same dynamics apply from D2 to D3,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
so just replace D3 over here with D2s over there.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That means the transition probabilities from one day to the next remain the same.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Tell me, what's the probability that D3 is sunny?
