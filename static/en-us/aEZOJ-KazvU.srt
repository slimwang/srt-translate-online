00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is that breadth-first search is complete,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
so even if the tree is infinite, if the goal is placed at any finite level,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
eventually, we're going to march down and find that goal.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Same with cheapest first.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
No matter where the goal is, if it has a finite cost,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
eventually, we're going to go down and find it.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But not so for depth-first search.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If there's an infinite path, depth-first search will keep following that,

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
so it will keep going down and down and down along this path

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and never get to the path that the goal consists of

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and never get to the path on which the goal sits.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So, depth-first search is not complete.
