00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,015
In this session we're going to
talk about a powerful data type

2
00:00:03,015 --> 00:00:05,620
called enumerations,
or enums, for short.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,410
As developers, we can think of
enums as a type that can represent

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,090
any value in a set of related values.

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,140
For example, North, South, East, and

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,600
West, these are values we could
represent with an enum called direction.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,150
Let's get started.
