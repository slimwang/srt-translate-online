1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,402
So first let's look at a little bit more in detail a,

2
00:00:03,402 --> 00:00:07,730
a very well-known form of a camera, a single-lens reflex camera.

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,320
This is an example of one.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,330
It has a lens and the whole body.

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,170
I'm going to take the lens off.

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,690
And it basically now can see more details of this camera.

7
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,170
We'll look at it much more in detail in a few seconds.

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,940
But you basically see that there are certain aspects of this camera.

9
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,490
There's a viewfinder.

10
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,590
In there there is a mirror which moves away.

11
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,200
We'll see examples of that a lot.

12
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,240
And of course, this is where the shutter release is.

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,750
So this is a standard film camera here.

14
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,870
I wanted to also show you this.

15
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:41,840
Most of your concern that I've exposed film, this was an exposed film already.

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,390
We will be looking at more detail what a film like this looks like.

17
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,310
But this is again, you know, one of the more widely used form factors for

18
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,420
professional photography.

19
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:57,210
So here I'm showing you now a cut out of the same camera, or similar camera.

20
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,310
Here you can see all of the details that we looked at.

21
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,630
This where the view finder was.

22
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,790
The focus, or zoom ring and the lens.

23
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,360
And I took this out before I showed you any of this stuff, were right here.

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,040
The shutter release button is right there.

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,970
This is the one that when you press opens the mechanism, so

26
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,680
let the light in to where the film would be.

27
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,860
The lenses are all in the mechanisms right here.

28
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,230
There is a diaphragm.

29
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,930
And we'll talk about the diaphragm and all of that kinds of stuff.

30
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,930
Because that's where all of the openings are controlled between these

31
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,170
lenses to allow the right kinds of light into the camera.

32
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,710
And of course this was a film camera, so there is where the film is.

33
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,300
In the new modern digital cameras of course,

34
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,030
the film has been replaced by a CCD sensor or CMOS sensor.

35
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,020
Again, something we will be looking at in much more detail later.

36
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,030
And all of the focal plane shutters are all mechanisms that are built in here.

37
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,610
That actually let again, different things happen in terms of

38
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,770
how the focal planes and everything as I suggested,

39
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:03,380
to get the right kinds of light into, to where the film is.

40
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,680
Now, of course, you noticed, and I showed you the thing, there was a glass here.

41
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,530
Basically single-lens reflex,

42
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,680
this thing opens to allow you to get the light in correctly.

43
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,870
And this, the prismatic sensor, that lets the light into the viewfinder so

44
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,990
the viewfinder can see exactly what the lens is seeing.

45
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:21,058
And as soon as the shutter is released, the mirror moves up and

46
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:23,790
then the light basically goes and hits the film.

47
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:28,044
So you actually get to see exactly what you're seeing will the one,

48
00:02:28,044 --> 00:02:30,293
the image that will be registered.

49
00:02:30,293 --> 00:02:33,480
And actually then imaged on the sensor or the film
