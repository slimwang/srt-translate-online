00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,650
So things that can go wrong when
you're outsourcing your job is

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,660
low quality of work.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,770
It happens a lot of times, you're just
asking someone to do something and

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,800
this is not what I asked for,
or this is in such low quality,

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,770
how possibly can you think that I
am going to accept this this job?

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:25,080
Another thing is that they charge
you more money than they should.

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,880
They said they worked on
this project for 50 hours,

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,470
but you know that in it never
took them more than five hours.

9
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,800
What, seriously?

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,310
And they can be not responsive,
they're not answering emails,

11
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:42,640
they're not answering your
instant messages in time.

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,110
The slack world is empty and
basically a lot of the stuff that can

13
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:51,360
happen when you remotely work with
employees, it's not that different.

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,590
But it's kind of more annoying.
