00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,600
We need to be able to get a baseline to compare our caffeine group to. In an

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,890
experimental study, there are two types of groups. There's the experimental

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:13,490
group and there's the control group. The control group receives the same exact

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:18,220
treatment as the experimental group. The only difference is the independent

5
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:23,740
variable. So, in our case, our control group does not receive caffeine. Our

00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,519
independent variable, but the experimental group does.
