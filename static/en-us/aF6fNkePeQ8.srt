00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,844
You've just run into the phenomenon called Overflow. Just like a glass of

2
00:00:04,844 --> 00:00:09,358
orange soda can overflow when the foam goes wild, the same can happen with

3
00:00:09,358 --> 00:00:17,001
integers. The largest integer that java can represent is this number over here.

4
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:20,649
don't worry about the exact number, but you do want to remember that it's about

5
00:00:20,649 --> 00:00:25,836
2 billion. When a number gets larger than 2 billion in change then java can no

6
00:00:25,836 --> 00:00:30,114
longer hold the value in an integer, and the most common remedy is to use the

7
00:00:30,114 --> 00:00:36,134
double type. Give it a try. Here, one million is typed as a floating point

8
00:00:36,134 --> 00:00:41,050
number, as a double. Now multiply it by itself, and what do you get for

9
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,110
mystery?
