1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,240
While weather prediction is a good tester performance.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,150
The finer the grid on which the weather is computed, the higher the quality of

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:13,100
prediction made, and so having many, many computations on a fine grid, which

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,149
might stress the performance of a system is the best way to get good results.

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,550
As far as security is concerned, online banking.

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,830
Certainly, you don't want anybody interfering with your bank accounts.

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,100
And so, having a highly secured banking system is important.

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,240
As far as safety conce, is concerned,

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,410
I want the cruise control software on my card to be highly, highly safe.

10
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,830
Maintainability, I'm thinking here of the Twitter API.

11
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,260
That is we know that there are many, many applications that are based upon

12
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,410
the twitter API, and over time if we can maintain stability and

13
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,150
maintainability of that API, those applications won't be broken.

14
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:56,440
As far as reliability is concerned, I want my traffic light controllers.

15
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,460
So, at every intersection you come to where there's traffic lights

16
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,730
those traffic lights are controlled by some kind of control box, and we

17
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,650
want that control box to be, the software on it to be as reliable as possible.
