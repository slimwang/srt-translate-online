00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,088
So, in addition to hostile aggression, we also have what's known as

2
00:00:03,088 --> 00:00:07,518
instrumental aggression. And instrumental aggression occurs when someone acts

3
00:00:07,518 --> 00:00:12,354
aggressively. But in the service of achieving some particular goal. Good

4
00:00:12,354 --> 00:00:17,396
examples of this happen often in sports. So, for instance, in hockey. Let's say

5
00:00:17,396 --> 00:00:21,090
someone body checks someone real hard into the boards. In order to prevent that

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,550
person from getting the puck. This is instrumental aggression, because it's

7
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,511
used in the service of achieving a goal, in this case preventing the guy from

8
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:33,032
getting the puck. This is different from hostile aggression. Now we're going to

9
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:35,429
go to Lauren, for a word on biology and aggression.
