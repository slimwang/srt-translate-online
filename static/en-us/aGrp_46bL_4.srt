1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,969
For the first one, no.

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:06,351
While CSS can act a little
strangely sometimes,

3
00:00:06,351 --> 00:00:11,051
the situation you see here is not one
that would be caused by quirks in

4
00:00:11,051 --> 00:00:13,872
the way different browsers handle CSS.

5
00:00:13,872 --> 00:00:15,938
For the second one, yes.

6
00:00:15,938 --> 00:00:20,240
Different device pixel ratios can
definitely change the size of content on

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,450
the page,
if you don't handle it correctly.

8
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,810
For the third one, nope.

9
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:30,630
Initial scale isn't going to cause the
inconsistent zooming that you see here.

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,380
And for the fourth one, yeah.

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,690
This could be a reason.

12
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,340
Without defining the viewport,
you're leaving it up to the browser to

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,600
determine the viewport size, which could
cause a disparity that you see here.
