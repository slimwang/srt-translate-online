1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,990
So these tools give us the ability to build designs that

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:06,270
are fluid. But as it turns out, that's not enough. As you

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,050
may have noticed as you went through this lesson, the experience

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,270
of re-flow from a very small window size to a very large

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,730
window size is not really a great one for the user.

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,340
Now that you know how to build fluid designs, you need to

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,060
learn to adapt those designs to radically different scenarios, like a

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,560
four inch phone screen, and a 30 inch desktop screen. And that's

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,590
what we're going to be talking about in the next lesson.
