00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,010
Many game developers, especially
those creating Freemium games use A/B

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:09,510
testing to help design ads and in app
purchases to be the most effective.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,950
Here I have an example of
an in app purchase offer.

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:17,450
It offers a new character,
a frog, you can buy for 99 cents.

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,031
Let's think about how we can use
A/B testing to improve this in-app

6
00:00:21,031 --> 00:00:22,340
purchase offer.

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,730
What are some good examples of
variables to test in our A/B scenarios?

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,500
Check all that apply.

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,000
The age of our players,
the appearance of the offer,

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,430
the price of the offer, or testing
all these variables at the same time.
