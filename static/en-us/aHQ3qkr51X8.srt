1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,010
So we're going to generalize this
notion of a Bellman equation to

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,100
Bellman Equations.

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,190
And the way we're going to do that is by
noting that in the previous derivation.

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:11,370
The way that we're thinking about
things is we capture this V here,

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,805
as the repeating structure that's
starts with the max a, right?

6
00:00:15,805 --> 00:00:17,455
So it's actually this piece.

7
00:00:17,455 --> 00:00:19,025
This sort of infinite piece here.

8
00:00:19,025 --> 00:00:22,215
So the whole V consists
of this sub V in it and

9
00:00:22,215 --> 00:00:25,135
this is why this piece gets
substituted for the V in the equation.

10
00:00:25,135 --> 00:00:25,985
>> Yeah, and that makes sense.

11
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:30,115
And you have an infinite number of
these things going on forever and ever.

12
00:00:30,115 --> 00:00:33,325
And I noticed an infinite
number of left parentheses and

13
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:34,500
not enough right parentheses.

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,880
Oh, no.
This stripe bracket

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,860
has traditionally represented
the balancing of all left parentheses.

16
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,510
>> Oh, right.

17
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,540
That's from LISP.

18
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,650
>> Yeah, it's just a shorthand.

19
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:42,970
>> Nice.
Nice lisp.

20
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:43,710
LISP.
See?

21
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,282
Lisp.
>> Lisp.

22
00:00:44,282 --> 00:00:48,830
>> [LAUGH] Nice LISP reference.

23
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:49,470
>> Thanks!

24
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,320
But the thing is because this is
an infinite sequence, there's actually

25
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,590
a number of other ways that we
can group this infinite sequence.

26
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,560
So let me draw another one.

27
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,910
>> Okay.
>> So we can also group

28
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,400
the infinite sequence here.

29
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,610
And notice that it repeats like this.

30
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,959
So, this expression after the max,
the starting from the R and

31
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,620
then moving forward repeats again here.

32
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,840
And so we can actually make
a new equation that depends on

33
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,430
that substructure repeated.

34
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,440
So let me right that out.

35
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,600
So, the idea is, we can actually just
give a name to this big outer brace.

36
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,710
So we'll call it, Q (s,a) and
we'll say it's equal to R (s,a) plus

37
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:24,424
the discount factor times the sum
over the next possible state, so

38
00:01:24,424 --> 00:01:26,239
the probably of getting there.

39
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:31,023
Times max a2, our next max, of and then
there's that repeating structure again

40
00:01:31,023 --> 00:01:34,260
so we can just plug in Q of
S prime a prime for that.

41
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,340
This gives us another Bellman equation
that instead of starting at the S point.

42
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,370
Kind of starts after
the action has started.

43
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:44,560
>> Well, wait if it starts after the
action has started why isn't it Q of a?

44
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,970
>> Okay that's a fair question.

45
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:49,070
So could we have written
the Q value of an action,

46
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,530
the Q value of this point
in the sequence, this way?

47
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:55,870
Right, the reward for leaving that
state and taking that action,

48
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,090
plus the discounted value of the future.

49
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,350
What's the problem with this?

50
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,250
>> Well, I see two problems.

51
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,400
One is kind of mathematical and
one is sort of semantic.

52
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,290
So, mathematically,
it doesn't make sense,

53
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,080
because where did the S come from,
in R(S,a)?

54
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,210
>> Yeah,
this is an unbound variable, right?

55
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:10,930
So that's an error.

56
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:11,930
>> We can't have that.

57
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,320
And the second is,

58
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,800
when you actually write it that way, so
here you're arguing that Q is like V?

59
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,420
>> Yeah.

60
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:18,960
>> Right?

61
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,614
So you're asking me what the qual view.

62
00:02:21,614 --> 00:02:25,340
>> [LAUGH]
>> Of a is.

63
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,350
But the value of
an action is meaningless,

64
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,670
except in the presence of the state
where you're taking an action.

65
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,430
>> That's exactly right.

66
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,450
So, in particular,

67
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,090
we're conditioning our reward on
both the state and the action.

68
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,640
So it doesn't really make
sense to be able to talk about

69
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,290
what our future value's going to be if
we don't really know where we started.

70
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:45,270
So the idea here is that we started
at some state S, we take action a and

71
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,720
then we proceed every after.

72
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,970
>> Okay, so that makes sense.
