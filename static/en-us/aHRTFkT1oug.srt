1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,040
I've created a new user class here like
so, similarly to the Restaurant and

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,470
menu items classes.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,500
In both the Restaurant and MenuItem
classes there is now a user_id variable,

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,130
and the relationship declaration to
establish a ForeignKey relationship

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,880
between these items and
the user that created them.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,507
I'll read in the database
output in the create_engine to

7
00:00:18,507 --> 00:00:20,067
restaurantmenuwithusers.db.

8
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:22,840
So we don't override our
old database just yet.

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,000
You can go ahead and
run database_setup.py and

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,210
it will create a new database
complete with our user functionality.

11
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,980
There's a new lotsofmenus.py found
in the instruction notes that will

12
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,960
repopulate the database and set the user
ID for all the restaurants equal to one.

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,380
Go ahead and run this as well.

14
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,880
The sample code for this video is
available in the instructor notes.
