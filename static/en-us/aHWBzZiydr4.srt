Let's try working through 1 last problem with motion and a current. In this

2
00:00:03,926 --> 00:00:08,910
problem, a riverboat averages 12 miles per hours in still water. It takes the

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,760
boat an hour and 4 minutes to go 6 miles upstream, and then come back. What I

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,308
want you to do, is to find the speed of the current. Before we find the speed

5
00:00:18,308 --> 00:00:22,268
of the current, let's set up our information. I want you to fill in each of

6
00:00:22,268 --> 00:00:25,184
these parts of our table, and be sure to use the variable x for your

7
00:00:25,184 --> 00:00:30,440
expressions. Think carefully about which of these should be numbers, and which

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,032
of these should be expressions.
