00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,380
In fact, that's exactly what a component diagram does.

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:07,440
It's a static implementation view of how the components of a system fit

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,880
together. As far as UML is concerned, a, a component is a physical,

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,950
replaceable part of a system that packages implementation and conforms to and

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:23,360
provides a realization of the set of interfaces. It's usually used to model

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,990
code entities such as binaries, okay, that might perhaps come from a library.

7
00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:33,920
And relationships in the diagram are meant intended to

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,689
specify that one of the components uses the services of another component.

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,630
This particular type of diagram can also be used to convey architecture.
