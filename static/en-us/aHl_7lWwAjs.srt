00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,824
We're going to continue solving equations and this time, we're going to solve

2
00:00:02,824 --> 00:00:06,780
some radical equations. We'll use our knowledge of radicals and powers to help

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:11,094
us out. When we solve radical equations like this one, we want to isolate the

4
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:16,318
square root or the root on one side of the equals sign. This equation already

5
00:00:16,318 --> 00:00:20,124
has the radical on one side of the equals sign. This radical is actually a

6
00:00:20,124 --> 00:00:25,462
grouping symbol, and the quantity p plus 1 is underneath of it. So, when we're

7
00:00:25,462 --> 00:00:30,553
trying to find the value of p, we want to undo the square root. To undo the

8
00:00:30,553 --> 00:00:35,450
square root, you want to square both sides of our equation. We know this since

9
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:40,144
a square power undoes the square root. So, try finishing this problem. What

10
00:00:40,144 --> 00:00:41,550
would you get for p?
