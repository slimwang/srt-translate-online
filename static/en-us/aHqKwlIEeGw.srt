00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The next question was about handling the final slash because

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
it's technically a different URL and what the best way to handle that is.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Ending URLs in slash--honestly, I don't know the correct answer.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I usually make my websites not care.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You've seen in my URL mapping I have a regular expression that looks like this--/blog/?.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And what this basically says is this will map the URL/blog,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and then it will also match it that has the trailing slash, which I think it's what most friendly way to do it,

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
because some browsers will automatically add the slash or users will add a slash.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
They have a way of creeping up, and you don't want to have like /blogwork/44 or vice versa

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
because you make a lot of people hates it, so I just make it optional.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Now, you can do this thing--sometimes, and I've been working on this on the final project

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
where the URLs are going to be a little bit more dynamic.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I usually have regular a expression that looks something like this:

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
/+ or it's like .../+ or // or something like that.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Basically, I detect the situation where URL ends in a bunch of slashes.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And then I have this go to some handler that automatically redirects with single-slash version

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
or redirects to a zero-slash version.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Depending on your websites, that's kind of handy.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The question that somebody asked, they basically proposed,

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
"Should I do it this way? or "Should I have a redirect way?.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The answer is, it depends on web app.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Do whatever feels right, but it's a great question to ask, because it is something you should think about.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You should try to make both versions work.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It could be the case that /blog is the blog and / has got more content.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's kind of a hierarchical view your website--that's fine--but think about it, and it is pretty easy.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Generally, you just add a question mark and forget about it. I hope that helps.
