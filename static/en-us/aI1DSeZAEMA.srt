00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,620
In the last video we covered quite
a few acronyms describing many of

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,285
the different protocols out there for
implementing web APIs.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,320
In this video, let's do some
side-by-side comparisons in order to

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,000
determine which technology is best for
what we want to accomplish.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:14,740
SOAP and

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:19,520
REST have both been proven as two viable
options for implementing a web service.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,620
Soap was originally developed
by Microsoft in 1998.

8
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,280
For SOAP we are obliged to use XML for
our data structures, but

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,940
can choose HTTP or another underlying
application-level protocol.

10
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,720
REST was more of a description
than a development project.

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,510
The acronym first appeared in
a dissertation by Roy Thomas Fielding in

12
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,960
the year 2000.

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,370
REST uses the HTTP verbs in order to
access and manipulate resources, but

14
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:49,530
can use any type of messaging protocol
to structure the data it sends.

15
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,940
In order for
an application to be truly restful,

16
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:56,170
it must adhere to a set of constraints
Fielding defined in his dissertation.

17
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:59,200
So it seems we still have two good
options, but let's take a look at

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,059
the popularity of the two
implementation options over the years.

19
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,040
From this data gathered by
programmableweb, we see that

20
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,750
REST has gained an outstanding
popularity over the past decade.

21
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,660
A major reason for

22
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,150
this is because REST is generally
easier to implement than SOAP.

23
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:18,710
And for web developers, working with
HTTP is already a familiar practice.

24
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,970
For these reasons, this course will
focus on designing RESTful web APIs.
