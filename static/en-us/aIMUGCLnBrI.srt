1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,237
A distributed firewall configuration
typically includes standalone

2
00:00:05,237 --> 00:00:10,950
network firewalls, host based firewalls,
and personal firewalls.

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,910
That is,
the standalone network firewalls protect

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,068
the internal network from
attacks from the Internet.

5
00:00:16,068 --> 00:00:21,248
In addition, host based firewalls
are placed at workstations and servers.

6
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:24,990
These host based firewalls protect
against internal attacks and

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,900
provide protection tailored to specific
machines and server applications.

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,270
For example, with host based firewalls
providing server specific protection,

9
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,760
we can have one public facing,
external web server and

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,070
an internal facing web server.

11
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:44,160
In addition, personal firewalls can be
used to protect personal computers,

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,870
regardless of where they
are in the network.

13
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:51,460
An important issue here is the need to
coordinate the multiple firewalls for

14
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,870
security monitoring.

15
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:57,100
This typically involves aggregating
the logs from multiple firewalls and

16
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,120
perform correlation analysis.

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,990
For example, if multiple host based
firewalls see the same attack,

18
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:06,820
this may suggest that there's a worm
spreading inside the internal network.
