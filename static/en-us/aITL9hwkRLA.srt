00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,179
Here are the correct answers. For a square, we know we need to multiply X plus 4

2
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:09,668
by itself twice, the same is true for 3 x plus 1. I draw out my rectangle and I

3
00:00:09,668 --> 00:00:14,228
label each of the sides. Finally, we add up all the rectanges to get our total

4
00:00:14,228 --> 00:00:18,562
area. I can only add the 4x and the 4x areas together because they're like

5
00:00:18,562 --> 00:00:23,322
terms. That's where I get 8x. Down in this square, we have 3x times 3x, which is

6
00:00:23,322 --> 00:00:28,714
9x squared. Then we have 3x times 1 which is positive 3x, and 1 times 1, which

7
00:00:28,714 --> 00:00:34,009
is positive 1. We add up all of these areas just like before to get 9x squared

8
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:37,598
plus 6x plus 1. Great work if you got these correct.
