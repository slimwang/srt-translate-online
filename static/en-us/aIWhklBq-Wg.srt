00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,620
Now let's do an ROB Timing quiz. So

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,270
here is again a sequence of instructions and we want to know when they issue,

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,440
execute, write, and commit. And we want some comments here.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,960
Now let's say that an add takes one cycle, multiplication takes two cycles, and

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,680
divide takes four cycles. And in this processor, we can broadcast one add or

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,449
subtract result from the add subtract unit. And

7
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:29,688
one multiplication divide result per cycle. So if both the add unit and

8
00:00:29,688 --> 00:00:34,256
the multiply unit have a result available they can actually broadcast them in

9
00:00:34,256 --> 00:00:39,430
the same cycle. And this processor can also commit up to two instructions per

10
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:44,030
cycle. So two instructions can commit in a cycle if both of them can commit.

11
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,840
And we now free our reservation station at dispatch. So

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,910
let's look at what should be happening here.

13
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,700
We know that this instruction issues in cycle one. Begin execution in cycle two.

14
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:01,450
It will begin execution in cycle two. And then four cycles later in cycle six,

15
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:05,410
it's going to write the result. And it's going to commit in cycle seven. So

16
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:09,400
the question for you is for this multiplication. When does it issue execute,

17
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,850
write and commit? You can write your answers here.

18
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,560
So pretty much what should go here, you should write here, here, here and here.
