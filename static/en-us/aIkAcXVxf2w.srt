1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,349
your job is to teach the car how to
drive itself in order to do that you're

2
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:08,490
going to need to teach the car how to
perceive the world around it now when I

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,630
Drive I use my eyes to figure out how
fast to go and where the lane lines are

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,820
and where to turn a car doesn't have
eyes but in a self-driving car we can

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,989
use cameras and other sensors to achieve
a similar function that's right so let's

6
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:25,829
think about what those cameras are
seeing as we drive down the road you and

7
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:28,890
I can see where the lane lines are
automatically but we need to teach the

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,600
car how to do that so your goal in this
first module is to write code to

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,128
identify and track the position of the
lane lines in a series of images and

10
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:41,850
then the project at the end of this
first module you're going to use image

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,488
analysis techniques to do exactly that

12
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:49,020
so let's start really high-level here's
a picture of a stretch of wide open

13
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,549
highway what kind of features do you
think would be helpful to figure out

14
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:55,439
where the lane lines are in this image
