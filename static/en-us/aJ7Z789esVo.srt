1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,700
So we've made a lot of
progress on Sunshine.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,440
>> Yeah,
I'm feeling a lot better about it.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,920
>> Right, but
you have to admit it's pretty boring.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,150
Oh come on, like you haven't noticed
that there's no way to personalize it.

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,600
You know if it was my app there'd
be some sort of Cheyenne, right?

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,330
So I was just wondering,
do you have any ideas?

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,070
>> Actually yeah, I think there's a lot
we can do on the personalization side.

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,420
I'm not sure about Cheyenne though.

9
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,600
>> Oh, come on.

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,460
Obviously everybody
needs a little Cheyenne.

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,930
>> Yeah, I'll take your word on that.

12
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,000
She is cute though.
