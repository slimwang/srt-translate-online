1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,110
In addition to the knowledge and
skills you'll gain,

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,588
you're also going to practice
thinking like a programmer.

3
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:07,460
And we're going to to focus on five
ways of thinking that all programmers

4
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,370
must do.

5
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,370
And you already have
experience in all of them.

6
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:15,040
The first is procedural thinking, and
this involves taking a big problem and

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,360
breaking the solution into a set
of steps: one, two, three.

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,870
The next way of thinking is
called abstract thinking.

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,930
And if you couldn't do abstract
thinking, you may know that

10
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,150
if someone gave you one apple and
then another, you have two.

11
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,570
But if you someone asked you what
happened when they gave one orange and

12
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,689
then another orange,
you might have no idea.

13
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:36,580
But because you do have an understanding
of the abstract idea of numbers,

14
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,700
you know that you have two oranges.

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,240
But even more importantly, you know th
abstract idea, that one plus one is two.

16
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,200
The next programmatic way of thinking,
is a systematic way of solving problems,

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,630
or systematic debugging.

18
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:54,600
Because even the best programmers make
mistakes, and this is the skill where

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,890
they systematically identify problems,
or potential problems, and

20
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,170
then track down potential causes,
until they find the problem and fix it.

21
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,879
The fourth mental technique,
is called technological empathy, and

22
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:11,910
it involves understanding how
the computer sees things, and

23
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,240
you've already started developing this.

24
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,790
Now, when you see texts like this,

25
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:18,504
you can start to think about
it the way a computer would.

26
00:01:18,504 --> 00:01:21,840
You may already be thinking
that the "is" should be bold.

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,830
The fifth technique that we're
going to keep coming back to,

28
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,010
is called "systems thinking".

29
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:31,320
This may sound a little intimidating,
but basically this involves taking one

30
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,100
big idea, like, what does it
mean to think like a programmer.

31
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,910
And break it down into
its component pieces.

32
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,770
Because we're going to keep coming
back to these five ways of thinking,

33
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,990
next you'll see a text
summary of all of them.

34
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,250
You can just skim it for now.

35
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,720
I'll link back to it as appropriate.
