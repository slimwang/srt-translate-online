00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,953
This entire process is called U-Substitution. It's when we can take an equation

2
00:00:04,953 --> 00:00:10,243
an we make a substitution, to turn it in to our quadratic equation. Here we've

3
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:14,652
replaced the repeated expression x squared, with the variable u. We created

4
00:00:14,652 --> 00:00:19,453
this so we could perform the substitution. Now we could have made any

5
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:23,549
assignment for x squared. We didn't have to use the variable u. We could call

6
00:00:23,549 --> 00:00:29,105
this t substitution and use t or w substitution and use w. It doesn't matter

7
00:00:29,105 --> 00:00:31,831
what variable you use here you just want to make sure you use the same one

8
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:36,440
throughout your problem solving. Keep in mind that we performed this

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,196
substitution so we could have a factorable quadratic. We factor this expression

10
00:00:41,196 --> 00:00:45,609
to solve for the values of u. Keep in mind that these values are not our final

11
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:50,915
answer. We need to find the original values of the original variable, which was

12
00:00:50,915 --> 00:00:56,034
x. So we take our answers, u equals 9, and u equals 4, and we replace u with

13
00:00:56,034 --> 00:01:01,642
the original variable that we substituted, x squared. We solved for the

14
00:01:01,642 --> 00:01:06,469
original variable which is x, which gave us our four solutions. Now if you're

15
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:09,360
not convinced that each of these is a solution, try checking them in the

16
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,420
original equation. You'll find that all four of them check.
