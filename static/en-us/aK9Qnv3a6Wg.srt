1
00:00:00,363 --> 00:00:03,468
Next, we're going to do body paragraphs.

2
00:00:03,468 --> 00:00:05,554
I divide these paragraphs
into categories and

3
00:00:05,554 --> 00:00:08,300
different functions the job requires.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,580
When writing your letter,

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,839
you want to focus in on things
you are especially good at.

6
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:15,859
If you are an expert at one thing,
the employer can make a logical

7
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:18,908
conclusion that you can learn and
become an expert in something else.

8
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,339
If the job asks for skills that you
don't have and don't show up in your

9
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:27,030
resume, use the cover letter
to make a case for yourself.

10
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:31,429
For example, let's say I am pursuing
a data analyst role which asks for

11
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:33,740
three years of experience
in data science.

12
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,480
But my only experience is from
taking the Nanodegree program.

13
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:38,259
But I think I could really
succeed in this role.

14
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:42,549
I would spend some time writing about
how important data-driven results and

15
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:44,109
decision making are to me.

16
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:46,762
And talk about my most advanced
Nanodegree projects that required

17
00:00:46,762 --> 00:00:48,700
the most programming and
data science skills.

18
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,690
Your cover letter should also
include details about your relevant

19
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:54,559
qualifications and goals.

20
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,510
This means that you should
include concrete examples

21
00:00:57,509 --> 00:00:59,019
of your related experience.

22
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,690
Let's dive deeper into this.

23
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:05,500
For example, a sentence such as I've
built a variety of web applications for

24
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,680
many audiences is vague.

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,740
And someone can already assume
this by looking at the skills or

26
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:12,059
experience section of your resume.

27
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:18,740
Instead, describe an experience such
as I recently built a website for

28
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:20,789
members of a national organization.

29
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,420
Some of the website features
include an appointment scheduler

30
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,579
that factors in time zone differences.

31
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:28,120
And a searchable online
drive of meeting notes.

32
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,490
This shows that you can develop
multiple types of website features,

33
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:33,609
that you can meet
the needs of the client and

34
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:37,500
that you can develop with user
experience or interface design in mind.

35
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,750
You should definitely expand on this
by describing which languages or

36
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,260
frameworks you used.

37
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,070
Having even just one specific example
that describes how you work and

38
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:49,789
what you can accomplish is
better that having five

39
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,439
general sentences about your skills.

40
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:56,430
You'll also want to give examples on
when you achieve a lot of great success.

41
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,219
Or when you work on a team or

42
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:01,450
with challenge to produce something
you have never done before.

43
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,109
Your body paragraphs are also a great
place to re enforce your goals and

44
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:06,200
how they align with the position.
