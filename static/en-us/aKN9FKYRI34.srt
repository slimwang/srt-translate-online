1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,410
The answer is on the order
of t squared steps.

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,000
The reason for
this comes from two observations.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,640
The first, is that simulating
a step of the multitape machine

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,370
with a single tape machine,

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,219
involves a number of steps proportional
to the total number of symbols used.

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,750
Recall that each step of
the multitape machine

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,770
was simulated with two
passes over the tape.

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,890
With k tapes, up to k minus one
more passes are possible, for

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,230
shifting cells to the right, but
we're treating k as a constant here.

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,620
The second observation, is that at step
i of the multitape machine, the number

11
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,218
of symbols used is at most the original
size of the input, plus k times i.

12
00:00:40,218 --> 00:00:43,360
Since at most k symbols can be added

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,040
during each step of
the multitape machine M.

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,910
Summing over the different
steps of the multitape machine,

15
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,220
we can put a t squared bound
on the first term here.

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,670
And then the second term just
becomes the arithmetic sequence,

17
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,250
which we can write like this.

18
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,070
And that also is order t squared.

19
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,080
So that's the answer.
