00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,302
>> First things first, we need to distribute this multiplication by five to both

2
00:00:04,302 --> 00:00:08,658
the x and the negative two. Since in slope intercept form, y is all by itself on

3
00:00:08,658 --> 00:00:12,946
the left side of the equation, we're going to need to move this negative three

4
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:17,213
term out of the left side. So we add three to both sides, since right now it's

5
00:00:17,213 --> 00:00:21,514
being subtracted. And we end up with a final equation of y equals five x minus

6
00:00:21,514 --> 00:00:26,118
seven. So, this equation. In our earlier equation should be equivalent or rather

7
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:30,376
these should be equations that graph exactly the same line. To make sure that

8
00:00:30,376 --> 00:00:34,530
this equation fits the information that we used to create the equation end

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,847
points slope form, lets see if the point we started are with lies on this line.

10
00:00:38,847 --> 00:00:43,100
We can already tell that the slope of this line is 5. So that gets rid of one of

11
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,936
our criteria. Lets check each side of this equation done with the point 2, 3.

12
00:00:47,936 --> 00:00:52,344
One the left hand side we have y, and substituting in our value for y, we have

13
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:56,688
3. So the left hand side gives us 3. Now what about the right hand side? The

14
00:00:56,688 --> 00:01:01,299
expression on the right hand side of the equation is 5x minus 7. Let's see what

15
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:05,801
that is equivalent to when we plug in our point. So you substitute 2 in for x.

16
00:01:05,801 --> 00:01:10,070
And for this side of the equation we also end up with 3. Since our left hand

17
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,276
side and our right hand side match each other, we plug in our information. We're

18
00:01:14,276 --> 00:01:17,962
good to go. We have confirmed that this equation fits our information.
