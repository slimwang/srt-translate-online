00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,312
We just saw that in order for a function to undergo a reflection in the y-axis,

2
00:00:04,312 --> 00:00:10,389
we need to replace x in the original function with negative x. So going back to

3
00:00:10,389 --> 00:00:14,232
our equation, y equals the root of x, if we want to reflect the graph of this

4
00:00:14,232 --> 00:00:20,420
function in the y-axis, what do we need to replace with what in the equation?

5
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,649
And what final equation will that give us?
