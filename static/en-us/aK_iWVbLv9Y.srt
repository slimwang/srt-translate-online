1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,174
>> So, the thing about entering these points, is that there are actually a ton

2
00:00:03,174 --> 00:00:06,527
of different ways you can do it. I simply wanted to give you one method that you

3
00:00:06,527 --> 00:00:09,995
can use that's pretty reliable for creating different fraction slots in ordered

4
00:00:09,995 --> 00:00:13,303
pairs. So, for our first point, 3 quarters comma negative 1 half, you could, of

5
00:00:13,303 --> 00:00:17,160
course, use this method that I showed you up here. But you could also just enter

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,431
this from left to right and it should turn out just like this. So, for some

7
00:00:21,431 --> 00:00:25,537
ordered pairs involving fractions, things aren't really that complicated.

8
00:00:25,537 --> 00:00:29,785
However, this one right here is a pretty difficult one, I think. If you try, for

9
00:00:29,785 --> 00:00:33,685
example, to enter to everything in here from left to right, here's what you'll

10
00:00:33,685 --> 00:00:37,498
end up with, you open parenthesis and then a 1 comma 2 as a denominator over 7.

11
00:00:37,498 --> 00:00:41,460
That's definitely not what we want. So here, I think it's easiest if you first

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,036
enter the fraction 2 over 7 then go backwards and write the 1 and the comma.

13
00:00:45,036 --> 00:00:48,717
Negative 1 over 8 comma 3 is another one that's pretty simple to enter. You can

14
00:00:48,717 --> 00:00:51,966
also do this from left to right, or you can use the method of inserting

15
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:55,805
fractions that's where you need them first. So, the moral of the story is, when

16
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:59,825
your typing things using MathQuill, you always need to be super careful to check

17
00:00:59,825 --> 00:01:03,826
what you're typing and make sure that it's actually what you want to be typing.

18
00:01:03,826 --> 00:01:07,712
Also, the more practice the better. So, just keep trying things like this out,

19
00:01:07,712 --> 00:01:08,690
any chance you get.
