00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,440
This lesson will focus on one of
the quintessential problems of

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,970
linear algebra.

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,210
Given a set of flat geometric
objects such as lines and

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,920
planes, what are their
common intersection points?

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,870
In the abstract it isn't immediately
obvious why this problem has much

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,440
interest outside of pure mathematics.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,440
How do the intersections of lines and
planes come up in real life?

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,620
Geometric objects are often defined to
be sets of points whose coordinates

9
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,550
satisfy a particular relationship,
like an equation.

10
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:36,420
For example, this ellipse in the plane
is the set of all points x,y

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:44,110
that satisfy the equation 1/4 times x
squared plus 1/9 times y squared = 1.

12
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:50,295
In this shape in 3 dimensions called a
hyperboloid is the set of all points X,

13
00:00:50,295 --> 00:00:55,930
Y, Z satisfying the equation x
squared + y squared- z squared = 1.

14
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:01,920
Flat objects like lines and planes
satisfy a special type of equation

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,920
called the linear equation In which the
only operations allowed are adding and

16
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,700
subtracting variables and constants and
multiplying variables by constants.

17
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,750
So for example, x + 2y = 1 and

18
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:22,220
y/2- 2z = x are linear equations.

19
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:27,210
But x squared- 1 = y is not
linear because x is being

20
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,320
multiplied by x and
y over x = 3 is also not

21
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,560
linear because a variable y is being
divided by another variable x.

22
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,290
In real world situations these equations
typically come from observed or

23
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,130
modeled relationships
between quantities.

24
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,770
Let's take a look at a modified example
from machine learning for trading.

25
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,890
Suppose I'm trading stocks and
I have a choice of two stocks, A and

26
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,820
B, that I can put into my portfolio.

27
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:02,420
Let's denote the proportion of each
in my portfolio by w A and w B.

28
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:07,300
Which are weights between 0, meaning
none of that stock is in the portfolio,

29
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:11,590
and 1, meaning that the portfolio
is entirely that stock.

30
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,120
Note that wA and

31
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,380
wB have to add up to 1 since any portion
of the portfolio that isn't A must be B.

32
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:25,070
This gives me the linear
relationship wA + wB = 1.

33
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:30,210
Each stock also has an associated metric
called its beta value representing

34
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,750
how correlated its price movements are
with those of the overall stock market.

35
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,840
The beta value of my portfolio is
a weighted average of the beta values of

36
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,960
its individual components.

37
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,380
So if the beta value of A is -1, and

38
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:50,550
the beta value of B is 2,
then the beta value of my portfolio

39
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:55,238
is wA(-1) + wB(2),

40
00:02:55,238 --> 00:02:59,210
or simplified, 2wB- wA.

41
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:02,510
Having a beta value of 0
means that the portfolio

42
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,700
is uncorrelated with the market.

43
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,960
So it has minimal market risk.

44
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,150
Suppose I want to choose my weights so
that I minimize market risks.

45
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:19,330
Then that means I need the weights to
satisfy the equation to wB- wA = 0.

46
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,090
This gives me a second to
linear relationship between

47
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,940
the weights of the stocks
in my portfolio.

48
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,440
In other words, I now have two lines.

49
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,670
Finding what values of wA and
wB satisfy both equations.

50
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:38,050
In other words finding at what
point the two lines intersect at

51
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,230
tells me what the weights of
the stocks I choose should be

52
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,680
in order to minimize my
portfolios market risk.

53
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,570
Often variables are factors
that are within our control but

54
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:54,220
which we want to set to correct values
in order to satisfy some constraints.

55
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,980
In the previous example our variables
were the weights of the stocks in

56
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,360
the portfolio.

57
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,970
And we had two constraints that
we wanted the weights to satisfy

58
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,090
in order to achieve some goal.

59
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:09,820
Interpreting this problem in geometric
language, we created two lines and

60
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,660
we want to find the point
where they intersected.

61
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,570
What we created is called
a system of linear equations.

62
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:21,140
Finding points that satisfy all
the equations at the same time is called

63
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,790
solving the system.

64
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,780
In practice this is how problems
involving the intersections of geometric

65
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,160
objects come about.

66
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,890
These types of problems show up in
fields as diverse as economics, biology,

67
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:37,350
chemistry, physics, engineering,
and of course computer science.

68
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:41,490
In this lesson we will use our tools
from the first lesson on vector

69
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,830
operations to solve this ubiquitous
problem of finding intersections.
