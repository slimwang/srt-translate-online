00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,590
Another design component that can aid you in your work when creating

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:05,720
visualizations is color.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,540
This bar chart displays the count of certain cuts of diamonds, and

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,500
it was made using the R programming language.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,300
I'd like you to take a few minutes to think about how color is used

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,570
in this chart.

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,270
Do the colors add to the visualization or

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,790
do they distract from the visualization?

9
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,160
Come up with a few reasons for yourself.

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,490
Once you're ready, check this box and submit the answer to continue.

11
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,130
Keep in mind that you don't need to submit an answer here.

12
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,180
I just want you to think about those question for a minute.
