00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Last problem of Unit 3, we find a population faced with a malaria epidemic

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
which is definitely very scary for everyone involved.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Luckily, we're here to help them out.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
In order to slow the spread of the disease,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
we're going to make people start using mosquito nets in their houses,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
so they can avoid being bitten as often.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We're going to introduce the nets after 100 days and they immediately decrease

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
the probability of a person getting bitten by 90%

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
as we can see from the constant that we've defined right here called bite reduction by net.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Bite per day in mosquito tells us that every person gets bitten by each mosquito, 0.1*per day.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Now when a mosquito bites a human, there's a chance of two different things

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
happening that are a particular interest to us.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Now, if a mosquito has malaria, it can give a disease to human or

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
if a human has malaria, then he or she can give it to the mosquito.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The probability of either of these things happening is shown right here.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Once infected, it takes a human approximately 70 days to recover.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
At this point, it's important to notice that mosquitoes only live for 10 days.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Clearly, humans also have a finite lifetime but compared to mosquitoes,

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
we might as well be immortal even if we do end up with malaria.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Sets that we're going to pretend for the purposes of this problem,

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
that we can model a scenario like this, we need two separate bubble diagrams--

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
one for the mosquito population and one of the human population.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The mosquito life cycle is kind of a sad one--as soon as they are born,

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
they fall into the S part of the population, the susceptible part.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
From here, they can become infected and then eventually they die.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
There's no option for them to become susceptible again.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
A couple of other things to keep in mind about mosquitoes.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
For one thing, they can't get malaria until after they're born.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Second, only female mosquitoes can transfer malaria.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So just pretend that all the mosquitoes that we're talking about in this problem are female.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Now this problem requires you to take into account

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
all the factors affecting the infected population and to include them using the forward Euler method.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Think critically, keep track of your units, and good luck.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 99:59:59,999
