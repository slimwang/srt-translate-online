00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,350
This lesson is about
parallel algorithms for

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:05,090
sorting in the dynamic
multi-threading model.

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,420
There are two parts.

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,060
The first part consists of the
videos,which cover the idea of a sorting

5
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,220
network.

6
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,837
You can think of a sorting network as
a special kind of circuit that sorts.

7
00:00:14,837 --> 00:00:18,187
It's a topic that's not usually
covered in your standard undergraduate

8
00:00:18,187 --> 00:00:19,438
Algorithms 101 class.

9
00:00:19,438 --> 00:00:22,478
So I hope that many of you will find
it interesting and, heaven forbid,

10
00:00:22,478 --> 00:00:24,110
even a little fun.

11
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,830
Now separate from the video part,

12
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,840
I also want you to read a short
chapter on parallel merge sort.

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,920
I hope you'll find this reading helpful.

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,615
It should reinforce the main
ideas behind the dynamic

15
00:00:34,615 --> 00:00:36,260
multi-threading model.

16
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,210
You'll also see some additional
techniques to analyze algorithms in

17
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,460
this model more formally.
