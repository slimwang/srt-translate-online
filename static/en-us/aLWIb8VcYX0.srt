1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,830
So the information about
the Hufting bound gives us a way of

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:07,160
thinking about how many samples we need
to accurately learn the value of an arm.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,850
So we're going to have to
actually pick a number for that.

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,460
How many samples we're going to take of
each arm to guide us in that decision.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,830
It's going to be helpful to think about
how we're going to combine information

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:16,680
across the arms.

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,340
So this is going to be a strategy
that will ultimately work,

8
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,970
though we don't have all the details
filled in yet, and it goes like this.

9
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,730
What we're going to do is, we're
going to take c samples of each arm for

10
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:25,970
some value c.

11
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:26,880
>> That's what I was going to do.

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,540
>> The c is going to be some function of
epsilon delta k, that sort of thing, but

13
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,060
it's going to be some number, and

14
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,950
it's going to be a number that,
well, we're going to see.

15
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:39,030
It's going to be some number that
guarantees that we're some amount

16
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,270
close with some certainty.

17
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,530
And then after that point,

18
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,780
we're going to choose the arm that has
the highest estimate, the best estimate.

19
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,520
>> All right.

20
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,254
>> Ultimately, we want our final
decision here to be epsilon

21
00:00:50,254 --> 00:00:55,120
close to the optimal decision
with probability 1 minus delta.

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,510
So I claim that to do that,
for this to work,

23
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:03,485
we need to learn each arm individually
to an accuracy of epsilon over

24
00:01:03,485 --> 00:01:07,680
2 with a certainly of
1 minus delta over k.
