Zeros can be any kind of complex number. Some of them are just real numbers,

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,640
but some of them are complex numbers that have imaginary parts. Let us look at

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,920
a little bit more closely at the case where our zeros are not just real

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,419
numbers. When we looked at a quadratic equations, we found that if we had a

5
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:19,100
solution of x equals 2 plus 3 i, then it's complex conjugate was also a

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:25,877
solution. So, can you tell me what the complex conjugate of 2 plus 3 i is?
