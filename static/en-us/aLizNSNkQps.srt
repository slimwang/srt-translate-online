00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:02,192
Hey, Georgia.

2
00:00:02,192 --> 00:00:04,130
Georgia.

3
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,060
>> Hey Anthony.

4
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,980
Sorry about that, what's up?

5
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,270
>> So, I collected some data
about project compos, but

6
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,490
I want to format it in a way
that doesn't look so boring.

7
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,800
>> Well, data analysis not only
analyze and extract data, but

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,378
they also create data visualizations.

9
00:00:19,378 --> 00:00:21,286
What data visualization?

10
00:00:21,286 --> 00:00:25,550
A data visualization is
a representation of data.

11
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,811
So like charts, maps or graphs.

12
00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:30,400
Okay so I've seen that everywhere.

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,705
I didn't realize they were also
called data visualizations.

14
00:00:33,705 --> 00:00:34,210
>> Yeah.

15
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,020
There's a lot of ways you can
create data visualizations but

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,840
a couple libraries are D3 js or
temple js.

17
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,510
They both use HTML and CSS.

18
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,220
>> Like frontend programmers.

19
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,680
>> Exactly, let me show you an example.

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,280
So as you can see,

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,230
when I hover over this data point
it shows me more information.

22
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,500
>> That is cool, I think I'll try using
Dimple for my project compass data.

23
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,560
>> Awesome.

24
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,200
>> Definitely check out
the documentation if you need help.

25
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:03,750
>> Thanks, Georgia.
