1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,576
We just found the last two zeroes of our function, f of x. They are 3 plus 2i

2
00:00:04,576 --> 00:00:09,228
and 3 minus 2i. To at long last get our function in fully factored form, we

3
00:00:09,228 --> 00:00:13,920
just need to figure out what linear factors correspond to these two zeroes.

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,484
Please write 1 in each of these boxes.
