Now, from here, we need to bounce back and update any entity file that create a

2
00:00:03,852 --> 00:00:08,429
physics body. In the entity definition object that's passed into the physics

3
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:11,874
engine, we need to add a user data object, which contains some metadata that we

4
00:00:11,874 --> 00:00:16,890
can later use for collision responses. Most importantly, is an object that

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,184
points back to the this object for this entity. And any other datda that you

might need. For example, a unique string that represents an ID.
