00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,420
The architecture of the Andrew System looks like this. There are client

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:10,460
workstations, which are called virtues. And these client workstations,

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:15,130
are connected by insecure network links, to a local

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:20,550
area network. And through the local area network, they can access servers,

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,460
S1, S2, S3 and so on. And these servers are in a secure

6
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:31,970
environment or in other words, accessing the servers from a client work station

7
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:38,530
uses insecure links but once inside the boundary of the servers, the servers

8
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:43,650
can talk to one another, exchange information, grab data from the disks and

9
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:48,300
so on. This communication that happens inside

10
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,310
this server environment is a secure communication.

11
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:58,260
That's part of the reason they've named the server environment as Vice, and,

12
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,860
the client environment, where you're accessing information

13
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,360
from the secure servers, as the Virtue

14
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,010
workstation. And the important thing to note is the fact that the clients have

15
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:17,540
to access information from the server over insecure links. What that means is

16
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:23,380
that in order to make sure that information that is sent

17
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:30,240
on the wire to the servers or received from the servers to the clients. They

18
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,970
have to be encrypted, since anyone can sniff the packets that are flowing

19
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,380
on these wires. But inside the vice,

20
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,560
the communication that happens among the servers,

21
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,630
because it is secure, there is no need for information encryption. The client

22
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,280
workstations run some flavor of Unix operating

23
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,230
system. So inside each client workstation, there

24
00:01:55,230 --> 00:02:00,880
is a special process called Venus. And this process, which runs on the virtue

25
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:07,670
workstation, is for the purpose of authentication of the user, and for client

26
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:12,820
caching of files that the user may fetch from

27
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:17,380
device servers into the workstation that they're logging in to. The

28
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:22,500
user will use RPC in order to get the files

29
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,820
that they want to work on, on the workstation. And this is where Venus comes in.

30
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,700
Venus is the one that authenticates a user walking

31
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:39,860
up to a virtue workstation, to the server and then acting as the surrogate

32
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:45,250
for the user, in fetching the files that he or she wants to work on from the

33
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:51,620
file server using RPC. And since I mentioned that the link that is used to

34
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,700
communicate between virtue and vice is insecure. The

35
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,540
RPC has to be a secure RPC. In

36
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:03,180
other words, the RPC messages, both passing the

37
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,460
parameters and receiving the results, is going to use

38
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,870
encryption on the data that is being sent and

39
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,580
received between the virtue and the vice file server.
