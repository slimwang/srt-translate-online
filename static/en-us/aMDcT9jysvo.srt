>> Speaking of fractions, here's another equation, with yet another fraction

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,006
involved. We've just been talking about how many different ways there are to

3
00:00:08,006 --> 00:00:12,240
start problems, especially those involving fractions. So for this problem in

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,465
particular, if we'd like to solve for z, what do you think our first step should

5
00:00:16,465 --> 00:00:20,566
be? Should we start off by simplifying the fraction? Should we multiply both

6
00:00:20,566 --> 00:00:24,670
sides by z? Should we multiply both sides by 3? Or should we multiply both sides

7
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:25,285
by 3z plus 6?
