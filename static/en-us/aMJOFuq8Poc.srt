1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,550
To see the key value pairs that are stored

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,400
for a particular site or scheme host port combination, you

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,780
can open up the chrome developer tool, go to

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,450
the Resources tab and select Local storage. Note that there

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:17,140
is Local storage which persists across reloads and sessions

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,660
storage which has the same API but it's isolated by

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,330
tab and it's cleared at the end of the session.

8
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,010
So whenever the page is closed down, the Sessions Storage

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,580
goes away. Now, remember, you can only store text

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,880
in local storage, so if you wanted to store

11
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,550
an image or some other binary data type, you'd

12
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,310
have to first base64 and code it. And of

13
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:41,130
course, you only get typically about 5MB per domain,

14
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,750
so you're not going to be able to store very

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,130
much. So now it's your turn. Use local storage

16
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,750
to store the value "bar" for the key "foo"
