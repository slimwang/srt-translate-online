00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,745
So, here is the resources directory from
a sample project created in an Android

2
00:00:04,745 --> 00:00:05,273
studio.

3
00:00:05,273 --> 00:00:09,724
There are some predefined
drawable folders for

4
00:00:09,724 --> 00:00:16,410
different screen densities such as mdpi,
hdpi, xhdpi, and xxhdpi.

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,521
And if you remember that's 160,

6
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:24,106
240, 320, and 480.

7
00:00:24,106 --> 00:00:28,260
Additionally, there's a drawable
folder with no qualifier.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,680
This is useful for
things like XML shapes.

9
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:36,260
There's also a folder called
Drawable-nodpi which you can put in

10
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,269
images that shouldn't scale based on
density, things like background images.

11
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,219
If you remember from Android
fundamentals, there are also qualifiers

12
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:48,119
for user locale, screen width,
API level, and more.

13
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:50,969
These can be applied to
any type of resource,

14
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,019
whether it'd be graphic assets,
layouts, or text strings and

15
00:00:55,019 --> 00:00:58,850
style definitions that you would
put in your values folder.

16
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:05,440
So you could customize a layout for
screens that are 600dp or wider.

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,244
Or you could provide styles that
only apply to Lollipop devices,

18
00:01:09,244 --> 00:01:12,022
that's devices with API level 21 or
higher.

19
00:01:12,022 --> 00:01:15,823
And if you wanted to customize graphics
assets for specific languages,

20
00:01:15,823 --> 00:01:17,142
you could do that, too.

21
00:01:17,142 --> 00:01:22,050
Just remember to also specify
the density for those assets.

22
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:26,100
Check the instructor's notes for
a link to developers.android.com and

23
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,860
a listing of the accepted
resource identifiers.
