Know that the upper limit of length that we can add to Grant's booth is 10, and

2
00:00:04,485 --> 00:00:08,542
we just need to change the lower limit. It can't go below 0. He could

00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:12,939
theoretically add nothing to the length of the booth. So Grant can chose to

4
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:16,835
expand each side of his booth anywhere from 0 to 10 feet. Awesome.
