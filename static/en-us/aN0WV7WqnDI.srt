00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,574
The bulk of canvas interaction that GRITS uses, is through rendering images to

2
00:00:04,586 --> 00:00:08,953
the canvas. In order to draw an image to the canvas, we first have to load it.

3
00:00:09,054 --> 00:00:13,204
In order to load an image, we need to create a new image object, which in

4
00:00:13,216 --> 00:00:17,661
Javascript, is comprised of three steps. Number 1, is we need to declare the

5
00:00:17,673 --> 00:00:22,905
image object. Number 2, is we need to define its onload function. Then number 3

6
00:00:22,917 --> 00:00:27,270
we need to set the image.source attribute. It's worth noting that as soon as the

7
00:00:27,282 --> 00:00:31,635
source property if this image is set through a value Javascript will kick off

8
00:00:31,647 --> 00:00:35,975
onload function. Because of this, we need to specify the callback function first

9
00:00:35,987 --> 00:00:40,326
before setting the source attribute. Otherwise the image will load the data and

10
00:00:40,338 --> 00:00:42,463
we won't get a callback received.

11
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:47,033
Now let's take a look at this code. Here is the url of the image that we'd like

12
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:50,707
you to load. What we want you to do is create a new image object, following the

13
00:00:50,707 --> 00:00:54,508
steps we just mentioned, and set the onload function and source properties for

14
00:00:54,508 --> 00:00:58,069
that image described in the code. Make sure that your onload function is

15
00:00:58,069 --> 00:01:01,693
assigned to this onImageLoad down here, which will actually print out some nice

16
00:01:01,693 --> 00:01:04,766
little message to the console log, letting you know that things have loaded

17
00:01:04,778 --> 00:01:08,309
properly. If you're confused about whether or not your image is loading, don't

18
00:01:08,309 --> 00:01:12,767
forget to check out Chrome's developer tools on the network tab, which will list

19
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:15,988
whether or not the image has been loaded, and how long it took to do it.
