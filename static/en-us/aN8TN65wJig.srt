1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,760
So, the dollar sign is just a function.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,170
But, now, what can you do with it?

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:09,430
jQuery returns an array-like object which we call a jQuery collection.

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:13,550
The reason we say it's an array-like object is that it's an object that

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:18,070
looks and behaves like an array, but also includes some additional methods.

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,275
You could pass strings into the jQuery object and

7
00:00:20,275 --> 00:00:22,760
a jQuery collection of DOM elements will be returned.

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,770
On the Udacity website for instance, I've passed #foo into the jQuery object and

9
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,350
saw an empty array come back.

10
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,680
All right, well, that's not too exciting.

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,620
I'll come back to the passing in strings like this in a moment.

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,510
But what if you pass in a function?

13
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,160
You could actually do that too.

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,890
This is a pretty neat trick that I'll be revisiting at the very

15
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,450
end of this class.

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,540
You could pass a DOM element into the jQuery object as well,

17
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,020
if you want to call some jQuery methods on it.

18
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:55,268
You can call methods directly on the jQuery object, like $.ajax.

19
00:00:55,268 --> 00:00:59,580
$.ajax subtracts away all the annoying nuances of

20
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,560
ajax into a simple method called on the jQuery object.

21
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,480
You can check out the ajax class if you want to learn more.

22
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,460
Notice that I'm just talking about normal JavaScript operations.

23
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,240
It's worth repeating that jQuery is just a JavaScript library.

24
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,920
It's not a language.

25
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,530
The jQuery function takes in some parameters.

26
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:22,170
It returns an object and even has some methods attached to it,

27
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,780
just like any other JavaScript object.

28
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,400
But that's enough of me talking.

29
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,950
It's time for you to start practicing.
