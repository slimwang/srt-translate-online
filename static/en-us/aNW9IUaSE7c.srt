1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,969
So, so far, you've learned
that thinking responsively,

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:07,680
means thinking about the user
experience for every device.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,250
From the small screen,
all the way up to the largest.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,720
>> And inputs too.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,760
Buttons need to be big.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,310
>> But responsive design,
goes beyond optimizing single elements.

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,590
Now in lesson three and

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,700
four, you'll be taking a step
back to design page layout.

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,970
Which means you'll need to think about,
what information you're presenting to

10
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:32,140
your user, and how you want elements
to be arranged on the page.

11
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,260
Picking the right design pattern can
be more of an art than a science, so

12
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,430
you'll have a chance to try
a few different design patterns,

13
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,160
as this lesson progresses.

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,790
>> And by the end of the next lesson,

15
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,950
lesson four, you'll take what you've
learned about responsive design

16
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,090
patterns to layout the project
in a way that looks great.

17
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,040
No matter how users find your site.
