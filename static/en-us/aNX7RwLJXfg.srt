00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,803
Do you remember this question that Greg asked? Well, the answer is, during your

2
00:00:03,803 --> 00:00:08,250
teenage years, this is another time when your amount of REM sleep increases.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,850
So, does the amount of neural growth. The human brain is still growing into

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:16,538
early adulthood. Neurons though, never stop growing, even if the rate of growth

5
00:00:16,538 --> 00:00:21,240
does slow over time. The biggest region of brain growth in adolescents occurs

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,459
in the frontal lobes. Which allow us to think abstractly, plan, control

7
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:30,230
impulses and to think critically, and scientifically. Teenagers are much more

8
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,332
likely to do impulsive and risky things, because their frontal lobes are still

9
00:00:33,332 --> 00:00:37,606
growing and maturing. Driving a car really, really fast while not wearing a

10
00:00:37,606 --> 00:00:41,008
seatbelt, or skateboarding off of a 5-foot stair handrail seems perfectly

11
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:45,526
reasonable to many teenagers. The brain isn't our only change during

12
00:00:45,526 --> 00:00:48,484
adolescence though. Let's go check in with Susan, who's going to explain the

13
00:00:48,484 --> 00:00:50,670
other physical changes that we go through.
