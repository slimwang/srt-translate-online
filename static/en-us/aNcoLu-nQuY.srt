1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, in summary, revenue streams

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
might take the form of a whole series of potential strategies.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
But what's interesting is inside of each revenue stream,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
you may have different pricing tactics.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let me say that again.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We just talked about revenue streams.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
If you think about it, we didn't talk about how much to charge.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We talked about the potential ways to charge—

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
licensing and intermediation and direct sales, etc.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
But how do you think about pricing itself?

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
How do you set prices?

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Let's take a look.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Pricing is kind of the tactics.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The first thing you have to figure out is what's the revenue stream

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm going to use for the customer segment.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But there are two types of prices.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
One is fixed prices.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Fixed pricing is just like it sounds.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
There's no haggling.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Here's how it is. It's the fixed price.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Now, fixed price you can decide, well, how do I set that price.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm going to take the cost of what it takes me to build the product,

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and I'm going to add some fixed markup—whatever I think my profit should be.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's very simple. It's cost plus markup.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This gets me to the minimum price in the market.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But you know what? I might know something that my competitors don't know.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Because I've been out talking to these customers for weeks or months,

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and I know that they actually value my feature set, my value proposition,

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
more than my competitor's.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
In an existing market, I will likely know something no one knows.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I know exactly how much they value what I will offer.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Instead of pricing based on cost,

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I could actually price on specific customer segments

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
or on features I know they need.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
There's a third type of fixed pricing, and that's called "volume pricing."

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It might be that you want to encourage high volume,

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
because you have economies of scale.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So, you might price the product if you buy in quantities of 1-10 it's $1000,

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
but if you buy in quantities of 10-100 it's $900.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Therefore, you can keep stepping up the discount,

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
but if you buy in hundreds of thousands or millions,

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
instead of $1000 we'll charge $99.

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Know who does that?

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Go talk to Intel and the semiconductor manufacturers.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
They want to encourage high-volume purchases,

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and so they have stepped pricing that is oriented to create volume.

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Cost plus market, value pricing, and volume price

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
are all examples of fixed pricing tactics.

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But there's another type of pricing.

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's dynamic pricing.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Dynamic pricing is exactly what it sounds like.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Dynamic means it moves.

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
How could you have prices that kind of move?

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I thought all pricing is written down on a piece of paper and never changes.

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
If you ever think about it,

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
pricing that you negotiate—yeah, we kind of have this price on paper,

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
but that's just the starting point of the conversation.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Negotiated prices is a dynamic price.

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But airlines are now a great example of another type of dynamic pricing,

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and that's called "yield management."

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
If you think about it, once an airplane takes off they can no longer sell those seats.

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So, a month before the flight, those seats might be $500.00.

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
A week before, those seats might actually go up to $600.00.

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
An hour before, those seats might drop down to $99.00,

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
because that plan is leaving, and if we have empty seats, we're not getting any revenue.

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So, yield management is actually pretty interesting based on experience, on time, etc.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
There are software programs and industries like airlines and car rentals, etc,

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
that have perishable seats or time actually are quite good at doing this.

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Another type of dynamic pricing is real-time markets.

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The stock market is a real-time market.

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Then auctions like eBay are another example of dynamic pricing.

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Again, two types of pricing models—fixed and dynamic.

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
How do you know which one to use?

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You've been out talking to customers.

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
How do they currently buy and what's the revenue stream

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
that's associated with these kind of pricing tactics?

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You need to be constantly thinking what's the right revenue stream

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
for the right segment and, within that, what's the right pricing model.

79
00:04:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Is it fixed or is it dynamic, and which one are you going to pick?
