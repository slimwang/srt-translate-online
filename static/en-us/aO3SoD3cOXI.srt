So thanks, Lauren. You know, there a classic study in psychology that has to do

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,177
with availability heuristic. And it revolves around the question you were just

3
00:00:07,177 --> 00:00:13,175
asked. Which is, are we more likely to die in airplanes or automobiles? And

4
00:00:13,175 --> 00:00:16,100
when people are asked this, they tend to overestimate the likelihood of dying

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,233
in an airplane. And in fact, the statistics show just the opposite. We're much

6
00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:25,190
more likely to die in an automobile. For instance, in the US about 30,000

7
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,786
people a year will die in automobile crashes, and only about a hundred or so

8
00:00:28,786 --> 00:00:34,763
will die in plane crashes. So in fact, planes are much safer than automobiles.

9
00:00:34,763 --> 00:00:38,667
So, even though we know these numbers, we're still more afraid of flying than

10
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:44,570
driving. Why is that? Well, as it turns out, there's a thing called vividness.

11
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:49,495
And vividness is related to availability and accessibility. So, when we hear

12
00:00:49,495 --> 00:00:54,286
about a plane crash, it's horrific. A lot of people die all at once, and that

13
00:00:54,286 --> 00:01:00,115
makes it very vivid in our minds, very accessible, very available. So, when we

14
00:01:00,115 --> 00:01:04,144
think about flying versus driving, we're more likely to think of dying in a

15
00:01:04,144 --> 00:01:09,500
plain crash, because it's a vivid event and that's availability.
