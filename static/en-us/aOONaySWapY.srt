00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,480
Hope to set up tracking and
goals with Google analytic.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,000
The first step would be to gain a code
from Google Analytic that will let it

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,970
execute on your website.

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:16,660
The best way to do it is to go
to Google Analytic Website, and

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:23,710
click on the Admin section then you
could click here and add a new account.

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,290
You could choose here between
a Website to your Mobile app.

7
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:34,952
Give it a meaningful name like demo1.

8
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:39,271
In my case it will be Ido's project.

9
00:00:39,271 --> 00:00:41,640
And let's give it a URL.

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,092
And from here of course,

11
00:00:43,092 --> 00:00:47,230
you need to decide in which
category you are going to be.

12
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,440
In our case it's Internet,
the Time Zone, and

13
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,520
some other aspects of the data
sharing that you're going to do.

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:00,420
And by clicking getting tracking ID
you're basically accepting of course,

15
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,330
the terms of use of Google Analytic.

16
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,140
And after you accept them
you'll get the tracking code.

17
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:07,860
Here it is.

18
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:12,770
With the right information,
how to put it on your website.

19
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:17,039
Once we do this preliminary phase,
we can jump into setting up our goals.

20
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,150
The first way to set goals is
because goals are very versatile way

21
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:28,810
to measure how well our site or
app fulfills target objectives.

22
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,980
You can set up individual goals for

23
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:35,773
discreet actions like, how many
users reach out our thank you page?

24
00:01:35,773 --> 00:01:39,657
What are the top exlending pages?

25
00:01:39,657 --> 00:01:43,450
What are the bounce rates on each one?

26
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,980
Where do people interact with the site?

27
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:50,480
Let's take for example,
my own site and set up a goal.

28
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,690
I'm clicking on the Admin to
get into the Admin tab and

29
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,800
then I'm clicking on Goals.
