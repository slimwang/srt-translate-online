Okay, let's look more closely at the meaning of an exponent. It's easy to think

2
00:00:04,596 --> 00:00:08,644
of 2 to the 3 as 6, but we really know this isn't true. I know exponents

3
00:00:08,656 --> 00:00:13,301
represent repeated multiplication, so I should have 2 times 2 times 2, which is

4
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:17,727
8. This is often a common error that students make throughout Algebra. You have

5
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:22,203
to train your eye, and train your mind to think about what this really means. Go

6
00:00:22,215 --> 00:00:26,521
slow, and be careful. This is how you can get better at Math, taking your time

7
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:28,795
and asking yourself, what does this mean?
