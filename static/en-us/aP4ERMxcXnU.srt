1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,090
We'll start with the image
of the envelope.

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,300
In the skit I place the request
inside of the envelope and

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,852
this is indicative of what
an NSURL request is doing.

4
00:00:08,852 --> 00:00:12,830
The NSURLRequest encapsulates the URL
that the client is requesting.

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,120
The second image is of Jason and

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,060
the container that was
on my desk in the skit.

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,550
In the skit, Jason takes
the request from the container and

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,160
then he handles the rest of
the HTTP request on my behalf.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,000
This is the same behavior as
the NSURL session for our apps.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,770
It too handles the sending and
receiving of HTTP data.

11
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,730
Here on this third image we have
something that's a little bit

12
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:34,460
more abstract.

13
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,230
We have Jason and

14
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,460
we have pictures of arrows indicating
his path that are shown in color.

15
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,990
These serve as a representation of the
data tasks that's being accomplished by

16
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:47,500
Jason and therefore it's mashed
with the NSURL session data task.

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,500
The data task is specifically used for

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,120
retrieving data and then bringing
it back to the client or app.
