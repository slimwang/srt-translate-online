1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,503
Done already.

2
00:00:01,533 --> 00:00:04,936
Let's go to the solution. 
In the menu layout file

3
00:00:04,936 --> 00:00:10,540
for the main activity, called main.xml, 
we add another menu item

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,850
that will always be in the overflow menu.

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,830
We also define the string 
in the strings.xml file.

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,660
The menu will be inflated 
in the main activity class,

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,560
so we can handle 
the map menu item being inflated.

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:28,560
by calling helper method 
called open preferred location in map.

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,600
The helper method reads the users

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,070
preferred location 
from shared preferences.

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,650
Then we create a view intent, 
indicating its location in the data URI.

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,390
The format of the data URI 
was from the documentation

13
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,099
page on common intents, 
where you can append

14
00:00:47,099 --> 00:00:49,268
a postal code as a query parameter.

15
00:00:50,428 --> 00:00:53,325
Finally, we start an activity 
with this intent.

16
00:00:53,325 --> 00:00:54,642
(typing)

17
00:00:54,642 --> 00:00:58,620
Note that we only start the activity
if the activity resolves successfully.
