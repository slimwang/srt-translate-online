00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,394
Before we jump straight in to making
preferences for everything under

2
00:00:04,394 --> 00:00:08,930
the sun, I wanted to a moment to talk
about something called choice paralysis.

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:14,199
In 2000, a team of researchers
conducted a famous study involving jam.

4
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:18,829
The researchers operated a booth at
a grocery store, offering jam samples.

5
00:00:18,829 --> 00:00:22,009
Every few hours they alternated
between offering samples of either

6
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:26,190
six different types of jam or
a whopping 24 flavors of jam.

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,620
What the researchers were testing
was which method was actually more

8
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,899
successful at getting
customers to purchase the jam.

9
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:33,890
What do you think?

10
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,890
Now, you might be going, with more
options, the customers were more likely

11
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,770
to find their perfect, personalized
jam and happily purchase it.

12
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,230
But the findings of the study actually
found that shoppers who were presented

13
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:48,769
with fewer choices were more
likely to purchase some jam.

14
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,890
So what does this mean for settings?

15
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,039
Well, settings are kind of
like those jars of jam.

16
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:59,409
Giving the users a few key options is
good, but overwhelm them with screens,

17
00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:03,939
upon screens, upon screens of settings,
and they don't buy any jam.

18
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:06,140
Or I mean, use your app.

19
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,209
If you and
your team can't decide on a feature,

20
00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:10,739
resist the temptation just
to make it a setting.

21
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:14,569
That shifts the burden of deciding
the value of the setting onto the user.

22
00:01:14,569 --> 00:01:15,439
Also remember,

23
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,030
it's always easier to add a setting
then it is to remove a setting.

24
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:23,030
When you remove a setting, you always
risk having that subset of users

25
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,670
angry about the feature
being taken away from them.

26
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,359
To help you with
the decision of whether or

27
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,269
not to make something a setting,
I've provided a handy flowchart below.

28
00:01:31,269 --> 00:01:34,469
In addition, I've linked the material
design guidelines for settings.

29
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:38,408
In our case, I'm removing any choice
paralysis whatsoever on your part about

30
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:40,087
what to actually make a setting.

31
00:01:40,087 --> 00:01:43,755
And I'm prescribing that we will be
making two settings for Sunshine.

32
00:01:43,754 --> 00:01:45,694
The first is a unit setting for

33
00:01:45,694 --> 00:01:48,814
Fahrenheit versus Celsius
to make Assar happy.

34
00:01:48,814 --> 00:01:51,405
The second is a setting
where users can specify

35
00:01:51,405 --> 00:01:53,495
what location they want
to get the weather for.

36
00:01:53,495 --> 00:01:54,094
Let's get started
