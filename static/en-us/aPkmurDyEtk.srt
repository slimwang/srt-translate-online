1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Another key component of understanding customers

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
is understanding customer gains, which is a fancy way for saying

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
what are the benefits that customers expect,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
or desires, so besides the jobs they want to get done

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
what do they want to gain by using your product or service?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Let's take a look.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Some of the gains could be what would make them happy?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Is it saving money, saving effort, saving time,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and what do they expect, and what would go beyond their expectations?

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
How would you delight these customers?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Is it quality, more of something, less of something?

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And is it features that would delight them or performance or quality?

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And what would make your customer's job or life easier?

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
More services, lower cost of ownership, flatter learning curve?

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Obviously this depends whether you're selling to business customers

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
or consumer customers, but you want to be able to make a list or a column

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
of all the gains that they would get by using your product.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And some more gains could be is it social consequences?

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Does it make them look good, increase in power?

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Is it good design? Is it specific or more features?

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And how do they measure success and failure?

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Is it performance or cost?

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And what would increase their likelihood of adopting your product

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
or using it or using your solution?

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Again, is it about cost?

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Is it about lower risk? Is it about better quality?

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Is it because it's more fun?

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You need to come up with a series of hypotheses.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Just make that list now.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But you can't guess forever.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
You have to validate these hypotheses.
