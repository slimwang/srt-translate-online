00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,230
Let's start with use case diagrams. UML does not include OMT's data flow

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:11,840
diagram. Instead, it includes Jacobson's use case diagrams.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,430
A use case is a sequence of user-visible actions along with system responses.

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:23,330
It's a story of how the system deals with a particular user interaction.

5
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,760
Use cases are particularly useful for eliciting requirements.

6
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,300
You lay out different stories of how the system is going to be used, and

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,820
then explore ramifications. What happens if something goes wrong,

8
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,180
what are some intermediate steps that maybe you didn't make explicit.
