00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,360
To get from function f of x equals log base 2 of x, to the function f of x

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:11,400
equals log base 2 of x plus 2. We need to shift the original function up, which

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,170
is a vertical shift, by 2 units. So here's a different look at the graph of f

4
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:22,870
of x equals log base 2 of x and just above it. The graph of the transformed

5
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:28,330
function, f of x equals log base 2 of x plus 2. And sure enough, we can tell

6
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:35,150
that for every x value the graph up here, the transformed one, is 2 units above

7
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:35,929
the original.
