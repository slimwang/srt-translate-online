00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,165
Now, this is great for JSON, but what if we want to grab something else, say,

2
00:00:05,177 --> 00:00:10,118
a sound file. To do that, we need to set the response type of the XMLHttp

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:15,732
request object to arraybuffer and what that will do is specify that it is binary

4
00:00:15,744 --> 00:00:21,321
information rather than text that we can then decode as necessary. What we like

5
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:26,357
you to do is create another XMLHttp request but this time we're going to

6
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:31,612
request "bg_menu.ogg", a sound file and set the response type

7
00:00:31,721 --> 00:00:36,645
to arraybuffer. Now, we've already created the on load function for you to use. Don't worry if

8
00:00:36,657 --> 00:00:41,725
you don't understand any of this. We'll be going over this in more detail later

9
00:00:41,737 --> 00:00:46,279
in the sound unit. For right now, your job is just to fire off the XMLHttp

10
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:46,808
request.
