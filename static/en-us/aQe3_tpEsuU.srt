00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,147
Hey team.
So,

2
00:00:01,147 --> 00:00:04,990
things are lot more chiller out
here since the Point Four launch.

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,130
The users are happy,
our investors are happy.

4
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,330
And now that we've got
sharing implemented,

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,480
most of the features we want
in the app are basically done.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,860
I've even had enough capital to
hire Paulter on as our attorney and

7
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:16,620
data scientist.

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,120
>> That's so great to hear.

9
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,460
It sounds like you're on track
to a very successful launch.

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,640
>> Wait, JP.

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,210
You're doing that thing.

12
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,350
>> What?

13
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,390
>> The thing you do when you're
worried about something but

14
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:30,295
you don't want to say it.

15
00:00:30,295 --> 00:00:33,730
>> Well, you're both doing so well.

16
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,490
I don't want to rain on your parade.

17
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,220
I was just wondering if you looked
into some of the other features

18
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:38,880
Firebase offers?

19
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:40,640
>> Okay, like what?

20
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,590
>> Well, for example,
in version .5, if you have time,

21
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,855
you could look into providing
some basic offline access.

22
00:00:47,855 --> 00:00:50,740
Firebase provides a few methods to
make it very simple to cache and

23
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,810
persist your data locally, even when
you're Internet connection is shoddy.

24
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,960
After that, you might want to take
a look at Firebase's offerings for

25
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,130
authorization and validation.

26
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,590
It jSon database like Firebase,

27
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:07,100
you can accept basically any
mishmash of key value pairs.

28
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,025
Firebase allows you to write
some data rules server side.

29
00:01:10,025 --> 00:01:12,190
Then enforce the structure of your data.

30
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:16,436
In addition, you can write permission
rules that based off of your users

31
00:01:16,436 --> 00:01:20,905
authentication tests, allow you to
control read write access to the data.

32
00:01:20,905 --> 00:01:23,320
>> Okay, JP.

33
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,968
We'll think about it.

34
00:01:24,968 --> 00:01:27,208
Right now working on a slide deck for
investors.

35
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:30,368
But, I guess I could have
the developer look at some of that.

36
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:34,304
But really JP its not like anyone
is actively trying to attack us.

37
00:01:34,304 --> 00:01:44,304
