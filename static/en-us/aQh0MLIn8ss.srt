00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,755
Okay, great job with the refactoring
to normalize the shopping lists.

2
00:00:03,755 --> 00:00:06,830
While you were working on that,
I made two new screens for sharing.

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:07,870
Let me show you what they look like.

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,450
You might have remembered the sharing
flow from when I mentioned it before.

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:12,590
So you have some list open.

6
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:13,780
Let's say a generic grocery list.

7
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,700
And you can click the share icon.

8
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,490
The Share icon will take you to
the new Share List activity that I've

9
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:19,580
created for you.

10
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,700
Here you'll see a list of your friends.

11
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,200
And if you want to add a new friend,
you can click the Add New Friend button.

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,430
This takes you to
the Add Friend activity,

13
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,090
which has a list of
all users in the app.

14
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,850
If you want to add one
of them as a friend,

15
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,120
you simply need to click
their email address, and

16
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,400
you'll be taken back to the Share List
activity with the new friend added.

17
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,080
Things get more complicated when you
actually want to start sharing the lists

18
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,040
with these friends.

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,140
But for now, let's start with just this
ShareList AddFriendActivity interaction.

20
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,790
All that I want is for you to make it so
when you click add friend,

21
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,540
you see a list of users,
you could select the user, and

22
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,290
then they end up here in the ShareList.

23
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,840
Right now, displaying the list of all
users of the app should be pretty

24
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,960
straightforward.

25
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,610
After all, you know how to
use Firebase list of actors.

26
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,620
And you have a location in your Firebase
database that contains a list of

27
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,680
all users.

28
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,959
But what about this
list of friends here?

29
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,890
Remember that our database design
included a node called user friends,

30
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,920
which I've been told I
haven't talked much about.

31
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,420
Let's take a look at that node
in the database design schema.

32
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,540
So here's the database design
that we're going for, and

33
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,550
we can see the user friends node here.

34
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,360
If we expand it, you'll see that we're
going to have a list of user emails.

35
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,180
For every user that has friends,
they'll be a list.

36
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,680
And then under each user email,
they'll be a list of friend emails.

37
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,320
You can go ahead and
put an entire user object here, so

38
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,310
that you'll have access
to the user's name.

39
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,540
So getting that list of users that you
need to show on the sharing screen

40
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,600
is a simple as attaching
a list right here.

41
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,130
To the encoded email of the user
that you're interested in.

42
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,190
Okay, I'm excited for you to add these
new screens, and I'm sending over

43
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,880
the exact specifications, and
the code, for the new screens now.
