1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:02,280
Okay so let's tease out some of the details here. What

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,370
I'd like to do is assemble a complete record for carrier

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,198
and airport for all of the data maintained in this database.

4
00:00:08,198 --> 00:00:12,980
Okay. So what' I'm talking about here is doing the necessary queries

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,330
against this site. In this case I would need to do

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,040
two queries for each carrier and airport pair. And end up with

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,080
a table of data that looks something like this. Now I

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,140
may decide to store it as a table or JSON. The format

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,960
doesn't matter here. So much is the data wrangling

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,870
from the site. Okay. So, for every carrier and airport

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,840
in a given month, I want to know both

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,680
how many departures and arrivals there were for that airline.
