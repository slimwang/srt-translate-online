1
00:00:00,552 --> 00:00:04,980
Awareness of these ideas may not seem
like much, but it's actually a big deal.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,350
Because with the awareness that you
have, you can now look at a substantial

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,640
code base like the code that
generates this page, and

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,560
get a feel for how it works.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,750
You won't understand everything,
but a lot of it will look familiar.

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,440
So, let's go through the code that
generated this page and see what I mean.

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,140
I've already shown you the web page that
you'll be able to make when your done

8
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,090
with this nanodegree.

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,610
But now I want to show
you the code you'll write

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,470
that will generate a page like this.

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,000
So, if I find the folder in my
computer that has all this code,

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,600
it's this one intro programming nda,
I've called it.

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,460
And notice it's got a lot in it, this
is what happens when you write larger

14
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,330
programs, you can't fit all of
your code in a single file.

15
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:45,440
In fact, we have folders with different
sorts of files and more and more files,

16
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:52,853
and they're all of different types,
.py, .yaml, .css, .jpg, .html.

17
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:57,120
But as you can see, the majority
of the files are HTML files,

18
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,450
which is what you've
already started to learn.

19
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:04,043
For example,
this file is called adsubmission.html.

20
00:01:04,043 --> 00:01:05,363
And it's responsible for

21
00:01:05,363 --> 00:01:09,780
the page you'll see when you submit your
project at the end of this Nanodegree.

22
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,010
That's this page.

23
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,360
So notice that this page has
a nice heading at the top.

24
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,640
That heading has a description when
you complete the final project.

25
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,668
And then we have some
more things down here.

26
00:01:19,668 --> 00:01:23,560
We have what looks like some sort of
form where we can add some input.

27
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,070
These forms seem to have some labels,
and

28
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:31,270
then way at the bottom we have this
button which will submit the project.

29
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,420
So let's see what the code looks like,
that generated this page.

30
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:39,390
so, to open this, I'm going to right
click > Open with > Sublime Text,

31
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,720
which is a program you're going to
be downloading shortly, and

32
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,260
this is what I see.

33
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,960
Now first, I want to point out there's
going to be a lot of code in here that

34
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,420
you don't understand yet.

35
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,750
That's to be expected,
you're just starting.

36
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:56,200
For example, this looks a little
weird and these class equals title,

37
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,670
class equals section, class equals
description, also look weird.

38
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,140
Though maybe you can begin to
guess what they may be doing.

39
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,330
Here we have an h1,
that's a header element and

40
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,220
it says degree student projects.

41
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,410
Here is that description we
were looking at and down here.

42
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,490
We have something called the form.

43
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,610
Hm, interesting.

44
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,670
Let me zoom out a bit, because if
the form begins here, I'm going to look

45
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:23,220
all the way down to see where it ends,
and it ends there, okay.

46
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,390
Let me see what's inside of that.

47
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:30,310
There appears to be a name to display,
a URL, a project description.

48
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,470
And notice that these are all in those
b tags that you're familiar with.

49
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,640
There's some other things that you
probably don't understand at this point,

50
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,850
but that's all right,
we're getting there.

51
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,700
And then at the end we have this end
block, and even if you don't know

52
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,480
what that means quite yet, it seems
to have something to do with this.

53
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,860
Now, this process I just went through
was me trying to demonstrate what I

54
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,770
actually do when I look at
code I don't understand.

55
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,470
And that happens all the time.

56
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:58,560
I try and anchor onto the things I
do understand and build from there.

57
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,830
Now, if I wanted to, I could look up
any of these things I don't know.

58
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,892
So for example, form, what is a form?

59
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:09,100
I'm going to go to Google and
I'm going to type html form.

60
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,490
And the first thing I get,
maybe it will help.

61
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,420
The form element, that looks familiar.

62
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,610
It says down here html forms
contain form elements.

63
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,830
Form elements are types of input
elements, check boxes, radio buttons.

64
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,490
Okay, this seems about right.

65
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,590
And I could keep reading,
I could learn more.

66
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,180
Right now, I'm not going to do that.

67
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,110
But Google is really a huge
friend in looking up and

68
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,320
researching what's going on
with code you don't understand.

69
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,330
I wanted to show you this process
of encountering new code and

70
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,160
looking into Google for what it does,

71
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,820
because it's a totally authentic
part of every programmer's workflow.

72
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,990
There's a lot to learn out there, and
you're never going to learn it all.

73
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:49,040
And so, looking up things as you need
them is a totally normal thing to do.

74
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,360
Anyways, just as a reminder, you're
about to take your boring black and

75
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,240
white page, and turn it into
something beautiful and colorful.

76
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,490
So good luck, and have fun.
