Congratulations!

00:00:01,195 --> 00:00:05,420
You've made your first step
towards a path in iOS programming.

00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,200
This course will introduce you
to iOS app development and

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,320
swift, a new programming
language from Apple.

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,140
As you dive into foundations
of programming through swift,

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,690
there may be times where
you reach your strain zone.

7
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,470
I encourage you to reach out for
support on the forums.

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,840
By the end of this course, you should
have a better idea of whether iOS

00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,450
app development is the right path for
you.
