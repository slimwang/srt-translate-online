1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,330
We're almost there
with our tablet layout.

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:03,430
It's time to get this done.

3
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,100
We have two problems.

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,400
First, if you've tried this on
a Nexus 7, or other seven-inch tablet,

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,150
there's a good chance the detail view
isn't rendering in landscape mode.

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,470
The reason for this,
is that the grid view cannot solve for

7
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,430
the constraints we've given it.

8
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,420
And the reason why we don't have
enough room is that the design for

9
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,320
this view calls for

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,390
the toolbar to be placed in line with
the detailed grid, rather than above it.

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,270
The second problem is
a problem with elevation.

12
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:31,420
Our design calls for a shadow around our
detail view, but it's just not there.

13
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,150
Since we'd like this to have a shadow
on all platforms, not just Android L,

14
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,830
we can introduce another widget
from the support library, CardView.

15
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,580
CardView is a container that
casts a shadow around a view.

16
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,985
When we change the elevation of
the card, it casts a larger shadow.

17
00:00:48,985 --> 00:00:52,610
Note that card view has its own
version of the elevation parameter.

18
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:56,000
We can also change the radius of
the corners of the card view to make

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,330
rounded shadowed rectangles.

20
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,830
Note that this works best on L,

21
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:03,510
due to the way we handle clipping
on the compatible version.

22
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,900
Because the card view is a layout that
draws stuff around other layouts,

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,520
it works a bit differently than others.

24
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,480
You can control the background
color of the layout,

25
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,250
the background color of the card,
the padding around the card frame,

26
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:23,120
and the padding inside the card frame,
between the card and its contents.

27
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,910
Since CardView is rendered in
Android L using elevation,

28
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,930
it's important to understand how
this impacts the rendering of views.

29
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,180
First of all,

30
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:36,670
a view at a higher elevation
obscures views at lower elevations.

31
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,900
If you have nested views,
if a view will obscure the parent,

32
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,230
you will also obscure all
children of the view.

33
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,230
Views that have transparent
backgrounds don't cast shadows.

34
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,870
Views that are contained within these
transparent views will also not cast

35
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,260
shadows.

36
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:57,030
Given these constraints, it's relatively
easy to create a view with elevation

37
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,700
that doesn't render the way one expects.

38
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,980
We're going to make extensive
use of relative layout,

39
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,970
to avoid having to add extra hierarchy,
which would prevent us from creating

40
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,729
the kind of shadows that
the design requires.

41
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,960
One more thing,
on pre-L versions of android,

42
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,450
card view doesn't clip contents to
the bounds of the curved rectangle, but

43
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:21,300
instead adds padding to avoid having
that content overlap the shadow area.

44
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,260
Since we have a dark background
on part of our card,

45
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,220
this makes a little white line show up.

46
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,120
Since the corner overlap looks more
benign than these white lines,

47
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,160
I recommend setting
cardPreventCornerOverlap = "false"

48
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,080
on our card views.
