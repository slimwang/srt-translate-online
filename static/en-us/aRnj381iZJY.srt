1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,880
So, how do you go about
choosing a library?

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,970
There's a few things to look at.

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,990
Central to everything is functionality.

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:12,320
So, the first step is to figure out
what the library actually gives you.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,600
If the source code is available, that
would be the ultimate source of truth,

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,450
but it's probably not
the best place to start.

7
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:24,570
Instead, consider looking for an
overview Readme or a Quick Start Guide.

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,060
These should help you get
the essence of the library and

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,830
highlight the common use cases.

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,980
The library really makes easy,

11
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,720
ideally, these should match
exactly what you need to do.

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,900
This is also where Integration and
Instructions should be found.

13
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,810
Finding easy to understand
gradal instructions,

14
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,158
can make a huge difference
in getting up and running.

15
00:00:43,158 --> 00:00:49,090
Lack of gradal instructions might
mean extra pain and maintenance time.

16
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,880
For UI libraries,
you might also look for screen shots,

17
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,100
videos, a demo app or
real world apps that use the library.

18
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,100
All can be powerful signals
in determining if this is

19
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,030
actually what you need.

20
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,290
There are specific things you
need that aren't readily visible,

21
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,160
may be time to look
through the documentation.

22
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,180
Good documentation is a sign that
the library developers care a lot

23
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,890
about the developer
usability of their library.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,300
Two other factors you might
consider are recent activity and

25
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,100
whether there is a community
around the library.

26
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,390
Both are good signs that if
you come across an issue, or

27
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,990
a bug, you won't be on your own.

28
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,510
While none of these things except the
core functionality are deal breakers,

29
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,812
there is a strong correlation
between these factors and

30
00:01:36,812 --> 00:01:38,680
well designed and useful libraries.
