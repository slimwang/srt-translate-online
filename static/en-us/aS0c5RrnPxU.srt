1
00:00:00,169 --> 00:00:01,956
This is a more common example; it’s called the

2
00:00:01,956 --> 00:00:04,509
wheel of fortune. We’re twisting an object like

3
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:07,092
a bottle, or like a pen and then it arrives at a

4
00:00:07,092 --> 00:00:10,624
specific angle. We all know that angles go

5
00:00:10,624 --> 00:00:13,707
between zero and 360 degree. So let’s take a

6
00:00:13,707 --> 00:00:16,549
specific angle. What is the probability that our

7
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:20,549
object has the very precise angle 180 degrees?
