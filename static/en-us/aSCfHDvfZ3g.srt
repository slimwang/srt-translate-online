1
00:00:00,032 --> 00:00:02,474
So for this quiz,
I want you to answer the question.

2
00:00:02,474 --> 00:00:05,710
What is the solution to this recurrence?

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,080
Let's do it as multiple choice.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,710
So pick one of these.

5
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:12,680
Is it constant time, log time,
linear time, or (n (log n) time?
