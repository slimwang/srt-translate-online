1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,200
Now, finally, there are some
overrides that we need for

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,770
when the connection fails
called onConnectionFailed, or

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,420
the client gets disconnected
called onDisconnected.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,020
For these, we'll just log the event,

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,740
and in the case of failure,
we'll also log the relevant error code.

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,710
And now that we've added these,
we've gotten everything that we need, so

7
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,580
let's run the application and
see what happens.

8
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:22,440
Awesome!

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,240
As you can see, it works.

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,010
Now take some time to
make your changes and

11
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,020
finish up the app on your own machine.

12
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,970
Maybe you could even do something simple
like making these labels a little big

13
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,680
bigger so they're easier to read.

14
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,120
Have fun playing with
the application and

15
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,680
seeing the kind of things
you can do with it.

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,240
Maybe visualizing latitude and

17
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,910
longitude in a lot more nicer way than
we've done here, by just using numbers.

18
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,520
You might be able to use,
like, a dial on a compass, or

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,120
something along those lines.

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,040
Well, whatever you do, have fun with
it and let's see what you can do next.
