[Andy:] On the forums, we saw a lot of confusion about homeworks 2.5 and 2.6.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Specifically, questions about what was going on with the linear algebra.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I want to talk about some of that today, and I want to do it by comparing the 2D case --

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and that's the case we talked about in lecture--

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
with the 4D case, which is what you're asked about on the homework.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So in the 2-dimensional case, I want to first talk about this f matrix

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
that Sebastian was calling the "state transition matrix."

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The idea behind this matrix was that we wanted to take some old beliefs,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
some old state, which in the 2-dimensional case was represented by x and ẋ

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
where ẋ is our velocity and x is our position,

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and from that we want to extract our predict some new state,

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
which was called x-prime and ẋ-prime.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The question was what do we fill in here to get the proper values for x-prime and ẋ-prime.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Let's think.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What should our position be--our predicted position after some time has elapsed?

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Well, we want to include our old position, right?

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Lets first write out these formulas.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We expect that x-prime will be composed of our old position

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
plus whatever motion was occurring due to the velocity.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That is going to be dt--the time elapsed--times our velocity.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This is just velocity times time, which tells us how much our position has changed.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Now, in matrix terms how do we express that?

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We're talking about x-prime, so that means we're going to think about this top row here.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We want to keep x, which means a 1 goes here.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We want to multiply ẋ by dt, so that means dt goes here.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Just like that we figured out the first row of our F matrix.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'll label it here--F. Now what about the second row?

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Let's do a similar thing for ẋ prime to figure out where we should go in the second row.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
After our prediction, we said that we're just

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
going to assume that the velocity hasn't changed.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Velocity after equals velocity before.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
That means we don't want to have anything to do with this x, meaning a 0 goes here.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We want everything to do with this ẋ--we want to keep this--so we put a 1 here.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay. This kind of gives us some intuition for how this works in 2 dimensions.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Let's see if we can generalize to 4.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Now, again, we're going to some new state,

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and we're doing that by multiplying a state-transition matrix by some old belief.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But now instead of x and ẋ, we also have y coordinates.

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So we have x, y, ẋ, and ẏ.

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Here we're going to, of course, get x, y, ẋ, ẏ, and all of those are prime,

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
because they indicate after our prediction.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Now, I'm not going to fill in this 4 x 4 matrix for you,

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
but I think using similar reasoning to what we did in the 2-dimensional case,

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
you can come up with what these formulas should be,

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and from that fill in this matrix appropriately,

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
remembering that this entry corresponds to the first row,

47
00:03:05,000 --> 99:59:59,999
this entry the second, and so on. Good luck.
