00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,240
The new tools we learned in
this session, loops, arrays,

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,900
hashes, are some of the most important
concepts in all of programing.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,305
We'll continue to build upon
them as this course progresses.

4
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:18,021
Everything we've done so far has been
with relatively simplistic data,

5
00:00:18,021 --> 00:00:21,227
an array of names,
a hash representing a person.

6
00:00:21,227 --> 00:00:24,841
Those types of examples are important,
when you're starting out, but

7
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:26,630
they may seem a little bit trivial.

8
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,960
It's time for us to step it up.

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,710
In this session,

10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:35,190
you're going to build a project
using more complex, realistic data.

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,960
Imagine, that we run an online retailer,

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,620
Toy City, that sells the best
toys in all the world.

13
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,999
You love your job, except for one thing.

14
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,750
Things are not going well for Toy City.

15
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,470
Children actually hate
toys now with a passion.

16
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,280
To help turn the business around,
our boss has

17
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,620
asked us to write an application that
will analyze our product sales data and

18
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,840
generate a nice looking sales report.

19
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,410
Here's a preview of the crazy product
sales data we'll be working with.

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,000
We'll revisit this project and continue
to improve it in future sessions.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,900
In this first iteration, we're going to
focus on running some simple analysis

22
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,700
on the data and printing
a simple report to the terminal.

23
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,110
In future iterations,
we'll save the output to a text file and

24
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,140
incorporate an API.

25
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,140
This project is a big step up,
but don't worry.

26
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,030
We'll be here to help you along the way.

27
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,960
Let's go ahead and take a closer look at
the project specifications and setup.
