00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:03,419
So let's recall what we've done.

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:05,320
We have two techniques
to reduce our Sudoku.

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,157
The first one is elimination,
which consists of

4
00:00:10,157 --> 00:00:13,771
picking a box with a value and
removing this value from all its peers.

5
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:17,292
[BLANK_AUDIO]

6
00:00:17,292 --> 00:00:19,567
And the second one is
called only choice,

7
00:00:19,568 --> 00:00:23,731
which consists of picking a unit, and
if there's only one value that is only

8
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:27,130
allowed in one of the boxes,
assigning that value to the box.

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,088
Now having these,
how do we solve the problem?

10
00:00:31,088 --> 00:00:34,129
Well, one thing we can do is
to just apply them repeatedly.

11
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:38,540
We can start with our original grid,
pick some box, and apply eliminate.

12
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,109
This takes us to a more complete grid.

13
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:44,929
Then in this new grid, we can pick
any unit and apply only choice.

14
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:47,609
This will take us to
an even more complete grid.

15
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:51,740
Now, again, we can pick any box and
apply eliminate and then any unit and

16
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,340
apply only choice.

17
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,130
And then keep on going.

18
00:00:55,409 --> 00:00:58,459
This may take us to a solution,
or maybe not.

19
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,090
Maybe we'll get stuck somewhere.

20
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,420
This technique is called
constrained propagation.

21
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,870
And we'll have the chance to learn it
more in detail later in the nanodegree.

22
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,609
So, let's find out how far
this gets us by coding it and

23
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:09,780
trying it on some examples.
