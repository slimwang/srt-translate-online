00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:04,500
The F-statistic is never negative. That's because we square each deviation,

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,358
making it positive. And when you do arithmetic with positive numbers, you'll

3
00:00:09,358 --> 00:00:14,013
always get a positive number as the result. This then has implications for the

4
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:18,964
f distribution. Since the F-statistic is always positive, the f distribution

5
00:00:18,964 --> 00:00:24,589
will only be in the first quadrant, and it looks something like this.
