00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:04,300
I'm sitting here with Mike,
one of the web developers at Udacity.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,220
I heard you wrote some
pretty bad code recently.

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,080
>> Yeah.
[LAUGH] That was quite the experience.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,775
>> Yeah, I actually remember, because
I gave you that bad code assignment.

5
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:13,460
>> [LAUGH] You did.

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,378
>> So, so basically in a nutshell,
what did I tell you to do?

7
00:00:17,378 --> 00:00:22,040
>> You, you came up with an app idea,
and you just told me, all right,

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:27,660
now forget all the things you know
to do right, and, and do it wrong.

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,250
And try to make it a rough experience.

10
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,940
>> So build a spaghetti code app.

11
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,620
>> Build a spaghetti code application.

12
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,570
>> And how did you feel?

13
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,330
I was really excited because I knew
I didn't have to maintain this thing.

14
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,460
I was just going to crank
out an application for

15
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,850
you really quick, get it done in hour or

16
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:48,690
two and and just get code on
the screen and feel super productive.

17
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,570
So I was, I was kind of excited to not
have to put whole lot of brain power to

18
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,880
it and just do it.

19
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,450
Yeah it's kind of old
habits in a way right.

20
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,860
>> Yeah, yeah.
>> Because everyone kind of learns

21
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,710
spaghetti code and then learns how
to organize their code later on.

22
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,130
>> It reminded me of like ten years ago.

23
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,055
Like the type of work I was doing.

24
00:01:05,055 --> 00:01:06,460
[LAUGH].

25
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,190
>> So you had this app.

26
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,700
You didn't have to maintain it.

27
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,725
You felt great about it.

28
00:01:10,725 --> 00:01:12,450
>> Mm-hm.
>> How do you feel by the end?

29
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,644
>> Pretty bad.

30
00:01:13,644 --> 00:01:14,330
[LAUGH].

31
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,320
>> Really, why?

32
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,440
>> Well it was a miserable
experience when it got to the end.

33
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,260
There was a point that I actually
coded myself into a corner.

34
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:23,980
>> Oh.
>> And

35
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:29,670
I had a problem that I knew, like I knew
myself was a simple problem to solve.

36
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,470
But, because of the way I
had built the application

37
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:36,540
it was no longer a simple problem to
solve, it was actually really difficult.

38
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,180
And then I just felt bad because I,
I knew where this code was going.

39
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:40,880
>> I see.

40
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,510
Well, actually,
Nick Artman one of our other front end

41
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,150
engineers-
>> Mm-hm.

42
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,870
>> Likens it to diving for
the finish line.

43
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,990
>> Yeah.
>> And if you dive for

44
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,310
the finish line too early,
well, you get scraped up.

45
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,810
Right?
And things seem really bad and

46
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,840
it takes a lot more effort to go
then and finish the, the race.

47
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,750
>> That's-.

48
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,630
>> That's a very good metaphor about it.

49
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,400
>> I basically told you to die
right out of the starting block.

50
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,270
>> [LAUGH] Right.

51
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,963
Yeah.
I, I thought I was done with

52
00:02:03,963 --> 00:02:07,677
the application before I had ever
started it really, and so I was just

53
00:02:07,677 --> 00:02:11,453
[NOISE] trying to get stuff done and
if I would have taken my time to like,

54
00:02:11,453 --> 00:02:14,973
really plan it out ahead of time and,
and know what I was going to do

55
00:02:14,973 --> 00:02:19,424
throughout everything it would have
been a much more enjoyable experience.

56
00:02:19,424 --> 00:02:19,930
>> All right.

57
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,460
So if you want to blame someone for
this experience you can blame Mike.

58
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,040
>> You told me to do it.

59
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,510
>> If you want to blame someone for
this experience, you can blame me.

60
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,190
Bad advice.
[LAUGH] Awesome.

61
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,315
Well, thanks Mike for sitting with me.

62
00:02:30,315 --> 00:02:31,554
>> Uh-huh.
