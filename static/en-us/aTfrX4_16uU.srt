1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
All right, to create Pitch Perfect,

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,230
we first need to learn how to create a new

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,620
Xcode project. If you haven't seen this

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,370
before, start by opening Xcode. Then go to

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,700
File > New > Project.

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,230
This will open up a new project wizard.

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,990
Make sure that you have selected the iOS

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,570
section. And then select a Single View

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,500
Application and click Next. Then we need

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,360
to give our new iOS app a name.

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,860
PitchPerfect seems like a good choice.

12
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,230
Then for the Organization Name, you can

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,300
put whatever you'd like for now. I’ll put

14
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,590
Udacity. the same goes for the

15
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:43,590
identifiers, which we'll talk about more

16
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,510
later on.

17
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,300
Make sure the language is Swift. Devices

18
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,120
is set to Universal. And you can unmark

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,190
all the checkboxes at this point.

20
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,620
This looks good. So let's go ahead and

21
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,219
click Next. Select a location where you'd

22
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,260
like to put the project. For me I'll

23
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,270
choose my Desktop and I’ll click Create.

24
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:09,330
Xcode will now create a new iOS app

25
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,340
called PitchPerfect and automatically

26
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,290
generate some files and settings for you.

27
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,930
Here's the project Xcode automatically

28
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,200
created for me. Here in the top left,

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,520
it has an AppDelegate class that will

30
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,560
listen to system events, such as when

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,330
your app starts, when you get a memory

32
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,100
warning and when your app is sent into

33
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,100
the background. There's also this default

34
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,560
ViewController class. Will add more tips in.

35
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,530
For now we're going to add a single

36
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,210
line to the AppDelegate, to a function

37
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,860
that gets called when the app launches,

38
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,900
called didFinishLaunchingWithOptions.

39
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,860
This one line of code will print out

40
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,250
hello, world to the console. Here in the

41
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,360
didFinishLaunchingWithOptions

42
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,850
function and in green we see comments

43
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,950
Xcode has provided by default.

44
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,479
Let’s add our print statement right

45
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,899
after the comment. I’ll type

46
00:01:57,899 --> 00:01:58,979
print(“hello, world”).

47
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,810
Ok, now let's test to see our code running.

48
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,270
To do this, we’ll want to click

49
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,159
the Run button here in the top left,

50
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,170
which will launch the iOS simulator and

51
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:12,330
kick off the execution of our app.

52
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,670
When the simulator launches, we see our

53
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,680
brand new app and just a simple white

54
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,100
background. In the console, you see the

55
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,140
words hello, world.

56
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,210
Awesome. In a few minutes, you've already

57
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,910
created an iOS app. It probably won't win

58
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,240
the Apple Design Awards, but it's a start.

59
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,280
we’ll work to build and improve it

60
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,350
throughout the course. But first, let's

61
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:41,180
take a closer look at Xcode
