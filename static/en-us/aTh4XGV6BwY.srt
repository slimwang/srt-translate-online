00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Here comes a simple situation in which to apply the heat equation.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Assume that the heat is distributed in such a way along the length of the wire,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
the temperature depends linearly on position--one end is cool and one end is warm.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
If you wait for a short time, what happens with the central part of that function.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Will it move left, will it stay as it is, will it move right?
