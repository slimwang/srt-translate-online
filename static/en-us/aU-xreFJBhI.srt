1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And it's 1 and 1. So, the way I get these numbers, 1 and 1, is really easy.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I just write down that y is always larger than x by 1.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
When you look at this, that just means a = 1 and b = 1,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
because you can think over this 1x instead of just x over here, and this gives us b equals 1.
