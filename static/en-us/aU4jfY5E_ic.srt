00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
One way of solving this is to find out which terms appear in several places--

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
for instance, this one--the number of persons taken from the susceptible to the exposed compartment

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and then the number of persons taken from the exposed to the infectious compartment,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and the number of persons taken from the infectious to the recovered compartment.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
If you write it like that, it's easier to read and you can immediately see

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
that the total number is conserved.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The number of persons we lose here we gain here, the number of persons we lose here we gain here,

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and the number of persons we lose here is gain here.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So up to very tiny round off errors of the total number and result you'll see that the infection

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
takes quite some time to evolve.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The maximum of the exposed compartment comes first and then comes

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
the maximum of the infectious compartment, and as we go, you'll see that the number of

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
susceptible persons shrinks drastically

14
00:00:59,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and the number of recovered persons grows by the same amount.
