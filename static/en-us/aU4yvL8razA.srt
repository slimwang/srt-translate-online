00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:06,000
Here, the only solution is positive 5. Nice work if you got this answer. We'll

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,618
start solving this problem like before. We'll change our equation into

3
00:00:10,618 --> 00:00:15,595
exponential form, having the x as our base, 2 as the exponent and set equal to

4
00:00:15,595 --> 00:00:20,876
25. We need to solve for x, so I must take the square root of both sides of the

5
00:00:20,876 --> 00:00:26,245
equation. When we take the square root of both sides, we must include the plus

6
00:00:26,245 --> 00:00:31,725
or minus symbol for the positive and negative root of 25. We know the square

7
00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:38,314
root of 25 equals 5, so x can equal positive 5 or negative 5. But remember for

8
00:00:38,314 --> 00:00:43,502
logarithms, the base of a logarithm must be great than zero. So, we know that

9
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:49,683
this value x cannot equal negative 5. So the only value that would make this

10
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:52,753
equation true would be positive 5.
