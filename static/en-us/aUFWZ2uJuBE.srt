1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now, the same algorithm works if your test says negative.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We'll practice this in just 1 second. Suppose your test result says negative.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You could still ask the same question:

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Now, what's my probability having cancer or not? But now all the positives in here become negatives.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The sum is the total probability of negative test results, and we may now divide by this guy,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
you now get the posterior probability for cancer and non-cancer assuming you had a

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
negative test result, which of course to be much, much more favorable

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
for you because none of us wants to have cancer.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So, look at this for a while and let's now do the calculation for the negative case

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
using the same numbers I gave you before,

11
00:00:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and with the step by step this time around so it can really guide you through the process.
