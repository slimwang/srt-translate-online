1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:04,640
Now that we understand a little
about what an outlier is,

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,610
let's take a look at
one through an example.

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,640
Here we have some income data
that's spread out in a histogram

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,610
to show how the values are distributed.

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:19,010
It's apparent that most of the values
representing people's income

6
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,608
are within the 0 to 100,000 range.

7
00:00:21,608 --> 00:00:25,371
But there's one value,
someone making $1 million,

8
00:00:25,371 --> 00:00:27,860
that we can see out here on the right.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,870
That might fit with what we've
described as extreme or abnormal.

10
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,990
Or a great distance from most
of the values in the data set.

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,004
And if we think about it,

12
00:00:41,004 --> 00:00:46,049
one instance of a report of $1
million income, compared to 40 other

13
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:51,110
values that are from zero to
100,000 is really quite abnormal.

14
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,470
We could probably
consider this an outlier.

15
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,330
But what if that single value was only
$200,000, and it looked like this?

16
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:08,700
It is far to the right, and
seems to be extreme, but $200,000,

17
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,450
compared to the range of zero to
100,000, isn't quite that extreme.

18
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,690
So is it an outlier?

19
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:21,720
It actually may not matter whether or
not we label a point as an outlier.

20
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,680
What does matter is that we
identify extreme data points and

21
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,140
understand how they impact our results.
