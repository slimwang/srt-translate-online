00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,940
>> So often in the theory of computation, we analyze algorithms in

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,250
terms of their use of resources. And it's usually time and space.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,500
So like, when we talk about an algorithm running in say n

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,200
log n time, we're saying something about this, the time that it takes.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,040
So if you say that it uses n-squared space, we're talking about

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,290
the, the amount of memory that it takes up as the function

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:21,930
of the growth of the inputs. So what sort of resources do

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,300
you suppose might matter in the

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,702
context of computational learning theory? So we're

10
00:00:25,702 --> 00:00:29,550
just, we're trying to select among algorithms. We want algorithms that

11
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,942
use their resources well. What source of resources would we analyze?

12
00:00:32,942 --> 00:00:36,070
If there's multiple possible answers, just fill in one of them.

13
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,960
We'll just see if it's any of the ones on our list.
