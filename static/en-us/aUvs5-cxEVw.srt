00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,450
We're out here by the Computer History Museum

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,340
in Mountain View, California. The Google headquarters is

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,700
just around the corner. But before we start

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,830
to build our applications on the Google cloud platform,

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,030
let's look at the history of building server

6
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:17,740
side applications. Fifty years ago this is where

7
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,140
most server-side applications were born. On a physical

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,530
computer sitting under the desk in some office. Yeah,

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,080
seriously. A physical computer, you know, one that

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:34,230
you can touch and smell. And the generated

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,590
heat from the fan outlet, so you could

12
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,830
warm your feet, if the office was cold. Well,

13
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:42,310
it didn't take long until the server-side applications

14
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,640
grew bigger. And it was no longer possible

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,080
to run them on a computer like this.

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,690
So the pizza box computer was created because it

17
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,650
looked like a pizza box. And these were great

18
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:56,140
because you could stack them on top of each other

19
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,130
and on top of each other and on top of each other. And voila! The

20
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:08,630
computer rack had just been born. And the entire shebang was put in a dedicated

21
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:13,100
room called the data center, because all the fans made too much noise and stuff.

22
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,890
But it was no longer possible to warm

23
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,920
your feet against the fan outlet of course.
