1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,190
To build the desired layout,
the image actually goes edge to edge, so

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,910
let's get rid of this padding
that we have on the parent view.

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,270
Cool, now the image goes edge to edge.

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,470
Let's fix the text down here.

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,720
We mentioned that we want 16 dp of
padding all around the edges here.

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,690
Okay, well, I tried to add 16 dp
of padding to this TextView, but

7
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,610
we originally wanted only
8 dp of padding here.

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,820
So we should break this out
into individual values and

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,420
set the bottom padding to be 8 dp.

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,480
Okay, now we have top, left, and
right padding equal to 16 dp, but

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,060
the bottom padding of
this TextView is 8 dp.

12
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,610
Cool, so now this last text you
should also get 16 dp of padding.

13
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,460
But wait, now that increases the amount
of space in between the two TextViews.

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,760
Let's also add 16 dp of
padding to this last TextView.

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,960
This makes the left and
bottom and right spacing correct.

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,350
But now there's too much space
in between the two TextViews, so

17
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,460
let's break this out
into individual values.

18
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,650
And we'll stop right there because we
don't want any top padding on this view.

19
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,248
The correct spacing is coming
from the bottom padding of this

20
00:01:04,248 --> 00:01:05,241
TextView above it.

21
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,090
Cool, so that looks correct.

22
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,890
The only thing that's missing now is
the fact that we need to get rid of this

23
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,440
white space here.

24
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,930
We don't need a bottom margin on
this ImageView, so let's delete it.

25
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,920
Great work,
we finished building this layout.
