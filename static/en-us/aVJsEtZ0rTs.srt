1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,145
First, we have to keep a couple things in mind. I have to decide what variable

2
00:00:04,157 --> 00:00:07,845
I'm going to use for the angle. I'm going to let a equal the measure of the

3
00:00:07,857 --> 00:00:11,940
angle. Next, I have to remember what supplement and complement mean. If you

4
00:00:11,952 --> 00:00:16,204
recall, the supplement of an angle, I'll write it as s, is equal to 180 minus

5
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:20,499
the measure of the angle. So here, we have the supplement as 180 minus the

6
00:00:20,511 --> 00:00:25,280
measure of the angle. The other thing we have to remember is the complement. The

7
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:29,863
complement of an angle is 90 degrees minus the measure of the angle. So, I have

8
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:34,512
the measure of the angle is a. The supplement is 180 minus a, and the complement

9
00:00:34,524 --> 00:00:39,107
is 90 minus a. Now, we can try to turn the words into an equation. The

10
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:44,465
supplement of the angle s measures, which means equals, 30 degrees more. So

11
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:50,169
that's 30 plus twice it's compliment. I know that s equals 180 minus a, and I

12
00:00:50,181 --> 00:00:55,641
know that the compliment is 90 minus a. Now I can solve the equation for a. The

13
00:00:55,653 --> 00:01:00,555
first thing we need to do to solve this equation is to distribute this 2. So I

14
00:01:00,567 --> 00:01:05,087
have 180 minus a equals 30 plus 2 times 90 is 180. And 2 times negative a is

15
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:10,073
negative 2 a. The next thing I want to do combine these like terms. 180 plus 30

16
00:01:10,085 --> 00:01:14,940
is 210. I need to get all my variables onto one side of the equation, and I'm

17
00:01:14,952 --> 00:01:20,036
going to do that by adding 2 a to both sides of the equation. When I add 2 a to

18
00:01:20,048 --> 00:01:25,425
both sides of the equation, the left side I have 180. Negative a plus 2 a gives

19
00:01:25,437 --> 00:01:30,839
me a. And that's going to equal 210. The next thing I need to do is subtract 180

20
00:01:30,851 --> 00:01:36,019
from both sides. And I get a equals 210 minus 180 which gives me 30. So, the

21
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:41,003
measure of an angle who's supplement measures 30 degrees more than twice it's

22
00:01:41,015 --> 00:01:45,222
complement is 30 degrees. I think we've had enough of word problems for now.

23
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:47,071
Let's move on to something else.
