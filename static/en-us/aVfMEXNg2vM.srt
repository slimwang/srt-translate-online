00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,960
Okay. You have now successfully used Git to merge some branches.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,130
At this point, you might be wondering whether Git can always automatically

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,130
determine how to merge branches.

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,825
Let's think this through by taking a look at another simple example.

5
00:00:11,825 --> 00:00:14,220
In this example, just like in the last one,

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:19,460
the original file contains a couple of lines, A, B and D.

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,640
Remember, these are just stand-ins for lines, not the content themselves.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,430
Again, like in the previous example, Jake's file and

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,930
Rachel's file look a little bit different at the end of the day.

10
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:35,475
This time, at the end of the day, Jake's file contains the lines, A, B prime and

11
00:00:35,475 --> 00:00:38,470
D, where B prime just stands for a modified version of B.

12
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:43,450
And then Rachel's file at the end of the day contains A, B double prime.

13
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,920
Again, another modified version of B, but not the same one as Jake's.

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,560
And D.

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,830
If it helps to think about this in more concrete terms,

16
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,740
you can imagine that this file is a recipe and that B is a line that calls for

17
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,040
preheating the oven to 375 degrees.

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,910
Then B prime, for instance, could call for preheating the oven to 400 degrees.

19
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,765
And B double prime could call for 350.

20
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:07,300
Then again, this content really could be anything.

21
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,720
Just like you did in the last exercise, consider for each line whether or

22
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,850
not it should be in the final version.

23
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,070
If you think it should be, mark it as yes.

24
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,420
If you think it shouldn't, mark it as no.

25
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,290
And if you don't think that we really have enough information,

26
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,090
mark it as unknown.
