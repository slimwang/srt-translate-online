1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,850
So that's really interesting.

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:05,370
Everyone's heard of Watson,
IBM's Watson,

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,030
and everybody knows that
Watson won Jeapordy!

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,610
I think a lot of people realize IBM
is now trying to move Watson into

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,910
healthcare.

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:19,900
The results you just
described are really amazing.

7
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,210
Do you think that we're heading
into an era down the road,

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,550
where tools like Watson
are going to replace doctors?

9
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,940
>> So first,
before I answer that question,

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,260
first I want to give a little background
about how Watson compete in Jeopardy.

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,180
Besides the advanced analytics
techniques they have used,

12
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:44,530
the amazing natural language processing
pipeline they have developed.

13
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:49,120
Another secret I think is very important
for the success of Watson winning

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,140
Jeopardy is to reach training
data source that are available

15
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,215
that related to Jeopardy challenge.

16
00:00:59,215 --> 00:01:04,694
In fact, there is a website
called www.jarchive.com that

17
00:01:04,694 --> 00:01:09,713
record all the historical competition
in the past in Jeopardy since 1983.

18
00:01:09,713 --> 00:01:15,005
And a lot of those questions
are general knowledge

19
00:01:15,005 --> 00:01:20,065
that there are associate Wikipedia
articles that provide very

20
00:01:20,065 --> 00:01:26,060
rich meta information
about those questions.

21
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:33,000
So those two important data sources
helped the Waston Team to develop their

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,620
algorithms, to train their algorithms
on those historical questions.

23
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:41,870
So that lead to a very amazing result.

24
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:46,430
But in medicines,
neither of those sources are available.

25
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:52,540
There is no good question database or
question/answer database that available.

26
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:57,030
There's no good matter information
related to all those clinical concepts.

27
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,560
So it's a lot more complicated
even to get to that stage.

28
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,150
So what they have done before I left is,

29
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:12,115
they look at the US medical
licensing exam questions.

30
00:02:12,115 --> 00:02:14,810
And trying to at least
tackle that first.

31
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,820
Because those are the available
questions and answers.

32
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,520
But just the space of
the medical domain is so large.

33
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,470
And the question and answers are a lot
of times there's no clear yes and

34
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,650
no answers.

35
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,270
So it's a lot harder.

36
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:34,320
But clinical institutions are very
interested in using Watson.

37
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:40,220
So there's a very big medical
research center at MD Anderson,

38
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,540
I mean,
Sloan Kettering Memorial Cancer Centers.

39
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:51,800
They all partners with Watson,
to use Watson for their diagnosis.

40
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,040
So that's definitely
a promising direction.

41
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,380
I hope they succeed.

42
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,880
>> It's fascinating to speculate
about what something like

43
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,790
Watson might be able to do, if you could
train it on that vast amount of data.

44
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:08,710
So as you look ahead for the next few
years, five years or so, where do you

45
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,140
think we're going to be in terms of
big data and analytics in health care?

46
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,740
>> Yeah, so
it's definitely a very hot area.

47
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,370
Big data analytics in health care.

48
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:23,180
And so there's a paradigm
shift from the traditional,

49
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:28,630
more small scale statistic approach,
to a more system approach.

50
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,680
When I say system,
I mean computing system.

51
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,500
So they're not single
algorithm that going to work.

52
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:42,070
It's a pipeline of sufficity
computational tasks that put together

53
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:47,140
and run in a various scalable platform
like high performance computing centers

54
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:54,450
or in a cloud environment
like Amazon web services.

55
00:03:54,450 --> 00:04:00,720
So, in particular,
I think there is a great need for

56
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,950
making the data more useable.

57
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,110
Using analytics techniques.

58
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:10,782
So, there's a new push
called phenotyping.

59
00:04:10,782 --> 00:04:15,835
That really means, how do you
convert those messy electronic

60
00:04:15,835 --> 00:04:20,490
health records into meaningful
clinical concepts using algorithms?

61
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:25,910
Rather than require the data to be good
to begin with, why don't we develop

62
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:31,800
algorithm that can automatically clean
the data and turn them into more usable

63
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,570
high quality data that can
support research and discovery?

64
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:41,200
So that's the phenotyping effort
that a lot of people are working on.

65
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,660
That's about the input to
the analytics platform.

66
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,470
Then, there's the middle part,

67
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:51,740
where people are trying to view those
analytics, predictive analytics.

68
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:56,245
That used to take months, like for
every disease target, every data set,

69
00:04:56,245 --> 00:05:00,590
you have to spend months just to
get the right data, view the model,

70
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,420
then validate that.

71
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:07,120
But now, everybody want to use
predictive analytics and there's

72
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,420
thousands of disease and conditions
people want to view the model for.

73
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,610
So how can you scale up to
view this model quickly?

74
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:18,820
You need a very scalable,
large scale platform to support that.

75
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,890
So, alot of people leveraging
parallel computing and

76
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,860
like map redo's to do that kind of work.

77
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,750
That's the processing part.

78
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,340
And also, finally, the output, right?

79
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,250
So we so far only talk about accuracy
and how good the models are.

80
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:40,160
But in order to make use of those
model in clinical decision support,

81
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,900
you really have to make
the model intuitive.

82
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,250
So that the decision maker,
like clinician, doctor can understand.

83
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,570
Can explain the result to the patients,
so that they believe and

84
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,570
follow through the recommendation.

85
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:59,570
And their work on leveraging
similar patients' history and

86
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:04,950
recommend what worked for
the similar patient to the current

87
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:10,148
patient as intuitive method to
explain the recommendations.

88
00:06:10,148 --> 00:06:13,390
So that's the final output part, right?

89
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,350
So all the entire system,
input processing and

90
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,260
output need to be new
computational method.

91
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:25,430
And I think that's very a promising
future for health care analytics.

92
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,380
>> Well thank you very much.

93
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,950
I think you really helped
the students understand,

94
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,580
not only where we are, but
to see that there are many,

95
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,340
many years of interesting research and
development ahead of us.

96
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:39,090
So maybe some students
will decide to join that,

97
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,530
which would be a great result.

98
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,520
So thank you very much.

99
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,020
>> Thank you.
