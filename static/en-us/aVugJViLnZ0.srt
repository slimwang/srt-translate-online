1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,000
Time to bring our apartment
into virtual reality.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,710
There are a lot of amazing
STKs that can make it really

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,150
easy to take a Unity Scene and
enable it for VR.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,790
However, it's also interesting to see
how to build your own VR camera system

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,479
and you'll learn a lot in the process.

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,570
Let's start by opening
up our apartment scene.

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,320
Now, let's create two
new camera game objects.

8
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,690
Let's name one of them left eye and
the other right eye.

9
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,640
For the left eye,
let's set the viewport width to be 0.5.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,634
For the right eye,
set its viewport x coordinate to

11
00:00:42,634 --> 00:00:46,130
be 0.5 and leave the width as 1.

12
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:50,490
Now if we hop over to the game
view we'll see that the left eye

13
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,370
is now rendering the image on
the left side of the screen.

14
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,820
And the right eye is now
rendering to the right.

15
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,690
Let's now create
an empty game object and

16
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,270
group our camera eyes
together underneath it.

17
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,850
Remember the lens separation distance,
aka,

18
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,150
the LSD that you measured in the quiz?

19
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:15,340
Time to put that to use, the LSD
on my cardboard is 64 millimeters,

20
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,710
this might be different for you,
so you should use your own value.

21
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,170
Now, if we divide the LSD by two,

22
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,860
we get the distance between
our nose to our eye, which

23
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,330
is the value we want to use in unity
in order to separate out our cameras.

24
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,550
Let's shift the left eye
to left by 32 millimeters.

25
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,560
Which we can do by setting
the X coordinate to -0.32.

26
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:42,970
And now let's shift the right eye to the
right by 32 millimeters, which we can do

27
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:48,535
by setting the X coordinate to 0.32,
and with that we've correctly

28
00:01:48,535 --> 00:01:52,465
implemented the rendering required to
view the image within our cardboard.

29
00:01:52,465 --> 00:01:54,885
Next, let's implement our
own head rotations so

30
00:01:54,885 --> 00:01:57,845
that we have more than just
a stereoscopic viewer.

31
00:01:57,845 --> 00:01:59,195
We'll have our own VR app.
