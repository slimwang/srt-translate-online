A common method of simplifying a mesh is the edge collapse, where one vertex is

2
00:00:03,675 --> 00:00:08,428
moved along an edge to be at the same location as another vertex. If I move

3
00:00:08,428 --> 00:00:11,722
vertex A to be at the same location as vertex B, I can then get rid of vertex A

4
00:00:11,722 --> 00:00:16,836
in memory and store just vertex B. This saves me from storing one vertex but

5
00:00:16,836 --> 00:00:21,190
there are other benefits. If I'm drawing a wire frame, I'll draw fewer edges.

6
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:24,388
If I'm drawing triangles, I'll need to save fewer faces. The question to you

7
00:00:24,388 --> 00:00:28,150
is, how many fewer edges and faces are drawn when you do an edge collapse?
