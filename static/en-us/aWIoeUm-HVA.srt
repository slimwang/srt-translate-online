00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We just use some basic SQL to pull out one link.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It had a where clause that looked something like this.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Let's talk about how we can make this a little bit fancier.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Instead of just saying ID = 2, let's change this constraint a little bit.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I've changed the clause to be instead of ID = something

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
to submitter ID = 5.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Okay, so I've added an and clause.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Select * from links where submitter ID = 5 and votes > 23.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And this is a perfectly legit SQL query, and it will also be even more expressive.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We could change this a little bit even more.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We could change this and to an or, for example,

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and this would return us all of the links that were submitted by user 5

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
or all of the links who have more than 23 votes,

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and so you can see SQL is fairly expressive, and you can use and and or,

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and you can use equals and greater than or equal to

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and less than and all sorts of cool stuff.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,720
And already you can see we can ask fairly sophisticated questions of our database.
