00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,017
Remember the information we were given about the three different brands of

2
00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:08,202
cleaning solution. Using this information, can you create an equation in the

3
00:00:08,214 --> 00:00:12,133
form of the word equation we just came up with, but make it so that it only

4
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:16,402
involves numbers and variables? For those variables, I'd like you to let total

5
00:00:16,414 --> 00:00:20,603
cost equal y, and the number of gallons ordered equal x. So, create a different

6
00:00:20,615 --> 00:00:22,001
equation for each company.
