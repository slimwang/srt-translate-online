We just talked about variables written in the form like this, f of u comma v.

2
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:08,973
So, we have two independent variables and one dependent variable. An example of

3
00:00:08,973 --> 00:00:13,830
a situation like this in real life is finding the area of a rectangle. Note that

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,366
the rectangle area is going to depend both on the length of the rectangle and

5
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:23,446
the width of the rectangle. So, if we choose to call the length, l, and we

6
00:00:23,446 --> 00:00:29,180
choose to call the width, w, and we choose to name the function A, how can we

7
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:35,144
express the area of a rectangle as a function of length and width? Please write

8
00:00:35,144 --> 00:00:36,769
this in form f of u comma v.
