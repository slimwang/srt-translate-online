00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,390
Congrats!

2
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:03,930
You've got your first iOS app going by

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,295
adding code into a project
we prepared for you.

4
00:00:06,295 --> 00:00:11,180
In the next lesson we'll start teaching
you iOS in earnest and you will begin by

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:16,170
creating the pitch perfect app, building
it from zero to a full working app.

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,360
This is another fun app that will
let you record your voice and

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,745
apply various sounds effects.

8
00:00:20,745 --> 00:00:24,630
Time to start your journey into
becoming a great iOS developer.
