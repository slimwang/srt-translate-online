00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,740
In this case, there is only one correct answer, which

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,939
is keeping the old and new state on the routers

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:07,650
and switches. This is the two-phase commit approach that we

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,630
talked about. Running different controllers

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,400
for different switches could obviously

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,630
result in an inconsistent state, since each of those controllers

7
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:18,630
maybe making independent decisions. Keeping a hot spare replica does

8
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,340
no good if the replica also writes state inconsistently to

9
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,460
the network. And resolving conflicts on the routers also doesn't work

10
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,380
because no router has a complete view of the network state.
