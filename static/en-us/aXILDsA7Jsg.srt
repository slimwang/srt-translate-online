1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:06,970
We'll have 5i, 3i root 2, 3i root 3 and 4i root 3. Great effort if you got at

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,823
least one of those correct. For the first one we simply take the square root of

3
00:00:10,823 --> 00:00:15,722
25 which is 5 and the square root of negative 1 which equals i. For our second

4
00:00:15,722 --> 00:00:20,910
one we'll split up negative 18 into 9 times 2. times the square root of

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,496
negative 1. We know the square root of 9 equals 3, and the square root of 2

6
00:00:24,496 --> 00:00:29,400
needs to stay as the square root of 2, since 2 can't be simplified. We've

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,684
replaced the square root of negative 1, with i, leaving us with 3 times i root

8
00:00:33,684 --> 00:00:39,387
2. We use similar thinking to get to this third one, we'll have 3i root 3. And

9
00:00:39,387 --> 00:00:43,163
finally, for this last radical, we'll break up the square root of negative 48

10
00:00:43,163 --> 00:00:48,343
into 16 times 3 times the square root of negative 1. We know the square root of

11
00:00:48,343 --> 00:00:51,629
16 equals 4, and the square root of 3 stays as the square root of 3, since this

12
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:56,955
can't be simplified. We replace the square root of negative 1 with i and then

13
00:00:56,955 --> 00:01:02,667
multiply 4 and i to get 4i root 3. Our final answer. There are of course other

14
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:06,703
ways to simplify this last expression this would be the quickest.
