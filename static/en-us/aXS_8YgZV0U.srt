00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,310
In this section, we'll talk about how
to build user interfaces for wearables.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,620
The important thing about Android Wear
is that it uses the same underlying

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,780
framework as Android on phones does, so

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,578
anything you know about Android
applies to wearables as well.

5
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:16,570
Key difference is, you want to design
your app to work well on a wearable,

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,010
you can't just smoosh down your
phone app to fit on a watch,

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,700
you really need to rethink your UI to
make sure it looks good on a wearable.

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,210
A really good question you
should ask yourself is this,

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,690
what couldn't we do on the phone
that we can do now on the wrist?

10
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,420
What now becomes possible?

11
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,660
So in this section you'll learn about
the additional widgets that we've given

12
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,750
app developers to use that
are wearable specific, and

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,910
that will give a common look
to your Android wear app.
