1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here is my submission.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
What we had to do is I built up a list called submissions.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's going to hold the links that are submitted by this author.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The first thing I do is I iterate over the list links

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
for l in links, and if the submitter ID matches our constraint,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
62443, I add it to our list of submissions here,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and then I said sorted by time ascending,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
so then I need to call sort on this list here,

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and if you haven't used the sort function, it's pretty handy.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You can just call sort, and that will sort by whatever the Python default would be,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
so if it's integers, it sorts by integers, but these aren't integers.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
These are entire link objects, so Python would probably sort it lexicographically

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
based on how it prints out, I think, so we want to sort it on submitted time,

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
so that's what the key parameter is for.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And then I return the submissions, and so if I run my query,

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
you can see the output down here, and you can see we have 3 links.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's not the easiest thing to read.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Here is link #1, and the submission time is 133390,

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and we can see our next link is here,

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and we can see the submission time is 133393, so bigger, good.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And finally down here we can see our last link and its submission time is 1334.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Okay, so they're sorted by submission time, and we see they all have

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
submitter ID 62443 here and here.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Okay, so that was not too hard, but it was still a little tedious,

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and this is the type of thing these types of problems a database can help with.
