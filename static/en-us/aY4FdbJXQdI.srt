00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,314
This equation would have a radius of 8. Great thinking if you found that

2
00:00:04,314 --> 00:00:08,642
number. We know that the general equation for a circle centered at the origin

3
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:15,455
is x squared, plus y squared, equals r squared. So, we know that r squared must

4
00:00:15,455 --> 00:00:20,578
equal the number 64. Its the number on the end of the equation. So, solving for

5
00:00:20,578 --> 00:00:24,546
r will take the square root of both side so, one r equals positive 8, and I use

6
00:00:24,546 --> 00:00:30,654
the positive root only since we are dealing with radius. A distance from the

7
00:00:30,654 --> 00:00:35,120
center to the points on the circle. If we actually graph the circle, we could

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,755
easily see that the center is at the origin. And that the radius is 8, the

9
00:00:40,755 --> 00:00:44,039
distance to any point on the circle.
