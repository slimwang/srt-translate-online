00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,290
In this lesson, we'll discuss the reorder buffer,

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:06,650
which lets us correctly handle exceptions and branch mispredictions in out of

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:12,000
order processors. This is very important for actually making real programs work.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,379
So, all high performance processors today, include such a reorder buffer.
