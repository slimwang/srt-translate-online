00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,870
You know, modern cars may still have a keyhole. But you don't have to use

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:10,190
it. As long as the key is nearby, it senses that you're an authorized driver.

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:15,500
So, how do I unlock this car? I just put my hand inside and

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:21,230
watch, it unlocks. Nice. Really, simple.

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,730
Easy. Turns on the interior lights too, so I can see. I can see

6
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,420
inside when it's dark. [NOISE]. Now suppose I leave,

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,870
and I want to lock the car. How do I

8
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,420
do it? Well you can't see, but there's a

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,558
little ridged area here. And if I touch it, watch.

10
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:42,960
It locks. Oh. But I left all the windows

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,950
open. And the sunroof open. Do I have to

12
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,050
open the car, and go in and manually shut

13
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:52,990
them? No, there's a secret way of shutting it. Secret,

14
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:58,578
hm. See, if I hold my finger here for a little while. The

15
00:00:58,578 --> 00:01:04,640
windows shut. And the sunroof shuts. But

16
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,810
it is a secret. How do you ever learn it? Well, it's in the

17
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:14,970
manual. But who reads the manual? It's a big thick manual. People don't read

18
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,290
the manual. I know lots of people who own this car. Who are not

19
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:22,370
aware that they can shut all the windows and sunroof, without going back inside.

20
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,180
Nice feature. Hard to know about it.
