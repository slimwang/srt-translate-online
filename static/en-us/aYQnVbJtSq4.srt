Let me discuss the second quiz here, in which we're given two scan lines again--

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
a left and a right scan line.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The pixels are for the left scan line black, red, black, black, black, black

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and for the right scan line black, black, black, black, red, and black.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Let's assume an occlusion now costs us 10, and a bad match costs us 20.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So what pixel should be aligned with the black pixel over here?

7
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check one of those boxes.
