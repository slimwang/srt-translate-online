1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,130
Now here's how we're going to
build that data frame.

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:07,390
Alright we start by constructing
an empty data frame

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,730
that has all the dates we're
potentially interested in.

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,920
And Dave will show you the syntax for
doing that later on in the lesson.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,260
We'll call this df1 for
data frame 1 of course.

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:27,660
Now, we want to load this data frame up
with a column of data for SPY, for IBM,

7
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,840
for Google and Gold, and I'm going to
show you step by step how we do that.

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,150
Okay, so we separately read in SPY.

9
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,770
And again,
Dave will show you how to do that.

10
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,390
Now when we read SPY,
we get all the potential dates and

11
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,900
all the prices that go with that.

12
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,565
And in this case,
we're loading adjusted closed data.

13
00:00:50,565 --> 00:00:56,030
Note that there's many more
dates here than there are here.

14
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,371
And this is our target data frame that
we loaded with the particular dates

15
00:00:59,371 --> 00:01:00,700
that we're interested in.

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,780
One other thing to mention,
that I didn't mention before,

17
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,750
is these two days are weekend days.

18
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,950
So you can go ahead and
check your calendar, go back to 2010,

19
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,880
and see if I'm right.

20
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,380
Interesting thing, or

21
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,200
just obvious thing about weekends,
is the markets are not open on weekends.

22
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:28,590
So if you compare this with this,
look in our SPY history,

23
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:35,270
we don't have the 23rd and the 24th
because SPY did not trade that day.

24
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,184
So, we've got a little bit of mismatch
there that we need to deal with.

25
00:01:38,184 --> 00:01:43,403
And this actually is one of
the important reasons that we use SPY

26
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:49,225
as a reference, because if SPY traded,
it meant the market was open.

27
00:01:49,225 --> 00:01:52,280
And if the market was open, SPY traded.

28
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:59,240
So, SPY, the S&P 500 ETF,
is our reference for many, many things.
