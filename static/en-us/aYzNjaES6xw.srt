00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,902
Modifying our equation to get y all by itself on one side of the equation gives

2
00:00:04,902 --> 00:00:10,024
us x over 10 minus 15 on the other side. There are of course several different

3
00:00:10,024 --> 00:00:14,052
ways you could write this. You could have just said 1 over 10 times x minus

4
00:00:14,052 --> 00:00:17,049
150, those are equivalent.
