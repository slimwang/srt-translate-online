00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,140
David, do you know about
these three animals?

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,019
Were you able to answer this question?

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,620
>> So, admittedly, I used Wikipedia
a little bit to find out some of these

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:11,210
answers, but we know that eagles lay
eggs, bluebirds lay eggs, penguins.

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,840
They all lay eggs, and
they all have wings.

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,410
Eagles and bluebirds have talons,
whereas penguins kind of more have

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,430
flippers because they swim, so
they don't really have talons.

8
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:19,990
All right.

9
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,720
Eagles and bluebirds also fly,
whereas penguins don't fly.

10
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,930
None of them have fur and
we might say that eagles and

11
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,870
penguins are large whereas
bluebirds are not very large.

12
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,275
Our definition of large
is kind of variable,

13
00:00:32,275 --> 00:00:36,220
it's kind of subjective, but if we were
to draw lines somewhere, it's reasonable

14
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,240
to say that bluebird is definitely
on the smaller end of the spectrum.

15
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,280
>> Good David, you know more
about those animals than I do.

16
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,750
Imagine that the three animals were
given as examples, one after the other.

17
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,726
So, we are back to incremental concept
learning of the previous lesson.

18
00:00:50,726 --> 00:00:54,300
One can use the techniques that
we learned in the previous lesson

19
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,130
to learn some equivalence class,

20
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,890
learn some concept definition
with the three animals.

21
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,590
But that's not the point here, the point
here is not about the learning of

22
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,319
the concept, the point here is much more
about the nature of the concepts and

23
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,152
how they get organized
related to each other
