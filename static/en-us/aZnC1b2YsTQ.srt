00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,150
The friendly chat folder
contains a file called Podfile.

2
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:07,651
This special file is used
by a tool called CocoaPods.

3
00:00:07,652 --> 00:00:12,679
CocoaPods is an iOS dependency
manager or in everyday speak,

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,789
a tool for incorporating code
already written by others so

5
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:18,579
that you don't have to write
everything from scratch.

6
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:21,616
Let's open the Podfile to get
a better picture what CocoaPods does.

7
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,239
We can see that the files comprise
the several pod statements.

8
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:30,097
Each of these pods tells CocoaPods to
download some code from a server and

9
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:32,539
incorporate it into our project.

10
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:37,200
For example, this statement pulls on a
code for a Firebase real-time database.

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,750
In the same way,
other Firebase features are bundled up,

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,549
it can be downloaded as separate parts.

13
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:46,199
When you want to add another Firebase
feature like including ads in your app,

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,280
you want to add the Firebase
ads pod to the pod file so

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,079
that the CocoaPods can do the leg
work of grabbing the code you need.

16
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:56,369
But how do you know what Firebase
pods you might need for your apps?

17
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,960
Here's a list of the current Firebase
pods and what services they provide.

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,719
You can also check out this list
in the link in the resources.

19
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:09,209
If you want to learn more about what
CocoaPods are and why we use them,

20
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:11,358
then check out the video we've
also listed in the resources.

21
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:16,210
Now, if you've never used Cocoapods
before then you'll need to install it

22
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:20,951
first by opening a terminal and
typing sudo gem install cocoapods.

23
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:26,290
If you get an error that looks like
this, don't panic, it's pretty common.

24
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,940
We've included a link for
how to fix it in the resources.

25
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:32,319
And you can always ask on the forums
if you have other problems.

26
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,379
But if it looks like nothing is
happening, then you're good to go.

27
00:01:35,379 --> 00:01:37,379
This means CocoaPods is being installed.

28
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:39,649
Now this can take several minutes, so

29
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:43,180
it might be a good time to go grab one
of those hamburgers off the grill.

30
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,290
Okay, now we have the software we
need in order to use our pod file and

31
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,260
pull in the dependencies for Firebase.

32
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:54,250
It's worth noting again that Cocoapods
is extremely useful because it allows us

33
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,870
to use classes of methods that have
already been written by others.

34
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,510
As you develop more apps
you'll realize that it just

35
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:04,200
doesn't make sense to reinvent
the wheel every step of the way.

36
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,380
There may be third party
libraries in the form of pods that

37
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:08,960
have already done this work.

38
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,540
And you can use CocoaPods
to incorporate them.

39
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:14,060
Let's see how we incorporate
Firebase dependencies.
