1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The effective mass of the rear is obviously way smaller than the mass of the quarter of that car.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Due to its low mass, it is much easier to accelerate than decelerate the wheel

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
than to accelerate or decelerate the car which has a larger mass.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So when we want to study equilibria of the wheel slip that its values which stays constant,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
we can start by thinking about the velocity of the car is a slow variable

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and the velocity of the rim of the wheel is a fast variable.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We have cheated a little and say, okay, let's assume that the velocity of the car is almost constant

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
but assuming that the velocity of the car is almost constant, this idea about the fast changing W

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and the slowly changing V helps us to think about the equilibria of the wheel slip.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
If that wheel slip reaches an equilibrium, its temporal, its rate of change becomes zero.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It does not change anymore. This is the meaning of equilibrium.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
If s doesn't change and V is almost constant,

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
we learned that W must not change, but we have an equation for the rate of change of W.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's the friction force divided by the effective mass of W minus the braking deceleration of the wheel.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
These two expressions have to be equal.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We find approximately this equation for the equilibria of the wheel slip.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
When the wheel slip does not change with time, the friction force

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
divided by the effective mass of the wheel has to be almost equal

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
to the deceleration of the wheel by the brake.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Given this equation, the task is now to determine the number of equilibria,

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
the number of stable equilibria, and the number of unstable equilibra.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
For that, assume that the car is braking slightly below the optimum value

23
00:01:49,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and ignore the case that s, the wheels that equals one, which means perfect locking.
