00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,506
Let's take a look at
the alien adventure app.

2
00:00:02,506 --> 00:00:04,789
You're going to see this
app in different forms, but

3
00:00:04,789 --> 00:00:09,070
the core concept for the app will be the
same every time that you work with it.

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:12,480
You start with their hero robot who
needs some help exploring this strange

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,900
new planet.

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,210
Above the robot,
we see some dialogue, and

7
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,590
if we tap the screen then we can
progress through the conversation.

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,770
So tap the screen, and
our robot starts moving along.

9
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,450
And we've reached our
first alien encounter.

10
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,188
I'm going to be quiet for now, and
I'm going to let you read the dialog.

11
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:46,895
Well, that wasn't so good.

12
00:00:46,895 --> 00:00:49,620
Our robot didn't give
the alien anything.

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,030
But that's where you come in.

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,130
Each time a robot encounters an alien,
a question is going to be asked.

15
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,580
It'll be your job to correct
the code responsible for

16
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,532
making the robot's decision.

17
00:00:59,532 --> 00:01:01,580
I'm going to go ahead and
make a quick fix and

18
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:05,590
see what it might look like if
a robot answers more intelligently.

19
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,700
Okay, let's give this another go.

20
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,450
I'll tap and
I'll let you read the dialog.

21
00:01:49,982 --> 00:01:51,840
Nice, the robot made it through.

22
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,270
Now you probably noticed in this demo,

23
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,610
each alien always asks
the same question.

24
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,655
They were looking for the most valuable
object in the robot's inventory.

25
00:02:00,655 --> 00:02:02,645
That won't always be the case.

26
00:02:02,645 --> 00:02:03,455
As you work on this app,

27
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:07,985
we'll keep introducing new more complex
questions, but I know you can handle it.

28
00:02:07,985 --> 00:02:09,835
The robot's adventure depends on it.
