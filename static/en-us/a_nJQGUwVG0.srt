1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,620
And, well, it's a bit of an opinion here but I would say that--actually for each three of these,

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:11,190
you could say maybe, so if you don't have much time to design and program an algorithm,

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,280
then brute force might be okay under certain conditions.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,140
For example when your instances are small and you have proper time to run the algorithm,

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,620
then brute force might actually be a good idea because it's your time that you invest

6
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,490
into programming a more sophisticated algorithm.

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,600
If it's your time that counts and not computer time, doing brute force

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,369
is sometimes actually a good solution.

9
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,020
Whenever the instances are small, there's two reasons to us brute force.

10
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,520
One is because you can implement it very fast, but the other good reason to us brute force

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:46,720
in these cases here is that because brute force algorithms are so simple they can be programmed

12
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,960
with very little overhead, so what I mean by that is that the constants that are involved

13
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,720
in the O notation are rather small and for small instances, such speedups actually play a role.

14
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,160
For small instances, it could be a good idea to use brute force,

15
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,300
but again even for the small instances, it might not be fast enough.

16
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,850
What you need to solve a problem only once--that might also be a condition where a brute force

17
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,070
could be okay--that might mean that you have a lot of computational time available.

18
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:19,160
Say you need to have this problem solved within the next 3 months or 6 months,

19
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,960
maybe then brute force is kind of fast enough.

20
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,860
Of course, in this case down here, I think that's the most debatable.

21
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,780
You might want to try some of the more sophisticated

22
00:01:26,780 --> 99:59:59,999
techniques that I'm about to show you.
