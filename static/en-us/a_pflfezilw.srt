00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,320
Fortunately, there's a better way. We can make in, make use of

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,250
an already defined mathematical construct called a permutation, that is,

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,990
we can describe the same elements as in English by the following. X has the same

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:19,230
elements as Y if the elements of X are a permutation of the elements of Y. Or,

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,350
the other way around. The elements of Y are permutations of the elements of X.

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,630
Because we know that permutation is well-defined, has well-defined mathematical

7
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:31,070
properties, we don't have to write it out for ourselves. We could just rely on

8
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:35,950
an already existing well-defined concept. Nevertheless, for

9
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:41,680
the, for the purposes of this exercise, let's, let's build up a a specification

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,170
of what it, what it means for one vector to be a permutation of another vector.
