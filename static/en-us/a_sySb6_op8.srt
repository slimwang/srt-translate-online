1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,630
The easiest but
also the slowest method to get and

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,590
render the data we need is AJAX.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:11,140
Not only does it require an extra
HTTP request but the request won't

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:16,079
be fired until after the app's
JavaScript has been downloaded and run.

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,210
On a fast WiFi connection or
even 3G, it's no big deal but

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,160
on 2G or even 3G it could add
a second or more to the app.
