1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Well, the answer we're looking for is: 8.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We just multiply the (3 * 4) first--that's a 12.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And the 8 over 2--that's a 4; we do that first.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We have to do both of those things

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
before we can do the Subtraction

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
because they have higher precedence.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So we end up with: (12 - 4) is 8.
