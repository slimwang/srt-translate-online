00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,554
So far, we've concentrated on the major stimulants, but there is one minor

2
00:00:03,554 --> 00:00:06,830
stimulant that is so addictive that it needs mention, and this is nicotine,

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:13,099
which is the active ingredient in tobacco. Nicotine is a colorless, highly

4
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:18,015
volatile alkaloid liquid. Nicotine activates central nervous system activity

5
00:00:18,015 --> 00:00:23,115
and it stimulates the release of dopamine. Tobacco is the leading preventable

6
00:00:23,115 --> 00:00:27,812
cause of death and disease in the United States and worldwide tobacco use

7
00:00:27,812 --> 00:00:35,230
causes more than 5 million deaths per year. And finally, smokers die on average

8
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:40,794
about ten years earlier than do nonsmokers. Now, this is something very

9
00:00:40,794 --> 00:00:45,741
important to consider if you are a smoker. So we know tobacco use leads to both

10
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:50,880
disease and disability, but let's look at some of those a little more closely.

11
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,678
So tobacco youth leads to cancer, heart disease and stroke. In addition, it

12
00:00:56,678 --> 00:01:01,034
leads to several lung diseases, including emphysema, bronchitis and chronic

13
00:01:01,034 --> 00:01:06,884
airway obstruction. In addition, for every one death caused by tobacco, 20 more

14
00:01:06,884 --> 00:01:12,440
people suffer with at least one serious illness from smoking.
