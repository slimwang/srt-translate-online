1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Sindbad certainly can't catch a break,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
but perhaps we can catch or notice errors in Python programs.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
If we are very wary and think that an error might happen,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
we can use the Python keywords try and except to guard critical code.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This code is guarded.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And if an error happens in here instead of aborting Python execution,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
it will go down to this except block and start executing there.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This except block only runs if the guarded block has an error.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So this code will print out "hello"

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and then we've seen before that when we try to do integer division by 0

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
that doesn't make much sense, so we'll jump down here and print out "didn't work"

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and then print out problem, which was our particular exception.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And if you haven't run into it before, exception is just a special computer science keyword

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
meaning an error in a program.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It derives from exceptional situation and can refer to either something like

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
you're out of space on your disk or memory card

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
or a problem in your program like you're trying to divide by 0.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
However, it's also entirely possible to raise exceptions on our own.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So here in this Python code fragment we're printing out "joseph heller"

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
but in the middle we raise this exception with the value 22.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And then down here we catch that exception, calling it the variable problem,

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and then we print out, oh, it "didn't work: we caught" problem,

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and this will end up printing out "joseph".

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We'll raise the exception,

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
so we'll never actually print out "heller".

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We will print out it "didn't work: we caught" 22.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And Catch-22 is a satirical novel by Joseph Heller. It's a bit absurd.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The phrase "catch-22" has actually entered the popular English lexicon,

29
00:01:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
meaning, approximately, "no win situation."
