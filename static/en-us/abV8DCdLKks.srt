00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,510
Here's the dolphin image we've seen before.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,980
Let's say our interest point detector found this tip of the fin to

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,100
be a possible keypoint.

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,470
We zoom in on a five cross five neighborhood around the keypoint.

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,090
Now recall how you computed image gradients.

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,950
Say using a three cross, three filter.

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,910
When we place it over this pixel, what is the dominant orientation you see?

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,630
Right. It's along the diagonal going towards the top left.

9
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,920
Let's use this approach to mark image gradient directions for other pixels.

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,680
To avoid edge conditions,

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,130
we only consider locations where the filter fits inside the image patch.

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,950
Also, we approximate or

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,460
quantize to eight directions for it to go horizontal and diagonals.

14
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:49,060
Can you figure out the dominant orientation of this patch using the image

15
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,900
gradient directions?

00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,580
