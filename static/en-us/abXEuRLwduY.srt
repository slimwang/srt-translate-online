1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,150
The first app I ever made was for
a bar crawl, for

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,780
a birthday party with a friend.

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,200
It was 2009, it was still just
really cool to see your own name in

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:09,840
a smart phone.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,760
So it had a little picker view inside
it, when you shook the phone the picker

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,530
view would cycle through everybody who
was there and kind of randomly stop.

7
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,926
And I put a little button int he corner,
so

8
00:00:19,926 --> 00:00:23,920
that you could put your
thumb over it and shake it,

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,380
if you're holding it right then it
will come up with the birthday boy.

10
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,402
Whoever's name came up had to drink,
so in the end we could set em up,

11
00:00:31,402 --> 00:00:32,100
it was good fun.

12
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:37,170
>> The first app I ever built,
well I actually started before there

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,850
was an SDK, so in 2007 when
the iPhone came out there was

14
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:45,110
a pretty good jail break community, and
we were sort of swizzling all the API's.

15
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:50,720
And I had been an audio developer on
OS10 for years, so I ported one of my

16
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,090
commercial apps to iOS and it was
just super exciting because this was

17
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:58,150
basically a full desktop operating
system on a mobile device.

18
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,380
So the first app was called Idrum,
and we actually did 23 of them

19
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,330
with different music artists, and
what not and it was really exciting.

20
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:08,180
We had two of them available
the day the app store opened,

21
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,920
because we had a pretty
good running start so.

22
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,690
>> The first app that I built
was called ATOM and it stood for

23
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:17,400
the Alpha Tau Omega Mobile application
I built for my fraternity in college,

24
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,440
and as fraternity brothers we were
looking for a way to communicate and

25
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,560
broadcast messages privately in
a way that was kind of like Twitter.

26
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,390
So that's what we did instead of carrier
pigeon, or email or anything like that.

27
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,330
We used this atom map to communicate.
