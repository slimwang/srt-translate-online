1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:06,100
The right answer is no, and since this might seem a bit counterintuitive

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:11,230
given this huge range of the hardware continuum, let's reason

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:16,190
it out. Basically, the hardware inside a computer

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:21,110
system consists of the processor, memory. And

5
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:26,550
implode the devices. And the organization of these hardware elements

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,480
within the computer system, whether we are talking about

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,570
smart phone or cloud, is not going to change tremendously.
