00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,400
So, when I need to get creative and
I'm feeling like I'm out of ideas,

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:10,190
a lot of times I'll look at other media,
like video games, or

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:15,840
movies, or television shows,
or just go for a walk.

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,560
Because a lot of times,
staring at Xcode,

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,220
and trying to get creative
is the exact wrong approach.

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,350
>> When I'm trying to get
creative in building an app,

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,460
I usually look to others
instead of myself.

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,250
So, I'll ask my twin brother or
my friends or family and just figure out

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,260
what problems they're going through and
figure out if there's a cool,

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,930
mobile way that we could solve them, and
then start building an app from there.

11
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,740
>> Having a problem to solve helps
me get in a creative mindset.

12
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:47,370
Because sort of defining
the problem gives me sort of

13
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,640
the space that I'm working within.

14
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,650
Chances are I know how that problem
has been solved previously and

15
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,860
I'm unhappy with those results.

16
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,780
So I have that, that gives me
the components that I'm working with,

17
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,152
the components that I want to change.
