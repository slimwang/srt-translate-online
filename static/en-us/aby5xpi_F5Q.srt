00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,620
Let's look at the solution to
our address translation quiz.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:08,880
We have a 16 bit virtual address
space and a four entry page table,

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,910
that means that the most significant two
bits of the 16 bit address are the page

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:19,630
number, the remaining 14 bits
are going to be the page offset.

5
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,450
So this 16 bit address can be
written like this in binary.

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,440
F0F0.
The most significant two bits are really

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,300
the page number, which corresponds
to this entry in the page table,

8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,360
because this is three, so we need to
look at this entry in the page table.

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,180
In this particular address we have 001F.

10
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,750
These two bits correspond to
this entry in the page table.

11
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,280
So now we can write out the physical

12
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,090
address that corresponds
to this virtual address.

13
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,040
It is going to contain
the frame number from

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,730
entry number three in the page table.

15
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,130
Which is going to be 1 7.

16
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:08,040
Concatenated with the page offset
which is going to be 1 1 etc.

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:14,742
And we can know write it
out it's going to be 0F0F0.

18
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:19,387
And then we have F and this is five.

19
00:01:19,387 --> 00:01:24,290
It's a 20 bit address so
it will have five hex digits.

20
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:28,280
Similarly here we are looking
at entry number zero here, so

21
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,310
it's going to be 1F,
followed by the page offset.

22
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,785
So it's going to have 00 and

23
00:01:36,785 --> 00:01:42,988
then the remaining digits
are going to be the same.

24
00:01:42,988 --> 00:01:48,350
So it's going to have F10 and then C7.

25
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:52,110
C because it's 1100 and
7 because it's 0111.

26
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:57,130
So this is the physical address for
this particular virtual address.
