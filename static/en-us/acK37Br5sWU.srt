00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,820
The specific objectives of
this lesson are for you for

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,830
to learn about,
the Geometry of the scene.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,500
Remember we talked about, that one of
the interesting things we want to do

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,720
with capturing images and photographs is
to capture the geometry of the scene,

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,910
that is the relative distance
of objects in the scene.

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,630
Here we're going to start getting into
that kind of geometry and look at depth.

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,410
That is how far away are pixels that
are visible in the image or photograph.

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,070
And also structure rela,
a lot of information of that scene.

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,450
Going to look at specifically
the concept of stereo.

10
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,720
That is how to do this from
two different viewpoints.

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,650
By introducing the concept of
the Parallax that could actually help us

12
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:41,070
look at the whole concept of how we're
going to extract depth from images.

13
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,310
And then, talk about specifically,

14
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:47,340
how can we compute depth
from a stereo image pair?

15
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,070
So let's get started.
