1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:08,628
The number was 3, 9, 2, 7, 1, 5, 4. So when I asked you to remember the

2
00:00:08,628 --> 00:00:12,608
numbers, you probably began rehearsing them in your head. But was it harder to

3
00:00:12,608 --> 00:00:16,560
remember the number correctly when I started saying other numbers? Often times

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,005
that little distracter, just hearing the other numbers, will interfere with

5
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:24,862
your rehearsal of this number. So in order for the mateiral being this number

6
00:00:24,862 --> 00:00:28,102
to be retained, we need to somehow get the information into our long term

7
00:00:28,102 --> 00:00:29,829
memory.
