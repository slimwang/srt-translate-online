1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,520
Let's start with an observation.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:07,310
1 going to 6 occupies this path,
whereas 7 going to 4 occupies this path.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:11,620
Now the two paths overlap, but
they're going in opposite directions.

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,170
So by rule number 2, which is
the existence of bidirectional links,

5
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:18,090
these messages can be
carried at the same time.

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,250
So you should have written
something like a + b x n.
