00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,570
We spend a lot of time looking at
the basic theory of prototyping.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,740
You know enough by now to know that
these things are only useful if you

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:07,840
actually build them.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:08,680
So let's get started on that.

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,750
The fundamental idea behind prototypes
is that your making the fastest

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,460
version of a thing that can get
you the information you need

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,160
from the people you need it from.

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,400
To that end, it's useful to think about
what the fastest possible prototyping

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,350
method would be,
since that's what you'll want for

10
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,350
your first two prototypes.

11
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,200
We'll be showing you two options,
either of which work for your own app or

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:29,950
our example app.

13
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,160
Behind this curtain is your best friend,
the tool that will allow you to

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,580
prototype and
pivot faster than any other tool.

15
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,080
Get ready.

16
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:40,560
Yeah, look at that.

17
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,400
Sketching your prototypes
simply on paper is the single

18
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,590
best way to work on prototypes when
you're starting a project from scratch,

19
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,890
and it allows you to
change course very easily.

20
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,520
You can redo parts of your designs
during user testing in order to

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,770
clarify things that are being
called out as confusing.

22
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,800
These paper prototypes are going
to be super low fidelity but

23
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,170
they will give you enough of an idea of
your app that their feedback will tell

24
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:04,400
you if you're going in
the right direction.

25
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,190
There's one other method of
fast prototyping that's behind

26
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,530
this other curtain.

27
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,198
Prepare to be amazed.

28
00:01:11,198 --> 00:01:13,274
[SOUND] Yeah.

29
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:14,597
That's a printer.

30
00:01:14,597 --> 00:01:17,109
When you've gone through the work
of making mocks for an app,

31
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:20,380
you can build a simple paper prototype
by printing out these mocks.

32
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,440
If you have mocks from
the product design course,

33
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,430
this rap could be for you.

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,620
Both methods will work for us here, and

35
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,940
they will both lead to
great user feedback.
