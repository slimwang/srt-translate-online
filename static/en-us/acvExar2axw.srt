1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,660
I'm going to use Flexbox to create
this layout, and then I'm going to

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,960
give you a design mock that I want
you to provide the styles for.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,840
I've got my markup for the HTML here.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,329
The first thing I need to do is set
up Flexbox on my container element.

5
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:18,178
I need to add display flex.

6
00:00:18,178 --> 00:00:20,820
And flex-wrap, wrap.

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,450
Looking at my layout I can see
that some things are out of order.

8
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:30,090
For example this dark blue box,
is not in the same place down here.

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,130
And I want to make sure they are.

10
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:31,750
Are.

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,110
So in addition to setting
the width of each element,

12
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,710
I need to remember to set the order.

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,420
To make things a bit easier for

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,620
myself, I've added the styles in
the order that the elements appear.

15
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,550
The header element is the first element,
and it spans the whole width.

16
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:52,290
So I'll set the width to 100 and
order to one.

17
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,490
Red and orange are next.

18
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:58,010
Each looks to be about 50%
of the view point width.

19
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:04,150
So I'll set width equals 50% and
order to two and three respectively.

20
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:10,360
In this design, the footer is next at
100% width, and order equals four.

21
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,750
The next line is light blue,
dark blue, and green.

22
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,870
Light blue and green,
each looks like they are about 20% wide.

23
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,090
Dark blue looks like
it's about 60% wide.

24
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,080
So, I'll set order to five, six, and

25
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,580
seven on each of those
elements respectively.

26
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,600
Let's compare this to our sample.

27
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,440
Looks about right to me.

28
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,120
Let's see how you do.
