Let's try another tricky question.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,210
Let's imagine you have a directory tree
like this, and you start here in your

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,700
home directory, which is also
your current working directory.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,517
Let's then say you also run
this series of commands,

5
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:20,033
cd.., cd, cd www, cd stuff, and cd ..

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,800
After running those commands what
directory do you wind up in?

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,480
What's your new current
working directory?

8
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,300
Enter the full path here in the box.
