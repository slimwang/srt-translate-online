1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Well, unlike the previous example,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
this is a little bit harder to see.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Certainly it's not the case that there's

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
nice white space in between separating them.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It seems to be a little tangled up,

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
but we can figure out the number of components,

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and one way to do it is we can just start systematically

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
seeing what's connected to what.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So starting from this node here,

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
we can see this node can reach this one,

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and this one,

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
well, and itself,

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and did we miss any?

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yeah, this node, which is part of that set--

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
call that the purple group, group A--

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
can also reach this node.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
But notice that's as far as it goes.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
All the purple nodes are connected to other purple nodes

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
but not to the nonpurple nodes, and in fact,

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
you can see that the nonpurple nodes can all speak to each other.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So in fact, there's two separate,

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
disconnected components in this example.
