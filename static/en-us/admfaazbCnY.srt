One common measure of affect size, when comparing means, is Cohen's d. Named

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,300
after the statistition Jacob Cohen. Cohen's d is a standardized mean difference

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,562
that measures the distance between 2 means in standard deviation units. In

4
00:00:15,562 --> 00:00:19,559
other words, instead of dividing by standard error. We simply divide by the

5
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:23,918
standard deviation of the sample. We can think of it like this, we have our

6
00:00:23,918 --> 00:00:29,551
sample, let's just say it's normally distributed. And here's the sample mean,

7
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:33,966
and the standard deviation of our sample is S. Now let's say we have some

8
00:00:33,966 --> 00:00:41,630
population mean out here. How many S's fit between x-bar and the mean? The

9
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,780
larger Cohen's d is, the further x-bar is from mu-not, in terms of the sample

10
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:50,353
standard deviation. So, go ahead and calculate Cohen's d for this example.
