00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,390
So today, we've been talking about learning by correcting mistakes.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,840
We started off by revisiting explanation based learning and

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,230
incremental concept learning, in those lessons we were dealing with a small

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:13,400
number of examples coming in one by one. We dealt with the same thing here, but

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,450
here we had the additional feedback about whether or not our initial conclusion

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:20,230
was right or wrong. We then talk about isolating mistakes. This was similar to

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,580
our problem diagnosis. Given a mistake how do we narrow down our reasoning to

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:28,380
find where that mistake occurred. Then we talked about explain the mistake.

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,200
This is key both to building human like agents and to enabling the agent to

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,810
correct its mistake. Only by explaining the mistake can the agent correct it

11
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,220
efficiently. And after those phases correction becomes a much more

12
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,370
straightforward task. Next time we'll talk about meta-reasoning in more detail.

13
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,270
For example here we've discussed mistakes in knowledge but what about mistakes

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,620
in reasoning? What about mistakes in architecture? What about gaps instead of

15
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,650
mistakes where we don't know something instead of knowing something incorrectly?

16
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:52,840
We'll talk about all that next time.
