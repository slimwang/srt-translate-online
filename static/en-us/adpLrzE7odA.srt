1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:04,090
So the answer is, it's a little bit of both.

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:08,480
It is a random process in the sense that we're modeling intertweet time as

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,970
a random variable and we're taking draws from that variable.

4
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,320
Now, if it was totally random,

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,240
we wouldn't be able to do any better than modeling it as an exponential process.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,380
But of course, as we have just found out,

7
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,610
there are clearly features that are influencing this process.

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:31,150
Specifically, length of a tweet and mention distance.

9
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:35,370
How long it's been since this person has been mentioned by one of

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,330
his close friends.

11
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,890
So it's not as totally deterministic as a functional mapping.

12
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,970
But then on the other hand it's not just complete randomness.

13
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:49,390
But if I have to chose one or the other, yes is the best answer.
