00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,010
Now I'd like you to find the point
in the starter notebook marked 7,

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:06,820
and create a list of rows that
includes only some of the records from

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,830
the engagement table.

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,918
Specifically, you should include rows
where the student is one of the paid

5
00:00:11,918 --> 00:00:13,780
students you just found, and

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,000
the date is within one week
of the student's join date.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,730
Give your new list the variable
name paid_engagement_in_first_week.

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,600
I've created this function you
can use to determine if one date

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,620
is within one week of another.

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,700
Take a look at the number of engagement
records that are present in your new

11
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,610
list and enter your number in
the box on the next screen.
