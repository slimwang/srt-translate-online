1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,120
So we'll definitely see an image
display next to each word for

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,939
three of our categories.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:09,670
And remember the phrases
activity won't have any images.

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,692
So when we zoom in to
one category activity,

5
00:00:11,692 --> 00:00:14,800
here are the changes
that we'll need to make.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,960
So the list view would need to
show an image in each list item.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,050
So we need to modify the layout.

8
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,470
Now remember that the phrases activity
won't show images in the list view.

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,380
So we'll leave that as an edge case and
discuss in more detail later.

10
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,230
So we'll also need to add images to the
app, so that they can be referenced by

11
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,150
the WordAdapter when need to
set up each list item view.

12
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,760
Next, we should also
change the type of data

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,170
that is stored in the list of Words.

14
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,070
So we need to modify each word
to be associated with an image.

15
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,110
And as a result,
we need to modify the instructions

16
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:54,340
in the WordAdapter on how
a list item is to be created.

17
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,940
So not only do we have to set the proper
English and Miwok words in the list item

18
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:04,519
text views, we also have to set
the correct image in the ImageView.

19
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:10,250
So all these changes in the list view
and adapter will make it possible for

20
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,640
the different activities to
show images for each word.

21
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,040
And as mentioned earlier, we'll worry
about how to make the phrases activity

22
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,760
not show images later on.
