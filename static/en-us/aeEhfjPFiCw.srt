1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,230
Another type of conclusion you
might want to be able to draw,

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,480
is to say that if you change one thing,
another thing is likely to change also.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,510
For example, you saw that students
who passed the first project

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,430
are more likely to visit the classroom
multiple times in their first week.

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,250
This is a correlation.

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,360
Passing the first project is
correlated with visiting the classroom

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,130
multiple times.

8
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,870
Does this mean that visiting the
classroom multiple times in the first

9
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,030
week causes the students
to pass their project?

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,646
This would be a statement of causation.

11
00:00:29,646 --> 00:00:33,020
For example, suppose Udacity sent emails
to students during their first week

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,700
reminding them to come back.

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,710
This caused more students
to visit multiple times.

14
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,400
Would you expect this to increase
the number of students who complete

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,810
their project?

16
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:45,870
It certainly sounds plausible, but
we can't be sure based on this data.

17
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,165
To see why,
let's take a look at this graph,

18
00:00:48,165 --> 00:00:50,845
which shows per capita
cheese consumption in red.

19
00:00:50,845 --> 00:00:51,725
And the number of people

20
00:00:51,725 --> 00:00:55,075
who died by becoming tangled
in their bedsheets in black.

21
00:00:55,075 --> 00:00:57,905
As you can see, these two
variables are highly correlated.

22
00:00:57,905 --> 00:01:01,190
As one increases,
the other tends to increase as well.

23
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,140
However, do you think eating
cheese causes people to become

24
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,720
tangled in their bedsheets?

25
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,260
Probably not.

26
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,630
This could be a coincidence or there
could be some third factor causing both.

27
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:14,620
In this case, it looks like
both cheese consumption and

28
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,740
bed sheet tangling
are increasing over time.

29
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,420
If this is the case,
then if you banned cheese,

30
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,050
bedsheet tangling would probably
continue to increase overtime.

31
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,180
So what are some third factors that
could be causing the correlation

32
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,750
between visiting the classroom and
passing projects?

33
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,240
One that I thought of
is level of interest.

34
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,670
Maybe people who don't find the data
analysis courses very interesting,

35
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,490
don't visit the site many times.

36
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,130
And then they also don't pass the
project because they're not interested

37
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:41,750
in working on it.

38
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,120
If you somehow convinced these students
to visit the site more, their lack of

39
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,030
interest might still prevent them
from working on the project.

40
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,200
A better approach might be for

41
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,320
the student to try learning something
else that they find more interesting.

42
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,930
Another factor might be
background knowledge.

43
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:58,760
Maybe some people don't have the
programming knowledge they need to take

44
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,420
the data analysis courses and
they get stuck and don't come back.

45
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,340
If you convince these
students to come back and

46
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:09,000
keep trying, they might remain stuck and
not be able to make forward progress.

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,150
In this case, a better solution might be
taking a programming course to fill in

48
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,260
the missing background knowledge.

49
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,340
On the other hand, this correlation
could be because of causation.

50
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,950
And I actually find that
explanation pretty plausible.

51
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,450
But the point is that we don't
know based on the data we have.

52
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:28,420
To find out whether one change causes
another, you need to run an experiment,

53
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,940
and online experiments
are frequently costed A/B tests.

54
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,340
To learn more about how to
set these experiments up and

55
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,630
some common gotchas that can arise check
out Udacity's course on A/B testing

56
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,690
linked in the instructor's notes.
