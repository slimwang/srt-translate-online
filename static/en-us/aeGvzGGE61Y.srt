1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,050
Now Sunshine is dependent on the open
weather map service for its weather

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:08,029
data, and we don't have control over
how we communicate with their servers.

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,020
And I already said that I wasn't going
to teach you about servers today.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,720
But I will teach you about GCM,
and to do that,

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm going to fake a few
severe weather alerts.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,540
In the United States, the National
Weather Service issues severe weather

7
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,070
alerts when a hurricane, tornado,
tropical storm, blizzard or

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,050
a similarly severe weather
pattern is likely in an area.

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,350
This weather does not happen
daily in most places.

10
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,150
I'm looking at you, tornado alley.

11
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:36,270
But when it does happen, it's vital
that your users be aware of the danger.

12
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,980
And that means that these would
be time-sensitive alerts and

13
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,230
not nice-to-know facts tomorrow morning.

14
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,180
So let's dive in.

15
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,860
So normally we would have a shiny server
that subscribes to weather alerts.

16
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,070
So then when a new alert happens,
the server will see it first.

17
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:56,150
Then it can take that alert and
use it to make a push notification.

18
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:00,225
And then it can send that
notification to each affected device.

19
00:01:00,225 --> 00:01:03,785
In this case, devices that are in the
region that we're concerned about for

20
00:01:03,785 --> 00:01:04,495
the weather alert.

21
00:01:05,495 --> 00:01:06,235
But, of course,

22
00:01:06,235 --> 00:01:09,755
before we begin you need to take
a trip to the Google API console.
