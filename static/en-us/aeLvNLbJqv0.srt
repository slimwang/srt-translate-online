1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What I'd like to do next is describe a different algorithm

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
that I learned under the name "Russian Peasant's Algorithm."

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
If you'd like to learn more about it, you can go to the Wikipedia page

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
called "Ancient Egyptian Multiplication."

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This is an algorithm that people actually implemented by hand before there were computers.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Here's the Russian Peasants Algorithm in Python.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You can see it follows pretty closely along with the naive algorithm that I described before.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It starts off assigning a and b to x and y.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It starts off z as an accumulator set to 0.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's going to repeat while x is bigger than 0 a bunch of steps

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
that involve accumulating values in z and making x smaller.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What makes this algorithm work really well is when doubling

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and halving numbers is really easy to do.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
If you're not familiar with this syntax, this is saying take whatever the binary representation

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
of y is and shift it over 1 to the left.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This is saying take whatever the binary representation of x is and shift it over to the right.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Let's do a little quiz to see if you know what that would do.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
A straightforward question--what is 17>>1 in Python?

19
00:01:01,000 --> 99:59:59,999
171, 9, 8, 8.5, or 34?
