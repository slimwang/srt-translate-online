1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,550
So let's continue to build on the corner detection mathematics.

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:05,490
We looked at this M matrix.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,460
Of course, we now put this M matrix in our E u,v term and

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,000
expand it out and we come up with this nice quadratic form here.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,770
So, basically, the surface UV is a locally approximated by

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,430
a quadratic form here with a window here.

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,360
Let's look at this car, equation a little bit more carefully.

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,280
So as I said, this surface is locally approximated by a quadratic form, and

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,120
have just shown you, am showing you here, the surface.

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,850
Now, this quadratic here is basically a slice through this surface,

11
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,040
which is basically this equation.

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,500
And this equation is that of an ellipse.

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,910
And you can notice this ellipse is right here.

14
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,940
So this ellipse are these ellipses here, and

15
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,840
these are the slices to the surface.

16
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,200
Drawing them here, it's hard to see them because they get complicated.

17
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,870
But you'll notice each one of them, these slices, is an ellipse.

18
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,570
So basically now we can actually look at each one of

19
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,930
these slices as a single ellipse.

20
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:08,620
So again, this is my equation of the ellipse and in the surface and

21
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,740
these lines here on my ellipses.

22
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,750
Let's draw one ellipse out to just kind of see what we can measure out of this.

23
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:19,271
Remember where we were looking at, at any point the directions of changes at any

24
00:01:19,271 --> 00:01:23,589
point and this direction and the magnitude of these change that will allow us

25
00:01:23,589 --> 00:01:27,300
to kind of quantify at any point the strength of this feature that I

26
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,420
can actually use as a repeatable measure across two images.

27
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,180
Right? So, this is my center.

28
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,830
In this direction there is a change going on, from here to there.

29
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,090
It's a rather fast change.

30
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,250
I mean, the same magnitude is covered in over a short distance.

31
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,690
So in essence, we can start labeling this as maximum change.

32
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,669
So direction of fastest change is this direction in this ellipse.

33
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,550
And another one would be in this axis.

34
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:57,120
And we can refer to this as lambda min.

35
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,160
And this is direction of the slowest change.

36
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,610
Now, this is a very standard linear algebra trick.

37
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,810
Where basically when we have surfaces like this, and we have ellipses.

38
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:11,380
We can actually now compute the lambdas and also the orientation.

39
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,200
Notice again that while these are the values of lambdas,

40
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,420
this ellipse is rotated by certain angle from the original image at this point.

41
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:27,308
So, this is where we refer back to eigenvalue analysis where axis lengths,

42
00:02:27,308 --> 00:02:30,350
the lambda values, are eigenvalues.

43
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:34,229
And the orientation is basically when you take these two vectors and

44
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:36,678
compare them to the normal axis or

45
00:02:36,678 --> 00:02:40,830
frame of reference you know actually the angles of these two vectors.

46
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:45,290
So this allows us to now start quantifying the direction and

47
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,530
the quantity of change that goes on at any feature point in an image.

48
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,680
Help us simplify this,

49
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,820
now let's actually still continue to come up with newer ways.

50
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,130
Remember, we did come up with an M matrix here.

51
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:00,220
We can actually still go back and compute the M matrix this way.

52
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,459
This was the quadratic form we had looked at before.

53
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:09,340
And M here is a diagonal matrix which basically has nothing else but

54
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:17,020
R here and the two diagonals are the two eigenvalues, lambda1 and lambda2.

55
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,720
Let's talk about Rs in a bit because these are all methods we've come up

56
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,350
with to help us make an efficient set of calculations to

57
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,570
compute what we are interested in.
