1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,180
So these hooks, this four step process,

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:08,010
starts with a trigger to an action,
then a reward, and then an investment.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,540
So every hook starts with a trigger.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,610
A trigger prompts the habit, and
we have these two types of triggers,

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,650
an external trigger or
an internal trigger.

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,510
External triggers are things in
our environment that tell us

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,200
what to do next.

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,310
They give us some piece of information,
click here, buy now,

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,890
a friend telling you about this
great new app through word of mouth.

10
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,080
All example of external triggers.

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,200
These external triggers
prompt us to action.

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,689
That's the habit itself.

13
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:36,530
Opening an app, scroll through
Pinterest, search on Google,

14
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,530
push the play button on YouTube.

15
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,960
These are these actions that we do
with little to no conscious thought,

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,180
that are these very simple behaviors,

17
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,480
these very small behaviors
that we do seeking a reward.

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,770
Which brings me to the third step
of the hook, the reward phase

19
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:55,060
is where the user's itch is scratched
where they get what they came for,

20
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,430
and yet there is a bit of mystery
around what they might find

21
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,662
next time they engage with the product.

22
00:01:00,662 --> 00:01:03,960
So it's not just a reward, it turns
out that habit forming technologies

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,370
integrate what's called
a variable reward.

24
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,390
So this comes from the classic
work of BF Skinner,

25
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,340
the father of operant conditioning.

26
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,200
Skinner found that when he gave rewards
to his pigeons in these little boxes,

27
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,900
on a variable basis, so sometimes
the pigeons would peck at the disk,

28
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,080
they wouldn't receive a reward, the next
time they would receive a reward.

29
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,620
What Skinner observed was
that the rate of response,

30
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:28,300
the number of times these pigeons pecked
at the disk increased when the reward

31
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,560
was given on an intermittent
new schedule of reinforcement.

32
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,570
And so in all sorts of products
that we find most habit forming,

33
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:38,230
most engaging, we find this bit of
mystery, this bit of variability.

34
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:43,340
So searching and scrolling and
scrolling on a news feed, or

35
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,660
what makes sports fun to watch
is the uncertainty of will our

36
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,190
team win the game, or what makes for
a great TV show or movie?

37
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:55,010
Right, the uncertainty about how
the happy ending is going to unwind.

38
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,990
All of these are examples
of variable rewards.

39
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,540
And finally, the investment phase,
the last step of the hook.

40
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,150
The investment phase is where the user
is prompted to put something into

41
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:12,060
the product to invest in the product
in anticipation of a future benefit.

42
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,740
So the purpose of investments is to
increase the likelihood of the next

43
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,890
pass, that's what the investment phase
is for, and it does this in two ways.

44
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,671
The investments load the next trigger.

45
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:25,856
So loading the next trigger, an example
of that would be, when I send someone

46
00:02:25,856 --> 00:02:28,699
a message on WhatsApp, I don't
get any immediate rewards, right?

47
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:32,419
There's no leader boards,
there's no badges, there's no points,

48
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,090
nothing really happens.

49
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,640
What I'm doing is I'm loading the next
trigger because I'm likely to get

50
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,180
a reply, and that reply comes coupled
with an external trigger, hey here's

51
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,410
a message from your friend, which
prompts me to use the hook once again.

52
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,430
The second way that investments increase
the likelihood of the next pass

53
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,100
is by storing value,
and this is a big deal.

54
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,440
Storing value is when the product
gets better and better with use.

55
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,170
It appreciates in value,

56
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,895
and it does this by storing data,
followers, reputation, content.

57
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:03,490
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Right,

58
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:08,340
anything that I'm putting into the app
that gets better and better over time.

59
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,179
And so it's through successive
cycles through these hooks,

60
00:03:11,179 --> 00:03:12,544
trigger, action, reward,

61
00:03:12,544 --> 00:03:16,268
investment, that now an association is
built with that second type of trigger.

62
00:03:16,268 --> 00:03:19,074
Remember, I told you there was two types
of triggers, external triggers and

63
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,250
internal triggers.

64
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,830
The internal trigger are these
things in our life that prompt us

65
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:28,640
to action like a place, a situation,
a routine, a certain person, and

66
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,540
most frequently emotions that prompt us
to do this next action, this next habit,

67
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,400
with little or no conscious thought,
but without any explicit information.

68
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,490
So over time, through successive
cycles through these hooks,

69
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:45,300
now we use the product,
not with a message that tells us, hey,

70
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,360
click here, but with a need, exactly.

71
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,940
We internally trigger ourselves,
we have these associations.

72
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,420
So I'm lonely, I check Facebook.

73
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,170
I'm uncertain, I Google.

74
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:59,210
I'm bored and I'm on YouTube, or
Reddit, or checking stock prices, or

75
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,160
sports scores, right?

76
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,640
We do these things instantaneously
because of these successive cycles

77
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,380
through these hooks.
