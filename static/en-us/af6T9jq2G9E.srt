1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,050
Labels should be prominent and

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:06,260
visible when a user is filling
out their associated inputs.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:11,660
When writing HTML, use the label
element as a container for your inputs.

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,500
Associated inputs get
nested inside labels.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,910
You could use the four attributes
to link inputs and labels.

6
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,040
Either way works fine, but

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:27,890
I like to nest because it simplify
my HTML and makes it more semantic.

8
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,440
As an important bonus,

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,900
applying labels to our form elements
helps to improve the touch target size.

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,180
The user can touch either the label or
the input in order

11
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,500
to place the focus on the input element,
like I'm doing right now.

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,010
And you could see here that
we're using the four attributes.

13
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,410
Okay, enough of me talking.

14
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,570
I want you to try one
out in the next quiz.
