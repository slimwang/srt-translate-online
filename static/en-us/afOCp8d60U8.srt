1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,840
We'll generate our key pair on our
local machine, not on our server.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,090
Remember, you never, ever want to share
your private key with anyone else.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,160
It should remain firmly in
your possession at all times.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,550
For this reason,
you always generate key pairs locally.

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,430
If you were to generate
the key pair on the server,

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,470
you cannot claim that the private
key has always been private.

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,870
We'll generate our key pair using
an application called ssh-keygen.

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,010
You will first be asked to give
a file name for the key pair.

9
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:34,370
I've given this one the name
users/udacity/.ssh/linuxcourse.

10
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,800
This directory here is the default
directory that key pairs should exist

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,000
in, so
I advise you to keep that the same.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,290
But you can name it what you'd like.

13
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,240
We'll then add a pass
phrase to our key pair,

14
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,470
just in case someone does
happen to get these files.

15
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:52,100
This pass phrase will prevent
them from actually using them.

16
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,847
Once done, you'll see that
ssh-keygen has generated two files,

17
00:00:56,847 --> 00:00:59,533
linuxCourse and linuxCourse.pub.

18
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:02,290
This file, linuxCourse.pub,

19
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,920
is what we'll place on our server
to enable key based authentication.
