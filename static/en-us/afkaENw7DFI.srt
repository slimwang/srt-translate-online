1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,150
We need to make this program read data from a file and compute the largest one.

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:09,105
We make a file object for the file with name input.text. With that file object

3
00:00:09,105 --> 00:00:12,800
we construct a scanner. And now the rest is exactly like what we had before,

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,192
because reading from a scanner that is attached to a file Is no different than

5
00:00:16,192 --> 00:00:22,085
using a scanner that's attached to the console. So here, here, and here we call

6
00:00:22,085 --> 00:00:27,898
next double, and has next double in the usual way. When you run this program,

7
00:00:27,898 --> 00:00:33,770
it'll tell you that it found, as its largest value, a value that is very large.

8
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,186
Let's have a peek at the input file. That file has a lot of numbers in it that

9
00:00:37,186 --> 00:00:40,966
seem kind of meaningless. You'll see in the next exercise with Sara where they

10
00:00:40,966 --> 00:00:41,830
come from.
