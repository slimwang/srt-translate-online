Hi.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,216
>> Hi.
>> I'm Gabrielle.

3
00:00:03,216 --> 00:00:03,762
>> Edith.

4
00:00:03,762 --> 00:00:04,319
>> So good to meet you.

5
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:05,899
You just talked to Jessica, right?

6
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:07,535
>> Yeah, we had a great conversation.

7
00:00:07,535 --> 00:00:09,137
I was just showing her
a prototype of my app.

8
00:00:09,137 --> 00:00:10,278
>> Excellent.

9
00:00:10,278 --> 00:00:12,026
I totally want to check that out later,

10
00:00:12,026 --> 00:00:15,316
but I want to start off with a few
technical questions about Objective C.

11
00:00:15,316 --> 00:00:16,079
We can get those out of the way.

12
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,298
>> Sounds good.

13
00:00:17,298 --> 00:00:20,574
>> Can you give me an example of
when you would use NSArray and

14
00:00:20,574 --> 00:00:22,697
when you would use NSMutableArray?

15
00:00:22,697 --> 00:00:24,613
>> Help me out.

16
00:00:24,613 --> 00:00:26,215
How do I answer this?
