00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,106
Now remember what we are originally trying to find. We're trying to find where

2
00:00:05,106 --> 00:00:10,580
on the distribution of sample means a particular sample will lie. Not just for a

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:15,494
simple population like this one, but for a huge population. And now we can do

4
00:00:15,494 --> 00:00:20,876
that. Because now we know that the distribution of means, where every mean is

5
00:00:20,876 --> 00:00:26,710
the mean of a sample of size n. This distribution has a standard deviation equal

6
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:31,988
to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of n. This is

7
00:00:31,988 --> 00:00:36,815
called the central limit theorem. And it not only holds true for these simple

8
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:42,775
populations but for any population. Because of the central limit theorem, we can

9
00:00:42,775 --> 00:00:47,284
have a population of any shape. And then let's say we draw a sample from it and

10
00:00:47,284 --> 00:00:51,252
calculate the mean, and then we draw another sample from it and calculate the

11
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:57,878
mean. And we keep doing this, say a 100 times. Assuming the sample size is large

12
00:00:57,878 --> 00:01:02,438
enough, if we plot the distribution of means, we're going to get something

13
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:07,435
that's relatively normal. With a standard deviation equal to the population

14
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:12,901
standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. And we've been

15
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:18,650
calling it SE so far. And that's because this is called the standard error. This

16
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:24,326
is super cool, but I also understand that it's also super complicated. So we're

17
00:01:24,326 --> 00:01:28,886
going to go through a few more ways of looking at this, using applets and

18
00:01:28,886 --> 00:01:33,750
demonstrations. And then finally at the end of this lesson, go over an example

19
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,463
where we would actually use this in real life.
