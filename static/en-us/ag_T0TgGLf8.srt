1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,710
Intrusion Detection Systems, or IDS for

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:06,730
short, are designed to counter
these types of threats.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,210
They can be quite
effective against known or

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,120
less sophisticated attacks, such as
large scale email phishing attacks.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,820
However, as attack techniques
become more sophisticated,

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,260
IDS will become less effective.

7
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:25,590
For example, attackers can blend attack
traffic with normal activities so

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,820
that it is very hard to
detect such attacks.

9
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,009
And the most sophisticated attackers,

10
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,355
in particular, the state-sponsored
attackers, may use new or

11
00:00:36,355 --> 00:00:40,360
zero-day exploits to render
IDS completely ineffective.

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,510
Since IDS are not always effective,
they need to be part of

13
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,430
the defense-in-depth strategy for
an organization.

14
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,110
Typical defense-in-depth
strategies should include

15
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,560
encrypting sensitive information,

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,720
provide detail of the trails of
activities on systems and networks.

17
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,060
Use strong authentication and
access control.

18
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:08,390
Actively manage the security of
operating system and applications.
