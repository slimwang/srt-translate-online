Recall the communication pattern for

2
00:00:01,807 --> 00:00:05,250
a bitonic merge assuming
a block distribution.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,460
Hereâ€™s my question, for
the following list of topologies,

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,770
tell me which ones would allow for
a congestion free exchanges.

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,790
For simplicity let's assume
that P is equal to n.

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,860
Here are your choices,
choose all that apply.
