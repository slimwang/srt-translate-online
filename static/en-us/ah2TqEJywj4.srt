00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,910
Alright ,just to make sure that you understand. Lets Lets

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,350
think through an example. Lets imagine, that we've gotta a

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,920
neuron. We got one of these perception units. And the

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,350
input, to it ,is one, zero negative one point five. For

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,880
the three different, inputs in this case. And the corresponding

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,070
weights, are half three fifths and one... And the threshold, let's

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,030
say is zero, meaning that it should fire, if the

8
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:25,350
weighted sum is above zero, or equal to zero, and otherwise,

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,850
it should not fire. So, what I'd like you to compute, is

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:32,470
based, on these numbers, what the output y would be in this case
