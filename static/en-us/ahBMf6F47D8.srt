00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,540
As you can imagine, since data science is being deployed in a wide range of

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,500
fields, data scientists use many different tools, depending on the task at hand.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,480
Two of the most common tools used by data scientists are Numpy and Pandas.

4
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,780
Numpy is popular because it adds support for

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,930
things like multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:23,870
It also adds a lot of mathematical functions that base python lacks.

7
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,130
Pandas on the other hand, allows us to structure and

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,850
manipulate our data in ways that are particularly well suited for data analysis.

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,110
If you happen to be familiar with the scripting language R,

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,610
Pandas takes a lot of the best elements from R and implements them in Python.

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,770
Both Numpy and Pandas are popular tools in the data science world, so

12
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,290
being familiar with them will help you read other people's code in the future.

13
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,042
Why don't we quickly discuss a couple of the more important features in both

14
00:00:49,042 --> 00:00:49,733
Numpy and Pandas?
