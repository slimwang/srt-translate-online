1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,480
I walk through the solutions for

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:06,640
lesson 2, stage 3 implementing the SentenceWordCountTopology.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,180
In part one, I asked you to navigate to stage 3, and duplicate

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:16,040
the SentenceCountTopology, and rename it the SentenceWordCountTopology.

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:21,010
Also in part one, I asked you to follow the Java convention and

6
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,550
make sure the class name matches the Java file name and the constructor.

7
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,760
You didn't need to do this, but I also think it's a good idea to build our

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,040
package as we develop so that we make sure we're not making any syntax errors.

9
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,350
We do that by mvn package remembering that

10
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,280
on your virtual machine you're in lesson 2, stage 3.

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,510
And we find we have a build success, which is great.

12
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:53,050
I'll do a mvn clean and clear the screen.

13
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:58,300
In part two you're implementing a new bolt, split sentence bolt, and I suggested

14
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,410
that you extend the base rich bolt by simply copying and pasting the count bolt.

15
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,050
Let's do that now.

16
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:08,100
I'll select and copy the count bolt.

17
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,630
I'll create a new area that says split.

18
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:14,780
For a split sentence bolt obviously the class name will need to change.

19
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,970
SplitSentenceBolt.

20
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,970
That extends the base rich bolt.

21
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,060
And now I'll just clear out the prepare, execute, and

22
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,110
declare output fields methods.

23
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,010
Here in prepare we no longer need our count map.

24
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:30,480
In our execute method all of this will change.

25
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,860
So we can delete that now.

26
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:37,940
And for our declare output fields we'll simply clear out some of these comments.

27
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:42,290
Remember that this split sentence bolt is going to be taking in a tuple of

28
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,530
a sentence.

29
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,340
And we'll need to split that sentence into individual words or tokens.

30
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:52,280
I gave you useful syntax hints with string delims and

31
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,570
string tokens, so I'll just copy that in now.

32
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,590
The first step in our execute method is going to need to,

33
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,860
again, take in a tuple and extract the sentence from position zero.

34
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,410
That's simply a string sentence,

35
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:12,980
sentence equals our tuple.getSTring at position 0.

36
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,940
Finally notice that our sentence.split method is returning tokens.

37
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,430
Let's just iterate through the tokens and emit each value.

38
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:28,350
Remember that the syntax here is collector.emit new Values.

39
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:34,480
Finally in our declareOutputFields we're emitting value token.

40
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,600
I'll call that a sentence word.

41
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,870
Therefore we tell the schema that we're emitting a tuple consisting of

42
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,630
one word sentence word.

43
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:48,610
And in our OutputFieldsDeclarer.declare method we have new fields and

44
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:51,870
not word but sentence-word.

45
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,640
Now that we've implemented our split sentence bolt,

46
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,620
let's make sure this compiles.

47
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,380
Mvn package.

48
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,300
Great, we have a build success.

49
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,610
Next in part three, I asked you to update the topology to make

50
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:08,480
a random sentence, split the sentence using your new split sentence bolt that we

51
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,550
just implemented, and send the output to the count bolt.

52
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,490
The implementation question I asked was, what stream method should you use to

53
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,610
connect a sentence to the split sentence bolt?

54
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,260
In other words, should we use a field grouping, a shuffle grouping,

55
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,890
a global grouping or an all grouping?

56
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:29,010
Do sentences really need to be sorted by field in order to be split?

57
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:29,730
Let's work on that now.

58
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,870
Scroll down to your topology building section.

59
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,760
And let's just look at the topology as it is now.

60
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:42,710
We have a sentence spout, a count bolt, and a report bolt.

61
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:46,600
These are connected by the fieldsGrouping and a globalGrouping.

62
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,710
Continuing on, notice I've labeled our sentence spout, count bolt, and

63
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:56,270
report bolt and removed the code for now so we can look at the topology.

64
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:00,680
In this exercise, we want to add in our split sentence bolt

65
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,670
between the sentence spout and count bolt.

66
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,250
In Storm this is very easy.

67
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:12,170
We first want to add in our new split sentence bolt,

68
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,360
connect out sentence spout to our sentence bolt.

69
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,180
In answer to the implementation question this should be a shuffle grouping.

70
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,710
And finally, we want to reconnect the split sentence bolt to the count

71
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,920
bolt using the fieldsGrouping.

72
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,460
Remember that the fieldsGrouping will hash or

73
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:34,070
bin on each word and send each word to the right count bolt.

74
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,590
Let's do this in code.

75
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:40,710
The first step is to copy and paste the syntax of a bolt.

76
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:45,270
Let's change the component id to split-sentence-bolt.

77
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:50,540
And that of course takes our new object, SplitSentenceBolt.

78
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,380
Let's leave the parallelism of 15.

79
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,983
And here the connection of the sentence-spout to the sentence-spout should be

80
00:04:56,983 --> 00:04:58,790
a shuffleGrouping.

81
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:03,590
And lastly, remember that the shuffleGrouping does not need to hash on fields.

82
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,170
And therefore we can remove the fields grouping.

83
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:10,188
Graphically we can see that the sentence-spout is now connected to

84
00:05:10,188 --> 00:05:14,200
our split-sentence-bolt by the shuffleGrouping.

85
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,506
Finally to connect the count bolt using the fieldsGrouping to

86
00:05:17,506 --> 00:05:23,305
our split-sentence-bolt, remember that we have to change our fields component.

87
00:05:23,305 --> 00:05:27,970
And it's no longer word and we actually named it sentence-word.

88
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,549
To see this we scroll up.

89
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,870
We scroll up to our declareOutputFields.

90
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,650
And remember that our field declaration sentence-word needs to

91
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,800
map in our topology.

92
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,145
Finally, we see that the sentence spout is connected to our

93
00:05:42,145 --> 00:05:44,950
split-sentence-bolt using the shuffleGrouping.

94
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,668
The split-sentence-bolt is connected to

95
00:05:47,668 --> 00:05:52,540
our count-bolt using a fieldsGrouping and fields sentence word.

96
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,360
And our CountBolt and our ReportBolt remains unchanged.

97
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,880
Let's compile this and run our package by submitting it in to storm.

98
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,580
The command here is mvn package.

99
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,340
Remember that you should be in lesson 2, stage 3.

100
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,960
Let's look at our hierarchy using tree.

101
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,410
We see that SentenceWordCountTopology has been created.

102
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,830
Let's scroll up a bit.

103
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,960
Our class SentenceWordCountTopology has been created.

104
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,320
Finally we see that our jar files, including dependencies, are there.

105
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,070
So submit our program using Storm space jar target/udacity.

106
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:34,191
Again hit using tab hyphen tab udacity.storm.SentenceWordCountTopology.

107
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:39,420
Once we've submitted our program, we can go back to our visualization.

108
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,810
We can see our program running in the background, and

109
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:46,170
here we see that seven is one of our largest words due to the count.

110
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,890
Here we have 14.

111
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:48,990
There we have 39.

112
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:53,660
As the program runs the random sentence spout is spitting out new sentences.

113
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,490
And our program is splitting the sentences and counting.

114
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,080
Seven is the largest word because we see four score and

115
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,350
seven years go and Snow White and the seven dwarfs.

116
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,670
Finally in part four I asked you to personalize your random sentences.

117
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:10,350
So you can go to the random sentence spout, change the sentences,

118
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,810
take a screenshot or screencast or video and upload it to the forum.

119
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,120
And how about commenting on two other posts?

120
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,820
Remember, that your sentence word count topology should now match Lesson 2,

121
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,530
Stage 4.

122
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:21,130
Great job.
