1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,540
So why are we interested
in segmentation?

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,350
And what do we mean by segmentation?

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,730
Well by segmentation obviously,

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,970
we're going to segment the image
into a variety of regions.

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,680
And the regions that you want to create
depend a little bit on what you're

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,330
actually trying to do.

7
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:17,980
So, there's this general intuition,
and here we point to this work up by

8
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,300
the folks out at Berkeley and
Jitendra Malik, and his group.

9
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,020
They really pushed hard on this.

10
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,350
There's this general view
that if I show you a picture,

11
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:28,090
like this picture here on the left here,
which has these, bison.

12
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,820
That's what we call them in the States,
or buffaloes, and

13
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,140
we still have them wandering around,
not in Atlanta, but in general.

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,710
The idea is that I should be able to,
you know, if I handed that picture off

15
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:43,150
to a, to anybody and I said, draw
a border around the different objects,

16
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,290
you would get something that looks
kind of like that, all right?

17
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,100
People would segment and, and the, this
segmentation wouldn't all agree, right?

18
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,860
Some people might separate out this
little guy here from the grass but

19
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,800
you can see that this one doesn't.

20
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,490
But in general,

21
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:03,520
there'd be a good agreement on
where the different elements are.

22
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,290
And this database that's pointed to,
they recorded a whole bunch of

23
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,840
segmentations done by people, and
that can be used to train systems.

24
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,420
Here's just another example taken
from a typical American scene here.

25
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,140
In fact,
it even says that it's in Idaho.

26
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,180
And you can see that the,
the regions that were cut out seemed to

27
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,310
correspond intuitively, what you might
think of as the different object, or

28
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,780
something more along
the lines of different parts.

29
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,050
Another reason you might want to do
this, is you've got some objects,

30
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:35,520
that are sort of the ones you want to
pay attention to against the background.

31
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,880
And you want to focus on the object,
and not the background.

32
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,160
So, here's some examples referred
to as figure ground segmentation,

33
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,850
which is the pulling out of the,
the figure from the background.

34
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,260
And these typically are done in
things that are moving around.

35
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,910
Here we've got some animals playing.

36
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,615
Here's a strange creature
referred to as a young child.

37
00:01:52,615 --> 00:01:55,916
And the idea is that you'd like to
be able to pull those objects out.

38
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,498
So if you want to analyze,
like we were doing activity recognition,

39
00:01:58,498 --> 00:02:00,840
you want to describe just
the movement of the object.

40
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,290
Another way of thinking about
segmentation, again some work that was

41
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:08,669
introduced by Malex Group is
this notion of super pixels.

42
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,960
So these two pictures that
you're looking at here,

43
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,460
you can see that everything is sort of
cut up into these little fragments.

44
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,950
And the idea of these fragments,

45
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,720
especially take a look at along around
here, right, is that within those

46
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,520
fragments, everything is sort of the
same, and it's within the same region.

47
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:29,190
And what that means is, when I think
about further cutting up this picture,

48
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,280
or processing it, I don't have to
think beyond these little regions,

49
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,080
which we'll refer to as, well later
in the literature, as superpixels.

50
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,900
Right, the idea is that I go from
having tens of thousands, or

51
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,750
hundreds of thousands of pixels,
to maybe having hundreds of superpixels.

52
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,710
So that makes the combinatorix much,
easier.

53
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,030
And again, getting these superpixels
is a form of segmentation.

54
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,590
Segmentation extends beyond
just single images of course.

55
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,620
Here we're taking a look at video.

56
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,930
This is actually some work that comes
from here at Georgia Tech done by both

57
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:09,060
Professor Erfanisa, Jim Raise and
Professor Jim Raise group here.

58
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,520
And there's this ice skater going along.

59
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,180
And the ice skater is being segmented
and it's not always so easy because

60
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,350
here, it's showing you against just
ice but obviously it pulls it out.

61
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,010
And you want to be able
to extract it carefully.
