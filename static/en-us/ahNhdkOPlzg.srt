Suppose that a sender is sending at some rate r, which is bigger than

2
00:00:05,137 --> 00:00:10,417
the sustained rate R that they are allowed to be sending it, and suppose

3
00:00:10,417 --> 00:00:15,319
that our bucket size is beta. Then, how long can a sender

4
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:20,690
send at the rate r that exceeds the sustained rate?

5
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:25,480
In other words, what is the value of d? We know that

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:31,876
the bucket size, beta, as shown in the shaded green area, is

7
00:00:31,876 --> 00:00:38,870
simply d times r minus the sustained rate R. So sender can send at the rate,

8
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:44,574
little r, that exceeds the sustained rate, R, 4 beta divided by r minus

9
00:00:44,574 --> 00:00:49,730
R sustained. Now based on what we've learned here, let's just take a quick quiz.
