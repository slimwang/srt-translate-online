00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay, so that allows us to substitute 1 string. What if we want to substitute multiple strings?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This is how to format, like this.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
If we want to substitute multiple variables into a string,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
we can include multiple % s's, but it means we need to include multiple variables.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
If you don't include enough variables, Python might get mad at you.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Why don't you try that out in the editor? We'll do a quick quiz.
