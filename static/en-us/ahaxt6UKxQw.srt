00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,350
You learned about the biasâ€“variance tradeoff in this lesson and

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,250
the last lesson. Now I want you to hear from Sean.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,870
Hear about his work at Facebook and pay careful attention to

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,240
his models and the trade offs in the visualizations he made.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,580
>> Some recent work I've been doing on measuring fan sentiment for

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,939
NFL teams over the course of the season that I'm really excited about.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,930
it's, it's been a really fun project because I myself am, am an

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,420
NF, NFL fan. I'm a huge Eagles fan and I go through all

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,790
of the, emotions that a fan goes through over the course of

10
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:30,090
the season. You know, the highs of when your team wins and then

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,600
the lows after a couple losses in a row of feeling kind of

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,660
hopeless. And so I got the idea of maybe we could measure this

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,490
and kind of tell a story. Not just for my team but

14
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,820
for all the other teams in the NFL, and come up with some

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,410
idea, some way of visualizing this, this experience of being a fan. And

16
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,950
so I, I counted ratios of positive to negative words at five-minute increments

17
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,020
over the course of the whole four months of the NFL season. And

18
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,520
because we're taking a ratio, we end up with some measurements that are

19
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,100
extremely high. Like, you know, positive to negative word ratios, oh, over a

20
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,340
hundred even though the average in somewhere in the two to three range.

21
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,390
So this, this was kind of like a first cut at the data, and

22
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,220
we can see that there's some signal here. But it's, it's definitely going to

23
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,510
need some, some modeling or some statistics in order to kind of tease

24
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,130
out what's actually happening. So what I did was just compute a moving average

25
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,360
of these five minute measurements and we start to get a little

26
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,630
bit of signal out of there. Because we're pooling over more measurements, so

27
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,670
the measurements themselves are more reliable. And we end up with a series

28
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,350
that kind of tells a little bit of a story. But these measurements

29
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,810
are still too frequent and too noisy to, to really tell a story

30
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,240
about what's happening. When we aggregate it up to one day moving averages,

31
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,800
we start to see some patterns emerge. I guess one of the key

32
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,180
features of this dataset was that I knew what I was looking for

33
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,040
ahead of time. Because I, I am an Eagles

34
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,720
fan, I experienced the highs and lows of the seasons.

35
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,070
I can look at a plot like this immediately

36
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,940
and tell you this is not telling the story that

37
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,500
I want. We needed to maybe apply some modeling

38
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,580
to that. We want a model that predicts sentiment as

39
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,248
a function of time. And one of the things

40
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,050
that comes to mind right away is a natural spline.

41
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,920
>> You can see that this actually tells a nice story. These color lines are

42
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,250
the dates of wins and loses. It kind of gives you an idea of why

43
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,090
the lines are upward sloping or downward sloping. So you can see

44
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,260
here, kind of like the exuberance at the beginning of the season as

45
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,830
people are really optimistic. And then, you know, three losses in a

46
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,420
row and see how the sentiment dips. This tells a nice story, but

47
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,960
it doesn't have the feature of, that we'd expect, which is that

48
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,540
on game day, things change really abruptly. At the very end of the

49
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,960
game, when you know if you've won or you've lost, you're much

50
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,400
happier or much sadder than you were at the beginning of the game.

51
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,180
So we expect to see really discrete jumps in sentiment

52
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,030
that we don't see from a model like this. And this

53
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,470
is because this is a bad model of the underlying data

54
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,150
generating process. So we need something more flexible. One way to

55
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,470
do that is just to use a seven day moving

56
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:51,230
average. Which is going to allow us to include only kind

57
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,400
of the last game sentiment in the moving average. So we're

58
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,180
going to pick a moving average, like I showed you before.

59
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,270
Let's smooth it out into over a whole seven day period. And when

60
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,700
we do that, we get something that actually tells a really nice story

61
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,270
about the season. And has all the kind of characteristics that I would

62
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,810
expect as a fan in having gone through this. Which is, the kind

63
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,960
of, the big bumps up on game days where you win, the big

64
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,480
bumps down on game days where you lose. And then, kind of, these

65
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,680
plateaus in between, which are these periods of stability when you don't have

66
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,470
any information about how your team is doing. We see that a week off

67
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,420
around Thanksgiving but then there's a big spike in

68
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,660
happiness because people are happier on Thanksgiving. This big low point

69
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,100
right after a loss that could have knocked them out

70
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,740
of the playoffs. And then a big kind of ascension

71
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,600
to their playoff game which they ended up losing

72
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,120
and the subsequent dip. This I think is a really

73
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,090
nice depiction of what happened and it took a little

74
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,889
bit of averaging to get the story to come out.

75
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,470
>> When you're looking at all this data, what sort

76
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,720
of things come up for you in terms of bias and

77
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,680
variance tradeoffs.

78
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,810
>> When you're computing just a simple moving average like this,

79
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,800
you're dealing with one of the most, it's just a really

80
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,610
flexible statistic. And so you're, not imposing any structure on the

81
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,010
data. You're letting the data kind of speak. When I use a

82
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,040
moving average here and I plotted standard errors that were kind

83
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,190
of rolling along with the data. They were gigantic. The mean

84
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,350
sentiment for the season is somewhere in the three range. And

85
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,830
the standard errors were over two or three. We can say very

86
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,050
precisely what's happening at any given point. But our variance

87
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,130
on that estimate is huge. So as we started to

88
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:22,370
add more lags, higher number of lags to the, moving

89
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,570
average. We end up with kind of smoother looking plots, that

90
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,480
have lower variance but but then are getting progressively more

91
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,930
bias. So as we go back further we are including

92
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,570
more data and were getting more bias. Because were including

93
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,990
data from parts that actually aren't applicable to that exact point.

94
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,560
But in exchange for that we get a lower variance plot,

95
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,340
one that doesn't move as wildly. When we combine that with

96
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,710
splines, we can end up fitting a model, that has kind

97
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,900
of the best of both worlds. Which has the smoothing, aspects of

98
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,410
the splines, with the discrete jumps, of what happens on game

99
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,230
day. And so this is a spline where we add it dummy

100
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,690
variables for post game periods. In this model, we end up

101
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,090
with kind of all the same thing. We get the big jumps

102
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,530
that we expect, so it jumps down on loses, jumps up

103
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,920
on game days where they win. And then also kind of the

104
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,600
smooth transitions in between. So it's kind of a nice story of

105
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,440
taking one style of model, which is a spine, which is just

106
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,210
too specific for the data generating process, and maybe not a good

107
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:22,390
fit. And in doing some exploratory data analysis where we see that

108
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,340
averaging over seven days tells a really nice story and gives us

109
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,140
the discreteness that we want. And then combining those two together into

110
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,580
kind of an aggregate of the two types of models. Where We're able

111
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,990
to better account for the fact that game days, are, are an important thing.
