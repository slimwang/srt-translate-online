00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,580
Linux is really flexible
about file names.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,290
There's no hard rule that
a particular kind of file has to

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,210
have a particular kind of name.

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,160
The file system doesn't require that
files have extensions on the end of

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:10,740
their names.

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,360
If you're coming from Windows,
that can be a big change.

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,500
You can see for instance,

8
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,880
a file called readme instead of
readme.txt, but it's still a text file.

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,750
But just as on other systems,
there are conventions.

10
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,660
If you don't know what a file is, you
can use your favorite search engine to

11
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,660
look up the extension on
the end of the file name.

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,110
Or, if there isn't one,
the whole file name and

13
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,159
maybe something about the context.

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,090
So, given what you already know,
and what you can find with some

15
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:39,620
quick searching, see if you can say what
each of these files is likely to be.

16
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,100
What type of things do you expect
to find in each of these files?

17
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,350
For Hello-Kitty.jpg is that
a photograph, a saved game, or

18
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,240
a Japanese textile?

19
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:54,300
License, is that a piece of copyrighted
software, piece of plain text,

20
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,090
or a crypto key?

21
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:59,120
Readme.md, is that a monitoring device,

22
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,495
a mark down document,
or a medical record?

23
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:07,840
Superuser.pem, is that a crypto key,
a printer config, or a recipe?

24
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,520
And install.sh, is that a shell script,
a data shard, or a shared file?

25
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,670
Again, if you don't already know, look
it up using your favorite search engine.
