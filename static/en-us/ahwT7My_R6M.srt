00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,520
So quickly, how can a source router adjust paths to a

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,750
destination when there are multiple paths

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,350
to the destination? Dropping packets to

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:13,810
cause TCB backoff, alternating between multiple forwarding table entries to the

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,400
same destination, or sending alerts to

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,380
incoming senders whenever a route changes.
