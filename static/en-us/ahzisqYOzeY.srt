1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,620
This side length, or this side, would have to be something else. We can't have

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,704
negative side lengths, so this first three choices would not make sense. Zero

3
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:12,288
times 0 equals 0, so that also wouldn't make sense, since that doesn't give us

4
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:16,690
an area of 2. One time 1 equals 1, so that also would not give me an area of 2,

5
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:22,150
so this one's out. We know 2 times 2 or 2, or 2 squared is 4. So this one won't

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:28,180
work either. And 4 times 4, or 4 squared equals 16. So, this one's out as well.

7
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,763
The answer is something else, lets see what it is.
