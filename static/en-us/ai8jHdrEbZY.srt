1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,176
Now we'd also like to have a sound object that we can pass around or attach to

2
00:00:04,176 --> 00:00:10,454
various entities in the rest of the game code. Say, for instance, that some

3
00:00:10,454 --> 00:00:11,722
entity has a specific

4
00:00:11,722 --> 00:00:12,104
[NOISE]

5
00:00:12,104 --> 00:00:17,708
death sound that always plays. We'd want to be able to actually attach that to

6
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:23,850
that entity. As you can see here, we have a sound object that has two methods,

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:32,210
init, and play. Init, initializes the sound in any way we might need to. Play

8
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:36,935
takes a boullian loop that plays a sound and playSoundInstance, which is an

9
00:00:36,935 --> 00:00:41,810
external function used by both init and play, is a fire and forget version that

10
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:49,565
takes a sound URL, loads it, and then immediately plays it. Now, we want you to

11
00:00:49,565 --> 00:00:54,945
fill in these methods as described with everything we've already built. And

12
00:00:54,945 --> 00:00:57,000
that should only be a few lines of code.
