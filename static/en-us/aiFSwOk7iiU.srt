1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So far I've told you that mutation

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
modifies the existing object.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
But you can't really see the difference from what we've done with strings.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Where we'll really see the difference is when we introduce a new variable.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let's go back to the example we had before,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and now we're going to add an extra assignment statement,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and we'll introduce a new variable.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Suppose we introduce the variable "q."

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And we assign p to q, and that means the value of p,

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
which is the object that's this list,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
is now what q will refer to.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The important thing here is after the assignment,

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
p and q refer to the same list.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Suppose we did an assignment statement

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
to modify the value of one of the elements of q.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Well, that will change element 4 of q,

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
so this is element 4 of q.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It will change that value

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
to the new exclamation point.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It also changed the value of p.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even though the assignment statement didn't include p,

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
the fact that p and q refer to the same object

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
means that it changed the value of p.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
To show you that things are different with strings,

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
let's try that with a string.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
See if you can guess what happens when we try to use assignment

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
to replace the first letter in the string.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Let's run it to see what happens.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And what we get is an error,

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and we get an error because the string is not mutable.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
There's no way to change the value of the string,

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and the error says there's no way to do assignment in a string,

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
that that type of object, because it's immutable, does not support assignment.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
A key difference between mutable objects and immutable objects

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
is once an object is mutable,

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
then we have to worry about other variables that might refer to the same object.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We can change the value of that object,

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and it affects not just the variable that we think we changed,

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
it affects the value of other variables as well.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Let's see an example of that.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I've initialized p to the list containing the strings "Hello."

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Now I have an assignment that introduces the new variable q

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and assigns p to that variable.

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And we'll print out the values of p and q,

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and we'll see that both p and q contain the string Hello.

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But now let's change the value at position 0.

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Now we have an assignment that stores

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
in the value at position 0 of p the letter y.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This changes the value of p.

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What may be more surprising is this also changes the value of q.

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Even though we didn't use q in the assignment,

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
it changed the value of q because q

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
refers to the same object as p.
