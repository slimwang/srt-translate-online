1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:01,819
The auth flow is complete and

2
00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:05,400
we can continue implementing
the rest of the Movie Manager app.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,970
Back in the code, I'm now working with
the more completed version of the app.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,050
You can download this version of the app
with the link in the instructor notes.

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,320
This version has implemented some
more of the movie database client and

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,630
its methods, and
I'll run it to show you what's going on.

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,170
We can login using our new auth flow.

8
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,647
And here in the movie picker
view we can search for movies.

9
00:00:31,305 --> 00:00:33,400
So I'll do a quick search and
I'll select a movie.

10
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,250
From here we can favorite and
unfavorite a movie, but

11
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,870
the watchlist functionality
is left incomplete.

12
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,940
If we go back you can see this
when we select the WatchList tab,

13
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,810
because no movies
are populating the table view.

14
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,610
But the Favorites tab
is working just fine.

15
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,560
Okay, so let's stop this and
go back to the code.

16
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,645
Here in the TMDBConvenience file,
we'll scroll down to getWatchListMovies.

17
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,770
This is one of two methods
that is not implemented yet,

18
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,970
and those will be the focus
of the next two exercises.

19
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,900
Now this method's what's used
to populate the WatchList tab

20
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,890
with movies from your watchlist and it's
going to be up to you to implement it.

21
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:15,550
To implement this method, I want you to
look at the already implemented methods

22
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,700
getMoviesForSearchString and
getFavoriteMovies.

23
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,560
Really study them and pay close
attention to the substitute key and

24
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,100
helper method that's used
in getFavoriteMovies.

25
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,603
When you've finished
implementing getWatchlistMovies,

26
00:01:28,603 --> 00:01:31,063
you should see your watchlist
movies in the WatchList tab.

27
00:01:31,063 --> 00:01:33,440
And when you're done with this exercise,
check this box.
