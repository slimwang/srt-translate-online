1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,190
So think about, we're doing queries
where we're computing the average and

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,510
returning it and
we're doing that only for

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,890
students that come from a certain state.

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:13,790
So, what if there's only one
student from, say, a smaller state.

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,240
Wyoming for example.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,230
So if there is only one
student from Wyoming,

7
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,440
this is kind of like the Junior
standing discussion we had.

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,550
There was only one student,
the Junior standing.

9
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,930
So there's only one student,
we ask the query,

10
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,730
saying give me the average of
students who are from Wyoming.

11
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,670
The average is going to be the same
exact score of that student,

12
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,520
one student, who comes from Wyoming.

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,550
So, depending on how many students,
if there are too few,

14
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,220
extreme case only one, then,
of course, the average is the score.

15
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,400
So, Yes is the answer.

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,090
It will not be possible if there
are lots students from each state.

17
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,990
But we didn't say that here so
I would pick the first answer.
