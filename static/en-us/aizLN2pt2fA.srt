00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,740
Since the inverse of a function will have its x and y coordinates switched from

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:08,170
how they were in the original function. The x's and y's must be switched in

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:13,462
this equation, too. How about we do that next then? Please switch the position

4
00:00:13,462 --> 00:00:18,715
of x and y in our equation y equals 3x minus 1. Write the new equation in this

box.
