00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,080
It is often useful to look at specific problem domains,

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,880
both to see how we can apply current theories of chronological reasoning to them

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,910
and also to see how we can use those problem domains to build new theories of

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:18,360
chronological reasoning. So let us turn now to the domain of design. In design,

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,320
there is a new movement that is sometimes called biologically inspired design,

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,440
or biomimicry. This movement is pulled by the need for

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,790
environmental sustainability and is pushed by the desire for creativity and

8
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:34,084
innovation and design. On the top left here is a picture of

9
00:00:34,084 --> 00:00:39,430
the Shinkansen 500 train in Japan. This is a bullet train. It's called a bullet

10
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:44,200
train because of the shape of its nose. This particular shape is inspired by

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,494
the shape of the beak of the Kingfisher. The story goes something like this.

12
00:00:48,494 --> 00:00:51,890
Japanese railway engineers were interested in building faster trains.

13
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,570
However, they had a problem, these trains had to go through tunnels. And

14
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,180
as they went through tunnels, they created shock waves, which created a lot of

15
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,000
noise, bothering the neighbors. The shock wave was created because outside

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,200
the tunnel and inside the tunnel were two different mediums. By serendipity,

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,770
the railway engineers looked at how the Kingfisher goes from the medium of

18
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:17,430
air into a medium of water, dips its beak and catches its prey.

19
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:22,728
The shape of its nose allows us to create a smaller shock wave.

20
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,873
We use the same principle to create the design of the nose of the bullet train.

21
00:01:27,873 --> 00:01:31,824
Shinkansen 500 travels faster than previous trains and

22
00:01:31,824 --> 00:01:37,760
also makes less noise than previous trains, mostly because of the nose shape.

23
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,970
Another example often cited in biomimicry is the example of a Mercedes Benz box

24
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:49,490
car, designed by inspiration to the Boxfish. Notice as biological

25
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:53,710
inspired design entails analogical reasoning. There's a target problem.

26
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:57,881
There's a source case. There is cross-domain analogical transfer.
