1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,020
So one last thing to do before we go on

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,470
to the next lesson is to add the tests for

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,890
the functionality that we added in this lesson. The end

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,600
of the profile lesson you added the test for profile.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,280
So now you need to add the test for conference.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,121
That'll be the conference test class, and you can find

7
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:20,794
that in the lesson four folder. And also go back

8
00:00:20,794 --> 00:00:25,579
into your conference API class and, uncomment the tests, that should

9
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:29,660
work now that you've added conferences. So, let's have

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,180
a quick look at conference test. Now we set

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,890
up the values that you're going to need to

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,200
test on. Create the service test helper which is

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,510
needed, the setup method which just gets everything ready

14
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:45,660
for the tests, the tear down method cleans up.

15
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,670
And then there's just a bunch of different functions

16
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,780
to test the different things that we've added. So test

17
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,790
creating of conference without an A, that's not allowed.

18
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,942
Test creating of conference, anyway, so on. You can

19
00:00:56,942 --> 00:00:59,294
read through the test files and see what all

20
00:00:59,294 --> 00:01:02,900
the things are tested. Feel free to add tests,

21
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,910
and then when you run your project with Maven,

22
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,080
it will automatically include the test, or run the

23
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,032
test. And it actually won't let you run your

24
00:01:12,032 --> 00:01:15,879
project, untill the tests are successful. If you really get

25
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:18,127
stuck with the tests, and you do want to deploy

26
00:01:18,127 --> 00:01:21,172
without running the tests. You can choose run as and

27
00:01:21,172 --> 00:01:25,637
then run configurations and then you can create a configuration

28
00:01:25,637 --> 00:01:30,260
and actually enable the skip tests. I don't recommend this.

29
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,742
It's a good idea to always test what your doing,

30
00:01:32,742 --> 00:01:34,619
but it is good to know that if you, you

31
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,759
know, that you can do that if you need to.

32
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:40,763
Anyway, go ahead and add the test, to your application.

33
00:01:40,763 --> 00:01:42,390
And then it's time for the next lesson.
