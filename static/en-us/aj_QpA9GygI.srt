For this solution, I'm showing you the ggplot code to

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,420
create the scatter plot of price versus time. Now, I've added

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,670
geom jitter here. So, that way, my points will show up

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,520
a little bit transparent. And I'll color them with an orange

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,390
hue. Looking at the plot, we can that the modal or

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:18,400
the most common prices, seem to be increasing over time. We

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,470
also see some lower price points scattered about the graph. These

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,550
may be due to sales or, perhaps, buyers using coupons that

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,960
bring down the price of yogurt.
