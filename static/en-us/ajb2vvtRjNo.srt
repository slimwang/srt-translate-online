1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,360
So now we need to build and
install the application.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,620
Remember, there are two parts,

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,260
the phone application and
the wearable application.

4
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,710
Before, I mentioned that
the wearable application

5
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,280
needs to be embedded into
the phone application.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,840
While this is required for
distribution through Google Play.

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,550
it's actually possible to build and
deploy them separately for testing.

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,120
So let's walk through how to build and
deploy our new application for testing.

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,780
And then we can discuss
the embedding later.

10
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:28,040
You'll notice here there are two
Gradle projects, Mobile and Wear.

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,340
We can build and
install each of these separately.

12
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,720
So make sure you connect
up your phone now.

13
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,290
And ensure that the Android Debug Bridge
is working properly.

14
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,550
Now select the mobile project,
and click the green Play button.

15
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,110
This tells Gradle to run
the Assemble Debug task.

16
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,990
Which compiles your code and
makes an APK out of it.

17
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,990
Android Studio then installs
it to your device or emulator.

18
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,420
We may need to select
a device to install it to.

19
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,580
So select that,
in this case, my Nexus 5.

20
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,950
And click okay to continue.

21
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,580
After waiting a minute or two.

22
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,200
You'll see the phone side of your
application running on the phone.

23
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,210
This is exactly the same as what
you would have done previously

24
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,090
when you learned Android programming.

25
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,430
Now to get to the important part,

26
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,820
building the wearable
side of the application.

27
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,860
We now need to get your wearable paired
up over ADB just like your phone.

28
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,270
Most Android Wear devices would come
with a cradle, like one of these.

29
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,310
That allows you to connect to USB cable.

30
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,550
So we make sure we've
got those connected up.

31
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,780
Also, you'll need to enable
developer mode and usb debugging.

32
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,340
So you need to go to Settings, About,
and tap on the Build number seven times.

33
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,640
Then you go to developer mode and
enable USB Debugging.

34
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,010
Your wearable will ask you if you want
to approve the permission request.

35
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,620
Once this is done,
your wearable will be able to use ADB.

36
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,930
If you're a Windows user, I've provided
a link in the instructor notes.

37
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,760
To some documentation that shows how to
set up ADB for Android Wearable Devices.

38
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,570
If you have a wearable device
that does not have a USB cradle.

39
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,780
You can also set up ADB over Bluetooth.

40
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,400
The instructor notes will have a link
that has more information about what you

41
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,930
need to do that as well.

42
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,690
Now that we have the wearable
device set up with ADB.

43
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,550
We need to build the Wearable project.

44
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:02,070
Let's select the Wearable Gradle project
and click the green Play button.

45
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,450
This tells Gradle to run
the assemblydebug task,

46
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,550
similar as before, but this time for
the Wearable side instead.

47
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,150
Once it finishes building,
Android Studio will prompt you for

48
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,300
which device to install the APK to.

49
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,550
Since there are now two
devices connected by ADB.

50
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,900
It's very important that you
pick the wearable device.

51
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,420
If you pick the wrong one,
the app will not execute properly.

52
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,370
So we select the wearable,
then we click okay.

53
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,620
Now you'll see the wearable activity
appear on the wearable devices.

54
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,200
So that's how you can easily test and

55
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,660
debug phone and wearable apps
from within Android Studio.

56
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,070
When you're ready to push the APK
to your users via Google Play.

57
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,980
You'll need to do these
steps a little differently.

58
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,510
You need to boot a release mode APK.

59
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:42,020
Which is different than a debug
APK because it is signed with your

60
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,630
development keys to
prove you built the APK.

61
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,310
You can start this process
by using the build menu and

62
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,220
selecting generate signed APK.

63
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,730
Which uses the gradle assemble
release task internally.

64
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,490
And this is how we go
start that process.

65
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,540
Build, generate signed APK.

66
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,620
And then you can follow through
by selecting the mobile project.

67
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,940
And at this point now, you need
to provide all your key details.

68
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,240
And then continue through
with the rest of the process.

69
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,420
I'm not going to go through
that process right now though.

70
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,770
So let's just hit cancel to
get back to where we were.

71
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,440
If you go to the mobile
build.gradle file, like shown here.

72
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,720
You can see there's a property
called wearApp at the bottom.

73
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,030
That references the ware gradle project.

74
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,980
This task tells gradle to embed
the wearable APK into the phone APK.

75
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,770
You should note that this
only happens in release mode.

76
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,900
When we did the testing
earlier in debug mode.

77
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,310
There was no app embedding.

78
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,360
So it's important that you test
your final APK in release mode

79
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,910
by installing it to a phone.

80
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,250
And checking that it syncs over
to the wearable correctly.

81
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,090
If you make a mistake with any
of the wearable packaging steps,

82
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,050
it'll fail to install in the wearable.

83
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,930
By the way, if you're trying to debug
packaging installation problems.

84
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,690
You can use adb logcat and search for

85
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,070
the process WearablePkgInstaller
on the phone and wearable side.

86
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,870
Which will tell you what the problem is.

87
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,728
Oh and one more thing.

88
00:03:52,728 --> 00:03:55,800
I mention build.gradle files, but
did not go into much detail on them.

89
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,230
For many cases you won't need
to edit these very often.

90
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,421
But if you want to learn more.

91
00:03:59,421 --> 00:04:02,547
We have a whole class on Gradle that
teaches you everything you need to know.

92
00:04:02,547 --> 00:04:04,960
About dealing with dependencies and
Multiple Build Flavors.

93
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,670
For a link check the instructor notes.
