00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,608
>> With point slope form, we have one point that's fixed and then we'll plug in

2
00:00:03,608 --> 00:00:07,724
the coordinates into this other point. 1 for the x and 2 for the y. Notice that

3
00:00:07,724 --> 00:00:11,592
I'm always using parentheses when I plug in. That's because I don't want to make

4
00:00:11,592 --> 00:00:15,427
a mistake with my negative signs. Since both these numbers are positive, I can

5
00:00:15,427 --> 00:00:19,472
drop the parenthesis. And on the other side of the equation, we have our slope,

6
00:00:19,472 --> 00:00:23,727
negative 3 halves. Now, I'm going to cross-multiply. Then, I carry out the

7
00:00:23,727 --> 00:00:28,796
distribution. Negative 3 times x is negative 3 x, and negative 3 times negative

8
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:33,865
1 is positive 3. On the right, I have 2 y and I have negative 4. I've re-written

9
00:00:33,865 --> 00:00:38,491
this line up here and now I'm going to solve for standard form. I want the

10
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:43,148
constants on the right, and the x and y on the left. If you got negative 3 x

11
00:00:43,148 --> 00:00:47,678
minus 2 y equals negative 7, excellent work. Notice how every single term is

12
00:00:47,678 --> 00:00:52,176
negative. Well, we could just multiply every term by negative 1 and make the

13
00:00:52,176 --> 00:00:57,052
entire equation and all it's terms positive. So, an alternative answer would be

14
00:00:57,052 --> 00:01:01,621
3 x plus 2 y equals 7. These are actually the same exact equation. This one has

15
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:03,870
just been multiplied by a negative 1.
