1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,670
For this assignment, talk about how you might use notion of recording cases to

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:07,000
design an agent that can solve Raven's Progressive Matrices. You might think of

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,750
cases in a variety of different ways here. For example, each figure in

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,200
a problem could be a case. Each transformation between figures could be a case.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,610
Or more broadly, each problem that your agent has encountered in

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,460
the past could be a case. As part of this, you'll also need to

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,110
think about how to evaluate similarity. If you're using figures,

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,380
how do you evaluate the similarity between two figures in a problem?

9
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,630
Or how do you evaluate the similarity between two transformations and a problem?

10
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,310
Or more broadly, how do you find what problem that you face in the past,

11
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,380
is most similar to the new one you're facing now?
