1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,839
in 2014 two different groups nearly tied

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:05,639
in the internet competition with the

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:08,369
seven-percent classification error one

4
00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:10,949
of those networks is called VG nett or

5
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:13,798
sometimes just DG and it came from the

6
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:15,990
visual geometry group at Oxford

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,710
University VG has a simple and elegant

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,660
architecture which makes it great for

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,510
transfer learning the VG architecture is

10
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,368
just a long sequence of three by three

11
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,469
convolutions broken up by two by two

12
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:30,809
pooling layers and finished by a trio of

13
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:32,609
fully connected layers at the end

14
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:35,579
lots of engineers use VG as a starting

15
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,170
point for working on other image

16
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,238
classification tasks and it works really

17
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:42,539
well the flexibility of VG is one of its

18
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:48,170
great strength
