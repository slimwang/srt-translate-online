1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The answer is N must be an even digit because D plus D, no matter what D is,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
that's equal to 2 times D, so N must be even.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Human problem solvers would continue on like that,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
making inferences from what they know about the rules of arithmetic

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
to figure out what each letter should be.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
In the end we come up with one of two possible solutions.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Either 655 plus 655 equals 1310

8
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
or 855 plus 855 equals 1710.
