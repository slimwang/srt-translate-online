1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,050
Privacy begins with the patient.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:08,029
Only they or their designees can consent
to the use of their health information.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,740
There are a number of models for
obtaining this consent.

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:17,510
Using data without asking for
consent is the No Consent model, but

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,186
this isn't reasonable or
even legal in most contexts.

6
00:00:21,186 --> 00:00:23,900
In the Opt-out Model,

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,570
Consent is assumed, unless
the patient specifically revokes it.

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:33,300
Some HIEs are using that Model,
but it would be very unlikely and

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,380
probably not even legal for
a healthcare provider to use it.

10
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,940
The converse is the Opt-in Model,

11
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,860
where no data is shared
unless the patient consents.

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,823
If you've ever visited a physician,

13
00:00:45,823 --> 00:00:49,390
you've probably consented to the use
of your data under this Model.

14
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:55,130
CurrentCare, the Rhode Island HIE
we'll discuss later, uses this Model.

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,560
Typically Opt-in is all or none.

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,060
So patients can't share some but
not all of their data.

17
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:08,270
Despite this inflexibility,
at least one study suggests as many

18
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:12,020
as 90% of patients will
consent under this Model.

19
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:17,300
The final Model, Opt-in with patient
specified restrictions, provides more

20
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:22,730
flexibility and would probably be the
preferred method if it can be managed.
