Since days are represented on the horizontal axis on this graph, what this

2
00:00:04,082 --> 00:00:08,390
question is really asking is what vertical coordinate goes with the horizontal

3
00:00:08,402 --> 00:00:12,715
coordinate of 7 on this graph. So we start by counting over 7 horizontally, and

4
00:00:12,727 --> 00:00:16,930
then moving up to find the point on the graph that has a horizontal coordinate

5
00:00:16,942 --> 00:00:20,207
of 7. Then we just need to see what vertical coordinate this corresponds to.

6
00:00:22,071 --> 00:00:27,121
This is right above the line representing 160 for n, so that means the answer

7
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:32,133
must be 161. Remember to be super careful about which axis represents which

8
00:00:32,145 --> 00:00:37,466
variable. What's even more interesting is comparing this to our equation. If we

9
00:00:37,478 --> 00:00:42,538
let d equal 7 here, or just substitute in 7 for d, and then solve for n, we get

10
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:47,083
161, which is exactly the point that we found on the graph. The equation and the

11
00:00:47,095 --> 00:00:51,578
graph are just different ways of describing the same thing, so of course, they

12
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,346
have to agree.
