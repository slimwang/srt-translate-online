00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,750
If you have not noticed yet,

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:05,750
performance considerations are really all about the metrics that we choose.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,160
Ideally, metrics should be represented with values that we

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,520
can measure and quantify.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,290
The definition of the term metrics, according to Webster, for

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,270
instance, is that it's a measurement standard.

7
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:21,380
In our analysis of systems, a metrics should be measurable.

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,040
It should allow us to quantify a property of a system, so that we

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,940
can evaluate the system's behavior or at least compare it to other systems.

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,020
For instance, let's say we are concerned with the execution time of the system.

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:34,850
That's a metric.

12
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:35,920
We can measure it.

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,310
We can quantify exactly what is the execution time of a system, so

14
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,410
it's a quantifiable property as well.

15
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:46,520
A metric is associated in some way with some system that we're interested in.

16
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,350
For instance, that can be the implementation of a particular problem,

17
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,000
the software implementation of a problem.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,070
And that's what we want to measure the execution time of.

19
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,440
And a metric should tell us something about the behavior of

20
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,450
the system we're interested in.

21
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:05,690
For instance, it can tell us whether it's an improvement over

22
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,140
other implementations of the same problem.

23
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,460
For the later, in order to perform this kind of evaluation and

24
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,200
comparisons, we really should explore the values of

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,645
this metrics over some range of meaningful parameters.

26
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:22,930
By varying the workload that this implementation needs to handle, or

27
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,770
by varying the resources that are allocated to it, or other dimensions.
