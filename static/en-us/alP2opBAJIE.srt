00:00:00,315 --> 00:00:03,910
Back-end programmers often collaborate
with other types of programmers, and

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:05,250
they work in teams.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,893
Each company and
team will be different, but generally,

4
00:00:07,893 --> 00:00:11,550
back-end programmers may sync with
front-end programmers to support

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,850
any front-end features
that require storing or

6
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:18,890
retrieving data, like someone's name,
birthday, and favorite food.

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,155
They may also link with mobile
programmers to make data usable

8
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:23,430
in a mobile application.

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,980
Finally, they may also connect with data
analysts to create usable structures for

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:29,630
client data.

11
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,840
Back-end programmers play
an important role in teams.

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,300
In the next lesson, we will learn
more about mobile programming.
