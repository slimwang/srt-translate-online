00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,925
P would equal positive 25, in this case. Great work if you found this number.

2
00:00:04,925 --> 00:00:09,834
Again, we'll start by converting logarithmic form into exponential form. So

3
00:00:09,834 --> 00:00:16,807
we'll have 5 as our base, 2 as the exponent, set equal to p. Remember when we

4
00:00:16,807 --> 00:00:23,548
have log of base 5 of p equal to 2. We know that 5 raised to the second power

5
00:00:23,548 --> 00:00:30,574
will equal p. So we really just need to evaluate 5 squared. 5 squared is 25, so

6
00:00:30,574 --> 00:00:32,871
p equals 25.
