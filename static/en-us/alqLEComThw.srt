1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,270
So there's still one more feature that you could

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,980
add to your project to round out functionality for

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,820
registering for a conference. Once you've registered, you can't

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,730
actually unregister. So even though the UI shows us the

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,740
Unregister button, users can't actually click it to unregister,

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,060
because you haven't written the functionality to unregister the

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,560
user from a conference. It's up to you if

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,370
you'd like to go ahead and implement the unregister functionality.

9
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:30,420
Feel free to add the function unregisterFromConference and

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,930
put it in conference API if you'd like. I'm

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,530
going to leave you to do this on your

12
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,610
own if you want to. Couple things, though, I

13
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,720
do need to point out, is that the

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,320
UI is expecting the function to be called unregisterFromConference

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,800
and it is expecting it to throw these exceptions.

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,320
One other thing here is we have an @Name("websafeConferenceKey"),

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,660
so this function knows to expect the web safe conference

18
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,370
key to be passed to the function, and if you go

19
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,780
to the API's explorer, you'll see that it offers the

20
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,710
websafeConferenceKey field for you to enter the value if you want.

21
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,300
Anyway, it's up to you if you'd like to go

22
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,230
ahead and implement this function. But it does tie together a

23
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,220
lot of the concepts that you've learned such as using

24
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:18,730
transactions and getting an entity by key and changing property values.
