00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,499
Let's think about what we've learned. Now, we know that a function has the same

2
00:00:03,499 --> 00:00:07,946
number of zeros, and the some number of linear factors as its degree. And, of

3
00:00:07,946 --> 00:00:11,154
course, we need to make sure that we count the repeats here. We've also seen

4
00:00:11,154 --> 00:00:15,872
that complex zeros always come in pairs as conjugates. And we know how to find

5
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:19,400
zeros of all different types. I think it's time then, to work through an

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,212
example that involves multiple techniques we've learned. This is going to be a

7
00:00:23,212 --> 00:00:26,592
great problem to help you summarize all the important aspects of determining

8
00:00:26,592 --> 00:00:31,736
zeros. So, get ready for this amazing polynomial function. We have f of x

9
00:00:31,736 --> 00:00:37,208
equals, we're off to a pretty good start. 2x to the fourth, minus 13x cubed,

10
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:44,525
plus 32x squared, minus 13x, and that's it. I hope you're impressed. So, if we

11
00:00:44,525 --> 00:00:47,738
want to find the zeros of this function, how do you think the best way to start

12
00:00:47,738 --> 00:00:51,976
would be? Should we factor the first two terms and then factor the last two

13
00:00:51,976 --> 00:00:55,501
terms? Should we grab a snack, since it's going to be a long ride? Should we

14
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:59,838
pull out the greatest common factor from all of the terms? Should we use the

15
00:00:59,838 --> 00:01:04,816
rational zero theorem involving negative 13 and 2? Should we divide both sides

16
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:07,233
by x? Or should we combine like terms?
