1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,250
I've mentioned the FragmentManager, 
FragmentTransactions

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,900
in the back stack 
a few times.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,650
Now, take a look
at the documentation

4
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,500
on the Android developer site, 
and complete the code,

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,170
which will replace the contents
of the fragment_container

6
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,400
with a new instance of the 
Details Fragment.

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,810
Keep in mind that this transaction 
should allow the user

8
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,460
to reverse the transaction 
using the Back button.

9
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,570
And in this case, 
we'll be calling this code

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,000
from within an activity.
