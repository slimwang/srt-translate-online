1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,020
You have to remember something from your linear algebra.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,610
And by the way, I have to look this up every time, so

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,860
if you don't remember, that's okay.

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,800
One is that the determinant of a matrix, remember the determinant of a matrix?

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,810
That's actually the product of the eigenvalues, okay?

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:17,750
So lambda one, lambda two,

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,830
multiply them together, that's the, that's the determinant.

8
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,370
With two zeroes in there, it's easy to see.

9
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,590
It's a little harder to see in the more general case.

10
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,890
The other thing is that the trace of the matrix, right?

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,080
The sum of the diagonals, is the sum of the Eigenvalues.

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,860
So the determinant of a two-by-two is trivial to compute, right?

13
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,750
This minus that, or however you like to determine some two-by-twos.

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,900
Trace is easy, sum them up.

15
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,500
And the Harris operator was just to compute some function R.

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,120
You take the M matrix.

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,860
You take its determinate, minus some constant of the square of the trace.

18
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,450
And I'll tell you that empirically, the constant was small number, 0.04, 0.06,

19
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:05,440
written here, exactly how things scale depends a little bit on your, the,

20
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,860
the way you do your gradient operators and pixels.

21
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,540
Okay?

22
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,250
So it's the determinant, which is a product.

23
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,560
Minus the alpha trace.

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,360
So the real equation of what you're looking at is right there.

25
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:16,990
Okay?

26
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,700
So taking a look at lambda one lambda two minus alpha one,

27
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,310
alpha times lambda one plus lambda two squared.

28
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,210
Let's think about this.

29
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,160
R depends on the Eigenvalues but we don't actually have to compute them.

30
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,220
And that's great, because even in 1980,

31
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,050
in the 80s you'd want to compute your eigenvalues, maybe, I don't know.

32
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,660
But the idea is that you compute a single number, all right, really fast.

33
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,760
All right.

34
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,440
So, we've already said that R is large for a corner.

35
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,290
And why is that?

36
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:49,050
Well, if they're large then both of the l one and l two are large.

37
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,200
Their product is even large and if you take the squares.

38
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,640
You know it's l one square plus l one l two plus l two squared.

39
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,490
Subtract it off.

40
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,520
Yeah but you're subtracting off alpha of it.

41
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,160
It's a small amount.

42
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,490
Okay? So it's still going to be large.

43
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:11,240
But if only one of the L's is large, then this term goes small,

44
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:18,390
whereas one of these terms is large so the R value is negative, okay.

45
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,630
So that you can measure the R value, it's negative along an edge, so

46
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:27,330
R is large for corner, it's negative, along an edge and if the magnitude

47
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,970
of R is small, basically that means that everything was small, right?

48
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:35,070
So L1 and L2 is, is small, everything there is small.

49
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,160
Well, that's the flat region we were talking about, right?

50
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,520
None of the gradients have any magnitude to speak of.
