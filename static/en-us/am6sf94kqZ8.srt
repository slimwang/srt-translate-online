1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,870
Now let's modify some of
the properties of the stack view.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:11,509
Axis, it correctly changes
from horizontal to vertical.

3
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:16,000
And we can even do this at runtime and
have it animated.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,829
Alignment also behaves as expected, and

5
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:24,829
we will leave it at fill so
it takes all the vertical space.

6
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:27,195
Now let's check out spacing.

7
00:00:27,195 --> 00:00:29,905
First, we're going to make it negative.

8
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:32,344
And that will make the view overlap.

9
00:00:32,344 --> 00:00:38,625
Now, let's increase it until we
reach 0 and increase it again.

10
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:43,269
So, what happens The stack view
just keeps growing wider and

11
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:48,750
wide to accommodate the necessary
space even when we reach the border

12
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,109
it will keep growing up.

13
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:54,280
This is happening because we
didn't set any constraints

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,810
to the size of the stack view.

15
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,230
Now let's take a look at distribution.

16
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:03,949
Distribution is the most
complex property, so

17
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:07,700
we will leave it at fill for
the time being.

18
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,870
In this simple example we made
the stack view's job ridiculously easy.

19
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:15,359
If the contents grows,
it just grows too.

20
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:17,992
This is not realistic,
and in the next examples,

21
00:01:17,992 --> 00:01:21,829
we will limit the size of the stack view
and see how it rises to the challenge.

22
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,469
But before you do that,
why don't you pause the video and

23
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:29,099
then change the axis to vertical.

24
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:32,640
Try the following,
change the access o vertical,

25
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,570
add some spacing, and then try
the different options for alignment.
