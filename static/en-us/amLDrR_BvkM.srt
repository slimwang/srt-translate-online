00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,800
Let's look at the use of XDR in a quiz.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,589
Let's assume that an RPC routine uses

3
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:09,519
a variable length integer
array of a maximum size 5.

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,378
Now if the array is full,
how many bytes are needed in order to

5
00:00:14,378 --> 00:00:20,014
represent this data structure in
a client in C on a 32-bit machine?

6
00:00:20,014 --> 00:00:21,860
You should provide your answer in bytes.
