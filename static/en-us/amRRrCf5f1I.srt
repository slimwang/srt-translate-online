Before we used the equation of a line to draw a graph, but how about this time

2
00:00:04,616 --> 00:00:09,074
we use the graph to find the equation? I've drawn three lines for you on the set

3
00:00:09,086 --> 00:00:13,854
of axes, and I'd like you to start by finding out the slope and the y-coordinate

4
00:00:13,866 --> 00:00:18,517
of the y-intercept for each of these lines. Please notice that I have labeled

5
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:23,076
them f, g, and h. So, just fill in this table with the proper values for m and

00:00:23,088 --> 00:00:23,164
b.
