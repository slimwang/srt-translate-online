>> We can connect these points to form all the points that represent the miles

00:00:03,794 --> 00:00:07,893
driven and the cost of our truck rental. Here's what our graph would look like.

3
00:00:07,893 --> 00:00:11,929
And notice that the graph continues to increase up into the right, well that's

4
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:15,801
because I can drive more miles and my cost would continue to go up. But wait,

5
00:00:15,801 --> 00:00:20,276
there's something else going here with this equation. If we switch these two

6
00:00:20,276 --> 00:00:25,353
terms around then the equation becomes y equals 2x plus 20. This is an equation

7
00:00:25,353 --> 00:00:30,167
in slope intercept form. So, what's the slope and the y-intercept for this

8
00:00:30,167 --> 00:00:32,391
equation? Put your answers here.
