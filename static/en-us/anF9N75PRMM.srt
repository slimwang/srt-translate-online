1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,970
The answer to this is that at some point
the manager will simply not be able to

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,260
control any more resources.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,300
There is a limit to the attention
that a single person has, and

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:16,600
therefore one single manager will
not be able to continue controlling

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,510
all of the different types
of resources in the shop.

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,090
In addition,
another limit to the scale maybe that

7
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:27,320
there is a physical limit as
to how many different things,

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,259
how much staff, or how many workers, how
much staff can simply fit in the shop.

9
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:36,110
Outsourcing could sometimes be
an option, however if the manager only

10
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:42,200
trusts his own workers, then, he will
not be able to outsource those tasks,

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,035
and that's going to compose
some limits to the scale.

12
00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:49,730
These kinds of limitations exist in the
context of internet services as well.

13
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,520
Given the size of the data center,

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,190
there may be a limit on the amount of
resources that can be placed there.

15
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,690
Given the complexity of the management
processes there will be limits as to how

16
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,470
many different things can be managed.

17
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:08,750
And if we want to run our own software
stacks, our own operating systems,

18
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:14,400
our own software services then we'll
clearly be limited by these factors.

19
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,550
In order to address these challenges,
cloud computing has emerged as

20
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:24,105
a solution that allows us to address
some of these limitations regarding

21
00:01:24,105 --> 00:01:28,305
the scale that can be supported with
existing Internet service solutions.
