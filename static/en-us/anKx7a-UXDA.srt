00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,251
And the answer to each of these questions is no. If we plug in negative 1 into

2
00:00:04,251 --> 00:00:09,810
our function, we get 9. And if we plug in 1, we get 1. Neither one of these

00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,796
numbers is 0, so that means neither one of these values of x is a root or a 0.
