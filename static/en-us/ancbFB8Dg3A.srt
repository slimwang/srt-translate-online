00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,786
>> In addition to that atlas we have, we also have a very large and very complex

2
00:00:04,786 --> 00:00:09,733
data file. This data file represents how the atlas should be rendered to draw

3
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:14,505
the entire map. Now this is a pretty complex file because its actually been

4
00:00:14,505 --> 00:00:19,337
generated by an external tool, called tile. Prior to running the game, and

5
00:00:19,337 --> 00:00:24,063
artist would take our atlas data and the tile tool. For grids, we actually read

6
00:00:24,063 --> 00:00:27,969
the exported JSON data into our game, which tells us how to render the images

7
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:31,906
and the tiles on the screen. Now, in order to actually render our map, we need

8
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:36,014
to parse the exported data file that we've been given from the tiled editor. The

9
00:00:36,014 --> 00:00:39,977
data the we extract from this will tell us a number of things. First off, what

10
00:00:39,977 --> 00:00:44,045
atlases to load. And secondly, how the layers are organized, given to us by the

11
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:48,196
artist. For example, you can see that the data layer here actually references

12
00:00:48,196 --> 00:00:51,883
what tiles to render, as well as the height and the name of the layer itself.

13
00:00:51,883 --> 00:00:55,665
We'll need to be able to scrape all this and properly understand how it's laid

14
00:00:55,665 --> 00:00:57,144
out to render our final image.
