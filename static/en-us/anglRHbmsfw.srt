00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,710
Thanks for sharing your findings.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,370
I can't wait to see what
discoveries you've made.

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,320
I wanted to improve the histograms
showing the number of days students

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,080
visit the classroom during
their first week, for

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,310
both passing and non-passing students.

6
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,280
So I started off with the same plotting
code that I had used previously.

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,660
Then I added the line,
import seaborn as sns.

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,910
To the top of the first cell, since
importing seaborn will automatically

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,170
make the plots look a little nicer.

10
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:24,560
You can see the difference here.

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,260
The colors are a little bit better and
there's a grid in the background.

12
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,830
Next, I wanted to use the bins argument
to specify that there should be exactly

13
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,600
eight bins for this histogram.

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,680
This will fix those blank
spots that we saw earlier.

15
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,860
There should be eight bins since there
are eight possibilities for the number

16
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,254
of days you visit the classroom in
the first week, 0 through 7 inclusive.

17
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,490
I also used plt.xlabel to specify that
the x access was measuring number

18
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:49,580
of days.

19
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,430
And I used plt.title to add a title
that would explain what the graph

20
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,530
was showing to someone
who didn't already know.

21
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,896
Re-running the cell, I can see that
the strange gaps have disappeared and

22
00:00:58,896 --> 00:01:01,970
my axis label and title have been added.

23
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:06,430
Then I made very similar changes to
the second histogram adding an xlabel,

24
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,586
a title and
setting the number of bins to eight.

25
00:01:08,586 --> 00:01:11,820
I didn't re-import Seaborn
since that's not necessary.

26
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,140
Seaborn will apply to all plots
that are made from now on.

27
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,610
And again I can see that all the weird
gaps are gone and my x label and

28
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:19,790
my title have been added.
