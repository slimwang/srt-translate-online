Thank you. Here comes the answer.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The answer, of course, is you put the part back in,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and you try to remove other parts. Why is that so?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Well, if you remember our discussion of the scientific method in the first unit,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
what you just had is you set up a hypothesis on why the failure occurred.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You removed some part, and you observed that after removing this part,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
your hypothesis on what the failure is no longer holds,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
so you go back to your earlier hypothesis and remove other parts.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Trying to keep only the part and remove everything else makes little sense,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and keep on removing until the failure occurs again also is very unlikely to happen.
