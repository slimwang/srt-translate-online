We saw in the last quiz that x minus a is a factor of a function, f of x, if

2
00:00:04,902 --> 00:00:11,246
and only if f of a equals 0. So let's take another function as an example to

3
00:00:11,246 --> 00:00:15,928
see if this rule that we just figured out really makes sense. If we have f of x

4
00:00:15,928 --> 00:00:21,316
equals x squared plus 3 x minus 10. Then what do we get for f of two. Please

5
00:00:21,316 --> 00:00:25,156
write that in this box. Now based on your answer here, you may or may not have

6
00:00:25,156 --> 00:00:29,190
information that tells you about a factor of f of x. If you think you can

7
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,108
figure one of theme out, please write it right here. Remember to find f of two,

8
00:00:33,108 --> 00:00:36,484
just replace every x here with a two.
