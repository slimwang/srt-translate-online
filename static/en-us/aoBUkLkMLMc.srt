1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Well, we just saw the code for processing these tokens,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and we know that it went to a bit of trouble

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
to store the beginning position, lexps,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and then the ending position,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
but then--phwoomp--subtract out 9.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So this is way too much.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We went to a lot of trouble to drop

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
<script type"--blah, blah, blah--so this one doesn't match.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Similarly, this one doesn't match.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This one looks perfect! It has stripped out the tag at the beginning

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and the tag at the end.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This one still has the tag at the end, so it's not right.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
In the particular example we're using,

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
the Satasai or Bihari Satsai

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
are 700 verses from the 17th century.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
They're written in Hindi

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and they cover topics from morality to devotion, to love.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Good stuff!
