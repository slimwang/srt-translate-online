00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,430
Before we move on to creating
our own If statements,

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,200
let's look at a few examples.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,150
To see these examples in action,

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,210
download the ifstatements.playground
file.

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,700
To see your results in the console,
go up to the View menu,

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:18,100
scroll down to Debug Area,
and click Show Debug Area.

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,310
You might see three errors there
at the top of the console.

8
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,400
Those are caused by
a bug in Playgrounds,

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,965
which will hopefully be fixed soon,
but you can ignore them for now.

10
00:00:26,965 --> 00:00:29,130
Let's scroll down a little bit, and

11
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,830
first I want you to
focus here on Example 1.

12
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,990
Now, when I go up to the Editors menu,
and

13
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:38,450
I click Execute Playground,
nothing happens.

14
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,480
Now try changing the variable hungry
to true and see what happens.

15
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,260
Down here, we can see nom nom
printed out in the console.

16
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,430
Now let's focus on Example 2.

17
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:56,380
This time try changing the value of
the Bool wantTeddyBear to be true and

18
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:01,290
see what happens, and down here in
the console, we can see snuggle snuggle.

19
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,730
Moving on to Example 3,

20
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:08,760
see what happens when you change
the variable raining to equal true.

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,908
Again, you can see that a new message is
printed to the console, Ryan Gosling!

22
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:16,569
Be still my heart!

23
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:20,120
And notice that in each scenario
a different function is called.
