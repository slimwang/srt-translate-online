1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,130
So now we're going to look at Interdomain

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,450
Routing Business Models. So the one thing to

3
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,610
remember about interdomain routing is that it's really

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,760
all about routing money. Let's consider this AS

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,060
that wants to send traffic to a particular

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,180
destination. Well, in the internet there are two

7
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,750
different types of business relationships: a customer-provider business

8
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:25,130
relationship where money flows from customer to provider,

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,640
regardless of the direction that traffic flows, the

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,500
other type of business relationship is a peering relationship

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,820
where an AS can exchange traffic with another AS

12
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,450
free of charge. This is sometimes also called settlement-free

13
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:42,210
peering. So already you can see given three possible

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,080
ways to reach the destination. This AS is first

15
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,300
going to prefer a route through its customer, because

16
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,000
regardless of the direction of traffic on this link,

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,240
money is always flowing from the customer. The

18
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,180
peering link is the second most preferable because it's

19
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,110
free. And the least preferable route is through

20
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,440
the provider, because the AS has to pay money

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,730
every time it sends traffic on this link.

22
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,635
This leads to the basic rules of preference in

23
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:11,540
interdomain routing, where customer routes are preferred over peer

24
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,440
routes, which are in turn preferred over provider routes.

25
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,820
The other consideration that an AS has to make

26
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,850
is filtering, or export decisions. In other words, given

27
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,430
that an AS learns a route from its neighbor,

28
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:29,370
to whom should it re-advertise that route? To understand filtering

29
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,180
and export decisions, let's add a couple more AS's

30
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,820
to the graph. Let's add another peer, and let's add

31
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,050
another provider. Let's call this AS in the middle

32
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,510
of the picture Cox Communications. This ISP might have smaller

33
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,050
regional customers and it might also buy transit

34
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:46,690
connectivity from other providers. Now let's suppose that this

35
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:51,310
AS learns routes to a destination via its customer,

36
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,590
its peer and its provider. Now we already have

37
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,220
established that it would prefer the customer route, so

38
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,260
that it can make money by sending traffic to

39
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:03,090
that destination. But what about filtering decisions? Well, routes

40
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,630
that are learned from a customer, Cox of course

41
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,500
would want to re-advertise to everyone else, because the

42
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,280
more people use that route, the more money Cox

43
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,940
makes. Therefore a route that's learned from a customer,

44
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,460
gets advertised to everybody else. On the other hand, a

45
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,110
route that's learned from a provider, if it were

46
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:24,520
actually selected, would of course, only be advertised to customers.

47
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,140
It wouldn't make any sense to take a route

48
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,680
like this and advertise it to another provider. The reason,

49
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,870
of course, is that money is flowing in the

50
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,750
direction of the providers. So any route that's learned from

51
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,840
a provider would never be advertised to another provider,

52
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,720
because it would result in Cox essentially becoming a transit

53
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,560
provider between two of its own providers and paying

54
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,450
them both for the privilege of carrying that traffic. So

55
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,930
routes learned from a provider would only ever be advertised

56
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,780
to other customers. And similarly, routes from peers would only

57
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,710
be advertised to other customers, not to other

58
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:02,660
peers or other providers. So to summarize, interdomain routing

59
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,462
has both ranking rules, where, given multiple choices,

60
00:03:06,462 --> 00:03:09,950
an AS might prefer a customer route over a

61
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,670
peer route over a provider route. And then,

62
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,330
given that it selected a particular route from either

63
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,830
a customer, a provider, or a peer, Ii makes

64
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,880
different decisions about where to re-advertise that route to

65
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,240
other neighboring ASs. Now as it turns out if

66
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,000
every AS in the internet followed these rules exactly, then

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,620
routing stability is guaranteed. Now you might wonder, isn't routing

68
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,270
stability guaranteed already? And it turns out that it isn't.
