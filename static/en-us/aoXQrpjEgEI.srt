1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,934
First we distribute the positive 2 to negative 1 and negative y. So I get

2
00:00:04,934 --> 00:00:09,976
negative 2 minus 2y plus 5y equals 7. Next I combine the like terms to get

3
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:15,255
positive 3y. We can add 2 to both sides to get 3y equals 9 and then divide both

4
00:00:15,255 --> 00:00:18,688
sides by 3 to get y equals 3. Way to go if you got 3.
