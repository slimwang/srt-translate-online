00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,600
Here are the correct answers negative 1. Great work if found that one. We start

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:10,078
solving this equation by multiplying both sides by the LCD this leaves us with 2

3
00:00:10,078 --> 00:00:15,320
times x minus 8 minus 6 times 2x minus 1 on the left hand side of the equation.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,360
On the right hand side we'll still have 0 since 0 times any factor would still

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,993
be 0. Next we distribute and combine our like terms to get negative 10x. Minus

6
00:00:24,993 --> 00:00:30,341
10 equals zero. We rewrite this sign up here, and then solve for x. We add 10 to

7
00:00:30,341 --> 00:00:35,638
both sides, and then we divide both sides by negative 10. This gives us our

8
00:00:35,638 --> 00:00:39,750
final value of negative 1. For the excluded values, we want to look at these 2

9
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,649
denominators to figure out what x cannot equal. We know x cannot equivalent half

10
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:49,796
or this denominator here equals 0. Likewise we know x cannot equal positive 8 or

11
00:00:49,796 --> 00:00:53,892
this denominator would be 0 as well. Our final answer is not one of these

12
00:00:53,892 --> 00:00:59,145
excluded values. So here is our only solution, negative 1. Notice that there is

13
00:00:59,145 --> 00:01:03,700
another way to solve this equation. If we move this second fraction to the right

14
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:08,205
side of the equation we would have one fraction equal to another. We would just

15
00:01:08,205 --> 00:01:13,067
add this to both sides of our equation. Next we would multiply by the LCD or

16
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:18,428
simply cross-multiply to get this next equation. After distributing and solving

17
00:01:18,428 --> 00:01:23,144
for x, we would find x would be equal to negative 1. If you use this method,

18
00:01:23,144 --> 00:01:23,953
that's great.
