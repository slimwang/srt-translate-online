Here's on final quiz for you. We saw in the previous lesson that there are 14

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:09,900
different kinds of UML diagrams, some of those are structure diagrams and

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,400
some of those are behavior diagrams.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,695
What I'd like you to do is to draw a UML class diagram.

5
00:00:17,695 --> 00:00:24,260
That indicates the parent-child sub-classing relationship,

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:30,330
amongst those kinds of diagrams. That is, you're going to have classes for

7
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,950
each of the 14 diagrams. You're going to a class for

8
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,280
class diagram and you're going to have a class for class structure diagram and

9
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,130
behavior diagram. See if you can fill in the details.
