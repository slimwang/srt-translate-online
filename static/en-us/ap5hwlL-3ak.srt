1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And the answer is measurements are indeed ignored which has to do with the following:

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We do weigh particles by the measurement probability but we normalize them to 1,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and if there's only 1 particle, it will always normalize itself back to 1,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
so the measurement probability has no effect.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The results are generally poor.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That is, a single particle is just insufficient to anything interesting,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
so that is absolutely the correct answer over here.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Clearly, a single particle cannot represent multi-modal distributions

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
because multi-modes look something like this over here

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
because it's just 1 particle, so this is actually correct.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The initial state, if known, is not necessarily ignored.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You might actually place the particle at the initial state

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and it might consider it in the filtering result.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The state transitions are also not ignored because we will still propagate this particle

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
forward according to the state transistion, and because 3 of them are true,

16
00:00:57,000 --> 99:59:59,999
the final one isn't.
