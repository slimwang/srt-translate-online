1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,620
The first choice is correct. Multiplying a function by some positive constant

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:10,048
stretches or shrinks the graph in the Y direction, which is vertically here.

3
00:00:10,048 --> 00:00:16,490
Since 3.3 is greater than one we have a stretch in this case. We can also see

4
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:22,460
that in our graph. The distance from the X axis up to the curve for Y equals

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:27,200
log base ten of X. Is just a fraction of the distance from the x axis up to our

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,650
second curve. 3.3 times log base 10 of x. This curve is identical to this one,

7
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:37,990
just stretched upward. It's taller, interestingly enough then even the change

8
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:41,999
of base of a log is a transformation. That is really cool.
