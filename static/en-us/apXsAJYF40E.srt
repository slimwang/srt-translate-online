00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,486
Before we wrap up this lesson, we are going to talk about power. Remember when

2
00:00:04,486 --> 00:00:08,410
we talked about type two errors. This was failing to reject the null when we

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:13,876
should have. We don't want to make type two errors. Which is basically when we

4
00:00:13,876 --> 00:00:18,840
fail to find treatment affects when they actually exist. Since research is so

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,440
time consuming and expensive, we need to make it more likely that we find

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:28,171
statistical significance when we should. We do this by increasing power, there

7
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:32,380
are a lot of things we can do to increase power and I bet you can guess some of

8
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:36,727
them, if we are testing the effects of different drugs like we did in the last

9
00:00:36,727 --> 00:00:43,987
example. Do we want to test more or less peopel do we want to give each drug to

10
00:00:43,987 --> 00:00:50,326
very similar or very different groups of people. And finally, do we want to

11
00:00:50,326 --> 00:00:56,696
test a small or large dose of the medication. This is assuming that we'll still

12
00:00:56,696 --> 00:01:00,531
be safe in the amount of the drug that we give the subjects.
