00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,290
Consider an-all-to one vector reduction.

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:07,138
Now suppose tau is the time
per scalar addition.

3
00:00:07,138 --> 00:00:11,380
Assuming a tree-based scheme this is
the time to reduce an input of size N

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,310
on a linear network.

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,110
Here is my question.

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,360
Which of the following best
describes the isoefficiency function

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,090
of a tree-based all-to-one reduce?

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,170
Here are your choices.
