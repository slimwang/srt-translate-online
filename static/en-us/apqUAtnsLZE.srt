1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,849
Now, this is an incredibly tough question. Even though we've gone over this

2
00:00:04,849 --> 00:00:10,605
before, and I've taught you how we compute this, it is pretty difficult. And it

3
00:00:10,605 --> 00:00:15,399
takes some time to really grasp what's going on here. So, we're going to go

4
00:00:15,399 --> 00:00:20,944
through this again. Bear with me, and you'll get it eventually I promise, if you

5
00:00:20,944 --> 00:00:26,640
don't already. We know that 95% of sample means will be within 1.96 standard

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,668
deviations of the population mean, which is also the mean of sample means. Now,

7
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:37,536
let's just zoom in on this part over here. This sample mean doesn't change. It's

8
00:00:37,536 --> 00:00:43,851
there. But if it's going to be one of the 95% of sample means that falls within

9
00:00:43,851 --> 00:00:50,752
1.96 standard deviations from the mean, then the population mean can range from

10
00:00:50,752 --> 00:00:55,999
here to here. So, this here is the range in which the population mean of

11
00:00:55,999 --> 00:01:01,944
everyone who uses the Bieber Tweeter is most likely to fall. So, you see that

12
00:01:01,944 --> 00:01:10,023
this range is 40 plus 1.96 standard deviations and 40 minus 1.96 deviations. And

13
00:01:10,023 --> 00:01:15,765
we know that since this is the same shape as our sampling distribution, that our

14
00:01:15,765 --> 00:01:21,594
standard deviation is the population standard deviation divided by the square

15
00:01:21,594 --> 00:01:25,524
root of n. I know I just said a lot of confusing things, so let's write it out.

16
00:01:25,525 --> 00:01:32,428
So her,e we should have 40 minus 1.96 standard deviations, and then 40 plus 1.96

17
00:01:32,428 --> 00:01:38,835
standard deviations. And we know that the standard deviation is our standard

18
00:01:38,835 --> 00:01:48,957
error, okay? So, we already know that our standard error is 2.71. So, you have

19
00:01:48,957 --> 00:02:01,390
40 minus 1.96 times 2.71, and 40 plus 1.96 times 2.71. So this is about 34.69 to

20
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:07,334
45.31. So, our confidence interval for the population mean is something like

21
00:02:07,334 --> 00:02:13,370
this. So, if everyone were to use the Bieber Tweeter, our point estimate is 40,

22
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:18,076
and our interval estimate is our 95% confidence interval.
