00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,770
Congratulations, you've reached
the end of the first lesson.

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:05,790
And you've learned the principles that
are the basis of Dev ops, culture,

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,170
automation, measurement, and sharing.

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,050
In the next lesson, we'll go deeper
into the culture, automation and

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:11,830
sharing topics.

6
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,440
And not only in theory,
but also in practice.

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,040

we're coming from with this course.

We'd like to know where
you're coming from too.

00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,840
there's a link to a survey about
your background and experience.

11
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,150
And what you think of the course.

12
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,960

13
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,280
