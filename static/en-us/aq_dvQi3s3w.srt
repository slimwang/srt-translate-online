1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,610
The most dangerous and advanced APTs
are those that use a zero-day exploit or

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,950
a specially crafted malware.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,800
A zero-day exploits a previously
unknown vulnerability and

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,380
therefore there's no patch or
fix for the vulnerable system.

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,970
And most likely there's no prevention or
detection signature for the attack.

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,650
That is, a zero-day exploit
will succeed and go undetected.

7
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:28,920
Likewise, a specially crafted malware
is usually designed to defeat

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,369
the signatures and
behavior patterns in a detection system.

9
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,270
That is, it also has a very high
chance to succeed and go undetected.

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,370
APTs are characterized by its ability to
not only evade anti-malware and network

11
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:48,400
intrusion detection systems, but also
fool even the most sophisticated users.

12
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,110
For example,

13
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,725
an APT can be designed to first
compromise an internal network router or

14
00:00:53,725 --> 00:00:58,285
server and all it does at that point is
to learn about the valuable individuals.

15
00:00:58,285 --> 00:01:03,215
That is, the APT will first learn who's
e-mailing to whom, on what topic and

16
00:01:03,215 --> 00:01:05,890
with what kind of
attachments in the e-mail.

17
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:10,590
With such knowledge, the APT can then
forge email from a person to another.

18
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,056
And this email can appear
to be very legitimate.

19
00:01:13,056 --> 00:01:14,970
This is so-called,

20
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,730
Spear Phishing because it is
targeted to a specific individual.

21
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,930
And if the internal network, router, or

22
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:25,860
server has been compromised, the APT
can play man-in-the-middle to make such

23
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,380
social engineering attacks very
successful and very convincing.

24
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,810
For example, if the email recipient is
not certain about the email attachment,

25
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,630
and he sends an email to the sender and
asks hey did you send this?

26
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,930
The APT can pay the man in
the middle to intercept inquiry and

27
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:45,270
send answer back to the user
to say yes I sent this.

28
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,500
APTs are also designed to plan in with
normal activities to avoid detection,

29
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,950
even if that means it
has to go low-and-slow.

30
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,930
For example, if an APT is designed to
forge a document, it will not do so,

31
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,720
unless the user is also
authoring another document.

32
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,440
Similarly if the APT is designed to
send our document it will not do so

33
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,419
unless the users also
sending our document.

34
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:14,300
As another example if the APT is
designed to change the setting off

35
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,490
a controller in a nuclear plant, the APT
does not make the changes all at once.

36
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:23,170
Instead, it will make incremental
small changes over time

37
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,850
to accomplish the eventual attack goal.

38
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:29,550
For example, the famous Stuxnet
falls into this example, and

39
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,800
you can search and learn more about it.

40
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,830
And because APT activities are designed
to blend in with normal activities and

41
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,280
go low-and-slow, it is very hard for

42
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,548
an anomaly detection
system to catch an APT.

43
00:02:42,548 --> 00:02:47,155
APTs are often designed to stay in the
compromised organization for long time.

44
00:02:47,155 --> 00:02:50,885
For example, always looking for
more valuable data to steal.

45
00:02:50,885 --> 00:02:54,915
For example, an APT can include
a number of steps, and at each step

46
00:02:54,915 --> 00:02:59,635
you only focus on a subset of the users,
and only part of the network.

47
00:02:59,635 --> 00:03:03,675
And at each step, he may actually use
a different version of the malware.

48
00:03:03,675 --> 00:03:06,735
And when it moves from one part
of the network to another,

49
00:03:06,735 --> 00:03:09,330
it may clean itself from the O port.

50
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:14,350
That is, at any given it's only
present at the specific target.

51
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:17,060
In other words,
it's footprint remains to be very small.
