1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,930
Being a little more formal, we say
that if P is not equal to NP, then for

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:09,780
any constant alpha at least one,
there is no polynomial time factor

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,080
approximation for
the traveling salesman problem.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,270
For the proof we reduce from Hamiltonian
Cycle, where we're given a graph,

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,800
not necessarily complete this time,

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,760
and we want to know if there's a cycle
that visits every vertex exactly once.

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,050
Here then is how we set up
the traveling salesman problem.

8
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,439
We assign a cost of one to every
edge in the original graph G.

9
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,580
And we assign a cost of
alpha times V + 1 for

10
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,290
every edge not in the original graph.

11
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:43,338
Clearly then, if G has a Hamiltonian
Xycle, then the optimum for

12
00:00:43,338 --> 00:00:46,293
the traveling salesman
problem has a cost of V.

13
00:00:46,293 --> 00:00:49,700
One unit of cost for
every edge that it follows.

14
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,040
Then a factor alpha approximation for

15
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,330
the traveling salesman problem,
will return a Hamiltonian Cycle H,

16
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,680
whose cost is at most alpha
times this number of vertices.

17
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,533
On the other hand, if the original
graph has no Hamiltonian Cycle,

18
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:08,725
then the cost of the Hamiltonian Cycle
returned by our traveling salesman

19
00:01:08,725 --> 00:01:11,650
approximation has to be
greater than the optimum.

20
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:18,630
But that must include at least one of
these edges not in the original graph.

21
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,910
Note that this term comes from
following edges in the original graph.

22
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:27,110
This one from following edges
not in the original graph.

23
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,800
There has to be at least one of them.

24
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,670
Simplifying gives the lower
bound of 1 plus alpha times V.

25
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,570
Therefore, to decide
the Hamiltonian cycle problem,

26
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:39,450
we just run the alpha approximation
on the graph with these costs here.

27
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:46,168
Then we compare the resulting
cost to alpha times V.

28
00:01:46,168 --> 00:01:50,300
If it's larger, then there can't be
a Hamiltonian Cycle on the graph.

29
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,450
Any Hamiltonian Cycle would have cost V,
and

30
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:57,000
our approximation algorithm couldn't
have returned such a large cost.

31
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,280
An the other hand,
if it's the same as alpha V or

32
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,600
smaller, then we can't have used one
of the edges not in the original, so

33
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,169
there must be a Hamiltonian Cycle.

34
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,560
Thus, if there were a polynomial time
constant factor approximation for

35
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,700
the general traveling salesman problem,
it would yield a polynomial algorithm

36
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,250
for the Hamiltonian Cycle,
which is NP complete.

37
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:25,050
Unless P is equal to NP, no such
approximation algorithm can exist.
