1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So the closest thing to a correct answer here is to

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
download the set of routers from a trusted directory.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This has some pretty serious drawbacks though.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The other choice is, well, asking Alice. If Alice actually knew everything, it could work.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But not everyone can ask Alice.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Using SSL certificates would be a good way to get the public keys starting from some

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
root certificate authority to validate the public keys of the routers.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And that could be used as part of it. That doesn't tell you what the routers are though.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We need some way to identify the actual routers as well as their public keys.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We could send messages to the random nodes.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This would work if a large fraction of the nodes on the Internet were Tor routers.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We could also require that every router implements Tor.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This would be great, but it's not very practical.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So what actually happens is that there's a list of known routers on the network

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
that can be downloaded from a trusted directory.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
There's a big problem with this in that someone who wants to censor anonymous communication

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
which a regime that someone is using Tor to get around might well want to do

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
can also find these nodes, and the censor can download the trusted directory as well

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and block all traffic to those nodes.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So this is a big challenge for networks like Tor to figure out ways to distribute the routers

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
that is accessible and can be used by people that want to use it to communicate anonymously

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
but isn't visible to a censor that would want to block all of those routers.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
There's no known right solution to this, but I would encourage an open discussion

24
00:01:32,000 --> 99:59:59,999
on the forum about ideas you might have how to solve this.
