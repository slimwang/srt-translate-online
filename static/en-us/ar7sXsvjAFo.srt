1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,400
Well, A is certainly allowed.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,570
You can have the sunroof and

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,600
the automatic transmission, gasoline engine, and pulls trailer.

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,610
And so is B.

5
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,590
But in C, you can't have both an automatic transmission and

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:11,810
a manual transmission.

7
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:13,470
And notice, in D, we don't have an engine at all.

8
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,310
That's not much of a car.
