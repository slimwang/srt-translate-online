00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,800
Here is a simple example of a representation. It is a decomposition of a single

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,660
component, which is called here, the component. The component involves a,

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,350
two ports: one for dealing with easy requests, and one for dealing with hard

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:19,428
requests. And then, there's the representation, which describes the details.

5
00:00:19,428 --> 00:00:25,110
In a sub-system, called details that has two components.

6
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,760
One fast but dumb component and second a slow but

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:34,100
smart component. The binding section then pastes these two levels together.

8
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:39,040
Easy requests are mapped to the fast but dumb component port P and

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,340
hardRequests to the slowButSmartComponent also called Port P. Hence we

10
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:49,210
now have the same system described at two different levels of abstraction,

11
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,960
the lower one allowing us to go into the more details than the upper one.
