1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In this and the following units, we will talk about probability.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Probability is just the opposite of statistics,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and there's a yin-yang relationship between both.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Put differently, in statistics we are given data

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and try to infer possible causes that relate to the data,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
whereas in probability we are given the description of the causes

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and we'd like to predict the data.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The reason why we now study probability and not statistics

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
is because it gives us a language

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
to describe the relationship between data and the underlying causes.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So, enough of the theory; let's dive in.
