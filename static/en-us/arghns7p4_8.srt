1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,980
Now you're ready to activate
that service worker.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,470
As we saw earlier in the course
the service worker won't

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,740
activate until pages using
the current version go away.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,310
So either close this tab,

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:15,498
navigate it to a page out of the service
worker scope or shift refresh it.

6
00:00:15,498 --> 00:00:19,420
When you navigate back to the page
it should be showing the new theme.

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,190
To confirm this,
head over to the settings page,

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,140
type new-cached-used into
the test field and press enter.

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,206
This will confirm it's all working.
