1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,030
Another source of error cited at
that symposium was an incorrect

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,760
system default.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,700
This can occur in at least two ways.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:13,170
A particular EHR could have been set
up to default to a particular value,

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,810
and the provider may overlook
that while charting.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,640
Another, and

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,590
far more insidious possibility
is that EHR remembers the values

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,920
from a patient's prior visit to save
the physician time in charting this one.

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,550
The obvious potential
error is to document

10
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,400
what may have been correct last time,
but is wrong this time.

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,920
Another source of error derives from
the desire to save the provider time

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,110
by fitting as much as possible
onto each data entry screen.

13
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,560
This can lead to a cluttered
and/or illogical layout

14
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,840
that can cause information
to be overlooked.
