00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,246
This parabola will open upward. Good hinking if you chose up. Now we haven't

2
00:00:06,246 --> 00:00:08,640
even covered this yet, so don't worry if you didn't get it right on your first

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,421
try. But what I wanted you to recall is that the number in front of the x

4
00:00:13,421 --> 00:00:19,110
squared term is the a value. This tells us about the parabola's direction.

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:24,033
Since a equals two and is positive, we know the parabola will open up. And

6
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:27,297
since the parabola was in the form y equals, we already knew that the parabola

7
00:00:27,297 --> 00:00:31,904
opened up, or it opened down. So left and right weren't really good options

8
00:00:31,904 --> 00:00:32,610
there.
