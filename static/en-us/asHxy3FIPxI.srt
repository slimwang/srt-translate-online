1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,510
It would take them one and one fifth of an hour or six fifth hours to complete

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:08,306
that work together. And converting that to minutes, it would take them 72

3
00:00:08,306 --> 00:00:14,301
minutes total time to complete the work or one hour and 12 minutes. Great work

4
00:00:14,301 --> 00:00:18,578
if you found these two numbers. We want to take our equation and solve for x.

5
00:00:18,578 --> 00:00:22,484
We know that this fraction represents the amount of work that they both can

6
00:00:22,484 --> 00:00:27,486
complete in one hours time. So x represents the amount of time it takes for

7
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:32,682
them to do all of that work, or to complete the entire job. So we can solve

8
00:00:32,682 --> 00:00:37,734
this equation by multiplying through by the LCD, which is 6x. We simply

9
00:00:37,734 --> 00:00:40,950
multiply these denominators together, since the greatest common factor among

10
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:49,626
them is one. We simplify this to 3x, this to 2x, and this fraction to the 6. We

11
00:00:49,626 --> 00:00:53,910
add like terms on the left to get 5x equals 6, and finally we divide both sides

12
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:59,756
by 5 to get x equals 6 5th hours. We know 6 5th's hours is the same thing as 1

13
00:00:59,756 --> 00:01:05,042
hour and 1 5th of an hour. And digging all the way back to fractions in our

14
00:01:05,042 --> 00:01:09,830
clock, we know 1 fifth of an hour is really 12 minutes. Now, if you didn't know

15
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:13,030
this off the top of your head, you could have simply divided 60 minutes, which

16
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:17,704
is 1 hour, by 5 to get 12 minutes. We know an hour is 60 minutes. So, all

17
00:01:17,704 --> 00:01:22,516
together, this would make 72 minutes of time. So this is how we know that the 2

18
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:28,649
of you can solve all of the problems in 72 minutes or 6 5ths hours.
