00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,160
What answer did you give, David?``
>> So,

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,780
my answer is that the best explanation
is a combination of Betatosis and Zetad.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:11,090
By combining these two illnesses, we can
cover all of the data we saw over here.

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,970
We saw both illnesses elevate B,
which led to our High B, and

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,950
both reduced C, which led to our Low C.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,300
Our patient had a normal level of E,
but the effects of Betatosis and

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,790
Zetad counteract their influence on E.

8
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:29,150
Then Zetad accounts for our Reduced F,
and Betatosis accounts for

9
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,480
our Reduced H.

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,370
My explanation, though, heavily
weights the principle of coverage.

11
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,910
I sacrifice parsimony by having
two different explanations for

12
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,090
the sake of coverage,
I now cover all the symptoms.

13
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,173
I could have also chose Thetadesis.

14
00:00:41,173 --> 00:00:44,945
Thetadesis would have explained B,
C, and H.

15
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:46,371
It wouldn't explain F, but

16
00:00:46,371 --> 00:00:51,020
it would be a simpler explanation than
the combination of Betatosis and Zetad.

17
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,050
In that case I would be sacrificing
coverage for parsimony.

18
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,930
I could also augment Thetadesis
with Kappacide and Mutension.

19
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,580
The three of them together would
cover all our symptoms, but

20
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,900
that would also be less parsimonious
than Betatosis and Zetad alone.

21
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,680
I may have chosen to do that though,

22
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,890
if those three diseases were much
more common than Betatosis and Zetad.

23
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,690
In which case, I would have more
confidence in them than just these two.

24
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:17,500
>> It's an excellent answer, David, but
how did you come up with this answer?

25
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,210
>> So what I did,
is I started with the data and

26
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,660
I looked at which of these hypotheses
currently matched the data best.

27
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,300
That is to say, which hypotheses
explained the most points and

28
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,240
had the fewest conflicts.

29
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,220
So for example, Betatosis explained the
High B, the Low C, and the Low H, but

30
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,090
it didn't explain the Low F, and
it also suggested there was Elevated E.

31
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,180
Initially, Thetadesis was the best
match, it explained three symptoms,

32
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,930
it just didn't explain the fourth.

33
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,380
Then, based on that, I went looking for

34
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,820
another illness that would
complete the explanation.

35
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,480
For Thetadesis, that ended up leading
me to Kappacide and Mutension, but

36
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,020
at that point,
I was using three different hypotheses.

37
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,650
So I decided to revisit one of the
closer matches from my original round.

38
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:58,580
I revisited Betatosis, which had two
mismatches, it predicted Elevated E and

39
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,140
didn't explain the Reduced F.

40
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:00,780
And I went looking for

41
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,760
another hypothesis that would
complete that explanation.

42
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,389
Zetad happened to have
exactly those two effects.

43
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:10,110
>> Note that one can use alternative
methods for the same problem.

44
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,650
For example, one could use
case-based reasoning, and for it,

45
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,040
we came across a problem very
similar to this one previously.

46
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,152
Suppose that the solution to that
particular problem was of a level

47
00:02:19,152 --> 00:02:20,260
as a case.

48
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,331
In that particular case, B was high,
C was lower, F was low, and

49
00:02:24,331 --> 00:02:26,268
the solution was Thetadesis.

50
00:02:26,268 --> 00:02:29,818
In the current problem,
the additional symptom is that F is low.

51
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:34,510
So case would force you to
the conclusion of Thetadesis.

52
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,610
But it will create this particular
solution to also account for

53
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,440
the additional symptom of F being low.

54
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,750
We could do that by adding Kappacide and
Mutension to Thetadesis.

55
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,203
Case-based reasoning does,

56
00:02:47,203 --> 00:02:50,800
will tend to forecast
the alternative set of hypothesis.

57
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,030
One more point to note here then,

58
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,980
note that different methods can
lead to different solutions.

59
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,360
Given different methods,

60
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,400
how might an error agent
decide which method to select?

61
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,540
We'll return to this particular problem
when we discuss meta reasoning.
