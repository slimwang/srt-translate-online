1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,730
Let's go back to our app now,
and add a check box.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,700
This will allow the user to select if
they want the whipped cream topping on

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,220
their coffee.

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,880
It will look something like this,
and then you can check this box.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,160
Go ahead and
add a check box to the app now.

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,130
This will allow the user to
add a whipped cream topping

7
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,940
on their drink if they want.

8
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,610
When you click on this check box
it should automatically animate to

9
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:20,110
this state.

10
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,730
Also add a header that says toppings.

11
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,650
There's only one topping now, but
we're going to add another one later.

12
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:29,130
If you click on the order button,
the order summary shows, and

13
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,000
it's still the same as before.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,700
Eventually, we're going to modify it so

15
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,670
it shows whether you have
the whipped cream topping or not.

16
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,430
For this next coding task, just focus on
adding this check box and this header.

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,820
You haven't added a check
box to the layout before,

18
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,870
but here's your chance to learn.

19
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,750
You can look up online how to do this or
you can check out

20
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,960
the Common Android Views cheat sheet,
which is linked in the instructor notes.

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,840
Whichever way you decide
to figure it out,

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,550
when your app launches it should
look something like this.

23
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,080
Also note that I would like 24dp
of space in between the box and

24
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,890
the text whipped cream.

25
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,349
Also use a font size of 16sp for
the whipped cream text.

26
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,580
By the way, when I draw out specific
metrics like for spacing or

27
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,000
font sizes or font colors,
that's actually called red lines.

28
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,365
Red lines are very detailed
specifications about how the visual

29
00:01:19,365 --> 00:01:21,265
appearance of the app should look like.

30
00:01:21,265 --> 00:01:23,165
If you’re a developer
working with a designer,

31
00:01:23,165 --> 00:01:26,705
you’ll probably get a set of red lines
for different screens in your app so

32
00:01:26,705 --> 00:01:29,355
that you can build
according to these specs.

33
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:33,540
The red lines may include values for
colors,size of views,

34
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,350
spacing, font sizes and font colors.

35
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,085
These are the red lines for

36
00:01:39,085 --> 00:01:42,350
the sunshine app in the developing
Android apps Udacity course.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,830
Keeping this in mind, go ahead and

38
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,600
start planning how you're going
to build out this layout.

39
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,280
Remember the three steps that
we taught you in lesson one for

40
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,830
building any layout.

41
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,730
First, select the views that you need.

42
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,890
Then position them, and then style them.

43
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:02,450
In the text boxes provided, write down
what you need to do in each step.

44
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:05,080
Once you've planned it out,
then go ahead and add this to your app.

45
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,320
Ironically, I don't have a check box for

46
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,139
you to check when you're
done with this task.
