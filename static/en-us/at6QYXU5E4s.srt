00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,990
These numbers look pretty mysterious. Let's talk more about colors and what

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:10,590
these numbers mean. We left a few predefined colors out, here are the colors,

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:16,370
and here are their RGB values, though they're mixed up. Can you match each set

4
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:21,400
of RGB values to its color? You can figure this out whether you remember what

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,920
magenta means or not. As a reminder to help you in your experimentation, this

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,000
is how you would write code to color a box magenta. And this is how you would

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,200
write code to color a box with color a.
