00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,650
Now that you have your VM up and
running, let's talk about how to use it.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,127
In your vagrant folder,
there's a directory called rubynd.

3
00:00:10,403 --> 00:00:14,440
This folder will be home to all
of your Ruby project files for

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,344
this nanodegree program.

5
00:00:16,344 --> 00:00:18,630
Rubynd is a shared folder.

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,770
This will allow you to access the files
in it from both your Windows computer

7
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:23,410
and your Linux PM.

8
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:29,320
If you've ever used Dropbox or
Google Docs before, it's a similar idea.

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,409
You can upload files to
Google Docs on one computer but

10
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:35,840
access them from another computer,
just by logging in.

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,710
Take a look at what's inside the rubynd
shared folder using the file explorer.

12
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,610
You'll notice that there's
already a Ruby file in there.

13
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,410
We've included this file
as part of the VM setup.

14
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,245
Now take a look at the Linux shell.

15
00:00:49,245 --> 00:00:54,457
Type cd rubynd to navigate to
the shared folder in the VM.

16
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:03,282
Now if you type the ls command, you'll
also see the same file in your VM.

17
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:08,613
Run the file by typing ruby hello.rb.

18
00:01:12,653 --> 00:01:15,320
Open up hello.rb in your
favorite text editor.

19
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,358
I am going to use Atom, but

20
00:01:18,358 --> 00:01:22,073
the default Windows text editor
Notepad will work fine for this demo.

21
00:01:27,761 --> 00:01:30,840
Edit the message that
hello.rb will print.

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,230
Change Welcome to the Ruby Nanodegree
Program to a message of your choice.

23
00:01:39,952 --> 00:01:41,182
And don't forget to save.

24
00:01:44,641 --> 00:01:48,701
Now that your file is edited, you can
run the Ruby file again with ruby

25
00:01:48,701 --> 00:01:51,447
hello.rb, and
it will show your new output.
