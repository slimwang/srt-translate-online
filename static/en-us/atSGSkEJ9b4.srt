1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,130
We've had our taskForPOSTMethod
in place for a while.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:04,990
Now we're going to use it.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,880
So let's go to the TMDBConvenience file
and find our last unimplemented method.

4
00:00:12,468 --> 00:00:15,088
Here we go, postToWatchList.

5
00:00:15,088 --> 00:00:16,640
This is the method
that you'll implement.

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:22,490
This method should closely mimic the
postToFavorites convenience method, and

7
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,270
when it's complete,
you'll be done with the movie manager.

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,810
Also, if this doesn't seem like enough
of a challenge, why not try adding

9
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,340
the ability to display a movie's
rating as a bonus feature?

10
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,530
With the movie database client in place,
it should be a short amount of work.

11
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,990
Now this isn't a requirement but

12
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,680
it is a cool bonus to really flex
your networking muscles, and

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,750
make sure you understand the benefit and
the power of our new client.
