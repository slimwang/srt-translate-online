1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,530
Next, let's discuss matching
stores based on continuous trends.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,530
While we can use the average sales per
month, we might get a better match

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,640
if we could also measure trends
over time of some of our variables.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,150
Two commonly used measures for

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,519
using trends are growth in store traffic
and seasonal patterns in sales volume.

6
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:21,960
In our problem,

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,250
we'll use the number of invoices per
week to indicate traffic in the stores.

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,970
And we'll use total sales per store
per week to help us measure and

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,260
compare sales trends.

10
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,430
Fortunately for us,
there's a tool in Alteryx that

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,400
will help us create measures of
trend and seasonal patterns.

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,660
One value per test unit,
such as a store or

13
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,810
customer, that we can use to
match treatment to control units.

14
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,860
When thinking of the duration
of your experiment,

15
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,790
you should take into account that the AB
Trends Tool in Alteryx needs an entire

16
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:58,580
year of data plus a minimum 6 periods
in addition to the year is required.

17
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:03,333
For example, if your experiment is
14 weeks long, you would need 6

18
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:07,857
weeks of historical data plus
52 weeks for calculating trends.

19
00:01:07,857 --> 00:01:11,311
58 weeks of historical data
would be needed to analyze 14

20
00:01:11,311 --> 00:01:13,010
weeks of experimental data.

21
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,670
Make sure you understand the
requirements of your analysis tool when

22
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,720
designing an experiment as you may want
more data for different size periods.

23
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,340
See the Alteryx help page for
more information on the AB Trend Tool.

24
00:01:27,992 --> 00:01:31,200
Lastly, it's important to
consider the normal cycle for

25
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,689
what you're trying to test when
determining how long to run a test.

26
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:39,850
For instance, if a customer visits the
store weekly, the test should be run for

27
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,280
at least a week.

28
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,010
If they purchase a service on a monthly
basis, you'd want to run your test for

29
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:45,700
at least a month.
