00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:04,668
Here's the answer, we're going to define is yummy within our restaurant class

2
00:00:04,668 --> 00:00:08,953
because it's a method it's going to take self as a parameter. We'll have a doc

3
00:00:08,953 --> 00:00:13,289
string that explains what it does. It returns true if this restaurant is yummy,

4
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:18,244
otherwise it returns false, and we'll define it to just return false. So that's

5
00:00:18,244 --> 00:00:20,269
all we need to do to create the is yummy method.
