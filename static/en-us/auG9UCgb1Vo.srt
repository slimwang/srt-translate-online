Awesome.

2
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:04,510
Now, you can make attractive
documentation with Markdown.

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,260
Let's put it to use and
make a quality ReadMe.

4
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,140
In the instructor notes,

5
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,620
you'll find the poorly formatted
ReadMe that I've put together for you.

6
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,210
Your task is to apply the techniques
you've learned in this lesson,

7
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,620
and turn this into a good ReadMe.
