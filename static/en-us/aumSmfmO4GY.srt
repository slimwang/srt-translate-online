1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,070
If an app updates in the background but

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:05,900
no one opens it to find out,
did it really happen?

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,050
Though notifications started
out as a convenient way

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,830
to notify users of background updates,
they've grown to become a powerful

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:17,810
standardized shortcut to interact
directly with apps in a lightweight way.

6
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,000
Starting in Jellybean,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,179
rich notifications were
able to include actions.

8
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:23,419
Which let you define two or

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,340
three specific actions to perform on
the data included in the notification.

10
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:30,301
Lollipop added new template types for

11
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:33,042
notifications along with
heads-up notifications.

12
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:36,711
As a standardized UI designed for
specifically conveying timely

13
00:00:36,712 --> 00:00:39,915
information in limited time space,
they're an obvious

14
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:44,204
mechanisms to use when Android expanded
into wearables with Android Wear.

15
00:00:44,204 --> 00:00:48,091
Suddenly, the rich notifications
you designed for phone and

16
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:51,466
tablets make your app
wearable compatible for free.

17
00:00:51,466 --> 00:00:55,524
Nougat changes the layout of
notifications to always show the app

18
00:00:55,524 --> 00:00:57,259
posting them.

19
00:00:57,259 --> 00:01:02,239
The new API allows for inline replies to
notifications, similar to Android Wear,

20
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,689
as well as specifying custom layouts for
heads-up and big notifications.

21
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:09,810
The best part is that the Android
support library wraps almost

22
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,920
all of these platform differences
with an easy to use API.

23
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:18,629
But don't overdo it with notifications,
there's a fine line between useful and

24
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:19,181
spammy.

25
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,980
And it's only a couple of clicks for

26
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,619
a user to disable your apps
notifications permanently.

27
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,400
