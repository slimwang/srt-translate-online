00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,489
Now that we've taken a look at
storage in the Firebase console,

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:07,000
let's shift our focus back to Friendly
Chat and configure it to send and

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,330
receive photo messages.

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,830
Here, the steps we'll take the send and
receive a single photo message.

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,949
First, we'll upload a photo
to Firebase Storage.

6
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,579
Then, we'll write a message
to the database containing

7
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:21,339
a reference to the photos
path in the Firebase Storage.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,400
Finally, we'll handle
displaying the photo message

9
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:27,250
in FCViewControllers table view.

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,679
Before we can do this,

11
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,479
let's return to the pod file to insure
the 'Firebase/Storage' pod is listed so

12
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:38,859
that CocoaPods can pull in the storage
related classes and functions.

13
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:41,450
Remember, if we had just
added the storage pod

14
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:45,342
then we will need to run pod install
to download the correct dependencies.

15
00:00:45,341 --> 00:00:48,490
But since this pod is already been
included, we are ready to go.
