00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,290
As it turns out,
anything that involves movement or

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,310
finger on screen interactions will
need to run at 60 frames per second.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,490
The only two items that don't fall
into those categories are toggling

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,920
form controls and app theme changes.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,960
For these two, you still have 100
milliseconds to respond, but afterwards,

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,070
the app must continue running
at 60 frames per second

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,430
if it's going to keep
feeling responsive.
