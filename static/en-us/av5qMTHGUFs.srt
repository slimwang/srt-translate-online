For the answer, imagine you have objects entering each stage of the pipeline at

2
00:00:04,452 --> 00:00:08,967
the same time and suddenly stage B takes 3 nanoseconds. After 1 nanosecond, the

3
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:14,032
object entering stage A is done processing, but stage B is still busy. So, the

4
00:00:14,032 --> 00:00:18,482
object coming out of stage A is blocked and has to wait. With stages C and D,

5
00:00:18,482 --> 00:00:23,490
the objects move on through just fine. However, the object in stage B does not

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,626
enter stage C until 3 nanoseconds have passed. And that is in fact the time that

7
00:00:28,626 --> 00:00:33,403
this whole pipeline will take for every object to come off it, is 3 nanoseconds.
