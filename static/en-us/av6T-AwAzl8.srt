00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,630
At the heart of every experiment there's a good question. And these questions

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,540
come from observation. I've been observing my co-workers here at Audacity,

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,790
drink coffee every single morning right when they come in. I want to know why.

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,560
So, I think there might be a good experiment there. I'm going to wait here

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,187
until somebody comes, so that I can figure out what's going on. We've got

6
00:00:18,187 --> 00:00:21,843
someone. Good morning, Andy.

7
00:00:21,843 --> 00:00:24,668
>> Good morning, Lauren.

8
00:00:24,668 --> 00:00:26,165
>> How are you?

9
00:00:26,165 --> 00:00:27,163
>> fine.

10
00:00:27,163 --> 00:00:31,902
>> I see you're making coffee. You drink a lot of coffee. Why is that?

11
00:00:31,902 --> 00:00:36,855
>> it makes me more effective in the morning, I work better and faster I guess.

12
00:00:36,855 --> 00:00:40,564
>> Are you saying that it decreases your reaction time?

13
00:00:40,564 --> 00:00:45,580
>> No, I didn't say that, but I guess yeah, I guess it probably increases my

14
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,266
reaction time.

15
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:50,420
>> You mean decreases. Do you want me to stop asking questions this early in the

16
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:50,878
morning?

17
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:52,650
>> That would be, that would be fine.

18
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,252
>> Well, thank you, Andy. I think I have an idea for a good experiment. I'll see

19
00:00:56,252 --> 00:00:57,282
you later.
