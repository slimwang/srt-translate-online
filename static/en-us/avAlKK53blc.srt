1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,840
So far, so good.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,200
But there's one more step to go, and

3
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,720
that is we have to say things a little bit more precisely about what's going on.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,810
So I'd like you to give some OCL constraints for

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,030
each of those three operations, and for any class invariants.

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,360
Confirm to yourself that the class definition and

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,890
specifications together satisfy the problem requirements.

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,930
In other words, satisfying property one.
