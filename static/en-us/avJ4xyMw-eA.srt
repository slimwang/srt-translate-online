00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,735
What about all these other parts of the eye? What do they do?

2
00:00:02,735 --> 00:00:06,206
>> Well, there's a lot going on here. So, let's talk about it. right here, we have

3
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:12,341
this clear protective membrane and that's called the cornea. And the eye is

4
00:00:12,341 --> 00:00:14,965
pretty important so, its job is basically just to protect everything that's

5
00:00:14,965 --> 00:00:16,325
going on inside.

6
00:00:16,325 --> 00:00:18,445
>> And how about the blue part here?

7
00:00:18,445 --> 00:00:25,220
>> Well, that's the colored part of our eye. That's called the iris. And, in

8
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,870
addition to being very pretty, it's a muscle that constricts or dilates to

9
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:34,445
change the amount of light that's let in through this guy here, and that's

10
00:00:34,445 --> 00:00:40,204
called the pupil. And when it's dim, you'll notice that your pupils tend to be

11
00:00:40,204 --> 00:00:44,483
pretty big. Versus when it's pretty bright out, they tend to be pretty small.

12
00:00:44,483 --> 00:00:46,355
Because they don't need as much light.

13
00:00:46,355 --> 00:00:48,005
>> Then what about this guy right here?

14
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:52,409
>> Right. That's the lens. Remember how before we were talking about how the light

15
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:54,782
gets bent when it enters the eye?

16
00:00:54,782 --> 00:00:55,333
>> Uh-huh.

17
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:59,429
>> Well, the lens is what does that bending, that focusing, to make sure that the

18
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:04,174
light enters and is focused onto the back of the retina.

19
00:01:04,174 --> 00:01:07,010
>> And when it hits the retina, that's where our rods and cones are, right?

20
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:11,158
>> Yeah, exactly. Those rods and cones are called photoreceptor cells. And so,

21
00:01:11,158 --> 00:01:18,200
this retina actually contains many layers of these rods and cones.

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,287
>> And so, rods, photoreceptor cells, photo means light, receptor means to

23
00:01:22,287 --> 00:01:27,314
receive. They actually are sensitive to primarily black and white vision, and

24
00:01:27,314 --> 00:01:30,170
they help us to see at night time.

25
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,312
>> So then, does that mean the cones help us see color?

26
00:01:32,312 --> 00:01:37,074
>> Exactly. And there's actually three different types of cones. Some are

27
00:01:37,074 --> 00:01:41,023
sensitive to red light, which is a long wavelength. Some are sensitive to green

28
00:01:41,023 --> 00:01:45,273
or medium wavelength light. And some are sensitive to blue, shortwave length

29
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:48,069
light. So, these are used for color vision.
