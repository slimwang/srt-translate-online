00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,540
Here's one way to define look up.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:03,870
Instead of needing the loop,

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,240
we're just going to need to check to if the keyword is in the index,

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,910
if it is, we can return the value associated with that keyword

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,150
using the dictionary look up like this.

6
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:17,204
If it isn't, we return the value none.
