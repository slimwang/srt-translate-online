00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,312
So, here we have our two scatter plots. It kind of looks like the older you

2
00:00:04,312 --> 00:00:09,556
are, the more on time you'll arrive at the party. Let's pretend that this is

3
00:00:09,556 --> 00:00:14,554
the line that best approximates the data. Then we would guess that if you're

4
00:00:14,554 --> 00:00:19,775
about 70 years old, you're more likely to arrive right on time. But if you're

5
00:00:19,775 --> 00:00:25,030
about 20 years old, you're more likely to arrive an hour late. With age and

6
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:30,206
number of pets, it's really dfficult to see if there's a trend going on here.

7
00:00:30,206 --> 00:00:34,916
But it definitely looks like it's positive, maybe something like that. The

8
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:39,806
older you are, the more pets you tend to have. Let's use the Pearson function

9
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:46,613
for Google Spreadsheets to calculate R for each. What is R here and here?
