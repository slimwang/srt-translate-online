1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,990
The first thing we see
in the app delegate is

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,440
application did finish
launching with options.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,710
This happens immediately
after your app launches,

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,010
this might be a good time to set up
your core data stack but not to save.

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,790
After all there is nothing new
worth saving at this point.

6
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:23,680
Next we have application
will resign active.

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,830
This happens when the app's still in
the background but is no longer active.

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:34,590
Not being active means user input, such
as taps, don't reach the app anymore.

9
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,940
This happens when you're using the app
and you get a phone call, for example.

10
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,310
This is a good moment to save.

11
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,910
Next, we have application
did enter background.

12
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,280
This means your app has
been sent to the background

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,820
because the user
switched to another app.

14
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,710
This is also a good time to save.

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,140
Later on we have application
will enter foreground and

16
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,420
application did become active.

17
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,680
These mean that your app is
back from the background,

18
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,710
it wouldn't make much
sense to save in here.

19
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:14,200
And last but not least,
we have application will terminate.

20
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,410
Your app is about to
be killed by the OS.

21
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:22,400
Either the user closed the app or
iOS decided to shut it down,

22
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,370
this sounds like a good time to save but
actually isn't.

23
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,060
You don't have much time
left at this point.

24
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:35,030
You may want to do a print goodbye cruel
world, but anything else is risky.

25
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,080
Why not saving immediately
after creating a new note?

26
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,480
In this case it would be okay,
as our data model is very simple.

27
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:48,260
However, in a more complex app,
it's better not to overdo it and

28
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,785
save too often, unless you know
how to do it in the background.

29
00:01:51,785 --> 00:01:54,990
We'll look at how to do that later.

30
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,990
So this was all very informative but
we still don't have a concrete answer.

31
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,980
If saving every time we change
something is too much saving and saving

32
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:11,009
only when the app goes to the background
or becomes inactive, it's too little.

33
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:12,070
What's the best solution?
