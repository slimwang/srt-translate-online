1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,280
In summary, we had four different major blocks of techniques.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,130
>> You start with the data set or the question that inspires you.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,850
You try to extract the information from it, in the form of, of features.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,100
You feed those features into a machine learning algorithm,

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,360
this is the heart of machine learning.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,190
And then you evaluate that entire process to see how good you've done.

7
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,750
One of the hardest things is actually coming with the data set or

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,480
the question that interests you.

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,010
So one example that I loved was the Enron data set.

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,510
For you, this will be something different.

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,770
>> We spent a lot of time in class on features, how to present features, how to

12
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,740
get rid of features, how to find new feature spaces that actually work better,

13
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,090
and you can apply these techniques to pretty much any data set to get

14
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,290
really reasonable feature sets.

15
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,220
The heart and soul of this class were the algorithms which is

16
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,770
where the most fun is in machine learning.

17
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,952
You know that they are supervised if you have labels,

18
00:00:48,952 --> 00:00:51,150
unsupervised if you don't have labels.

19
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,210
There are actually more classes in machine learning that you can talk about, but

20
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,070
for the sake of this class, this is what we taught you.

21
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,980
And really important is each algorithm needs to be tuned.

22
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,830
We talked about quite a bit how to tune your algorithms.

23
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,140
>> Last but not least will be the evaluation.

24
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,090
How well are you doing?

25
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,650
There's different types of evaluation metrics that you can use.

26
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,700
Depends on, depending on what's most important to you.

27
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,630
And at this point, once you've worked your way through from beginning to end,

28
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,490
the evaluation metric will tell you if you want to go back and

29
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,800
revisit any of these steps.

30
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,360
Or if you're happy with your results and you're ready to move on.

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,720
>> And the cool thing is this is the entire class on one slide.

32
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,340
Isn't that amazing?
