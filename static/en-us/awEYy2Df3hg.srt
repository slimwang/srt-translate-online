00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,250
Vision is the main way humans
gain information about the world.

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,299
I see a cup of tea,
I pick up the cup of tea.

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:10,858
Ever since humans started imagining
machines moving around, and

4
00:00:10,858 --> 00:00:13,793
interacting with the world,
we've given them eyes.

5
00:00:13,792 --> 00:00:17,464
Look at HAL9000 from
2001 A Space Odyssey.

6
00:00:17,464 --> 00:00:19,714
He's just one big eye.

7
00:00:19,714 --> 00:00:24,324
Today, we want automated cars to be
able to distinguish between people, and

8
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:26,384
trees, and the road.

9
00:00:26,385 --> 00:00:30,635
We're enabling our cars to do this
using Convolutional Networks.

10
00:00:30,635 --> 00:00:35,311
Starting with the work of Yann LeCun in
the late 90s, Convolutional Networks,

11
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:39,381
typically shortened to cognets,
gained popularity for detecting and

12
00:00:39,381 --> 00:00:42,323
recognizing hand written characters and
images.

13
00:00:42,323 --> 00:00:46,049
In 2012, a huge data set called,
Imagenet was released.

14
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:50,459
With 1,000 labeled categories, and
over a million training images.

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,277
Alex Krizhevsky's AlexNet, used a deep
Convolutional Network trained on

16
00:00:55,277 --> 00:00:58,518
GPU's to achieve a 15%
error rate on Imagenet.

17
00:00:58,518 --> 00:01:03,046
And this easily beat the second
best attempt that had 26% errors.

18
00:01:03,046 --> 00:01:06,229
In this project, you'll build
a Convolutional Network with TensorFlow,

19
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,410
and it'll recognize objects and images.

20
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:12,439
Here you'll be using
the CIFAR-10 Dataset,

21
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:16,597
which consists of 60,000 images
of ten different objects.

22
00:01:16,597 --> 00:01:20,049
This data set is commonly used
in computer vision research, and

23
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:22,409
now it’s your turn to join the field.

24
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:23,280
Okay, enjoy.
