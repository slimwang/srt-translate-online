00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,190
Let's try and figure out one last pattern with our multiplication. We're going

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:08,480
to start by multiplying each pair of these binomials. Notice that the first term

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,488
is the same in each of the cases. Also notice that the second term is the same

4
00:00:12,488 --> 00:00:16,648
for each of the cases, except the signs are different, One's a plus, and one's a

5
00:00:16,648 --> 00:00:20,861
minus. Use what you know about multiplying binomials to find the product of each

6
00:00:20,861 --> 00:00:21,389
of these.
