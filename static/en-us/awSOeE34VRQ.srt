00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,290
With a wider viewport, things are a
little trickier, but still not too bad.

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:10,500
Here, the green and the light blue
boxes are 50%, but now we've got

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,980
this red box which is taking up about
a third or 33% of its container's width.

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:21,513
And the orange box is taking up two
thirds or 66% of it's container width,

5
00:00:21,513 --> 00:00:26,940
but what's going on when we resize
our viewport from here to here?

6
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,260
At the largest size,
the container around all of the boxes,

7
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,830
becomes fixed width, but the widths of
the elements inside it don't change
