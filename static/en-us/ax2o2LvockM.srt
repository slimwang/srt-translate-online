1
00:00:00,537 --> 00:00:03,617
Here we see the solution to the quiz.

2
00:00:03,617 --> 00:00:11,256
We have defined three new variables, g0, g1 and g2 for California.

3
00:00:11,256 --> 00:00:14,276
Here we are going to plot the variables.

4
00:00:14,276 --> 00:00:16,817
Let's first run this code.

5
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:21,935
Now that the variables are defined, we are going to

6
00:00:21,935 --> 00:00:27,299
first make a plot of g0 and g2 with normed equals 0.

7
00:00:27,299 --> 00:00:31,472
You should see a histogram that looks something like this.

8
00:00:31,472 --> 00:00:36,478
Now we are going to make the histogram of g0 and g1.

9
00:00:36,478 --> 00:00:40,585
Notice we have now changed normed equals 1.

10
00:00:40,585 --> 00:00:43,487
We expect a normalized histogram.

11
00:00:43,487 --> 00:00:47,026
Upon running the code, you should see two histograms.

12
00:00:47,026 --> 00:00:49,322
One in red and one in green.

13
00:00:49,322 --> 00:00:54,110
Notice the values in the y axis have changed.

14
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:59,360
In these histograms, the area under the curve here or

15
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,500
the count in each bin summed up must result to one.
