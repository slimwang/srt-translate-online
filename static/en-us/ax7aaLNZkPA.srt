1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,550
Let's look at an example. A lot of times where you

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,270
find yourself in a situation, where you need to get creative, you're

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,820
probably going to need to scrape data from a website. In

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,950
my experience, this is most often the case when the data is

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,360
provided by a government agency of some kind, or maybe a

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,350
small grasssroots organization. In this case, the example I woild like to

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:22,010
look at is from the US bureau of transportation statistics. So,

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,290
imagine we have a need for among other things to get statistics

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:29,270
on how many flights individual carriers have. To and from

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,080
the airports in the United States. Okay, now this particular

11
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,870
page provides us with a way of getting at that

12
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,850
type of flight data. That is, how many flights say Virgin

13
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:42,520
Atlantic has into and out of Boston Logan Airport. But

14
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,790
in order to get it we have to go through a

15
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,540
lot of work and a lot of manual effort if

16
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,250
we want to pull all the data for all the carriers.

17
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,310
So this is a great example of a situation where we would

18
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,900
problematically deal with this problem. Okay now I've got this zoomed in

19
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,540
big enough so that we can see what's on the page and

20
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,500
as a result the layer is falling apart a little bit so bear

21
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,740
with that. So, let's take a look at how we would use

22
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,550
this site. Now right now, this is providing for us, the number of

23
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:10,810
domestic and international flights for all carriers, US and foreign, with a

24
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:15,370
destination of any airport. So, if I want to get just the data

25
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,300
for Virgin America, and all of the

26
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,750
flights for Virgin into Logan Airport in Boston,

27
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,980
I can make those selections and click submit. And here we have just that data.
