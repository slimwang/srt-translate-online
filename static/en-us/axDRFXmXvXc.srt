00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,830
So let's do an in order versus out of order quiz. So

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,520
let's say that these are the stages of our processor. We have fetch,

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,810
decode, issue instructions, then we dispatch them to execution.

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,590
We have two stages of execution, so everything takes two cycles to execute,

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,590
followed by a broadcast of the result. Then we have a commit stage. And

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,470
then we have a separate stage after commit in which we release the ROB entry.

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:29,680
The question for you is to mark which of these stages are happening in program

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:35,090
order and which one of these are out of order in a out of order processor?
