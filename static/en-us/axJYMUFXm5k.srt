00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,040
Our two equations are y equals 3 x plus 4, which of course incorporates the left

2
00:00:05,052 --> 00:00:09,988
side of this equation, and y equals 19, which deals with the right side. If we

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,385
have these two seperate equations, but we know that at their point of

4
00:00:14,397 --> 00:00:19,560
intersection, they share a y value, then at that point, this y and this y will

5
00:00:19,572 --> 00:00:24,660
be the same. So we can set the other side of each equation equal to each other,

6
00:00:24,772 --> 00:00:26,985
which gives us 3x plus 4 equals 19.
