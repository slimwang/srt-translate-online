1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,790
Stack views are a new UI element.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,450
Introduced in IOS 9 and
as the name suggests,

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,119
they make it easy to stack views.

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:12,012
You can have any UI view
sub-class inside a UI stack view.

5
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:12,840
In PagePerfect,

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,390
we're going to place our play back
buttons inside a set of stacked views.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,280
Stack views can have either
a horizontal or vertical orientation.

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:26,120
You can control the alignment,
distribution and

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,660
spacing of a stack view.

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,340
Stack views can be nested
inside each other.

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,390
Here you can see a vertical
stack view for the entire screen

12
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,870
with horizontal stack views nested
inside for each row of buttons.

13
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,600
The real beauty in using stack
views is that you only need to

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,250
create our layout constraints for
the stack views.

15
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,990
What about all the UI elements
inside the stack view,

16
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,050
like are buttons in PagePerfect?

17
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,010
The stack views create their own
outer layout constraints for

18
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,890
all the UI elements contained in them
based on the alignment, distribution and

19
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,410
spacing settings you provide.

20
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,590
Let that sink in for a second.

21
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,280
Instead of having to create our layout
constraints for all these buttons

22
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,510
we can just embed them in UI stock
views and let them do the work.
