Hi again, now that you've completed
some of your nanodegree projects,

2
00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:08,108
it's time to work on communicating what
you've learned in a job application.

3
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:11,189
You may not be ready to apply to
jobs right now, and that's okay.

4
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:14,509
But you still need to work on your
career development in order to one day

5
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:15,859
be job ready.

6
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:20,114
I want to share a personal story of how
five minutes got me hired at Udacity.

7
00:00:20,114 --> 00:00:23,820
[SOUND] I had just moved across
the country I was not applying to jobs,

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,536
because I wanted to wait another month,
to settle into my new home.

9
00:00:27,536 --> 00:00:30,158
One day, I spoke with a friend
who worked at Udacity, and

10
00:00:30,158 --> 00:00:33,689
she told me there was a job opening
that I would be a good fit for.

11
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:36,780
However, they were already interviewing
other people for the role.

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,120
So if I wanted to be considered,
I had to apply right then.

13
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:41,519
I applied five minutes later.

14
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,880
I was only able to do so
because I already had a resume and

15
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,929
cover letter updated with my
new contact information and

16
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:51,679
targeted to a role at
an education company.

17
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:54,039
My materials had already
been viewed by my peers,

18
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:57,780
gradually, last year and
I refined them multiple times.

19
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,490
So I was confident my
application would be good,

20
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:04,109
I just changed a few key words to
match the job description and applied.

21
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:07,480
If I had taken even just another
day to work on my resume and

22
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,719
cover letter, I would have missed
the window of opportunity and

23
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:11,819
I wouldn't be here with you today.

24
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,329
When your dream job comes
you want to be ready.

25
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:17,079
In this lesson,

26
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:20,640
we will go over how to effectively
conduct a targeted job search.

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,260
Let's get started.
