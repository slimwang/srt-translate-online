00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Evans] We can compute these using the Python interpreter.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You didn't need to submit your code for this. You needed to compute the answers.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And the answers that you should have gotten is that a light bulb,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
the latency distance is approximately 300,000 kilometers;

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
for a CPU register, where the latency is less than 0.4 nanoseconds,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
the equivalent latency distance is 0.12 meters, about 120 centimeters;

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
for the DRAM, DRAM is much cheaper.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The latency is much higher than a CPU register.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That corresponds to 3.6 meters of latency distance.
