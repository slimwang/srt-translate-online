00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,400
Welcome to Linux for Web Developers.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,580
I'm Mike Wills and
I'll be your instructor for this course.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,150
Every time you visit a web application,
your browser is requesting a number of

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,180
files that are sitting on a server
somewhere out there on the Internet.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,260
More often than not,
that server is running Linux.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,210
Therefore, as you develop and get ready
to launch your own web applications,

7
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,000
it's critical that you understand
how these servers work and

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,920
how to get your web application up and
running on one.

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,475
In this course you'll do just that.

10
00:00:27,475 --> 00:00:30,220
You'll start with a quick
introduction to Linux, and

11
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,570
you begin exploring
the Linux file system.

12
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,520
How are files organized,
where do they belong.

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,690
I'll then introduce you to a number
of Linux security concepts.

14
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,640
Managing users, how to understand
permission system, firewalls, and

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,350
package or software management.

16
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:48,290
Finally, you'll get a very
basic web application up and

17
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:53,250
running using the Apache web server,
and a postscript SQL database server.

18
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,220
Managing and configuring servers is one
of my favorite parts of this career.

19
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,890
There's something very powerful in
knowing that you've taken a server from

20
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,690
zero to hero, all on your own and are in
full control of it's capabilities.

21
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,590
I think you'll enjoy this experience,
and in the end, you'll be able to

22
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,930
truly share your web applications with
others while having the most intimate,

23
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,270
low level knowledge of how people
are actually receiving and

24
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,700
experiencing your application.
