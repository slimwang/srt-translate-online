1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,970
So, finally to summarize, we introduced
the concept of video textures in this

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,540
lecture, talked about various methods
of how we can compute similarity.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,815
We talked about how similar frames
can be used to find similar points.

4
00:00:12,815 --> 00:00:17,080
And, and we can actually use that
to jump, arc back and forward and

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:22,340
that would allow us to kind of generate
a much more infinitely looping video.

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,390
We talked about how blending,
fading and cuts and

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,480
all that kind of stuff can
also be used in the domain or

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,860
video, then we talked about variety
of extensions of video textures.

9
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,700
Listing here a lotta
papers have come in,

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,070
including the three papers
from us that we worked on,

11
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,230
but there are additional papers that
you might actually find interesting.

12
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,040
Panoramic video textures
is another interesting one.

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,140
And actually these days of
course as we talked about it,

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,710
there's much more work going on
in trying to create cinemagraphs.

15
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,690
I'll show examples of that in
one of my future lectures too.

16
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,700
Again, look at my website and
of course as usual, search around,

17
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,430
you'll find lots of beautiful examples
of this kind of stuff on the web.
