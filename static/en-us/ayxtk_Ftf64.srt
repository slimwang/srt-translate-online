1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,500
Trust among HISPs is another challenge.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,900
Earlier we said that the HISP
established trust by

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,530
verifying that Doctors Johnson and
Jones are who they say they are and

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,980
that they are licensed physicians
in their practice state.

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,830
That's fairly easy to
do on a local basis.

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,780
Suppose, however,
that physicians in two states, or

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,870
even two regions of the country,
want to use direct.

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:27,330
They will almost certainly be
connected to different HISPs,

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,009
each of which established its own
policies for establishing trust.

10
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,330
Nationwide there could
be hundreds of HISPs.

11
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,870
Is each of them going to
have to investigate and

12
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:42,100
contract with all the others to make
sure they can trust each other?

13
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,040
That gets unwieldy fast, as shown here.

14
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,230
Direct Trust was established
to provide a solution

15
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,110
by establishing a trust community.

16
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,390
As the number of HISPs increases,
the number of trust

17
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:02,020
relationships needed doubles
as ten more HISPs are added?

18
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,000
Triples as 30 more HISPs are added?

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,400
Grows exponentially?

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,200
Depends on where the HISPs are located?
