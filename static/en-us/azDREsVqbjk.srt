00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,620
After a series of various steps, all of which you're pretty familiar with, we

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,046
end up with a final answer of z equals negative 3. And of course, it's super

3
00:00:09,046 --> 00:00:13,479
important to check our answer. We just plug negative 3 in to the left side of

4
00:00:13,479 --> 00:00:18,159
the equation and negative 15 over negative 3 is indeed equal to 5, which is what

5
00:00:18,159 --> 00:00:20,892
our right-hand side equals. So we're good.
