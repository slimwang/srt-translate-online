1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,200
So one of the things you'll do when
bringing people on to your project,

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,120
is have consultations.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,300
You might have a designer or an engineer
come in to help you understand

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,750
what would be part of your
minimum buyable product, and

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,620
what might need to go in
a version two or version three.

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,280
To do that,
we've brought in James and Karl.

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,310
Now guys, we have this app here, this
is a prototype built out in envision.

8
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,930
And the idea is that it is
an essentially a to do list or

9
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,720
calendar app.

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,420
And I want to understand sort of
what we would go about making first,

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,990
if we wanted to make
a version zero of this.

12
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:36,080
So as you can see,
we've got these sort of welcome screens,

13
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,930
these sort of home screens.

14
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,894
And as we go on we've got a bunch of
extra features that I thought were

15
00:00:40,894 --> 00:00:42,201
really cool that we added on.

16
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:45,540
We've got, you can view your tasks
by the month or by the week,

17
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,564
you can see an overview of
what tasks you've completed,

18
00:00:48,564 --> 00:00:51,540
what proportion of tasks
you've completed over time.

19
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,130
You can also see tasks grouped
up in certain ways, so

20
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,860
you know all the tasks about cars or
all the recipes you've wanted to make.

21
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,620
And then you've also got
sort of a profile and

22
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,960
a timeline of things we've done.

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,420
And then sort of general
settings screens and a menu.

24
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,695
Does that make sense?

25
00:01:07,695 --> 00:01:08,473
>> Mm-hm.

26
00:01:08,473 --> 00:01:09,482
>> Sure.

27
00:01:09,482 --> 00:01:13,490
>> So, I'm really excited
about getting this built.

28
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,450
First off, James, as a designer, what
are the things that you would like to

29
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,900
focus on in making this
a better app right now?

30
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,390
>> Color.

31
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,880
I would probably change this
color palette and then,

32
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,640
I really like this overview screen,
like this graphic is really cool.

33
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,970
But I'd probably pull some
colors from the images,

34
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:40,340
like maybe from your title bar and
use the Palette Library for

35
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,590
Android to make it kind
of more interesting.

36
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,954
And I really like this group setting.

37
00:01:45,954 --> 00:01:49,942
And that's another place where
I might change up the colors,

38
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:54,315
I might use more interesting
topography to make it more impactful of

39
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:58,764
how many items I have in this
automotive area, or books or whatever,

40
00:01:58,764 --> 00:02:03,420
because that's not that readable
>> That makes sense.

41
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,020
And Carl, how does that sound to you?

42
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,570
Do you think that that would be
a reasonable set of things to start

43
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,860
working on as every one?

44
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,330
>> Well, there's a lot here
in this envision prototype.

45
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,870
I think that we should probably talk
about some of the core elements

46
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,410
before progressing into building
absolutely every screen.

47
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:25,229
We probably want to talk about just the
most interesting interaction elements.

48
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,840
So for instance,
I have to question whether or

49
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,760
not we really need high
fidelity graphs at this point.

50
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,150
We're talking about
building a to-do app.

51
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,840
So, let's focus on the core
elements of managing to dos.

52
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,670
>> Okay.

53
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:44,190
So if I'm understanding you correctly,
we want to at least have as our first

54
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,920
bit, building out, making a to-do,
checking off a to-do, things like that.

55
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,220
>> Yeah, that's right.

56
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,437
>> And
do you think that it's worthwhile for

57
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:53,474
us to build out those small features?

58
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:57,760
This stuff is really cool and we wanted
to include that in the app in the end.

59
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,920
>> Ultimately, we can make
the app as big and featureful and

60
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,690
fancy as you want.

61
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,110
The thing that we have to do though
is express the core elements first,

62
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,720
the core functionality.

63
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,570
What are users actually
doing with this app?

64
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,540
And in this case they're
managing their to dos,

65
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,540
they're managing a little
bit of their life.

66
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,820
So we have to make that easy.

67
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,470
We have to bring that to the forefront.

68
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:25,130
There's a lot of extraneous views
here that maybe don't support that

69
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,430
core work flow.

70
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,570
And so let's, I think it would best for

71
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,250
us to focus on the core
elements going forward.

72
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:31,940
>> Okay.

73
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,480
Now James, with what Carl just said,
that we want to focus on the core

74
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,756
elements, what would
we be able to work on?

75
00:03:37,756 --> 00:03:39,955
What would we be able
to use your time on,

76
00:03:39,955 --> 00:03:42,630
to make these core elements
a little bit better?

77
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,870
Right now, that core element if I'm
understanding it right, we would want

78
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,640
to have this screen where we have these
to-dos and be able to check them off.

79
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,140
We would want, sort of our screen
of actually making a to-do.

80
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:57,880
And then we'd want something
like I don't know, a calendar or

81
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,670
something, to help manage their life.

82
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,550
>> Okay, so if we're focusing
on those three screens,

83
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,470
starting with this general
overview to do screen,

84
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:11,890
I would focus on the transitions between
that screen and the creating a to do,

85
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:16,430
just to make it more instructive and
make more intuitive for the user.

86
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,370
For this calendar,
probably a similar type thing, and

87
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:28,140
just focus more in making it glanceable
and more easy to read for, this

88
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:32,870
is the to do I have, this is what I need
to do at this moment, or for this day.

89
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,280
>> So even if we're just
building a small feature set,

90
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,668
there's still stuff for
you as a designer to work.

91
00:04:35,668 --> 00:04:36,632
>> Oh definitely.

92
00:04:36,632 --> 00:04:40,023
>> Okay, so, you know, we've been
talking about this small feature set,

93
00:04:40,023 --> 00:04:42,319
and I'm not sure if this
is actually a set that we,

94
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,250
I have the ability to pay you guys for
yet.

95
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,420
I have a relatively small budget for
this and

96
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,520
I want to make sure that we can
get this done within that budget.

97
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,520
>> Well, I think we should adopt
a philosophy of launch and iterate here.

98
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,310
That'll give us the agility to
move where our users are going

99
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:02,340
with our software, and allow us to
really focus on min viability first.

100
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:07,300
>> Okay, so I think we probably have
enough to pay you guys to make this

101
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,450
initial minimum viable product
really good, really beautiful,

102
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,880
and actually functional.

103
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,790
And then from there we can use the rest
of my budget as the users dictate.

104
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,750
>> I think that's a great idea.

105
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,780
>> Perfect, so that's how
a consultation session might go.

106
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,560
You'll have some concerns from either
side and you'll have to balance them.

107
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,600
>> And at the end you'll hopefully have
a sense of what is the minimum viable

108
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,470
product you'll be building.

109
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,810
As you go through this, you'll have
multiple consultation sessions

110
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,180
at each release of the app,
and it might be valuable for

111
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,150
you to bring these concerns
in every step of the process.
