00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let me do the same quiz again.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now we have two landmarks,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and the picture I'm giving you is a robot with three total positions.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
There's a landmark here and a landmark here,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and say this landmark is being seen in these two positions,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and this landmark these two poses, but landmark L1 is not seen at x2,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and landmark L2 is not seen at x0.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Of the 30 fields over here how many of them will never be touched?

9
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please put your answer over here.
