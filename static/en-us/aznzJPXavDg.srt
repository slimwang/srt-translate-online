1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,969
So we wanted to find all of
the animals that are not gorillas and

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:06,000
also not named Max.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,740
So we could do it this way.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,990
Select name from animals where
not species equals gorilla,

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,460
and not name equals Max.

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,170
Or here's another way we can do it.

7
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,519
There's a logic rule
called Demorgans law,

8
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:26,103
that lets us switch not X and
not Y into not X or Y.

9
00:00:26,103 --> 00:00:29,857
So we can say select name
from animals where not

10
00:00:29,857 --> 00:00:34,484
parenthesis species equals gorilla or
name equals max.

11
00:00:34,484 --> 00:00:36,550
That will do the same thing.

12
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,330
Or hey, here's a third way.

13
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:43,960
SQL supports the not equals or bang
equals operator, just like python does.

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,540
So we can say, select name from animals,

15
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:52,690
where species not equals gorilla,
and name not equals Max.

16
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,630
Any one of those three
will work just fine.

17
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,690
They'll all produce the same results.
