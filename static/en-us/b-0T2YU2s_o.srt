00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:02,916
So, let's say for example when your studying for this lesson you make an

2
00:00:02,916 --> 00:00:07,300
outline using headings that are similar to chapters in a book. So first would

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:11,800
be memory, and probably types of memory like short term and long term. And then

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,768
underneath each of these you'd get more specific. And then you would add things

5
00:00:15,768 --> 00:00:19,184
on this list that we're going to cover later in the lesson. The biological side

6
00:00:19,184 --> 00:00:23,390
of memory or forgetting. And under each sub category you get more and more

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:29,233
specific. This is an example of what? An associative network? A schema? A

8
00:00:29,233 --> 00:00:33,059
hierarchy? Or a mnemonic device? Select one.
