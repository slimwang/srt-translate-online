1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,330
The next step is to add
a second horizontal stack view.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,450
So that it can hold a chipmunk and
Darth Vader sound effect buttons.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,900
With the main storyboard file open and

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,900
the play sounds viewer controller
selected, open the main storyboard file,

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,650
and select the play
sounds view controller.

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,760
Let's search for
stack view here in the objects library.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,050
Drag a horizontal stock for

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,750
you from the object library
into the document outline.

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,556
Make sure that it's embedded
inside the vertical stack view,

10
00:00:28,556 --> 00:00:33,150
our outer most stack view
here in the document outline.

11
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:37,220
The easiest way is to drag it above
the first horizontal stack view and

12
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,800
reorder them here in
the document outline.

13
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,540
Your document outline should look
similar to what you see here.

14
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,210
One more thing, with this new
horizontal stuff you selected,

15
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,298
change the distribution setting in
the attribution specter to fill equally.

16
00:00:52,298 --> 00:00:56,560
Xcode may be warning you
about auto layout constraints

17
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,540
because this new horizontal stack view
does not have any UI elements inside it.

18
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,270
A search for buttons here,

19
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,220
I'm going to drag one under
our Neo horizontal stack view.

20
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,320
In the actually inspector I'm
going to remove the text for

21
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,940
this buttons title and
changes image to chipmunk.

22
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,120
I'm going to rename it here in
a document outline, the chipmunk button.

23
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,980
We need to follow the same steps
to create the Darth Vader button.

24
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,030
We'll drag a button from the object
library underneath the new

25
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:29,360
horizontal stack view,
remove the text from the title and

26
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,640
this time change
the image to Darth Vader.

27
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,520
We need to make sure that these
buttons are on the same level.

28
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,700
That is, they're inside
this horizontal stack view.

29
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,760
We can do that by toggling
this disclosure triangle here.

30
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,230
That was easy, now we have four buttons
in this view perfectly aligned and

31
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,710
we have not had to add a single
auto layer constraint.
