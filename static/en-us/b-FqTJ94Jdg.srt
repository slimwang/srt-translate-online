00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,470
Creating individual triangles by hand is pretty painful, as you probably noticed

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,738
from the exercises so far. The most common way to generate geometric objects is

3
00:00:08,738 --> 00:00:12,774
to use a modeling program. Writing such program is the bread and butter for the

4
00:00:12,774 --> 00:00:16,560
company I work for, Auto Desk. Here, I'm using 3 studio max to create a number

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,292
of basic objects including the tea polyhedron. There are plenty of other ways to

6
00:00:20,292 --> 00:00:24,864
acquire models. For example, laser scanners can be used to find a cloud of

7
00:00:24,864 --> 00:00:29,362
points. This data is then processed to make a mesh. Another method is to take a

8
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:33,747
series of photos and have a program derive the shape of the object from these.

9
00:00:33,748 --> 00:00:37,595
Whatever process is used you normally end up with the geometric mesh of

10
00:00:37,595 --> 00:00:41,967
triangles. Within Web GL on 3JS, there's a whole process where you can take a

11
00:00:41,967 --> 00:00:46,068
mesh in some 3D file format and convert it to a form that Web GL can read. I

12
00:00:46,068 --> 00:00:49,780
could spend the next few units discussing this process, but it's not all that

13
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,790
relative to interactive rendering itself. Take a look in the additional course

14
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,923
materials for it to learn more about this.
