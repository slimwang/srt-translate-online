1
00:00:00,228 --> 00:00:04,083
So let’s look at a coin. It has outcome 0-1 and

2
00:00:04,083 --> 00:00:07,617
we’ve already learned that the probability

3
00:00:07,617 --> 00:00:11,687
of the sum equals exactly K for N coin flips;

4
00:00:11,687 --> 00:00:14,145
; looks like this cryptic formula over here:

5
00:00:14,145 --> 00:00:17,665
N factorial divided by N minus K factorial and

6
00:00:17,665 --> 00:00:20,334
K factorial. And then we had some other term here,

7
00:00:20,334 --> 00:00:23,299
if the coin is fair, it is like 2 to the minus

8
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:25,401
N. Right now, I’m just going to care about these

9
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:27,485
coins over here. I won't care about the probability

10
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,979
for the time being. I want you to help me

11
00:00:29,979 --> 00:00:34,049
construct a table for these counts as N gets larger.

12
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:36,726
So we start with N equals 1, go all the way to N

13
00:00:36,726 --> 00:00:40,092
equals 4, obviously outcomes range from zero

14
00:00:40,092 --> 00:00:43,962
all the way to 4 at 4 coin flips. So here’s our

15
00:00:43,962 --> 00:00:46,845
table. It’s also quite obvious that these guys

16
00:00:46,845 --> 00:00:49,275
over here can never occur: if you flip the coin

17
00:00:49,275 --> 00:00:52,130
only once, the outcome can’t be 2. So we’re going

18
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,422
to fill out this table over here together for the

19
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:57,816
coin over here. Tell me, for N equals 1, what are

20
00:00:57,816 --> 00:00:59,782
the two values that go right over here,

21
00:00:59,782 --> 00:01:02,000
just those two values.
