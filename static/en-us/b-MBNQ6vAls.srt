Thanks, Susan. So, tolerance means that more of a drug is needed to produce the

2
00:00:04,624 --> 00:00:09,810
original effects. So, for example, a person might take meth, and on subsequent

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,586
occasions have to take a higher dose to produce the same feelings they did the

4
00:00:13,586 --> 00:00:19,332
first time they used it. This is also true for alcohol. One glass of wine after

5
00:00:19,332 --> 00:00:24,245
repeated use will not produce the same effects, so a person has to drink more.

6
00:00:24,245 --> 00:00:29,705
Tolerance is the body's way of trying to adjust to the constant presence of the

7
00:00:29,705 --> 00:00:31,459
drug.
