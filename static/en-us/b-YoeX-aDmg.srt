00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This is a quick overview on the concept of velocity,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
which is more or less the same as the concept of derivative,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
which could be called rate of change in general terms.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If you are already acquainted with that, you may want to skip to the quiz.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Imagine this situation: that we have a high-speed train on the track

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
that is labeled from -100 km to +100 km.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So the track is 200 km long.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And this is our timetable.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The train starts here at -100 km, and drives at a pretty high speed

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
'til 1½ hours after the start.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Then it stops at this position, 50 km.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It continues somewhat slower for 1 hour, 'til it reaches that position at +100 km.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Then it immediately returns to the position x = 0,

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
4 hours after it started.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This is, if you will, a mathematical view of the train's time table.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Let's rotate this by 90° to get something that's more typical for physics.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So now I've taken this diagram and rotated it by 90°

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
to come up with that diagram.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The t-axis now points to the right, and the x-axis now points upward.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We can create a second diagram from that that shows the velocity.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So here the train advances at 100 km/h, here it's just 50 km/h.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Here the train goes backward with 100 km/h.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So maybe a good idea is to label this axis with +100 km/h and -100 km/h.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So here we have a velocity of +100 km/h, here too,

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and then the train stops, which means we have a velocity of 0.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And here the train starts again and makes 50 km/h

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
which is just half as much as before.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And here we are going backward with 100 km/h as its speed,

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
so the velocity is -100 km/h.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This is what the velocity looks like.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So if you're going forward, it's positive, if you're going backward, its negative.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So what we see here is the velocity of the train, depending on time.

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That's nothing but the rate of change of the position, which we call x,

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
by how much does x change if a certain amount of time passes.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The rate of change would be the ratio.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
For instance, this ratio: 100 km divided by 1 hour -- the velocity of 100 km/h.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
In this case, the ratio would be 50 km divided by 1 hour; 50 km/h.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So what we are drawing here is the rate of change of the x position,

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
nothing but the velocity, and this is the very same as the derivative.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The derivative tells us the local rate of change.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Here the derivative is 100 km/h, here it's 0, here it's 50 km/h, and here it's negative.

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
As the time advances, the x position decreases.

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
A negative derivative, negative velocity, negative rate of change.

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The standard way of writing that: v of t, the velocity depending on t.

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:00,000
One way of writing it is dx of t by dt, or x prime of t,

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
or, and this is what the physicists are using, x dot of t.

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm going to stick to that notation.

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Whenever physicists want to compute the rate of change

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
with respect to time, they put a dot on top of that variable.
