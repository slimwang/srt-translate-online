00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,260
What are angel investors and how can
they help you finance your business?

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,220
Angel investors are people who invest
their own money into a new business,

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,090
offering capital for
startup or expansion.

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:15,210
These investors usually aren't rich, but
like the idea of investing in startups

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,070
as an alternative to returns they could
be getting by investing in stocks.

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,810
Considering these motivations is
important when understanding some of

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,270
the benefits and
downsides of working with them.

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,080
So let's look at some benefits
of working with angel investors.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,200
Here's three, investment amounts,
accessibility, and ease of engagement.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,400
First, investment amounts.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,240
Angels tend to be willing to invest
an amount of money that's great for

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,600
many startups.

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,405
As an estimate, it's possible to get
from as little as $25,000 to as much as

14
00:00:44,405 --> 00:00:46,620
1.5 million for your startup.

15
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,960
Next, accessibility.

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,850
Angels can really be anywhere.

17
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,820
These are just people with some
extra money to invest looking for

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,590
the right startup to
get some good returns.

19
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,880
They could be right down the street or
at local meet-ups.

20
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,410
You'll find it much easier to get
in touch with angels than with

21
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,510
any other type of investor.

22
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,910
And finally, ease of engagement.

23
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,220
Once you've found an angel
who is interested,

24
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,840
it's generally pretty easy to
get through the paperwork.

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,820
You're also likely to get
paid in a single lump sum.

26
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,240
This can speed up the time it takes for
you to get some money and

27
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,299
start growing your business.

28
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:22,070
So those are some of
the benefits of angel investors.

29
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,530
Now, what are some of the downsides?

30
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:29,830
Let's look at three, high rate of
return, risk aversion, and control.

31
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:33,660
First, they'll want a pretty high rate
of return on their original investment.

32
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,560
You're competing with their option
to invest in the stock market and

33
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,930
if you don't provide enough growth,
they're probably not interested.

34
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,814
Next, risk aversion.

35
00:01:41,814 --> 00:01:45,600
Angels aren't using expendable
income that they can afford to lose.

36
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,327
No one likes losing money, but the
financial situation of these investors

37
00:01:49,327 --> 00:01:52,358
makes them particularly cautious
with the way they invest.

38
00:01:52,358 --> 00:01:55,985
You're less likely to get an angel
investment if you have any high risk,

39
00:01:55,985 --> 00:01:58,134
high reward type of plan for
your startup.

40
00:01:58,134 --> 00:02:00,897
And finally,
because they want a high rate of return,

41
00:02:00,897 --> 00:02:02,893
they can try to be pretty controlling.

42
00:02:02,893 --> 00:02:06,307
Angel investors may want to be involved
in more of the decisions you'll make and

43
00:02:06,307 --> 00:02:09,310
could end up affecting
the direction of your business.

44
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,320
They could be helpful, but be sure to
balance their advice with what you

45
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,120
believe is best for the company.

46
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,550
Angel investors can provide
an excellent opportunity for

47
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,960
growth in the early
stages of your company.

48
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,930
Take some time to consider the positives
and negatives of dealing with these

49
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,500
investors, then decide if
this option is right for you
