Let's consider a different equation, y equals negative 5x squared. We know the

2
00:00:06,312 --> 00:00:11,239
vertex for this parabola will be at the origin, 0,0. We can easily see that,

3
00:00:11,239 --> 00:00:16,293
since every we plug in an x value of zero, zero squared will be zero. And zero

4
00:00:16,293 --> 00:00:21,408
times negative 5 would give us a y value equal to zero. But what are some other

5
00:00:21,408 --> 00:00:25,799
points on the graph. What I'd like you to do is use the a value to determine

6
00:00:25,799 --> 00:00:30,764
two other points that are on this parabola. When you think you've got them,

7
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:33,300
check them off on the graph.
