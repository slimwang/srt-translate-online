1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,730
The answer is that
the behavior is undefined.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,320
The processes don't complete.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,240
They both initiate sends and
then wait for the send to complete.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,330
But remember,

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,130
there's an ambiguity about what
complete means in the case of a send.

6
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,180
It might be that there's
some copying going on, but

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,890
it might be that the message
is very large and

8
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,900
the implementation has
decided to wait for delivery.

9
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,600
In the latter case,
that's a problem because it means that

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,830
neither process can ever
execute its receive.

11
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,450
The result is deadlock, each process is
waiting for the other to do something,

12
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:30,210
but no one does it.
