00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,695
Now here's the important part, our equation started off balanced, and then we

2
00:00:04,695 --> 00:00:10,206
changed it. We tried to complete the square, by adding an amount. And in this

3
00:00:10,206 --> 00:00:15,827
case we didn't just add 16, we really added 2 times that, or 32. So, we need to

4
00:00:15,827 --> 00:00:20,462
do something in order to get this equation back and balance. Since we added 32

5
00:00:20,462 --> 00:00:24,474
to the right, we could also add 32 to the left, but I really don't want to do

6
00:00:24,474 --> 00:00:28,758
this since eventually I just want to get y alone or isolated on one side of the

7
00:00:28,758 --> 00:00:36,464
equation. So, what operation should we perform here and the same operation here

8
00:00:36,464 --> 00:00:41,936
in order to make our equation balanced? As a hint think about what you would

9
00:00:41,936 --> 00:00:46,110
need to do in order to make this equation not change.
