00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,000
What's a mission statement, and
how do you write one for your startup?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,310
Let's define what a mission statement
is, what questions it should answer,

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,880
and then go over some guidelines you
can use to write one for your business.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,010
So first, what is it?

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,965
A mission statement Is a statement
of your company's functions,

6
00:00:15,965 --> 00:00:17,715
market, and goals.

7
00:00:17,715 --> 00:00:20,635
The purpose of your mission statement
is to ground your big dream,

8
00:00:20,635 --> 00:00:23,410
in terms of the steps you
plan to take to reach it.

9
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,965
You'll focus on what you're
capable of right now and

10
00:00:25,965 --> 00:00:28,145
what you can achieve in the near future.

11
00:00:28,145 --> 00:00:30,215
There's a few basic questions
that a mission statement

12
00:00:30,215 --> 00:00:31,915
should be able to answer.

13
00:00:31,915 --> 00:00:33,255
What do you do?

14
00:00:33,255 --> 00:00:34,555
Who do you do it for?

15
00:00:34,555 --> 00:00:36,530
And how do you do it?

16
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,120
Your mission statement should take
the vision you've created and

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,870
define what you plan
to do to achieve it.

18
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,500
So how long should your
mission statement be?

19
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,230
This is similar to a vision statement,

20
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,020
in that there's no set
length that it needs to be.

21
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,450
Some mission statements can
be a single sentence and

22
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,230
some can be a full paragraph, just make
sure you're providing the clarity needed

23
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,480
to give direction to you and your team.

24
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,249
Focus on the actual value that
you provide to your users.

25
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,420
For example,

26
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,660
Google's vision is to provide access to
the world's information in one click.

27
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,310
But their mission statement
is a little more specific.

28
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,070
Google's mission is to organize
the world's information and

29
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,440
make it universally accessible and
useful.

30
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,330
Do you see how their
mission statement describes

31
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,180
the way in which they plan
to achieve their vision?

32
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,210
They organize information and
make it accessible.

33
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:26,640
Try to provide a similar clarity for
your mission statement.

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,330
So, now that you know a little more
about the purpose of a mission

35
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,100
statement, take some time to come
up with one that you could use for

36
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:32,640
your company.
