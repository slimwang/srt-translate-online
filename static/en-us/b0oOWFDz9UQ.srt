1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,930
When we look at the plot, a few things

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:05,030
pop out right away. We can see a nonlinear

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:09,400
relationship. Maybe it's exponential or maybe it's something else.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,656
We can see that the dispersion or variance of

5
00:00:12,656 --> 00:00:17,282
the relationship also increases as carat size increases. With

6
00:00:17,282 --> 00:00:19,298
just a quick look at the data we've learned

7
00:00:19,298 --> 00:00:22,658
two important things about the functional relationship between price

8
00:00:22,658 --> 00:00:25,300
and carat size. We can add a linear trim

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,236
line to the plot by using the stat smooth function

10
00:00:29,236 --> 00:00:32,515
with method equals lm. We can see that the linear

11
00:00:32,515 --> 00:00:35,287
trend line doesn't go through the center of the data

12
00:00:35,287 --> 00:00:38,572
at some key places. It misses it here. It should

13
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:41,947
curve a little bit in the center of the relationship,

14
00:00:41,947 --> 00:00:44,863
and it should slope up more toward the end. And

15
00:00:44,863 --> 00:00:47,671
if we tried to use this to make predictions, we

16
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:50,695
might be off for some key places inside and outside

17
00:00:50,695 --> 00:00:53,450
of the existing data that we have displayed.
