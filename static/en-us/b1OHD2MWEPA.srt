00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,798
Now I have a few very tricky questions which doesn't require you to calculate

2
00:00:03,798 --> 00:00:09,052
the correlation coefficients but you really need to think about these. Let's

3
00:00:09,052 --> 00:00:15,690
say that the x variable is age in years and the y variable is age in months.

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,782
For example, if we plotted all students' age in years on the x axis and their

5
00:00:19,782 --> 00:00:25,901
age in months on the y axis. What would the correlation coefficient be?
