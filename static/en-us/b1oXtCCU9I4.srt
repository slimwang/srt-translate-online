1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,990
Starting with this weird selector, right here,

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:07,300
with dollar sign open parenthesis, quotes, quotes, close parenthesis.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,990
This is an indication that you're using jQuery.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,140
The dollar sign parenthesis quotes syntax is only used for

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,180
jQuery, and it grabs an element on the page, which in this case,

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:21,090
is the class identified by this .super-header-wrapper.

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,090
We run the .html method on it, which in this case is going to replace the HTML

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:32,100
of everything of the class super-header-wrapper with the HTML we see right here.

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,600
In this case, this HTML is going to embed a picture.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,210
So, when I press Enter, we can see that we've now changed the Udacity homepage

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,750
to this awesome picture of the Android teaching on the Udacity platform.

12
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,320
>> That is an awesome picture and just to be clear, you only made the change for

13
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,740
this local copy of the page, not the actual website.

14
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:56,880
So if you refresh the page, you'll see that it goes back to normal
