00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
You've already learned quite a lot in the last 6 units:

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,620
How to recognize challenging problems,

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,150
the theory of NP-completeness, and how you can,

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,030
nevertheless, solve these challenging problems using exact techniques

5
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:17,280
such as search trees, pre-processing, or fixed parameter tractability, or approximate method.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,900
So approximation algorithms, or randomization.

7
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,430
So far, all of the problems that we have looked at have had 1 thing in common:

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:29,540
If you gave the computer enough time, and it has enough memory, then eventually you'll get an answer.

9
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:33,210
So, of course, if you have an intractable problem, say an NP-complete one

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,710
or an NP-hard one, then, of course, you will have to wait a long, long time to get your answer.

11
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,730
The computer is, at least in principle, able to give you an answer.

12
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,750
In this unit, we will be looking at the ultimate limits of computation.

13
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,020
What that means is, I will show you some problems

14
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,010
that are not hard to solve, but are impossible to solve.

15
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,870
So the computer has no idea how to do this.

16
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,960
And there's 2 surprising things waiting for you.

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,700
First of all, these problems here are very simple, surprisingly simple.

18
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,810
And the second thing is, although these problems are totally impossible to solve,

19
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,240
actually, your computer is probably solving them every day.

20
00:01:09,240 --> 99:59:59,999
So some baffling things await you in this final unit of our course.
