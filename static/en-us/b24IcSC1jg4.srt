00:00:00,348 --> 00:00:03,050
Before we can get started
using the Movie Database API,

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:04,760
you'll need to sign up for an account.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,160
To do this go tot he Login or
Account Login at the top of the site.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,780
Then you'll want to follow the link
that says click here to get started.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,970
For this exercise go ahead and
sign up for an account with TheMovieDB.

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,080
Then once you're signed up,
get an API key.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,360
Also, I highly encourage you

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,310
to play around with some
of TheMovideDB features.

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,280
So try favoriting a movie, or
create a list, or go and rate a movie.

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,250
And when you're done, check the box.
