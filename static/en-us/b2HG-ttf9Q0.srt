1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,719
>> Alright, so we have our code. We have our editor. Let's open up the code

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:05,210
in the editor. We can just pull this

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,820
over from Finder and have this nice little sidebar.

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,360
>> That is cool. I had no idea you could do that. Okay, so these

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,630
are all our files. This is looking

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,050
familiar now. I played around with these before.

7
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,020
>> Okay.

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,470
>> So this, these are all JavaScript files.

9
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,970
I don't want to look at them right now.

10
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,160
>> Alright. The one that seemed most important was the index file.

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,260
>> Mm-hm, yeah. So this is the

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,170
HTML that we saw in the browser earlier.

13
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,560
>> Yeah. And so, so right, this is the HTML.

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,475
This is that great container with the rows and the cells.

15
00:00:33,475 --> 00:00:35,330
>> Mm-hm.

16
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,743
>> I had some different tiles. I made a Udacity flavored version of this app.

17
00:00:37,743 --> 00:00:41,040
>> Okay. I want to get them in there. So, basically,

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,660
I want these different, the two tile, the four tile-

19
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:44,190
>> Mm-hm.

20
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,310
>> To be something different.

21
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,030
>> Okay, so just replace the pictures.

22
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,340
>> Yeah, should we do that in here or is that going to happen in the CSS?

23
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,510
>> Well, let's see. Do we see anything in here about the pictures themselves?

24
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,390
>> I don't know.

25
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,940
>> Alright, so let's try looking.

26
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,580
>> So, you open up Style.

27
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,330
>> Yeah, so we've got a couple of different CSS.

28
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,020
>> So, the one we were playing with before

29
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,660
was the main, so maybe that's the place to go.

30
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,110
>> Yeah, that's probably, probably the best place to look.

31
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,970
>> Okay, so I'm going to search around for tiles and make some changes?

32
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:15,510
>> Alright.

33
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:15,760
>> Cool.
