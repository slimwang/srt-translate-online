1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,150
So to get our outputs in the correct range,

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,130
we're going to use the Modulus Operator. And this

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,750
is written with a percent sign. It's usually the

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,680
Shift 5 on most keyboards. What modulus does is

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,129
takes a number and maps it to the range

6
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,930
based on the remainder when you divide that number.

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,410
So the way modulo arithmetic works, is like a

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,070
clock. So if we think of having a clock with

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,910
12 hours, and then arithmetic on the clock is modulo 12. So if we

10
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:36,010
were to evaluate 14 modulo 12, what that would mean is,

11
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:40,910
well, if we start from 0, and we make 14 steps, we're

12
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:46,210
going to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,

13
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:51,070
12, 13, 14. Where we end up is 2. That's the same

14
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:55,330
as the remainder we would get by dividing 14 by 12. And

15
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:59,510
that's the result of 14 modulo 12, is 2. So now we're

16
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,950
going to have a few quizzes, to make sure you that understand the

17
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:06,750
Modulus Operator, as well as the org and char operators we introduced.
