1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
To answer this we're going to use this trick,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and that means we need to get p(x).

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Let's call the highly actives in our sample x to simplify our notation.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So, we need that less than 2 and that is going to be

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:34,000
equal to p(x = 0) + p(x = 1).

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Each of these is a binomial variable.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Recall what we need to figure out is the probability of the result being true--

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:01:04,000
the probability of getting a highly-active user--p(x) = 1000/100,000, which is 0.01.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The probability of x = 0--since this can only be arranged one way

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:22,000
we don't even need to know about binomials--is 0.99¹⁰.

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The probability of x equaling 1 is going to be 10!/9!1!. * 0.99⁹ * 0.01¹.

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So, if we total this all together, we get [0.099573],

13
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and then we'll recall from this formula over here we wanted the opposite thing,

14
00:01:57,000 --> 99:59:59,999
so we just take 1 minus, this equals our answer.
