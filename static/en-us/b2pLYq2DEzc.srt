00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,220
So how do we learn to describe the world within our skin? What's going on?

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,956
Well, we learn, through trial and error, experience, and reinforcement. So,

3
00:00:09,956 --> 00:00:13,930
here's an example. My niece, Sophia was about six years old. And we were at the

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,630
airport, and she was going to fly to Switzerland for the summer to see her

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:22,056
Grammy. And she said, aunt Sue, my tummy feels funny. And I said oh, honey

6
00:00:22,056 --> 00:00:26,726
those are called butterflies, you're just nervous about flying. She said no it,

7
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:30,770
it doesn't feel right. It kind of hurts. I said no, no. That's just called

8
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,846
nervousness or anxiousness. And she kept telling that something was wrong, and

9
00:00:34,846 --> 00:00:40,120
I was trying to describe it as excitement, as anxiousness. And it turns out

10
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,320
that when they got to Switzerland, my brother called me, and Sophia actually

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,940
was vomiting the entire way. so, it turns out that Aunt Sue was wrong. she

12
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:53,800
wasn't anxious, she wasn't nervous, she actually had some type of stomach bug.

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,148
But that's an example of me as an adult, trying to teach a child about what's

14
00:00:57,148 --> 00:01:02,833
going on inside their skin. So, besides experiencing pain or an upset stomach,

15
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:07,279
how do we describe feelings such as love or passion? There's a lot of

16
00:01:07,279 --> 00:01:11,311
literature out there on love and passion. But until you experience it, it's

17
00:01:11,311 --> 00:01:13,100
very difficult to describe.
