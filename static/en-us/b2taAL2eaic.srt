1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,880
Lost card is hopefully is not as
big a problem because there's still

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,960
a PIN, isn't it.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,640
So just because they have a card,
you lose it, the PIN still protects you.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,320
Cloning of cards is hard because
of the chip that we have is in it.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,370
And the way it works, obviously, in the
old days all you had to do, the credit

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:25,070
card number was encoded in a magnetic
strip that was very easy to clone.

7
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:29,710
But these chip-based cards, cloning
is harder, so that's not a weakness.

8
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:34,500
The third option is what this link, or
the story, or the paper I mentioned.

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,570
The protocol actually is
implemented had some problems.

10
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:42,180
Supposed to generate random numbers and
answers in each transaction.

11
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,327
Supposed to have random nonce but
the implementation had some flaws,

12
00:00:45,327 --> 00:00:47,099
because of which, it didn't do that.

13
00:00:47,099 --> 00:00:48,496
And those could be exploited.

14
00:00:48,496 --> 00:00:51,262
So this is really
an Implementation issue,

15
00:00:51,262 --> 00:00:54,939
in the protocol, that is based
on this chip and pin cards.

16
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:58,270
And that is the weakness that we
are exploring in this question.
