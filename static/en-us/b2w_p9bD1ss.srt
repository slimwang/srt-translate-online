1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,410
Since we've been talking
about the animator recently,

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:06,710
why don't we take a look at how we can
actually use it in scripts we build.

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,310
To get started, we should take a look
at the animator Unity documentation.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,970
There are a lot of methods here.

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:18,790
But the one's that I want to mention
are StopPlayback and StartPlayback.

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,640
With the Booleans we created last time,
these methods are perfect for

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,570
starting and stopping an animation,
like our sun rotating.

8
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,320
We've actually gone ahead and

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,380
created a simple animator that
you can use to rotate your sun.

10
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:38,210
Let's apply the animator to our sun and
then jump back into our script.

11
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,000
The first we want to do is
create a variable that we can

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,400
use to reference our animator.

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,500
Let's call it sunRotationAnimation.

14
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:52,656
Once we do that, all we need to
do is replace our Slerp code

15
00:00:52,656 --> 00:00:56,400
with sunRotationAnimation.stopPlayback.

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,935
Then in start,
we actually need to call startPlayback.

17
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,010
And with that we're all set up.

18
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,930
Now before we leave this script,
I want to mention that.

19
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:13,173
Built in to MonoDevelop is an auto
completion feature that enables us to

20
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,320
not only complete our code.

21
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,850
But, also allows us to
find methods we might need

22
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,159
without searching the documentation.

23
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,620
Let's practice this really quickly.

24
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,620
In our animator we've added a Boolean
parameter that when set to true

25
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,100
will turn that directional light red.

26
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,130
Instead of going back
to the documentation,

27
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,110
let's see if we can find
a method to set a Boolean.

28
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,480
In activate rotation let's
type sunRotationAnimation.

29
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,540
This'll bring up
the auto-complete possibilities.

30
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,430
Since we're looking to set a bool,
let's start typing set.

31
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,880
This'll bring up all the options
that have set in the name.

32
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,800
And at the top we see
that we have set bool.

33
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,420
Once we click on it,
we auto complete that method name.

34
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,315
The parameters we need to provide are
the name of the boolean, which is called

35
00:02:02,315 --> 00:02:06,150
changeColor and it's value that
we want to set, which is true.

36
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,800
Once we do that we can hop back into
the Unity editor, click on our sun and

37
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,680
apply the animator component and
then let's go ahead and hit Play.

38
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,390
Now if we simulate the trigger, we'll
see that our sun starts to rotate and

39
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,860
then our light also turns to a nice red.

40
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,010
And that was the simple magic trick
we did in the apartment scene to

41
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,688
activate our animations back then.

42
00:02:29,688 --> 00:02:31,054
Cool, right?

43
00:02:31,054 --> 00:02:33,399
