1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,910
Janet's time would be 250 divided by x, and Rohan's time would be 300 divided

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:13,084
by x plus 20. Remember, time equals distance divided by rate. So we just take

3
00:00:13,084 --> 00:00:18,910
Janet's distance 250, and divide it by her rate, which is x. We do the same

4
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:23,616
thing for Rohan. We take his distance of 300 and divide it by his rate, which

5
00:00:23,616 --> 00:00:25,623
is x plus 20.
