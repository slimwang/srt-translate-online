1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,032
Next question is where do these trees come from?

2
00:00:03,033 --> 00:00:07,866
And the answer is that trees come from grammars, and a grammar is a list of rules.

3
00:00:07,867 --> 00:00:15,066
Rules have a left-hand side where we say a sentence, and a right-hand side, where we say a sentence can be written as

4
00:00:15,067 --> 00:00:20,166
a noun phrase followed by a verb phrase. And so that's like making a small tree.

5
00:00:20,167 --> 00:00:26,432
Saying the top of the tree is the S node, and the daughter nodes are the nP and the bP.

6
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:34,199
Then we can say that a noun phrase can be a noun all by itself, like raises,

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:42,466
or can be a new category that we haven't seen yet, called a determiner, like "the" or "a" followed by a noun,

8
00:00:42,467 --> 00:00:52,499
like "the raises," and this vertical bar means "or." So this is saying we have two possibilities--a noun phrase can either be a noun

9
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,132
or a determiner followed by a noun. But there are other possibilities as well.

10
00:00:57,133 --> 00:01:01,866
It might be a noun followed by a noun, like interest rates.

11
00:01:01,867 --> 00:01:08,566
Or we can even have something like mortgage interest rates, which is a three-noun combination,

12
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:12,966
and there are many more, and we could have a internal structure here as well.

13
00:01:12,967 --> 00:01:18,432
But I just wanted to give some of the ideas of some of the possibilities.

14
00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:26,932
A verb phrase can be a verb followed by a noun phrase. So the verb "raises" and the noun phrase, the object,

15
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:33,266
"raises interest rates," or it could be a intransitive verb, the verb all by itself.

16
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:41,799
Or it could be a verb with a direct object and an indirect object. So, like, "Give me the money."

17
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:47,599
And that's all we're going to put in our grammar right now in terms of higher-level categories,

18
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:54,999
nodes that are up higher in the tree. And then we'll have the terminal categories or lexical categories,

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,832
categories that define classes of words. And we have three here: noun, verb and determiner.

20
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:14,432
And so the noun can be "interest" or "Fed" or "rates" or "raises." And a verb can be, again,

21
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:23,732
"interest" or "rates" or "raises." And the determiner can be "the" or "a." And so this is a tiny little grammar

22
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:28,299
that takes care of the sentence we showed, and maybe a few others.

23
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:33,832
Even with this grammar, some of the problems that show up in larger grammars is evident.

24
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:44,032
One of the problems is a problem of ambiguity. As we saw before, a single sentence but four words had at least two possible parses.

25
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:49,666
And what I want to ask you now is how many parses do each of these sentences have?

26
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:57,499
So, "The Fed raises interest rates." Tell me how many parses. If there are none, according to this grammar, put in a zero.

27
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,832
If there's one unique parse, put in one. And if it's ambiguous with two or more, put in that number.

28
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:11,666
"The Fed raises raises," or "raises raises interest raises."

29
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:19,266
Each of those tell me how many parses there are. Don't use your intuition or your knowledge of English,

30
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:27,333
but rather give me the answer according to exactly this grammar and nothing else.
