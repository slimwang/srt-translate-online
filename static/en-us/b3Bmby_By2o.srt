1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,319
For this equation, the center is at O,O the a value is 10 since we moved 10

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,442
units in the x direction, left and right. And the b value is 5 since we moved

3
00:00:10,442 --> 00:00:15,724
vertically from the center 5 units up and 5 units down. Now if you're stumped

4
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:19,196
about what to do first, remember that we want this to equal one, so we should

5
00:00:19,196 --> 00:00:25,456
divide our equation through by 400. So, we'll take our equation and divide each

6
00:00:25,456 --> 00:00:31,520
term by 400 4 divides into 4, leaving us with 1X squared in the numerator. And

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,611
4 divides into 400, leaving 100 in the denominator. For the second term, 16

8
00:00:37,611 --> 00:00:45,076
divides into 16 one time, and 16 divides into 400 25 times. So, we'll have 1Y

9
00:00:45,076 --> 00:00:50,258
squared, divided by 25. And finally, on the other side of the equals sign,

10
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:55,130
we'll have one, since 400 divided by 400 equals one. Now we're looking at an

11
00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:00,900
equation that fits our general form when the ellipse is centered at the origin.

12
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,239
The center is 0, 0, since there's nothing next to the x and nothing next to the

13
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:10,174
y. We simply just have x squared and y squared. Now, the a value is the square

14
00:01:10,174 --> 00:01:16,396
root of this number. So, the a value must be 10. And the b value is the square

15
00:01:16,396 --> 00:01:21,960
root of this number. So b must be positive 5. If it helps you, you can rewrite

16
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,867
the denominators as perfect squares. This easily lets you find the a value and

17
00:01:26,867 --> 00:01:31,018
the b value. So, we took this equation, and we changed it to look like

18
00:01:31,018 --> 00:01:37,363
something else. We've changed the equation to look like this. Let's graph this

19
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:41,255
one to make sure they're identical. So, so far we have our old blue ellipse

20
00:01:41,255 --> 00:01:46,562
just like from before that represents this first equation. And you can see that

21
00:01:46,562 --> 00:01:51,353
I'm on it since it's become bold, since I've clicked on it. Now if I take our

22
00:01:51,353 --> 00:01:56,355
equation and I set it equal to 1, we have the same exact ellipse. We moved 10

23
00:01:56,355 --> 00:02:00,555
units in the x direction, left and right, and 5 units in the vertical

24
00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:06,740
direction, up and down. And we can even write the equation in this form with

25
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:12,334
100 as 10 squared and 25 as 5 squared. And if I set this equal to 1, I get the

26
00:02:12,334 --> 00:02:16,976
exact same elipse. These three equations are written in different forms, but

27
00:02:16,976 --> 00:02:18,710
they're all equivalent.
