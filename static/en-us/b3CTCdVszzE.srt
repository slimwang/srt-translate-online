It kind of feels like our Alice in Wonderland code is done now, but there are a

2
00:00:03,275 --> 00:00:07,494
few more things we would want to do before presenting or sharing it. Our book

3
00:00:07,494 --> 00:00:11,772
class has a lot of methods: getNumCharacters, getfirstOccurrenceOfMadHatter,

4
00:00:11,772 --> 00:00:15,740
getFirstSentence, second sentence, occurrences of Alice, occurrences of

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:20,888
something else. But in general we called it book, we didn't call it any thing

6
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:26,056
specific to Alice. We would probably want to fix or generalize, or remove some

7
00:00:26,056 --> 00:00:31,694
of the methods that are overly Alice specific. Which methods should we remove

8
00:00:31,694 --> 00:00:36,446
or generalize? Write the names of the methods here.
