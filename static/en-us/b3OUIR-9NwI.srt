1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,110
That ends the lesson on stereo geometry.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,290
The idea is that, if you have calibrated cameras,

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:10,500
if you know the match, then you could compute the depth.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,820
So, this has been sort of general.

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,200
The only math that we did was the relationship between disparity and depth.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,250
In the next lesson,

7
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,777
what we'll do is we'll focus on actually finding the disparity.

8
00:00:19,777 --> 00:00:24,400
Figuring out which point in one image matches which point in the other image.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,790
And that's what you're going to be doing in your problem set.

10
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,300
Then we're going to work on calibration which is determining the relative views.

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,160
And by the way, you're going to do that in a different problem set.

12
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,290
But, we're going to break these down one at a time.

13
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:35,790
That's it.
