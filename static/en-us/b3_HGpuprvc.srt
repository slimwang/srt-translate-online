1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,630
So we're going to have one more quiz about variables. Variables are

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,140
a really important concept. We're going to use them all the time in

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,650
the programs that we write. So this quiz is going to test if

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,030
you can define a variable.yourself, and use that to do a computation.

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,360
So your goal for this quiz is to write Python code

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,740
that defines the variable age, gives it the value of your age

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,290
in years, and then prints out the number of days you've been

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,670
alive. You don't have to use your real age. If you don't

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,630
want to include your real age, you can make

10
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,830
up whatever age you are or you can use your

11
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,500
age in spirit. The important thing is that you can

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,140
define that in a variable and then do the computation.
