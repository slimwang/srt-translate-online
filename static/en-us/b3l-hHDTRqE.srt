00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,190
We get a final answer of 3 times the cube root of 4 all divided by 4. Nice

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,170
thinking, if you found this answer. We know the cube root of 3 to the 3rd is

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,885
just 3, so that comes outside of our radical. We can't take the cube root of 2

4
00:00:13,885 --> 00:00:18,572
squared since this power isn't divisible by this root. 2 squared stays inside

5
00:00:18,572 --> 00:00:22,567
of our cubed root. For our denominator, we'll use power divided by root to get

6
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:27,393
2 squared. Now we just simplify our powers to get our final answer.
