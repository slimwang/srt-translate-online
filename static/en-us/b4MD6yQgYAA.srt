00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
A final question we've had is about project management and keeping your code

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
somewhat manageable and not into a crazy ball.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Sure, sure.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The code I've been writing--ASCII Chan and whatnot--actually resembles a crazy ball,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
which is fine when you're starting out, but as your project starts to grow,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
yes, you need to add some more organization.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I generally have a directory with all my templates in it.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I have another directory that'll have all my static files--my CSS, my JavaScript.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
In this class, I've given you the little bit of CSS that we've used.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Then the rest of the Python files, I generally have one main file that is my controller.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's basically the URL mapping and then the classes that those URLs map to,

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
what their basic handler is.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I try to put all of the database stuff in a separate files.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
If I have a datatype for--in ASCII chan we have a datatype for art.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That would be in its own file that has a functions related to art.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I generally have a utilities file that has things like generating random strings

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and creating hash values and secure values and all that stuff you're going

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
to see in the next lecture.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Just like when you're organizing any large programming project,

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
pulling things apart. It's easy to pull things apart into separate files.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Sometimes you get some weird dependency issues with tricky imports--

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
one file depend another, depends on the same file.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That generally means you did something wrong.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But you'll kind of learn over time how to structure things so it makes sense.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Lots of files is good. It keeps things clean. It keeps each file sane.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You know where to look for things and that sort of problem.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
In the class, however, I've been working in the same file so you can see it all in one place,

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
but if the projects were getting much bigger than what I was working on now,

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I would and I would encourage you as well to start separating things out

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and organizing them a little bit better.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Okay. I think that's about all the questions we have for this time.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Is there anything else you want to add on at the end?

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Just a quick thank you to everybody in the forums who has been helping us out,

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
explaining things. I know the permalink thing was tricky for a lot of you.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
A lot of that is my fault so those of you who figured it out or already knew

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
what I was getting at, thank you very much for explaining that. It's been really helpful.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And thank you, Sean, for hanging out in the forums and keeping things going smoothly.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's really helpful. This is my first time teaching a class.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm kind of learning along with you guys what works and what doesn't.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I think we're starting to trend in the right direction.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's been pretty fun so far, and I think you'll enjoy Unit 4. That was one of my favorites.
