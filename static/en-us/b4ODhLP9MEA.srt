1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,848
So Skype has a central log in server but then use a pier to pier to exchange the

2
00:00:05,848 --> 00:00:11,094
actual voice streams and compresses the audio to achieve a fairly low bit

3
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:17,163
rate t around 67 bytes per packet and 140 packets per second. We see Skype uses

4
00:00:17,163 --> 00:00:20,840
about 40 kilobites per second in each direction.

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,310
Data packets are also encrypted in both directions.

6
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,970
Good audio compression and avoiding hops

7
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:33,440
through faraway hosts can improve the quality

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,650
of the audio, as can for arrow correction. Ultimately, though, the network is

9
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:44,630
a major factor. Long propagation delays High congestion, or disruptions as

10
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:51,090
a result of routing changes can all degrade the quality of a voice over IP call.

11
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,760
To ensure that some streams achieve acceptable

12
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,460
performance levels, we sometimes use what's called

13
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,430
Quality of Service. One way of doing

14
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,955
Quality of Service is through explicit resservations.

15
00:01:02,955 --> 00:01:05,280
But, another way is to simply mark

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,880
certain packet streams as higher priorities than

17
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,680
others. Let's first take a look at

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,070
marking and policing of traffic sending rates.
