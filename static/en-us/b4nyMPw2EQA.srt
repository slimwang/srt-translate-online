1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,110
Let's try a graph here on this left side and then I'll have you figure out

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,510
the largest possible clique that is in that network.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,160
It's going to be an easy example.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,580
Here you can check off these boxes and just make a check mark in each of the boxes

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,100
that belong to the largest clique.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 99:59:59,999
The largest set of vertices that are all connected to each other.
