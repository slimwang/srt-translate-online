00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,159
This section is on
problem based learning.

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,454
Problem based learning is a
constructionist learning strategy, where

3
00:00:05,454 --> 00:00:09,085
the learning process is really motivated
by some central organizing problem.

4
00:00:09,085 --> 00:00:10,367
Now, when we say problem here,

5
00:00:10,367 --> 00:00:13,465
we're not really talking about something
small like a little math problem.

6
00:00:13,465 --> 00:00:16,795
We're talking about something a little
bit bigger and a little bit open ended.

7
00:00:16,795 --> 00:00:20,565
So in ecology, we might have the problem
of figuring out why a certain species

8
00:00:20,565 --> 00:00:24,335
went extinct or in medicine you may have
the problem of given some symptoms and

9
00:00:24,335 --> 00:00:27,295
given some family history,
let's diagnose this patient.

10
00:00:27,295 --> 00:00:31,490
So there are these central motivating
problems behind the learning process.

11
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,330
The power of problem based learning is
that it really teaches students at two

12
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,390
different levels.

13
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:35,900
On the one hand,

14
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,540
it teaches them the content
knowledge that they need to know.

15
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,220
To diagnose that disease, you would
need to know a list of diseases and

16
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,940
you would need to know which symptoms
correspond to which diseases.

17
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,741
So there's content knowledge at play,
but

18
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:48,220
problem based learning doesn't
just teach the content knowledge.

19
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,100
It also teaches that content
knowledge in the context of how it

20
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,150
actually would be used
in the real world.

21
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:57,260
So in the ecology example, it's one
thing to know the biological principles

22
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,190
and the genetics and things like
that that go into that organism.

23
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,240
But its something else to understand
the overall idea of constructing

24
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,660
an explanation of what
happened in that system,

25
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:09,600
evaluating that explanation against
evidence, and revising it accordingly.

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,160
So the power of problem based learning
is it not only teaches students

27
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,730
content knowledge, but it teaches them
content knowledge in the context of how

28
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,890
it would be used out in the real world.

29
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,790
And this is very motivating for
students as well, they get to see that

30
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,580
if I went into a career in this,
this is actually what I would be doing.

31
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,120
This isn't just some material
that's been whitewashed to

32
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,400
use in a classroom environment.

33
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,180
This is actually what people do in
the real world when they work in

34
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,240
these fields.

35
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,860
So it's a great way of
motivating learning and

36
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,230
it's also a great way of teaching.
