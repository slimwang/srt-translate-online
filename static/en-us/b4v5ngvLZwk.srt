1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,060
Great job so far.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,830
You now know how to extract
visual features from an image,

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,460
you've trained a classifier to identify
cars, you've used that classifier to

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,110
detect cars in different locations in
an image, and you've addressed several

5
00:00:12,109 --> 00:00:15,230
issues along the way, including false
positives and multiple defections.

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,699
Now all that remains is to come up with
a way to track detected vehicles through

7
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:23,519
a video screen, this will allow you to
analyze the motion of the other cars and

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,539
avoid any potential collisions.

9
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:28,469
While you could treat each frame
of video as an independent image,

10
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:31,489
you can devise a much more efficient and
robust tracking pipeline

11
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:34,479
by utilizing what you know about one
frame when processing the next one.
