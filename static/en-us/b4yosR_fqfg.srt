00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,447
So, we know if we square 3 we'll get 9, and if we square 4, we'll get 16, and

2
00:00:04,447 --> 00:00:10,896
if we square 5, we'll get 25. But what's even more amazing if we add these two

3
00:00:10,896 --> 00:00:15,784
together we get 25. It turns out that the area of the squares of the legs of

4
00:00:15,784 --> 00:00:20,944
the triangle sum to the the area of the square of the hypotenuse. Pretty

5
00:00:20,944 --> 00:00:25,840
amazing. It turns out that this relationship is true for any right triangle.

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,670
So, lets take our triangle and give it unknown lengths. This side will be a,

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:36,220
this side will be b and this hypotenuse will be c. What equation could you

8
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:40,661
write to relate the variables a, b, and c? When you think you have that

9
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:42,530
equation, type it in here.
