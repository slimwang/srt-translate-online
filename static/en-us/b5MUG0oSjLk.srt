00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,280
Okay. Well, here is a quiz for you to test your knowledge of these different

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,660
diagram types. In column one I have the names of the diagrams,

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,420
in column two I have some definitions, and I'd like you to match them together.

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,110
As a review that particular diagram types of the class diagram,

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:18,000
the composite structure, the component diagram, deployment diagram,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,720
object diagram, package diagram, and profile diagram.

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,150
And then the definitions are in the right column. The static structure at

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:29,030
a particular time. The organization of physical software components.

9
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:33,340
Three is the logical groupings and dependencies. Four is the components and

10
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:38,180
structural properties. Five extensions to the UML metal model. Six internal

11
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,660
structure and possible interactions. And the seventh choice is the physical

12
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,620
system resources and how they map to the hardware. Try to match those together.
