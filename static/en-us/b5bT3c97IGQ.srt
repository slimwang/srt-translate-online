1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,000
When a user logs in with email and
password, you make a user object.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,240
Now, we also need to make those user
objects when they're logging in

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:06,810
with Google.

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,490
This might seem trivial, but it does
actually raise one good question about

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,965
how we deal with user creation flow.

6
00:00:12,965 --> 00:00:14,305
Take my roommate Kagera.

7
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:17,335
She has a Gmail account, and
she also has a Google account.

8
00:00:17,335 --> 00:00:20,315
When she creates an account with
this email it creates a new user.

9
00:00:20,315 --> 00:00:23,045
So then what happens if she
logs in with her Google account

10
00:00:23,045 --> 00:00:25,405
that's associated to
the same Gmail address?

11
00:00:25,405 --> 00:00:26,205
Should it make a new user?

12
00:00:26,205 --> 00:00:28,855
So I'm going to make a somewhat
executive call and say no.

13
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,480
In general I think it's safe to assume
that if they have an email with

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,670
the email password provider, and
they have the same email with the Google

15
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,970
provider that this in
fact the same user.

16
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,170
And because it's the same user they
probably don't want their data split up

17
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,780
into two different but
very similar accounts.

18
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,640
So, before I send over the spec,
quick question.

19
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,680
So what we want to do is be able to
associate a person's password email sign

20
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,690
in with a Google sign in,
if they're the same.

21
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,660
So given that, what should we use for

22
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,650
the key if we want to
associate these two accounts?

23
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,420
Here are some options,
what do you think?
