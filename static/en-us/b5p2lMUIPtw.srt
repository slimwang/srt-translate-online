1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,780
Now that we've seen
notifications in action,

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:07,220
let's step through the sample to quickly
refresh your memory as to how they work.

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,320
We'll need to understand how this works
before we can start adding wearable

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,770
extensions.

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:16,006
So let's open up Application
> Java > the Package, and

6
00:00:16,006 --> 00:00:18,667
then open up MainActivity.java.

7
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:21,090
So lets now work through the code.

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,490
Notification ID here is the unique
identifier for the notification.

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,600
Each notification we generate
has a unique value and

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,030
if we issue two notifications with
the same ID, we override the first one.

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,598
The interesting code is in
sendNotification, which is here.

12
00:00:37,598 --> 00:00:40,340
This creates an intent that is fired
when the notification is clicked

13
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,560
by the user.

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,800
We need to create a new
pendingIntent here, so

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,950
that the notification service can
run the intent later on for our app.

16
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,070
We need to setup a builder for
NotificationCompat objects.

17
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,650
We'll call methods on this to set it up.

18
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:56,720
This sets up the icon to show for
the notification.

19
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,170
This tells the notification what pending
intent to use, which we created earlier.

20
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,470
And this here makes the notification
automatically disappear when it's

21
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:04,870
clicked on.

22
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,440
This here is a different kind
of icon used on the left side of

23
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,420
the notification in
the notification shade.

24
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,890
These three lines configure
the main title, the main text, and

25
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,180
also some subtext, all of which are
shown in the notification on the phone.

26
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,740
This grabs a reference to
the notification manager.

27
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:22,930
And this takes the builder and

28
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,690
generates a notification compound
object using the .build method.

29
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:30,871
And passes it to the notificationManager
using the NOTIFICATION_ID value.

30
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:34,334
The NOTIFICATION_ID value must be unique
amongst the other notifications you

31
00:01:34,334 --> 00:01:35,270
might want to create.
