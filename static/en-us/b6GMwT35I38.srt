00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:00,940
Thanks, Sarah.

2
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,000
Now, I'm going to use git branches to create an experimental change in

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,250
the Asteroids repository.

4
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,390
This game is pretty hard, and I don't want to change that.

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,680
But I'd also like to create an easier version of the game.

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,510
If I do, there will be two versions of the game that are almost

7
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,450
exactly the same, but with some slight differences.

8
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,310
So this is a great time to create a branch.

9
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,310
Now, there's a lot of ways I could make this game easier.

10
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:25,740
But here's one.

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,280
Every time I shoot an asteroid, it breaks into three smaller fragments.

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,140
I'll try making it easier to complete the level by only making it

13
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,070
break into two each time.

14
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,010
I don't want to make this change on the master branch though,

15
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,260
since I don't consider it an official update to the game.

16
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,860
Instead, I'll create a branch called easy mode for that change.

17
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,050
I can use the command git branch to create and view branches.

18
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,260
First, I'll run git branch with no arguments,

19
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,130
which shows me my current branches.

20
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:55,450
Right now, the only branch is master, which is the default branch.

21
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,790
Now, I'll run git branch easy-mode.

22
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:02,030
When I give an argument to git branch, it creates a new branch with that name.

23
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,390
So now, when I run git branch again,

24
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,495
I can see that the easy-mode branch was created.

25
00:01:08,495 --> 00:01:11,540
This star next to master means that master is the branch that

26
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,340
is currently checked out.

27
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,170
So that's the one that will update if I make a change.

28
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,510
That's not what I want.

29
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,410
I want the easy-mode label to update when I make a change.

30
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,360
And master to stay the same.

31
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,670
So I'll run the command git checkout easy-mode.

32
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,410
And now, when I run git branch again,

33
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,670
I can see that easy-mode is the checked out branch.

34
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,150
Since I just created the easy-mode branch,

35
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:38,160
it has the same code as master right now, but I'm about to change that.

36
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,630
To make the easy-mode, I'll open the file game.js.

37
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:45,380
I saw earlier that the code I'm interested in changing has a common break in

38
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,610
to fragments.

39
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,920
So I'll search for fragments.

40
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,710
Here I find a loop that executes 3 times,

41
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:56,630
which is making 3 smaller asteroids, which the author calls roids.

42
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,340
So I'll change this 3 to a 2.

43
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,290
And give the game a try.

44
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:05,020
Sure enough, now only two smaller asteroids form.

45
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,750
Now, I'd like to commit this change.

46
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,020
Even though it's only a one-character change,

47
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,930
I consider this one logical change since it changes the behavior of the game and

48
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,580
it completely accomplishes the goal I had.

49
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,110
I'll add my change to the staging area.

50
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,510
And then commit it.

51
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,620
And I'll use the commit message make asteroids split into two

52
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,320
smaller pieces rather than three.

53
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,070
Now, go ahead and create and easy-mode branch on your computer.

54
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,290
Then checkout that branch.

55
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,780
And commit a change making the game easier.

56
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,360
You can use the same commit that I did.

57
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,830
You can find the line that I changed at line 678.

58
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,420
Or you can search for break into fragments, like I did.

59
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,700
When you're finished, paste the output of git status into this box.
