1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,530
So 1.1⁵⁰ is about 117 which again is a speedup of over a trillion, so what we now have found

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:15,300
is a second loophole, where the first loophole was sub-exponential time and the second loophole

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,920
is small bases for the exponent.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,070
Not having a 2 here but a 1.1 or maybe a 1.2, so now of course the question is--

5
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,610
can we actually exposed those loopholes, so can we find algorithms

6
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,260
that have these running times here.

7
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,380
The answer is--yes, we can, and that is exactly the point of using

8
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:39,890
intelligent force versus brute force, and I'm actually going to show you how this loophole here works.

9
00:00:39,890 --> 99:59:59,999
And the problem for which we're going to show this is vertex cover.
