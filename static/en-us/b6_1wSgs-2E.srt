00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,240
Let's consider the same
tree as the previous quiz.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,720
Is there a way to reorder the leaf nodes
of the tree in order to prune as many

3
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:08,400
nodes as possible?

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,280
You'll find a link to the original
version in instructor notes below

5
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:12,479
this video.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,079
Refer to that tree and fill in
the values here for your reordered tree.

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,130
Then go ahead and check the boxes to
indicate which nodes are branches you

8
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:21,869
can now prune from the tree.

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,179
Remember, you can enter an exact value,
like five,

10
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:26,350
or a range, like greater than or
equal to five
