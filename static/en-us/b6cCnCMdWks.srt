00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The main theorem that we're going to use to get that

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
was devised by Euler, and the theorem is that

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
if a and n are relatively prime, then a raised to the totient of n power

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
is 1 mod n.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'll talk soon about what the totient means.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
If we can obtain this, then what we want to do

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
is set ed - 1 is equal to the totient of n.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Then we would have exactly the correctness property we need

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
with the assumption that m and n are relatively prime.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This is the totient function,

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and what the totient function means is the number of positive integers

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
that are less than n and are relatively prime to n.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We'll have a quick quiz to see that you understand what the totient means,

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and the question is what is the value of the totient of 277?

15
00:00:47,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And I'll point out that 277 is my favorite prime number.
