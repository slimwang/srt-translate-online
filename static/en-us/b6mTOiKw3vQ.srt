00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's say there are two types of people for simplicityâ€”type A and type B.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Type A are the popular ones.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
They have 80 friends.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And type B are less popular. They only have 20 friends.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You might now say that I don't know which type you are.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I will compute what's called the expected or average number of friends.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
To do so, I assume that half of the people are of type A

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and half of the people are of type B.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Here's your very first quiz in this class.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Into this box enter what you think is the expected or average number of friends

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
if you have a 50% chance of being a type A and a 50% chance of being a type B.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Type in here when you're done.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
There is a submit button somewhere down here.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You can see if your answer is correct.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Regardless of whether you finish this or not,

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
at some point just hit the next button,

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and you'll see my answer.
