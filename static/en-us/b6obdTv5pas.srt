00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,990
So we've talked a lot about references
inside of scripts, but let's back up and

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,670
remember exactly what references are.

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,650
&gt;&gt; Are references a way that you
can declare a game object in

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,000
the Unity Editor that you drag and
drop into your script?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,250
Are they a link between
the Unity Editor and your script.

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,690
Or, are they a good way to control
game objects outside your script,

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,980
via hooking them up in the editor?

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,980
&gt;&gt; What do you think?
