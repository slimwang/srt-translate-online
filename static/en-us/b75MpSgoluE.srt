00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,693
6x plus 3 is equal to 3 times the quantity 2x plus 1. That this sounds actually

2
00:00:04,693 --> 00:00:09,403
a little bit tricky. One mistake that is really easy to make, is to forget about

3
00:00:09,403 --> 00:00:14,102
this second term inside the parenthesis, the 1. But if we leave it out, then we

4
00:00:14,102 --> 00:00:18,744
only have one term inside of the parenthesis. 3 times 2x is just equal to 6x,

5
00:00:18,744 --> 00:00:22,850
and this 3 would have nowhere to come from. Checking to make sure that this

6
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,946
answer when you simplify it, has the same number of terms as the first answer,

7
00:00:26,946 --> 00:00:29,047
is a pretty fundamental importance.
