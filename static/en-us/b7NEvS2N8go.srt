00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,550
So here, you can see my layout.

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:04,180
And I'm just using standard
LinearLayouts to arrange the flow of

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,430
the controls.

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,860
Here's the
com.google.android.gms.common.SignInBu-

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,830
tton that we had discussed.

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,520
As I scrolled down, you can see
I've called it sign_in_button,

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,870
and I've just set its
layout in the typical way.

8
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,950
I've also just used two
more generic buttons.

9
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,180
There's the sign_out_button,
whose text is Sign Out.

10
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:27,220
And there's the revoke_access_button,
whose text is Revoke Access.

11
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,070
Note that I've also added this TextView
as a status field and we use that for

12
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,872
tracking the signing in activities.
