00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,110
Here are four networking apps
that we've built this course.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,100
But there's a glaring
problem with each of these.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,050
For each of these apps we've assumed
near perfect network conditions.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,930
Or we've at least assumed that
the network conditions were equivalent

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,010
to the machines we were testing on.

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,600
In the real world this
is hardly the case.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,320
While networks are always
getting better,

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,580
connections are still unreliable.

9
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,640
And as we build apps we need
to keep these things in mind.

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,140
To get us thinking about apps that
address these kinds of network problems,

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,940
we'll take a look at Apple Maps next.
