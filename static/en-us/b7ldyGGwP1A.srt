00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,826
Let's take a step back, and see how far we've come in solving this problem. We

2
00:00:03,826 --> 00:00:08,350
started out with our function, f of x equals 2 x to the fourth, minus 13 x

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:14,872
cubed, plus 32 x squared, minus 13 x. And so far, we've pulled out two linear

4
00:00:14,872 --> 00:00:21,790
factors. Now we have x times 2 x minus 1, times x squared, minus 6 x plus 13.

5
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,363
We are clearly well on our way to having this fully factored. All we have left

6
00:00:25,363 --> 00:00:27,946
to do, is figure out the zeros that go along with this quadratic expressions

7
00:00:27,946 --> 00:00:33,208
right here. What then, are the zeros of x squared minus 6 x plus 13? Please

8
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:34,973
write them in these boxes.
