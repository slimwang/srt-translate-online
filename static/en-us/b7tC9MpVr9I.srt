1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,770
So we write that like this, all right?

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:05,510
So just as we said before,
we're going to maximize two divided by

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,680
the magnitude of W,
subject to the constraint,

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,090
we want to correctly classify
all the points, right?

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,510
So for
the positive X's where Y is plus one,

6
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:18,440
we want X dot W plus B to be
greater than or equal to one.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,140
And if, XI is negative,

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,770
we want W dot, X dot W plus B
to be less than negative one.

9
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,130
All right?

10
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,430
So this is a standard, what's called
a quadratic optimization problem,

11
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:36,810
we want to sut, we want to minimize
this term that's over here, okay?

12
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,130
Because if you minimize the square of W,

13
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:44,760
then that's going to maximize
two over the norm of W.

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,050
Subject to a constraint, right?

15
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,590
Here's our constraints.

16
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,820
You'll notice that what we did
is by multiplying by the YI

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,652
we can say that this thing is always
greater than or equal to one, right?

18
00:00:54,652 --> 00:00:58,620
because YI flips the sign, because YI is
positive when it's a positive example,

19
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,220
and YI is negative when it's a negative
example, so multiplying it through

20
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,099
keeps that constraint always
greater than or equal to one.

21
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,518
The solution to this, and I'm not
going to go through the solutions, but

22
00:01:08,518 --> 00:01:11,387
it's sort of a standard
quadratic optimization and

23
00:01:11,387 --> 00:01:14,476
some of the multipliers,
things like that, but what matters is,

24
00:01:14,476 --> 00:01:17,500
is the form of the solution,
not how we got there.

25
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,645
It's just the linear sum for

26
00:01:20,645 --> 00:01:26,290
W of some weights times,
and it's the YI times XI.

27
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,720
So, remember Yi sort of flips,
flips the sign.

28
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,500
All right?

29
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:36,050
And the XIs that you use
are the support vectors and

30
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:39,390
the alpha Is are these learned weights.

31
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,260
And another way of thinking
about it is that the weights,

32
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,050
you can think of that of alpha Is for
all of the XIs, but

33
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,850
they're only non-zero for
the support vectors.

34
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,650
Okay?
So when I, when I solve this,

35
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,750
I end up with a whole bunch of alpha Is,
most of which are zero.

36
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:59,080
But the alpha Is for
the support vectors are not zero.

37
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,770
Okay?

38
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:05,330
Well then I can just sort of substitute
in, we have this equation that for

39
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:11,044
any support vector W transpose X
plus B is equal to positive one or

40
00:02:11,044 --> 00:02:14,120
negative one, depending upon the YI,
depending upon whether it's positive or

41
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,900
negative in this example.

42
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,930
So that can be written like this.

43
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,800
Remember the YIs are plus one or
minus one, depending upon the example.

44
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,430
So I can write,
just substitute in for W.

45
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,750
Okay, so I substitute in for
both B and for W.

46
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,570
Given this, we can now create
a classification function.

47
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,320
So remember, what we were doing
was we were drawing a line

48
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,230
W X plus B equals zero.

49
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,070
Everything on one side of the line we
were going to call positive everything

50
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,490
on the other side we were
going to call negative, right?

51
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,451
Our support vectors are out here
where that function equals one, but,

52
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:50,240
but if something's on the inside,
if it's greater than zero,

53
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,360
we'll call it positive, less than zero,
we'll call it negative.

54
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,350
So I'm going to build
a classification function,

55
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,740
which is right what it says here.

56
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:02,000
It says, okay, I'm just going to
take the sign of W dot X plus B.

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,980
Greater than zero,
I'll call it positive,

58
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,120
less than zero, I'll call it
negative I substitute in the, for

59
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,500
W this expression here, okay?

60
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,210
And take that sign, and if this
function, F of X is less than zero, I'll

61
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,710
call it negative, and if it's greater
than zero, I'll call it positive.

62
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,350
Okay?

63
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,659
So this all depends on you being
able to solve for those alphas, and

64
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:28,960
I'll tell you the support vector.

65
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,590
Machinery will do that.

66
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,740
And realize by solving for the alphas,

67
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:37,570
by finding some non zero alphas that's
selecting your support vectors.

68
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:38,820
Okay?

69
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,890
A critical, critical,
critical element of this equation

70
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:48,180
is that it only depends
on this dot product.

71
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,630
Okay?
It highlighted here in red,

72
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,730
I'll highlight it in red again.

73
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:56,640
The only thing I need to know is
the dot product between some new

74
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,210
point X and the support vectors XI, and

75
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:05,170
then I multiply it by the alpha,
sum them up, and build my classifier.

76
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,250
That dot product element, or

77
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:11,600
that dot product structure, is what
makes what we're about to do work.
