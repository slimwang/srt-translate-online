00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,359
What do you think, David?

2
00:00:01,359 --> 00:00:03,010
>> So
it looks like the brick on the bottom

3
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,440
supports the two bricks in the middle.

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,550
So this brick supports those two bricks.

5
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,850
And then those two bricks
support the brick on the top.

6
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,140
So those two bricks each
support that top brick.

7
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,270
Note that we've not yet

8
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,470
got an example that tells us whether
these links are required or not.

9
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,100
So that's why these are supports and

10
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,220
not must support,
as we saw in our concept last time.

11
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,420
>> Now we'll give you some more
examples, some positive, some negative.

12
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,610
And we'll ask you how the air
agent will go about refining it's

13
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,470
concept definition.
