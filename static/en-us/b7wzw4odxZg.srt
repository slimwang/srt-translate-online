00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,050
First, we create our settings activity,

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,296
and this is the code that we got
from the gist.

3
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:07,762
Then, in the Android Manifest, 
we declare the settings activity.

4
00:00:07,762 --> 00:00:12,200
We give it an activity named Settings, 
which is declared in the Strings file.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,880
We also declare the main activity
as the parent activity. That way,

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,520
when you hit the up button 
in the settings activity,

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,030
it will return back to the main activity.
