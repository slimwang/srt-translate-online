1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,640
Okay, let's talk about
the options that we have here.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:12,290
So it is true at the time this ad ran,
this is a few years ago, that vendor a,

3
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:19,000
its systems didn't have as many,
sort of, reported attacks as vendor b's.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,367
Or maybe you can call this vendor a and
vendor m and

5
00:00:22,367 --> 00:00:25,990
you can figure out who a is and
who m is.

6
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:32,180
So it's true that it didn't, but
both of the systems were running complex

7
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:38,530
rich operating systems that supported
similar kind of applications.

8
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:42,490
So both tried their best to meet

9
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:47,400
the requirements that we listed for
a trusted computing base.

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,060
So it's not quite true that one
vendor's operating system was

11
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,400
significantly more secure
than the other vendor.

12
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,380
Okay, let's look at the second one.

13
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:01,040
The second option says, the two
operating systems were similar as far as

14
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,959
security was concerned but
one was not as big a target.

15
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,740
So this is about threat modeling
that we're talking about.

16
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,010
Who is that coming off to you?

17
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:16,750
And it is too at that time vendor
a's systems were not as big a target

18
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:23,050
as vendor b's, because vendor b actually
had most of the market belonged to it.

19
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:28,330
So the attackers obviously were
going after these kind of systems,

20
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:34,090
and vendor b's system was a much
bigger target than vendor a's.

21
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:37,730
One reason was,
as we said, market shares.

22
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:43,130
So in this case, I'm going to say,
this is one of the reasons why the claim

23
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:48,620
that vendor a's systems didn't suffer
as much as vendor b's was true,

24
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:53,054
because vendor a's system was
not as big a target, okay?

25
00:01:53,054 --> 00:01:54,755
So the last option says,

26
00:01:54,755 --> 00:01:59,297
the more secure OS could be much
simpler than the other one, okay?

27
00:01:59,297 --> 00:02:02,680
So this is our design principle for
secure systems.

28
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,960
So that's what I want
you to think about.

29
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,372
But I said both systems are actually
full faced operating systems.

30
00:02:09,372 --> 00:02:12,700
They supported same kind
of applications and

31
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,730
neither one of them actually
we can say was much simpler.

32
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,550
By the way this used to
be an ad that Apple ran.

33
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:25,750
And the sickly system that suffered from
all the ailments was a Windows system.

34
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,520
So I gave it away
