1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer for B is two again,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
same as A.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Add three values, but one can be deducted

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
from the other two.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So it's three minus one equals two.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
C is more difficult.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
There's nine possible combinations for A and B.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And we multiply nine

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
by the possible outcomes of C,

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
but we observe that we only need two for the outcomes.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And not three by the same the logic,

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
that A and B had two.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So nine times two equals eighteen.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
D is easier.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
There's three different condition values for D.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And again for each of those we need two outcomes.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The third one can be deducted,

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
which makes it six.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
E has three incoming arcs.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Three to the third is twenty-seven.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
For E itself, for each of these cases,

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
we need two variables for the outcome.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Which makes fifty-four.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And finally, F is the same as D,

25
00:01:01,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which is six.
