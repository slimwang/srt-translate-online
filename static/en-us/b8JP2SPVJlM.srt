As teens we start to identify less with our parents, and we may even reject

2
00:00:03,127 --> 00:00:07,759
them. Or at least their social beliefs and opinions. And we start to agree more

00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,509
with our friends and our peers. Of course, a major focus of our teenage years

4
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:17,824
is on sexual relationships, whether that be reality or fantasy. Sexual thoughts

5
00:00:17,824 --> 00:00:20,935
occupy a lot of a teenager's mind, and it's really common for teens to talk

6
00:00:20,935 --> 00:00:24,249
about sexual relationships with their friends.
