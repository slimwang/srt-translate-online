1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What we really said that we had a situation where

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
the prior P(C), a test with a certain sensitivity (Pos|C), and a certain specificity (Neg|¬C).

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
When you receive, say, a positive test result, what you do is,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
you take your prior P(C) you multiply in the probability of this test result, given C,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and you multiply in the probability of the test result given (Neg|¬C).

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So, this is your branch for the consideration that you have cancer.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This is your branch for the consideration you have no cancer.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
When you're done with this, you arrive at a number

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
that now combines the cancer hypothesis with the test result.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Look for the cancer hypothesis and the not cancer hypothesis.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Now, what you do, you add those up and then normally don't add up to one.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You get a certain quantity which happens to be the total probability

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
that the test is what it was, in this case positive.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And all you do next is divide or normalize this thing over here by

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
the sum over here and the same on the right side.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The divider is the same for both cases because this is your cancer branch, your non-cancer branch,

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
but this score does not depend on the cancer variable anymore.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
What you now get out is the desired posterior probability,

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and those add up to 1 if you did everything correct, as shown over here.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This is the algorithm for Bayes Rule.
