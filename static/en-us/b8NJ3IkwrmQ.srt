1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:05,199
If you plug in x equals zero, the result has to be five.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:13,132
Look at this term. If x equals zero, we have e to the power of zero, which is one.

3
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:16,566
To turn that into five, this has to be five.

4
00:00:16,567 --> 00:00:22,866
In the other box, we need to minus three. This is easy to see if you know about the chain rule.

5
00:00:22,867 --> 00:00:28,732
The inner derivative provides us with a factor of minus three, which we need.

6
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:32,766
If you don't know the chain rule, you can argue as follows:

7
00:00:32,767 --> 00:00:38,066
We start with e to the power of X. The standard exponential function.

8
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:47,466
Next, let's form e to the power of minus x, which means to flip that blue curve along the y axis.

9
00:00:47,467 --> 00:00:58,966
To compute E to the minus X for a specific value of X, we can compute E to the X for minus that value of X.

10
00:00:58,967 --> 00:01:03,232
So we're mirroring the blue curve to get the green curve.

11
00:01:03,233 --> 00:01:12,766
This additional factor of three accelerates the green curve. E to the power of minus 3x is three times as fast,

12
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:20,999
if you will, as E to the power of minus X. To compute E to the power of minus 3x for this X,

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,632
we can compute E to the power of minus X for three times that X.

14
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:32,966
And now look at the derivatives. By going from the blue curve--the regular exponential function--

15
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:38,366
--to the green curve, we are changing the sign of the derivative.

16
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:44,166
Here the derivative is positive. Now it's negative all of the time.

17
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:51,032
And with that additional factor of three in the exponent, you're boosting the derivative by a factor of three.

18
00:01:51,033 --> 00:01:59,632
Look at these triangles. The horizontal leg of this slope triangle is reduce by a factor of three,

19
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:04,333
meaning that the slope increases by a factor of three.
