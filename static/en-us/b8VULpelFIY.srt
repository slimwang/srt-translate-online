1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,965
Now the relationship between the variables in the candy machine situation we

2
00:00:03,965 --> 00:00:07,871
just talked about is of a special type, it's called a function. Now some more

3
00:00:07,871 --> 00:00:12,019
strictly mathematical examples of functions are things like I've written right

4
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:17,304
here. Y equals negative 2 x plus 5. Y equals x squared plus 5 x plus 6. Y equals

5
00:00:17,304 --> 00:00:21,030
negative 5. There are ton of other ones. Pretty much all of the equations for

6
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,506
lines and problems that you've seen in this course are functions. We just

7
00:00:24,506 --> 00:00:28,680
haven't been using this word yet. Now, however it is time. Think back to the

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,102
relationship between the input and output in the gumball examples from the last

9
00:00:33,102 --> 00:00:37,582
quiz. And then please complete this sentence here for me. If we consider x to be

10
00:00:37,582 --> 00:00:43,382
the input and y to be in the output of some function. Then there is no more than

11
00:00:43,382 --> 00:00:49,153
one value of, what for a given value of what. Remember again, how you answered

12
00:00:49,153 --> 00:00:53,792
the similar question for the candy example. You can also, of course, look at

13
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:58,400
values of x and y that satisfy each of these equations, or you can graph them to

14
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,503
figure this out.
