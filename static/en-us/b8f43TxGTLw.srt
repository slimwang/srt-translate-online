00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,590
How do we use pre-processing. We know that we can find structures like these in our graph.

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:11,900
And here can be other connections possibly--it don't have to be, but we'll ignore those for now.

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:16,379
Now, if we look at this structure from a brute force perspective, there are eight different possibilities

4
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,470
for assigning or not assigning these vertices here into a vertex cover.

5
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:26,270
The eight possibilities are as follows: either we can take no vertex at all into the vertex cover

6
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:30,060
and you already know that this going to cause a problem and we could take all of them

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,410
into the vertex cover, and then then the six more combinations.

8
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:38,650
A brute force search tree would look at eight possible assignments.

9
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:43,600
Out of these eight assignments, if you were to design a search tree that directly

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,790
branches into these cases here, there's only five cases that would even make sense.

11
00:00:48,790 --> 99:59:59,999
Please check which of these cases would make sense for a search tree.
