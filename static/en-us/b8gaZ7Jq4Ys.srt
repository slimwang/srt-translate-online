00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,404
Now that we have an equation for the perimeter and an equation for the area,

2
00:00:03,404 --> 00:00:08,089
let's try and rearrange this equation to solve it for l. We want to solve this

3
00:00:08,089 --> 00:00:11,865
equation for the length, so that way, we can perform the substitution for the

4
00:00:11,865 --> 00:00:17,506
length in this equation. We'll be able to solve this system of equation by

5
00:00:17,506 --> 00:00:22,627
doing so. So take this equation and solve it for l. What do you think we would

6
00:00:22,627 --> 00:00:23,510
get here?
