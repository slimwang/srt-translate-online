1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
As I said we should be able to do all these pretty easy--constant time.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The midpoint is the smallest number plus the biggest number divided by 2

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
so the average of those two. That's what? 114/2 which is 57.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The median is the number in the middle of the sorted list which let's see--51.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We've got one, two, three, four, five smaller and one, two, three, four, five bigger--so good.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And now we want the mean of these two number, which is 108/2 or 54.
