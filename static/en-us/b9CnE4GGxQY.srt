00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,379
The answer is x minus 1 times 3x plus 4. Recognizing that x minus 1 is a factor

00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:08,795
that both of these terms had, definitely takes a little bit of outside the box

3
00:00:08,795 --> 00:00:13,306
thinking. It is, however, in each term,multiplied by the other factors in the

4
00:00:13,306 --> 00:00:17,578
term so it count a factor. Just to get your brain jogging for later on in the

5
00:00:17,578 --> 00:00:22,232
course, think about what would happen if you multiply all this out. You did this

6
00:00:22,232 --> 00:00:26,453
before of course, but just think about this answer and the connection with, what

7
00:00:26,453 --> 00:00:29,018
this looks like when you distribute the terms.
