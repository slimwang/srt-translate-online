1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,601
Like we did before, we're going to start off by identifying the constant factors

2
00:00:05,613 --> 00:00:10,809
in this term, and then moving them to the front of the term. So our constant

3
00:00:10,821 --> 00:00:16,354
factors here are negative 5, negative 2, and 3. So we can write negative 5 times

4
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:21,824
negative 2 times 3, as the first three factors of our rewritten version of this

5
00:00:21,836 --> 00:00:26,363
term. Then after that come the variables, s, r and t. So you multiply the

6
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:31,127
constant factors by the variable factors. Remember that these multiplication

7
00:00:31,139 --> 00:00:35,966
signs between the variables actually aren't necessary. So I'm just going to get

8
00:00:35,978 --> 00:00:40,612
rid of those right away. Now, negative 5 times negative 2 is just positive 10.

9
00:00:40,716 --> 00:00:46,175
Remember, a negative times a negative. Equals a positive. So then we have 10

10
00:00:46,187 --> 00:00:52,069
times 3, and 10 times 3 is just equal to 30. So we can replace negative 5 times

11
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:58,062
negative 2 times 3 with 30, and then multiply that with the rest of the factors

12
00:00:58,074 --> 00:01:03,968
that are left over, srt. So our final simplified version of this term is 30 srt.

13
00:01:04,281 --> 00:01:08,982
Now to my eye, this looks much easier to deal with than this initial version of

14
00:01:08,994 --> 00:01:13,712
the term did. So I think we are making really good progress toward simplifying

15
00:01:13,724 --> 00:01:15,102
different expressions.
