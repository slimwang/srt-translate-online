00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,352
Let's see if we can use our knowledge of the greatest common factor to solve

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:08,931
this new equation. What's the greatest common factor of x squared, 5x, and 6?

3
00:00:08,931 --> 00:00:13,401
Now, this question is pretty tough, so take some time to think about it, and

4
00:00:13,401 --> 00:00:17,732
think about any number that can go in to each of the terms. Writing out the

5
00:00:17,732 --> 00:00:21,125
prime factorizations of each of these might help as well.
