00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,780
You created a Web App ID and
credentials.

00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,770
You added the client ID to
the endpoints.api definition.

00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,970
And if you have deployed,
then now when you load up your app,

00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:21,300
you should be able to do a sign in, get
a log in screen, go to My Profile, and

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,390
have your saved profile there.
