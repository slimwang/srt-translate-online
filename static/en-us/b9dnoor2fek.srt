1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,745
The solution to this compound inequality is negative infinity to negative 1

2
00:00:04,757 --> 00:00:09,350
union 4 to infinity. How did you do? Did you get it right? If so, great work.

3
00:00:09,455 --> 00:00:13,966
Let's see how we got that. Once again, I'm going to solve these inequalities

4
00:00:13,978 --> 00:00:18,532
independently and I'm going to start skipping a step or two. When I'm solving

5
00:00:18,544 --> 00:00:23,726
this inequality, I want to subtract 3x from both sides, which gives me 3x plus 5

6
00:00:23,738 --> 00:00:29,232
is less than 2. Subtracting 5 from both sides, gives me 3x is less than negative

7
00:00:29,244 --> 00:00:34,418
3. Divide both sides by 3, and I get x is less than negative 1. When I solve

8
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:39,745
this inequality, I'm going to skip the steps where I'm showing what I'm adding

9
00:00:39,757 --> 00:00:45,102
or subtracting to each side of the equation. In other words, here, I want to

10
00:00:45,114 --> 00:00:50,640
subtract x from both sides. When I subtract x from 2x, I am simply left with x

11
00:00:50,652 --> 00:00:56,203
plus 7 on the left side and when I subtract x from the right side, x minus x is

12
00:00:56,215 --> 00:01:01,426
0, so I get x plus 7 is 11. And when I subtract 7 from both sides, I get x is

13
00:01:01,438 --> 00:01:07,005
greater than 11 minus 7, which is 4. I have x is less than negative 1 or x is

14
00:01:07,017 --> 00:01:11,175
greater than 4. Let's see what that looks like on a number line. When I graph

15
00:01:11,187 --> 00:01:14,900
the solution of x is less than negative 1 on the number line, I have a

16
00:01:14,912 --> 00:01:19,115
parenthesis because it's less than, and I know it's going to the left because

17
00:01:19,127 --> 00:01:23,647
it's less than. Similarly, x is greater than 4 We've put a parenthesis at 4 and

18
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:28,015
since it's greater than, we're going to the right. The solution on the number

19
00:01:28,027 --> 00:01:32,296
line makes it really easy to write in interval notation. Since this arrow is

20
00:01:32,308 --> 00:01:36,664
going off to negative infinity, we start at negative infinity and we have to

21
00:01:36,676 --> 00:01:40,611
stop at negative 1. Since it's an or we have a union, and then we start up again

22
00:01:40,623 --> 00:01:43,799
at 4 and the arrow is going to positive infinity.

23
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:46,468
Let's go ahead and try one more compound inequality.
