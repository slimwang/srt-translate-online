1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,270
So far the machines we've made
in our reductions ie the ends,

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,640
have been relatively uncomplicated.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,180
They all either accepted every string or
they accepted no strings.

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,220
Unfortunately, reductions
can't always be done that way.

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,170
Since the machine that always loops and
the machine that always accepts.

6
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,710
Might both be in or might not be
in the language we're reducing to.

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,500
In these cases,
we need N to pay attention to its input.

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,330
Here's an example were
we will need to do this.

9
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,295
The language of descriptions
of Turing machines,

10
00:00:32,295 --> 00:00:35,015
where the Turing machine
accepts exactly one string.

11
00:00:35,015 --> 00:00:37,645
It doesn't make much
of a difference which

12
00:00:37,645 --> 00:00:39,845
undecidable language we reduce from.

13
00:00:39,845 --> 00:00:40,605
So this time,

14
00:00:40,605 --> 00:00:46,580
we'll reduce from the halting problem
to this single acceptance language.

15
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,730
Again, there are many
possible reductions.

16
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,090
I like this one.

17
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,220
We run the input machine
M on the empty string.

18
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,060
If M loops, then so will N.

19
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,320
We don't accept one string,
we accept none.

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,210
On the other hand,
if M does halt on the empty string,

21
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,710
then we make N act like
a machine in this language, S.

22
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,820
We'll have it just accept the empty
string, my favorite string.

23
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,620
This works because if M
loops on the empty string

24
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,590
than N will loop on every input and
hence accept nothing.

25
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,085
On the other hand,
if M does halt on the empty string,

26
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:27,020
then N will accept exactly one string,
the empty string.

27
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,830
Once again, in one case,
the language of N is the empty set.

28
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:35,730
In the other case,
the language of N is the empty string.

29
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,620
A decider for
the language S can tell the difference.

30
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:42,770
And therefore, would be able to decide
if M halted on the empty string or not.

31
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,330
Since this is impossible, a decider for

32
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:49,270
this single acceptance
language cannot exist.
