1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:06,210
Even the simplest of models can drastically improve the way we understand and

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,540
interact with systems.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:14,336
Consider the following example, in the United States the EPA tries

4
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:19,625
to protect the American public by examining new compounds and

5
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:23,095
classifying them as toxic or nontoxic.

6
00:00:23,095 --> 00:00:27,735
In the 1970s, a trained chemist would make the determination based on

7
00:00:27,735 --> 00:00:30,176
chemical properties of the compound.

8
00:00:30,176 --> 00:00:33,790
This process was slow and expensive.

9
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:37,260
So, the EPA started a project to see if you

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,110
could automate the classification of compounds with software instead.

11
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,660
The answer turned out to be a decisive yes.

12
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,740
A decision tree based model was able to algorithmically detect patterns in

13
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,870
the chemical properties that indicated toxicity.

14
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,140
Just like that.

15
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,460
A fast and inexpensive data driven model replaced an expensive and

16
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,160
difficult approach to solving the same problem.

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,450
You can find more information about this EPA project in the book linked in

18
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,550
the instructors notes.

19
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,790
>> Another interesting example is the field of advertising.

20
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,430
So originally, the advertising age was created by

21
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,380
Sigmund Freud's nephew Edward Bernays.

22
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,340
He used his uncle's theories of the mind to craft ways of

23
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,490
communicating with people.

24
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,640
In fact, in addition,

25
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,660
he was a pioneer of public relations as well as advertising.

26
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,759
See the instructor's notes to learn more about Bernays if you're curious.

27
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,180
Today, advertising looks like this.

28
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,060
Amazon sees what items you look at, collects the viewing and

29
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,120
buying history for you and other customers, and

30
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,360
recommends things that you are statistically likely to purchase.

31
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:54,540
Now this relies on models like collaborative filtering

32
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,128
to reveal patterns from data about buying habits among similar types of people.

33
00:01:59,128 --> 00:02:03,560
Advertising using data-driven models is now one of

34
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,740
the primary sources of revenue for a lot of small and

35
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,080
large companies and is the focus of a lot of data scientists.
