00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,205
We're going to use our knowledge of radicals and factoring to solve quadratic

2
00:00:03,205 --> 00:00:06,896
equations. We'll use three different strategies in this unit, and we'll learn

3
00:00:06,896 --> 00:00:11,190
them one by one. The three methods are the square root method, completing the

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,040
square and the quadratic formula. First, we'll learn each of the methods, and

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,695
then you'll have a chance to pick which method you think is best to use in

6
00:00:17,695 --> 00:00:22,506
different cases. For this lesson let's start by focusing on the square root

7
00:00:22,506 --> 00:00:23,410
method.
