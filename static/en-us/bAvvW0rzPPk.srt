00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,169
I'm sorry about that, Andy, I'm sorry about that, viewers at home. But now I'm

3
00:00:06,169 --> 00:00:10,915
back, I'm good and now we're ready for one of my favorite senses, hearing.

4
00:00:10,915 --> 00:00:14,755
>> It's alright Lauren, I really had no idea that a smell could bring back such an

5
00:00:14,755 --> 00:00:16,980
emotional response.

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,970
>> Anyways the event we're about to do now is all about the sensation and

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,475
perception of sound.

8
00:00:23,475 --> 00:00:27,567
>> Really, Andy. And now, I think myself included, that our viewers would like to

9
00:00:27,567 --> 00:00:29,880
know what exactly is sound?

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,952
>> Well, sound is a wave.

11
00:00:30,952 --> 00:00:32,512
>> Now what do you mean by wave?

12
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:38,323
>> So, let's take a look at sound with our patented UdaciTablet system. So, sound

13
00:00:38,323 --> 00:00:42,105
is just a pressure wave through the air, and air is just a bunch of molecules

14
00:00:42,105 --> 00:00:48,820
spread out like this. And here, each little black dot is just an air molecule.

15
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,292
And when something like a speaker, which I've drawn here, makes a sound, it

16
00:00:52,292 --> 00:00:56,957
does so by vibrating this part back and forth. So, it would go forward and

17
00:00:56,957 --> 00:01:01,996
backwards, and forwards, and backwards, and so on. And this actually causes all

18
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:06,180
of the air molecules to bunch up in some places, like this. And you can see

19
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,184
regions where there are a high density of air molecules. And region where

20
00:01:10,184 --> 00:01:14,376
there's a low density. And this, in turn, creates region of high pressure, and

21
00:01:14,376 --> 00:01:16,639
regions of low pressure.
