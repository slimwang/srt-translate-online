1
00:00:00,137 --> 00:00:00,804
So, Paul.

2
00:00:00,804 --> 00:00:01,345
>> Mm?

3
00:00:01,345 --> 00:00:04,773
>> It seems like it's probably worth
reiterating the time allowances for

4
00:00:04,773 --> 00:00:06,095
each of the stages in RAIL.

5
00:00:06,095 --> 00:00:07,584
>> You mean LIAR.

6
00:00:07,584 --> 00:00:08,554
>> Even better.

7
00:00:08,554 --> 00:00:09,262
>> Yeah, okay.

8
00:00:09,262 --> 00:00:12,032
>> [LAUGH].
>> Okay, LIAR stands for load, idle,

9
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:14,554
animations, and responsiveness.

10
00:00:14,554 --> 00:00:17,671
During the load stage you have about one
second or a thousand milliseconds to

11
00:00:17,671 --> 00:00:20,252
render the page before the app
no longer feels responsive, and

12
00:00:20,252 --> 00:00:21,780
the user's attention level falls.

13
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,930
Download and
render your critical resources here.

14
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,080
After loading, the app is idle, and

15
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,060
this is a great time to do
non-essential work to ensure that

16
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:36,390
whatever interactions occur after
this period will feel instantaneous.

17
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,720
Your app's idle time should be broken
down into 50 millisecond chunks so

18
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,750
that you can stop when
the user starts interacting.

19
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,320
>> During the animation stage,
such as when users are scrolling or

20
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,930
animations are occurring, you only have
16 milliseconds to render a frame.

21
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,970
This is when 60 frames per
second is absolutely critical.

22
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,300
>> Lastly, there's the response period.

23
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,620
The human mind has about 100
milliseconds' grace period

24
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,140
before an interaction with
the site feels laggy and janky.

25
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,680
That means your app needs to
respond to user input in some way

26
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,770
within a 100 milliseconds.

27
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,640
Using this time wisely is
absolutely critical for

28
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,660
setting up difficult animations
that run at 60 frames a second.

29
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,640
>> In the next few quizzes, you'll be
asked to apply what you've learned about

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,770
RAIL in some real-world scenarios.
