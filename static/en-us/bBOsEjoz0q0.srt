00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,260
In this lesson we continue to study

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,360
control hazards. We already know about branch

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,810
vectors, but we also know that some

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,590
branches are really difficult to predict, even

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,860
when we have a sophisticated branch predictor. So, in this lesson, we will see

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,350
how the compiler can help us completely

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,120
avoid some of the hard to predict branches
