00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,570
Let's discuss a typical DDOS
attack scenario by botnets.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,390
First, the attacker
decides the victim and

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,010
when the victim machine
should be attacked.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,940
In order to launch a DDOS attack,

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,680
the attacker must be able
to commandeer a botnet.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,660
Here, we assume that the bots
already have the bot code,

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,680
and the bot code communicates
with the attacker regularly.

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,700
To start the attack,

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,090
the attacker sends the command
to all the bots in the botnet.

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,090
For example,
the command would tell the bots to send

11
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,930
connection request to
the victim at once.

12
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,380
The result is that the victim gets
connection requests from many,

13
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,270
many bots at the same time.

14
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,890
Therefore, the victim
is being overloaded and

15
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,540
the effect of denial of
service is accomplished.
