1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,920
The correct answer is use whitelisting

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,170
to allow only well-defined
set of safe values.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,880
Blacklisting is very hard to implement,
because there can be many,

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,910
many possible ways to
inject malicious strings.

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,190
That is, it's very hard to
have a complete blacklist.
