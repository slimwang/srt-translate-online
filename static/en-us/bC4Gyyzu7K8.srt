1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,320
It's very important to align all
the different stakeholders towards

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,740
that same goals.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,770
First, everyone needs to have a shared
view on what the current situation is.

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:09,850
What are the goals?

5
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,180
What are the current practices and
flows?

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,000
All of the stakeholders
should participate and

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,780
work together to
formulate the end goals.

8
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,700
Shared input generally creates
shared responsibility and ownership.

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,820
People are willing to work
together if their thoughts and

10
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,410
opinions are being heard.

11
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,410
It's important to have a shared
view on problems and identify and

12
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,890
eliminate bottlenecks.

13
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,009
The bottlenecks can be inside
departments or between them.

14
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,870
It's not really important as
long as they're being addressed.

15
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,440
And it's also important to have
shared benefits amongst the team.

16
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,090
You want to make sure that you have
all the involved stakeholders get

17
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,470
the benefit of a new product release.

18
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,970
To achieve that you need to define and
measure key performance indicators for

19
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,990
the whole cross functional team.

20
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,720
You cannot improve what
you cannot measure.
