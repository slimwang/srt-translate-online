1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,530
Yes, stressful moments building a team,
there really are a lot.

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,550
And the biggest one for
me I remember is then, and honestly,

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,955
I still feel this today even in a larger
company when you get to hire somebody,

4
00:00:09,955 --> 00:00:13,690
you've decided that you want
them to join the company.

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,950
It's that moment when you are waiting
for them to get back to you, because

6
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:22,348
once you've decided that somebody is
going to help you grow your company and

7
00:00:22,348 --> 00:00:25,808
get you to the next step,
it feels like life or death to you.

8
00:00:25,808 --> 00:00:27,921
And so you're just sitting there like,
please say yes, please say yes.

9
00:00:27,921 --> 00:00:30,280
Texting them may be a little too much.

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,040
You know, it's almost like dating.

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,410
So yeah, it's a little stressful.
