Do you guys know who Ariel Parson is?

00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,110
>> I think it's my dermatologist.

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:05,731
>> Wait?

4
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:08,720
No.

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,655
>> No.
No idea.

6
00:00:09,655 --> 00:00:10,430
No.

7
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,100
>> No one I know.

8
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,140
>> That's great,
do you know what this means?

9
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,270
This means that there is somebody out
there that is not either a direct

10
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,500
friend, family member,

11
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,842
or pet of someone in this room
that's using Shopping List++.

High fives, JP!

15
00:00:29,807 --> 00:00:32,164
>> You seem a lot more energetic.

16
00:00:32,164 --> 00:00:37,218
Yeah, I don't know if it's that red
black caffeinated insta I had or

17
00:00:37,218 --> 00:00:42,458
the fact that I've finally been able to
get some sleep, but man, I feel great.

18
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:43,961
That's good to hear.

19
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:44,461
That's good to hear.

20
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,757
>> This is a real person.

21
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:49,530
>> I know a real person.

22
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,490
>> No, that's not what I meant.

23
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,540
This is a spambot or a malicious user.

24
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,326
>> Nah.

25
00:00:55,326 --> 00:00:56,403
I mean, come on JP.

26
00:00:56,403 --> 00:00:58,980
It's not like somebody's trying
to hack into our system.

27
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,309
>> Well, I hate to burst your bubble but
now the app is released,

28
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:04,816
aren't you at all
concerned about security?

29
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:06,035
>> Not now JP.

30
00:01:06,035 --> 00:01:07,681
