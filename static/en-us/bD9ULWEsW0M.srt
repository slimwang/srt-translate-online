00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,522
The correct answer is a one tail test in the negative direction. This is

2
00:00:04,522 --> 00:00:08,542
because, when we compute our T test, we expect a negative value, in other

3
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:13,965
words, we expect x bar to be smaller than mu. So, here's where our critical

4
00:00:13,965 --> 00:00:17,566
region would be. Notice, we wouldn't do a two tail test because our alternative

5
00:00:17,566 --> 00:00:21,752
hypothesis says we're only looking for a negative difference. Which is also why

6
00:00:21,752 --> 00:00:24,680
we wouldn't do a one tail test in the positive direction and a 3 tail test, I

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,900
just made that up. There's no such thing.
