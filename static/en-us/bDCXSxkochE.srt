1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And this answer is tricky. We will derive it through the truth table. Now there's eight possible cases.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Flip one can come of heads or tail; same for flip two, heads, tail, heads, tail;

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and the same for flip three and if you look at this every possible combination is represented.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
For example, these are heads, tail, tail.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Now each of those outcomes has the same probability of an eighth, because it's eight cases.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So 8 x 1/8 sums up to 1. In how many cases do we have exactly one H?

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It turns out that it's true for only three cases.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The H could be in the first position, in the second position, or in the third position.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So three out of eight cases have a single H.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Each of those carries a probability so we sum those cases up to carry a total of 3/8 of a probability.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 99:59:59,999
These are the same as 0.375.
