1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
And of course, again, we'll do this as a quiz so, my first question for you

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,860
regarding the first success-factor is this.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:13,200
In this line here, when we pick a random (0, 1) assignment for the variables

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,820
how many variables can we expect to get right on average?

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,720
By right, I mean, if in a satisfying assignment the variable is set to false,

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,850
then this random assignment here also sets it to false and if it needs to be set to true

7
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,960
this random assignment here also sets it to true.

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,850
So, my three choices for you here are the following:

9
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,670
Can we expect to nearly get all the variables correct in this random assignment here?

10
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:41,840
Can we expect to get about half the variables correct in this random assignment here?

11
00:00:41,840 --> 99:59:59,999
Or is it not possible to make a statement about this here?
