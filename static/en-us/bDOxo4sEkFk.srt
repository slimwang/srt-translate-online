Okay, now that you're storing
the list of users who are shopping,

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,210
can you make the information visible
to anyone looking at the list?

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,500
Here I'm looking at the active
list details activity screen, and

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,220
right around here I'd like you to
say who's in the store shopping.

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,260
I'll send over spec right
now with more details.
