00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,530
Remember, our goal in analyzing this Facebook user data is to

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,990
understand our users and their behavior. This question is just another

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,650
dimension where we're trying to understand which segment of our population

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,600
uses a certain feature on the website. In this case, we're

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,870
wondering whether or not males or females end up using likes

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,380
on the World Wide Web more often. So, first I'm just

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,612
going to remind myself of what variables are in my data set.

8
00:00:22,612 --> 00:00:25,430
I'm wanting to compare likes between the genders, so I'm going to

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:30,320
use www_likes. This code would give me a histogram which isn't

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,690
what I want. And remember I also need to subset my

11
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,812
data to remove any values for gender that are in a.

12
00:00:36,812 --> 00:00:39,276
Now this bit of code is starting to look more like what

13
00:00:39,276 --> 00:00:42,252
I want. But, I've only got one frequency polygon on here,

14
00:00:42,252 --> 00:00:44,380
and I need two. So I'm going to use the color

15
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,620
parameter, and pass a gender. That seems a little bit better.

16
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,460
I'm also going to add scale x continuous, since I know that

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,740
World Wide Web likes is on a continuous scale. Alright, now

18
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,220
we're looking at a reasonable plot. Zooming in, it looks like males

19
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,690
typically have more likes on the web. But I can't really make

20
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,770
sense of the tail end of this graph. This is long tail

21
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,480
data, so let's use a log transformation to see if we can

22
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,480
get a better look at what's happening down here. I'm going to

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,940
go back to my code and add a scale x log 10.

24
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:16,430
Running this code we get a different plot with much more information.

25
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,620
It looks like males have more likes on the web

26
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,010
at first, but we can see that females overtake males

27
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,540
at this point in the graph. So this still leaves

28
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,410
me wondering who really has more likes, men or women?
