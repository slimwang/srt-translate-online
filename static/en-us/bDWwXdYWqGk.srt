00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,064
So B.F Skinner studied rats and pigeons in an operand conditioning chamber,

2
00:00:04,064 --> 00:00:08,650
which is called a Skinner box. Inside the Skinner box, they have a food

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:13,493
dispenser and a level that the rat can press. Other conditioning chambers have

4
00:00:13,493 --> 00:00:17,506
things such as lights, as well. Now you might wonder why did Skinner look at

5
00:00:17,506 --> 00:00:21,740
rats and pigeons in a Skinner box. Well it turns out that what he learned from

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,964
the Skinner box can be applied to humans, meaning the information from the

7
00:00:24,964 --> 00:00:30,894
animals generalizes to human behavior as well. First we want to know why does

8
00:00:30,894 --> 00:00:34,556
the rat first press the lever. Well, it turns out rats are exploratory

9
00:00:34,556 --> 00:00:37,936
creatures, meaning they will walk around their environment and check it out,

10
00:00:37,936 --> 00:00:41,056
And so when the rat is first placed in the Skinner Box, it may go over to the

11
00:00:41,056 --> 00:00:46,931
corner Stand up and smell the walls. But eventually it may come over and bump

12
00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:51,651
into the lever, or stand on it to smell something up here. When that first

13
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:56,707
occurrence happens, we can deliver a food pellet to the rat. But how do we get

14
00:00:56,707 --> 00:01:01,374
the rat to press a lever again? We can get the rat to press the lever through

15
00:01:01,374 --> 00:01:05,444
the process of shaping, and shaping is reinforcing successive approximations to

16
00:01:05,444 --> 00:01:10,526
the final target behavior. So if the rat were standing over here in the corner,

17
00:01:10,526 --> 00:01:15,425
I wouldn't deliver a food pellet. However if the rat started to approach the

18
00:01:15,425 --> 00:01:20,034
lever, I could deliver a food pellet. Eventually you'll reinforcing those

19
00:01:20,034 --> 00:01:23,863
behaviors that are closest to the final one. Shaping is important for many of

20
00:01:23,863 --> 00:01:26,084
our operant conditioning and behaviors.
