00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,870
I used SW pre cache with gulp.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,610
I installed a set of gulp plug ins
that I wanted to use and SW pre cache.

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:16,440
Then in my gulp file.js,
I added a generate SW task.

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,540
And added a few static file
globs including my index.html,

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,360
images and my styles.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,100
I kept it pretty simple since
I don't have many files.

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,860
But for
bigger projects this'll be more complex.

8
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,920
And you'll probably want to have
a separate source and disk directory.

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,040
I told swPrecache to strip the dot
from the front of the static

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,710
files it included so
that everything is served from the root.

11
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:47,170
I also added runtime caching using
network first for the weather API.

12
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:52,830
I could run gulp generate-sw but
then I miss out on the automagical

13
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:56,840
service worker regeneration
whenever I change any files.

14
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,540
So instead,

15
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:02,370
I'll use gulp serv which uses browser
sync to serve the files locally.

16
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,500
Then anytime any of my files
are changed, not only does the service

17
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,160
worker get rebuilt but
the browser refreshes automatically.

18
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,540
If you want to see exactly what
I did the solution I built

19
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,110
is in the instructor notes.

20
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,650
It includes the gulp file.js and
a package.json.

21
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:22,060
So you can simply run MPN installed
to get everything you need.
