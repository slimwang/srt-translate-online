00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,370
Bandwidth and latency are the two
networky things that people often mean

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,490
when they refer to speed
of a network connection.

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:12,580
Or rather, low bandwidth and high
latency can both feel like slowness.

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,350
This is a map of the world.

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,510
Well actually, it's just a map
of the Northern hemisphere.

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,300
But that's okay.

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,270
It'll do for this example.

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,760
Here are a few places around the world.

9
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:24,660
Here's Alice.

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,630
Alice lives in California.

11
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,830
Alice clicks a button in your web app.

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,490
The app performs a query
to your web server.

13
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,430
But Alice is here.

14
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,420
And your web server's over here
in Riga Latvia, many hops away.

15
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,260
Maybe traffic has to go to Chicago,
to New York,

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,160
over the ocean to London,
down into France,

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,330
bum around in like the middle of Europe
for a while, eventually get to Latvia.

18
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:53,010
And then your server itself consults

19
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,430
an API server that's
back in let's say Paris.

20
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,340
And that takes some time to respond.

21
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,430
By the time the response gets
all the way back to Alice,

22
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,150
it's been a few seconds.

23
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,910
So the app's response to Alice's mouse
click doesn't feel instantaneous.

24
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:08,890
It feels laggy.

25
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,620
That's high latency.

26
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,920
Now here's Bob.

27
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,030
Bob's computer is from 1997, and

28
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:17,250
he's using an old dial up
modem to connect to his ISP.

29
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,060
Bob goes to your website.

30
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,940
And his browser starts downloading
your site's logo which is 100

31
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,460
kilobytes in size.

32
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,550
Over the next 15 seconds, your logo
slowly appears on Bob's screen.

33
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,340
That's low bandwidth.

34
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,740
Now one of the biggest contributors to
latency on the network is just plain

35
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,990
old distance and number of hops.

36
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,480
Internet signals are bound
by the speed of light.

37
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,930
And the routers that move
them around the globe

38
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,750
take some time to switch
their signals around.

39
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,670
When you're done with this video,
I suggest you go watch

40
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,950
Admiral Grace Hopper's video entitled
Nanoseconds, which is on YouTube, to get

41
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:55,090
an idea of just how far things can
travel in those short periods of time.

42
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,264
Now depending on what your app does and
how your users use it,

43
00:01:59,264 --> 00:02:01,530
bandwidth may not matter much at all.

44
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,950
If you're serving big photos or
video, of course it will.

45
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,030
If you're serving mostly text and small
images, your site can be fast even for

46
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,440
people on very low bandwidth networks.

47
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,480
Today that's less likely to mean old
modems, and more likely to mean maybe

48
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,880
slow cell phones, which are actually
not all that much faster than dial up.
