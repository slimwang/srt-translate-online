00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It's out pleasure to be here today with Guido van Rossum, inventor of the Python programming language.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
[Guido van Rossum, Author, Python Language:] I stayed relatively close the ABC,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and ABC's ideals just sort of naturally lead to a language that is easy to teach.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I was in a situation where my two choice were on one hand Shell,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
which is easy and nice for simple scripts, but sort of limited if you want to do anything complex,

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
especially in those days when it was like well before Bash, the original Bourne shell

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
that I mostly had to deal with.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Then on the other hand, the C language, which you can use to do anything you want,

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
including implementing your own programming language,

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
but it all takes a lot of effort and it's easy to make mistakes

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
that only sort of come out much later after you've already implemented a lot of code.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You'll realize, oh, I should've used a different kind of data structure and start over from scratch.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That original computer programming for everybody idea, in part was just a ploy

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
to get funding from certain corners--if I may admit to that.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
One of the reasons that in the end note much happened

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
was that the funding turned out to be much harder to obtain than just writing a proposal

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and winning some contests, which we all did successfully,

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and then getting the funding turned out to be still an impossible hurdle.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I know plenty of teachers who have been teaching Python to high school students at some level.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I heard recently that somewhere in England there is a national initiative that is at least considering--

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I don't know how much that actually became a definite plan

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
to teach Python to all high school students there, which is a great idea--

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
a wonderful experiment, and no matter what the outcome,

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
a lot will be learned from that experiment.
