1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,300
Now, that we've created this user.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,750
Let's go ahead and
connect to our server as that user.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,200
I've opened a new terminal here, and
this terminal is on my local machine.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,050
I have not connected to the server yet.

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:18,919
I can connect to the server using this
command, ssh student@127.0.0.1 -p 2222.

6
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:21,880
Let's break this command
down a little bit.

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,280
We've been connecting to our
server using vagrant SSHwhich

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,130
is just a shortcut for all of this.

9
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:32,439
SSH is the application we use to
remotely connect to the server.

10
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:38,150
And 127.0.0.1 is the IP
address we want to connect to.

11
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:42,230
This is a standard IP address
that always means localhost or

12
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,300
the same computer I'm currently on.

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,700
The student@ is the user
we want to log in as.

14
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,068
We want to log in as
student@ this IP address.

15
00:00:52,068 --> 00:00:59,060
Finally, the -p 2222 flag tells
us to connect using port 2222.

16
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,410
When Vagrant set up our virtual machine,
it automatically set up this port on

17
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,160
our local machine to forward
to the virtual machine.

18
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,490
After hitting Enter, you may be asked
an authenticity verification question.

19
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,170
Just hit yes, and then you're asked for
the user's password.

20
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,020
Enter that, and
you'll be logged in as the student.
