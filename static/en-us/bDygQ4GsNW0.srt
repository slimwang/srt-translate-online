00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,930
This section is all about
the Unity documentation,

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:04,880
which is incredibly important.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,390
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

4
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:09,440
Actually a lot of people have
the misconception that coding is just

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,570
sitting down and typing.

6
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,090
But in fact, there's a lot of prep
work that goes into understanding

7
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,520
the library they're using beforehand.

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,590
In this case, it's the Unity library,

9
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,960
which has all of the code organized
into a tree of functionality.

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,820
So once you understand how these name
spaces work, then it's a lot smoother.

11
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,340
&gt;&gt; Yeah, once you figure out how the
documentation is structured you can go

12
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,790
so much faster.

13
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,150
So, let's dive right in.
