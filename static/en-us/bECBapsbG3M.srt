1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,840
This multiplication, simplifies to this expression. Now this might look really

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,225
complicated, but it's not too tough to get there. First, we distribute the cube

3
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:14,730
root of 4xy to each of the terms in our second parentheses. When we multiply

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:21,976
these two cube roots together, we'll get 64, x cubed, y cubed. So we know this

5
00:00:21,976 --> 00:00:26,140
distribution gives us this first term. Now we want to distribute this to the

6
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,322
second term. For the second term, we'll have the cube root of 12, and then xy,

7
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:35,946
from these variables here. Next we distribute the cube root of 2 to this term.

8
00:00:35,946 --> 00:00:42,166
So we'll have the cube root of 32x squared y squared. And finally for our last

9
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:47,302
term we'll have the cubed root of 2 times the cubed root of 3. Which equals the

10
00:00:47,302 --> 00:00:51,271
cube root of 6. Next we try to simplify any of the radicals that we can. The

11
00:00:51,271 --> 00:00:57,890
cubed root of 64 equals 4. And the cubed root of x cubed y cubed is xy. This

12
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,355
radical is already simplified since there's no factor that repeats 3 times

13
00:01:01,355 --> 00:01:06,261
underneath the radical, so we leave it as is. We can't simplify the x squared y

14
00:01:06,261 --> 00:01:12,230
squared since we don't have a group of 3. But we can simplify 32 here, since 32

15
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:17,709
is the same thing as 8 times 4. The cubed root of 8 equals 2, and this leads us

16
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:22,160
to our answer. On the end here, the cubed root of 6 can't be simplified, so we

17
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,324
have to tack it onto the end. There's no like terms here since none of the

18
00:01:26,324 --> 00:01:31,502
radicands are equal. So we're done. This is our final answer.
