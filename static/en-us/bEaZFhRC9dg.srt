00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,300
Any time you want to operate on a bunch
of files that have similar names,

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,020
you can use a glob pattern to do it.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,570
I am not making up this name.

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,830
Globbing is the real,
actual, technical term for

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,670
matching files by name
in the Unix shell.

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,690
Seriously, globbing.

7
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,275
If you don't believe me you
can look it up, man glob.

8
00:00:19,275 --> 00:00:22,880
Globbing is a kind of pattern
matching for file names.

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,010
When you write a glob pattern in
a shell command, the shell turns

10
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,800
that pattern into a list of file names
that exist to match the pattern.

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,750
For instance,
a star matches any string of characters.

12
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:40,160
You can use a star at the beginning or
at the end of a pattern.

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,940
Patterns can be all sorts
of different lengths.

14
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,990
You can use two stars
in the same pattern.

15
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:50,040
For instance, here, matching every
file whose name contains pp.

16
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,470
A star can appear in
the middle of a pattern.

17
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:57,000
Matching all the files that
start with B and end with png.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,700
There are other patterns
you can use as well.

19
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,960
For instance,
to match files that end in either CSS or

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,006
HTML, a list of strings in curly braces
will match any of the alternatives.

21
00:01:08,006 --> 00:01:11,524
A single question mark
matches any one character.

22
00:01:11,524 --> 00:01:16,060
So BEA question mark dot
png matches both bean and

23
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,540
bear, but it doesn't match beer or bees.

24
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,200
Two question marks matches
two characters, and so on.

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,874
List of characters inside square
brackets matches any one of

26
00:01:27,874 --> 00:01:33,280
the characters inside those brackets,
so be and then square brackets

27
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,795
A-E-I-O-U R dot png will match bear and
beer, but not bean or bees.

28
00:01:38,795 --> 00:01:41,715
Something to watch out for
is that file names in Linux are always

29
00:01:41,715 --> 00:01:44,870
case sensitive, and
that applies to globbing too.

30
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:50,030
For instance, if you have files
that end in jpg in capitals and

31
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:55,300
files that end in jpg in lower case,
you have to specify which one you want.

32
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,170
If you want both,
you could use the curly braces.
