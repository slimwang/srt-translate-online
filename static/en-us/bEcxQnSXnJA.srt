00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,520
The visitor pattern is quite powerful and popular however there are some

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,820
issues with it. First off the implementation of the operations are placed in

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,280
a different place from the Elements being operated on.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:18,250
It means that the operations are kept together. The elements are kept together

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,980
but in a sense encapsulation is compromised because those two are separated.

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,910
Second consequence is that adding new operations is straightforward,

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:30,770
you just have new classes on the visitor side of things.

8
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,300
In a sense you are actually extending the operations on a class without changing

9
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,870
the class itself on the other hand adding new element types is hard.

10
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:43,400
This would break the data structure and cause a lot of reprogramming.

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,510
Final consequences, if you need to, visitors can accumulate state as I

12
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:51,660
indicated before an example would be collecting statistics.
