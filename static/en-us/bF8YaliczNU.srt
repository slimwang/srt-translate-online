00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,570
I'm really proud of all that
you've done with Project Compass.

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:03,340
>> Thanks.

3
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,680
I had some rough moments but
I definitely learned a lot too.

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,280
>> What's your next step?

5
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,900
>> I was thinking that I should
try to learn more about my users,

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,060
see how I can reach more people.

7
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,110
>> Sounds like you want
to analyze some data.

8
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,850
That's what data analysts do.

9
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,410
Data analysts make informed
decisions about data.

10
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,590
Let's check it out.

11
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,500
Data analysts solve many
different types of problems.

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,650
They identify meaningful relationships,
patterns or trends from datasets.

13
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,770
Data analysts built reports and

14
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:37,980
data dashboards on mint.com so users
can track and visualize their spending.

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,729
They also use applied statistics and
machine learning algorithms.

16
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:47,610
Facebook's facial recognition software
uses an algorithm to create a template

17
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,440
based on a person's facial
features to suggest

18
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,650
who you should tag in your photos.

19
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,370
They also represent data in engaging
ways with data visualizations.

20
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:02,160
One of my favorite data visualization
blogs is Information is Beautiful.

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,380
They take ideas, issues, and
data to create visualizations for

22
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,480
people to understand complex data.

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,120
Netflix, the online movie and

24
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,530
TV streaming service is known
to make data driven decisions.

25
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:19,630
They analyze data points such as
what time of day movies are watched,

26
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:23,810
the time spent selecting movies,
and how often playback is stopped,

27
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,390
to predict the perfect
viewing option for users.

28
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,330
Amazon uses big data to drive
their recommendations feature.

29
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,530
They take data points such
as your previous purchases,

30
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,570
the items you add to your cart or

31
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,181
previous ratings to make suggestions
about products you may be interested in.

32
00:01:41,805 --> 00:01:44,435
Data analysts at Hired,
created a State of U.S.

33
00:01:44,435 --> 00:01:49,375
Salary Report to give visibility into
the job market for software engineers.

34
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,745
Let's hear from Jessica,
who worked on this report at Hired.
