Let's turn that to a physical, rather than an electronic percept,

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,620
the mode switch. Remember, that was on the top, front of the,

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,470
radio. The sliding mode switch controls, whether the device is off.

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,730
On playing the radio continuously, on laying the radio only when the wake up

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:21,520
time is reached or on beeping, only when the wake up time is reached.

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,060
Can you model this percept with a finite state machine?
