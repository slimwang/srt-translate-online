>> Here are samples of size 10 from each of these distributions. So I'm going to

2
00:00:04,814 --> 00:00:09,495
find the first quartile, which we'll henceforth call Q1 for the general

3
00:00:09,495 --> 00:00:14,611
population. And I'm also going to find the third quartile, which we'll call Q3.

4
00:00:14,611 --> 00:00:19,171
First, let's split the data in half. So we have five values above, and five

5
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:26,042
values below. Then we find, essentially, the median of this half, which is

6
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:33,309
38,801. So this is Q1, the value of the first quartile. And then we find the

7
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:40,770
median of the second half, which is 56,863. So this is Q3 and the median we'll

8
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:46,992
call Q2. And our new range, then, will be the distance between Q1 and Q3. So

9
00:00:46,992 --> 00:00:53,010
18,062, then, is our new range, when we cut off the upper and lower tails. Or

10
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:59,196
the upper and lower 25%. So now, how 'bout you do the same for this one. Cut off

11
00:00:59,196 --> 00:01:05,414
the upper and lower 25%. This one is Mark Zuckerberg. And then let's find the

12
00:01:05,414 --> 00:01:09,995
range between Q1 and Q3. Put your answer here in the box.
