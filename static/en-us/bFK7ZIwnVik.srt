00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay--let's learn about another input type.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm going to change our main input

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
from type="password" to type="checkbox".

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And this, as you might imagine, will make a checkbox.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
When we go to our form, I hit Reload,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and now we have a checkbox next to our Submit button.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
When I check this checkbox--you know--

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
a checkbox is for toggling something on and off--I'm sure you've seen them before.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
When I check this checkbox and hit Submit,

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
we see in our URL the "q" parameter equals "on".

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That means that the box was checked.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What happens--and you can try this yourself--

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
when I hit Submit, when the checkbox isn't checked?

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Is it off, the parameter doesn't appear at all,

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
the parameter is blank

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
or is it the string, "hunter2"?
