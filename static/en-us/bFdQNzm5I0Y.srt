00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,000
To illustrate analogical reasoning and

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,740
design, or analogical design, we'll talk about a specific problem,

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,440
let us suppose we design a robot that can walk on water.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,790
Nature already offers several examples of organisms that can walk on water,

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,130
this is a picture of the basilisk lizard, which can walk very well on water and

6
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:23,370
catch it's prey. Recall that we said earlier that for analogical mapping and

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:28,470
crossword worker row, requires a deep understanding of the source case and

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,740
the target problem. That is true here as well in case of analogical design,

9
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:37,500
we require a deep understanding of the locomotion of the basilisk lizard,

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,870
in order to be able to design a robot that can walk on water, inspired by

11
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:45,490
the design of the basilisk lizard. Here is a model of the basilisk lizard,

12
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:49,010
this model is sometimes called structure behavior function model.

13
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,880
This particular picture doesn't show the structure,

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,940
it just shows the function and the behavior. The function is shown at

15
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,660
the top here, It is shown by it's initial state and it's goal state, and

16
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,900
it's function is achieve by behavior shown here. The behavior is represented as

17
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,620
a series of states, and transitions between those states. We will not talk about

18
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:12,970
the representations in more detail here, readings given in the class notes

19
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,890
give this sort of representations a lot more detail if you are so interested.
