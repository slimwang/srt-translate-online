>> Notice I didn't need to tell David what coffee house, what time of day,

2
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,770
what he was ordering, who the cashier was etc. He has a script for that scene.

3
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:32,189
And he associates it when needed. It helps with different expectations like,

4
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,900
the cashier's going to give me my total, my drink should be coming up soon.

5
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,470
If those expectations are not met, he knows something has gone wrong and

6
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,930
he needs to react. This is the power of script.

7
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,910
It helps to generate expectations about scenes in the world.
