1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,010
The event's object has properties for
each one of the event names.

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:08,730
So we need to have birthday,
party and present's events.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,230
The callbacks need to be
added to the right events.

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,400
So purchase needs to be
added to every single event.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,580
The presents event also needs
to call the build function.

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,860
So it needs an additional entry.

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,030
These are the solutions.

8
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:25,950
Remember that backbone's events API
function can handle an event name that's

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,780
an object, a single string,
or a space separated string.

10
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,090
If it's a space separated string,
then it will split on the space and

11
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,450
add the callback to each event.
