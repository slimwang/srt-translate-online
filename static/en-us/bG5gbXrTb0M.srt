1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,940
The last class of drugs we're going to discuss are the hallucinogens, or

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:09,470
psychedelics. These drugs can erratically distort the way a person perceives.

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:14,270
In addition, it can change the way they think, as well as the way they feel.

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,955
Sometimes when people take these substances, they can experience great fear or

5
00:00:17,955 --> 00:00:22,244
anxiety. But in some cases, they say that it changes the way they view the

6
00:00:22,244 --> 00:00:27,460
world. In addition, we see that people can experience synesthesia, and this is

7
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,976
a crossing over of the senses. For example, a person may hear colors or taste

8
00:00:32,976 --> 00:00:37,944
sounds. In addition, LSD can bring back long-lost memories and some people

9
00:00:37,944 --> 00:00:44,144
report a dying of the ego while taking this drug. Now, it's no doubt that some

10
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:47,264
people have experienced troublesome or even a frightening experiences from

11
00:00:47,264 --> 00:00:52,092
taking hallucinogenic substances. And there's some research to support the idea

12
00:00:52,092 --> 00:00:55,996
that one of these agents can act as an epigenetic agent and turn on the gene

13
00:00:55,996 --> 00:01:02,059
that codes for mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia. Therefore, some major

14
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:05,992
caution for some people using hallucinogenic substances. Now, LSD has its

15
00:01:05,992 --> 00:01:10,546
effect at the serotonin receptor and we see that psilocybin or magic mushrooms

16
00:01:10,546 --> 00:01:14,962
also affect the serotonin receptor system however, not to the same degree as

17
00:01:14,962 --> 00:01:23,084
LSD. Psilocybin can produce changes in perception and cognition as well. In

18
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:26,742
fact, some people have said that LSD demands introspection whereas as

19
00:01:26,742 --> 00:01:28,860
psilocybin invites it.
