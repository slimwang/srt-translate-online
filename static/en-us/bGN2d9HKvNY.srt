1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,580
In order to reject the access token
when the user's ready to log out I

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,530
will create a FB disconnect
function like so.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,240
If the request is successful
then I will depopulate the login

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,660
session accordingly.

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,450
But let's take a second to re factor and

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,180
make a disconnect function for
easier expansion to other providers.

7
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,580
I will create a new value in
login session called provider and

8
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:24,240
set it equal to Google and G-Connect and
Facebook inside FB-Connect.

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,530
Now when I log out, I can just
call this disconnect function,

10
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,550
figure out which session I'm logged in
under and then log out accordingly.
