1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,160
Pictorially, the Kalman
filter looks like this.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,050
Nice Gaussian.

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,040
I don't know why I'm drawing this.

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,860
It's already here.

5
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,170
A Gaussian, I'll circle it.

6
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,710
We start off with that Gaussian.

7
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,940
We then have the linear prediction part,
which does the shift.

8
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,120
We then say, but wait a minute,
there may be some noise,

9
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,470
so things get widened.

10
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,689
We take our measurement,
and we sort of blend.

11
00:00:17,689 --> 00:00:21,305
Remember, it was that the Kalman
filter is a, a blending between your

12
00:00:21,305 --> 00:00:24,450
prediction, which was what our,
our prediction here was.

13
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:29,231
And your measurement, and it creates
a new estimate that's a weighted average

14
00:00:29,231 --> 00:00:33,228
between those, depending upon
the relative uncertainties, and

15
00:00:33,228 --> 00:00:37,030
the uncertainty gets smaller
after we take the measurements.

16
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,261
So uncertainty gets bigger
when we do our prediction,

17
00:00:39,261 --> 00:00:41,200
because we don't know
exactly what happened,

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,489
and it gets smaller again
when we take the measurement.

19
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:47,948
We said nice things about it was
that it's simple, it's compact,

20
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:50,810
it's efficient and
it's very easy to spell.

21
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,364
The cons of it are in fact,

22
00:00:52,364 --> 00:00:55,480
maybe I should have listed
these in the other order.

23
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,075
Here it says, we'll say there's sort of
a restricted class of motions defined by

24
00:00:59,075 --> 00:01:00,320
the linear model.

25
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,250
Linear thing we can get around by using
what's called an extended Kalman filter.

26
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,850
A much bigger problem is, it's nice,

27
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,000
it's got this nice unimodel
distribution assumption.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,210
You're assuming the world really is
a nice Gaussian of some uncertainty.

29
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:19,650
And the question arises, what would you
do, if it, things are not a Gaussian?

30
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,290
So what's an example of when you
might need a non-Gaussian situation?

31
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,910
Well you remember these videos?

32
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:25,452
Okay, and

33
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:29,139
again this comes from the Isard and
Blake condensation tracking paper.

34
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:32,310
There's all sorts of dynamics going
on here with things jumping around.

35
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,670
Let's see if I do that again,
yeah there she goes.

36
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:39,540
And things move quickly, they they may
be able to be nice and smooth sometimes,

37
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,890
then something rapid will happen.

38
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:46,386
So like when the leaves are blowing in
the wind for a while they blow nicely.

39
00:01:46,386 --> 00:01:50,226
But basically, the problem here is
that things are moving smoothly and

40
00:01:50,226 --> 00:01:53,042
then all of a sudden you'll
get a perturbation, and

41
00:01:53,042 --> 00:01:55,410
you'd like to be able
to keep track of that.

42
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,950
So graphically we're going to
show that like this, okay.

43
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:04,420
So now we have the same model
that we had before, okay?

44
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,080
We have a,
an estimate from the last time.

45
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,910
We have a deterministic shift.

46
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,010
We apply some smoothing because
we grow the uncertainty.

47
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,814
And then we take our measurement and
we update our estimate.

48
00:02:16,814 --> 00:02:19,994
But now these are not
Gaussian lumps all right.

49
00:02:19,994 --> 00:02:22,445
These are sort of arbitrary
distributions, and

50
00:02:22,445 --> 00:02:25,971
in fact this particular figure is
taken from the paper that introduced

51
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:30,036
the particle filtering that we'll talk
about in a minute, to computer vision,

52
00:02:30,036 --> 00:02:32,990
that, that condensation paper,
I just mentioned.
