00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:05,059
Earlier, we talked about the diverse
uses for Firebase real-time database.

2
00:00:05,059 --> 00:00:08,289
I mentioned that we wouldn't want
to store photos in the database

3
00:00:08,289 --> 00:00:13,224
because it would prolong load time and
the database is meant to be fast.

4
00:00:13,224 --> 00:00:17,280
Luckily, Firebase provides a place
to pop those larger items.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,550
Its called Firebase storage.

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,230
Firebase storage is the perfect
place to store files.

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,960
Such as rich content documents,
images and video.

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,070
Firebase storage also provides
a robust connection for uploading and

9
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,520
downloading files.

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,120
This means that if you lose your network
connection in the middle of an upload or

11
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,849
download, then the transfer
can continue where it left off

12
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,710
once you've reconnected.

13
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,549
So regardless of a user's bandwidth,
uploads and

14
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:48,339
downloads are as efficient as possible.

15
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,020
Another benefit of Firebase storage
is that its storage space is

16
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,859
easily scaled to suit
the needs of your user base.

17
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:59,130
As your app grows,
your storage can grow with it.

18
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:03,940
Lastly, Firebase storage also has
security features, because we know

19
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:08,060
users and developers care a lot about
the security of their pictures, video,

20
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,799
and other rich content.

21
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:14,560
You can provide access controls that
dictate who can read data from, and

22
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,700
who can write data to your app storage.

23
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,990
You can also create folders in your
storage which provide a foundation that

24
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:26,729
makes it easy to designate which
users can work with groups of data.

25
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:31,090
We're going to examine how to set up
storage using the Firebase Console and

26
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,170
how to implement storage
within the Friendly Chat app.

27
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,250
And then, we'll see how to use
security rules to protect your data.
