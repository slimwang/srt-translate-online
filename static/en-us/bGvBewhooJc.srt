1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Okay, so we just ran some queries on our list of 25 links by hand,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and that was a little tedious, so what are some of the downsides of querying data by hand?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Now, I know we only had 25 links there,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
but one problem is it's very error-prone.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You have to write code for every query you want to answer,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and if you don't get the sort order right or something like that,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
you have trouble.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's tedious.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I could ask you a lot of questions about--

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
get these links sorted by this and that and links submitted by this user and that user,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and writing a function for each of those can be a bit tedious,

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and one of the most important reasons is it's slow.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Now, you didn't see that yet because we only had 25 links,

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and iterating over all of those links sequentially wasn't a problem.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
There's only 25 links.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But if there were a million links or a billion links,

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
you wouldn't want to do that, or you wouldn't even be able to do that.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I wouldn't have even been able to build that kind of fake database in memory

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
like I did there, so databases basically exist

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
to take big chunks of data, like our collection of links,

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
which could be in the millions, and answer queries on them

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
in a reasonable amount of time without

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
having to write a lot of custom code, which is always an option.
