1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,469
So as Lorenzo mentioned, there are two qualities to the central nervous system

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:07,904
that influence introversion and extroversion. And these two qualities are

3
00:00:07,904 --> 00:00:12,697
cortical arousal levels and sensory threshold levels. For example, by cortical

4
00:00:12,697 --> 00:00:17,635
arousal, we mean how much the brain is active at rest. And some people, while

5
00:00:17,635 --> 00:00:22,235
at rest, not being stimulated, their brain is really quite active. And coupled

6
00:00:22,235 --> 00:00:27,210
with that often, is a low sensory threshold. Meaning for these people, it

7
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,734
doesn't take much stimulation to arouse them. And we call these people who have

8
00:00:31,734 --> 00:00:36,438
this pattern introverts. And introverts are often regulating their behavior in

9
00:00:36,438 --> 00:00:41,804
order to optimize their arousal level. So they withdraw from people they don't

10
00:00:41,804 --> 00:00:46,547
know. They tend to avoid real sensory experiences like parachuting and roller

11
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:52,864
coaster rides, and jumping off cliffs into water. So on the other hand we see

12
00:00:52,864 --> 00:00:56,896
the opposite pattern in extroverts, and in extroverts we have low cortical

13
00:00:56,896 --> 00:01:03,670
arousal and high sensory threshold. Meaning that at rest the brain activity of

14
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:09,980
extroverts is relatively low in activity. And coupled with that is a high

15
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:15,828
sensory threshold, meaning it takes more stimulation to arouse extroverts. So

16
00:01:15,828 --> 00:01:21,500
they regulate their behavior and arousal levels by seeking out stimulation.

17
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:26,372
They really want to be around people, around noisy environments. Do thrill

18
00:01:26,372 --> 00:01:30,207
seeking and risky kinds of things like parachuting and roller coaster riding

19
00:01:30,207 --> 00:01:34,984
and jumping off cliffs. So you may or may not have noticed that, in fact, we

20
00:01:34,984 --> 00:01:38,020
filmed these two different scenes, talking about introversion and extroversion

21
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:43,227
in different environments. So when we were talking about in introverts, we were

22
00:01:43,227 --> 00:01:47,640
in a white background room. And now we're in a room with more colors and

23
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,054
there's more going on. This was not a coincidence because as it turns out

24
00:01:52,054 --> 00:01:55,564
introverts tend to feel more comfortable in, in rooms and environments where

25
00:01:55,564 --> 00:02:00,475
there's less going on. And extroverts tend to feel more comfortable in rooms

26
00:02:00,475 --> 00:02:03,460
and environments where there's more going on.
