1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,290
So the first thing that I asked you,

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,710
is whether udacicolaVotes is a local
variable or a global variable.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,780
And you should have determined
that it was a local variable.

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,330
Well, to figure this out, you go to
where the variable is declared, which is

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,340
here, and you know it's declared,
because the data type is right here.

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:19,800
And you see is it declared Inside of a
method, meaning between between the two

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,900
curly braces here, or
is it declared outside of the method?

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,890
Now, if it's declared
inside of a method,

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,670
that means that it's a local variable,
and

10
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,960
we can see very clearly that it is
in fact declared inside of a method.

11
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,790
So it's a local variable.

12
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,150
Well, what does that mean?

13
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,720
We should also be asking ourselves,

14
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,030
if I declared something as
a local variable, should I have?

15
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,930
Let's think about it in this case.

16
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,060
Here's our phone.

17
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,010
And we've been talking about udacicola,
so

18
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:49,550
let's only focus on when we
click the udacicola button.

19
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,230
When we click this button,
this method starts.

20
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,008
It sets udacicola votes to zero, and
then it adds one to udacicolaVotes,

21
00:00:57,008 --> 00:00:58,790
which is zero.

22
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,870
So udacicolaVotes becomes one.

23
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,430
Now, because udacicolaVotes is a local
variable, at the end of this method,

24
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,990
it actually sort of dies,
or gets deleted.

25
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,940
The fact udacicolaVotes is trashed, or
gone, at the end of this method because

26
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,640
it's a local variable,
causes a couple problems.

27
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,880
So why is this a problem?

28
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,580
Well, you would think that if
three different people voted for

29
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:25,905
udacicola by clicking on the button,
that udacicolaVvotes should be three.

30
00:01:25,905 --> 00:01:30,001
Well, what actually happens is the first
time you click on the button,udacicola

31
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:31,105
becomes zero.

32
00:01:31,105 --> 00:01:32,865
It gets one added to it, becoming one.

33
00:01:32,865 --> 00:01:34,185
And then it gets trashed.

34
00:01:34,185 --> 00:01:35,815
It doesn't exist anymore.

35
00:01:35,815 --> 00:01:38,605
The second time that somebody
clicks on udacicolaVotes,

36
00:01:38,605 --> 00:01:41,785
well udacicolaVotes is
made all over again.

37
00:01:41,785 --> 00:01:42,565
It's declared again.

38
00:01:44,155 --> 00:01:47,575
Because remember, the first time
it had essentially gotten trashed.

39
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:49,520
So it needs to be remade.

40
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,840
And when it's remain, it's set to zero.

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,690
Now we add one again to it, but
remember the value is zero.

42
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,700
So udacicolaVotes is still one, even
though the button's been clicked twice.

43
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,250
And the same thing happens when
it's clicked the third time,

44
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,550
it still is one and it's actually
trashed again at the end of this method.

45
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,740
So that's the first problem.

46
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,350
It's not really saving the state
between button clicks.

47
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:14,190
About how many people have voted for
udacicola.

48
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:18,700
But another problem is down here, this
code's actually going to throw an error.

49
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,610
And the reasoning for that is because
remember I said that udacicolaVotes

50
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,820
sort of comes into existence or
its scope begins right here.

51
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,880
And then at the end of
this voteudacicola method.

52
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,090
It is trash, it's out of existence.

53
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:36,190
Which means when I come down here,
udacicolaVotes doesn't really exist.

54
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,640
More technically, we say that
this variable is out of scope.

55
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,010
Its scope was here It got declared here,
and it ended here.

56
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,700
But we're trying to use it down here.

57
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,612
And it can't be used.

58
00:02:47,612 --> 00:02:51,490
Having udacicolaVotes be a local was
not a correct decision in this case.

59
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,130
And I can summarize why
with these two points.

60
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:58,320
It's not saving the vote about between
button click, and it's not in scope for

61
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,650
the show me votes method.

62
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,700
So this will actually cause errors.

63
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,680
So this will actually not compile.

64
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,140
Okay, so let's look at the other
variable in this program.
