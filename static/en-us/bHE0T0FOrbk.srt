00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,840
Now that we have our quadratic inequality written out very nicely, I'd like you

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,320
to figure out what the critical values of x that are going to divide up our

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,434
number line are, and then what intervals those critical values determine. Just a

4
00:00:11,434 --> 00:00:15,263
hint. You should probably start by factoring the expression on the left. Also

5
00:00:15,263 --> 00:00:18,803
when you write your intervals out at the end, I'd like you to write them as

6
00:00:18,803 --> 00:00:19,596
inequalities.
