00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,669
This expression is equal to the log of base b of 5. Great thinking if you got

2
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:10,176
this answer. Now, to start, I think it's best to think about this as two

3
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:15,996
logarithms of base b of 5. If I write this line all out. I see I have log base

4
00:00:15,996 --> 00:00:22,961
b of 2 plus log base b of 5. Plus log base b of 5, minus log base b of 10. And

5
00:00:22,961 --> 00:00:27,299
notice that there are two log base b's of 5 here. Now I'm ready to apply my

6
00:00:27,299 --> 00:00:31,260
properties of logarithms. I know when I add two logarithms together that have

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,913
the same base, I can really just multiply these numbers together. So have log

8
00:00:36,913 --> 00:00:41,850
base b of two times five. I'm going to do this one more time. I have one more

9
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,474
addition here, so I can multiply these number times these numbers. So we have

10
00:00:47,474 --> 00:00:54,027
log base b of 2 times 5 times 5, minus log base b of 10. Now when we subtract

11
00:00:54,027 --> 00:00:59,484
logarithms, we take this number and divide it by this number. So we'll have log

12
00:00:59,484 --> 00:01:05,465
base b of 2 times 5 times 5 divided by 10. Now, you might be wondering why I

13
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:09,265
didn't go ahead and multiply these numbers. And it's because I knew that I

14
00:01:09,265 --> 00:01:13,352
would have to simplify in the end. So I can see that 2 times 5 times equals 10,

15
00:01:13,352 --> 00:01:18,640
and that reduces with another ten in the denominator. These simplify to one.

16
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,623
And this is how we get our final result of log base b of 5.
