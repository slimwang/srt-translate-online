00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,368
>> In general, samples underestimate the amount of variability in a population,

2
00:00:04,368 --> 00:00:08,881
because samples tend to be values in the middle of the population. Especially in

3
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:13,314
a normal distribution, most of the values are centered here in the middle. So

4
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:18,646
when we take samples from it, most of our values are going to be around here,

5
00:00:18,646 --> 00:00:24,038
since most of the values are in this area. Therefore the variability in this

6
00:00:24,038 --> 00:00:29,565
sample will be less than the variability of the entire population. To correct

7
00:00:29,565 --> 00:00:35,223
for this, we use something called Bessel's correction, where instead of dividing

8
00:00:35,223 --> 00:00:40,389
by n, we divide by n minus 1. Same within the variance. So what will dividing by

9
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:45,413
n minus 1 do to the original standard deviation and variance? Will it make them

10
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:47,843
bigger, or will it make them smaller?
