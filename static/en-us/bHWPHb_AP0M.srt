>> I could draw the dimensions of Grant's new space like this. In orange we have

2
00:00:04,491 --> 00:00:09,177
the original layout, and these blue lines represent the addition that he wants

3
00:00:09,177 --> 00:00:13,700
to make, in order to get, to a total area of 300 square feet. What I'd like you

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:18,270
to do now, is to rewrite this equation. So that you carry out the distribution

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,726
or multiplication on the right hand side. So multiply these two polynomials

6
00:00:22,726 --> 00:00:27,142
together, and also combine like-terms on the right side, then write your new

7
00:00:27,142 --> 00:00:31,669
equation down here. Again, just simplify the right side. Leave the left side

8
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:32,095
alone.
