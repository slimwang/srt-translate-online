00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,550
For an exponential function of the form f of x equals a to the x,

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,440
we know that a must be greater than 0, and a cannot equal 1.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,880
Now, since logarithmic functions are the inverses of exponential functions,

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,290
the same must be true for the base of a log. That means that this choice,

5
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:25,350
all positive real numbers except 1, is correct. The positive real

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,500
numbers are the numbers greater than 0, and if you don't include 1,

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,040
that means that they can't equal 1. Remember that if we let a equal 1 and

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,380
see what happens we end up with a function f of x equals 1 to the x.

9
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,470
This is just equal to 1, which means it's just a horizontal line.

10
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,130
This doesn't pass the horizontal line test. So that means that

11
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,330
this exponential function doesn't have an inverse. In other words,

12
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:55,940
if we let a equal 1, then there's no logarithmic function that can come out of

13
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,085
this exponential function. The same is true if you decide to let a equal 0.

14
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:06,350
So bottom line, they're both logs and exponents, the base of it,

15
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,015
which I've written as a, must be positive and it can't equal 1.
