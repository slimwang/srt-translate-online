The function f of x equals log based 10 of x can only have inputs that are

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,940
positive. If we substitute in x equals negative 4, we'll find ourselves trying

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:18,180
to take here the log of negative 20, or here the log of negative 5. We take

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:26,020
here log base 10 of negative 20 and add to that log base 10 of negative 5. And

5
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:30,825
yes, we get an error, just as we suspected. This isn't allowed because negative

6
00:00:30,825 --> 00:00:35,850
20 and negative five aren't part of the domain of this function. That means

7
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,900
that x equals negative 4 is not a solution. Nothing goes wrong though for x

8
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,710
equals 5. We get perfectly valid values when we plug in five in the spot of X

9
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,753
here. That means that only X equals five is a solution.
