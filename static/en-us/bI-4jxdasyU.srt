00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:05,067
What we just described is termed self serving bias. And a self serving bias is

2
00:00:05,067 --> 00:00:08,772
when we have the tendency to make situational attributions for our failures,

3
00:00:08,772 --> 00:00:14,088
and dispositional attributions for our successes. And the reason we asked you

4
00:00:14,088 --> 00:00:18,120
to pay so close attention to this attribution theory is because of this self

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,053
serving bias. Now, when I first started teaching psychology and covered this

6
00:00:23,053 --> 00:00:26,113
topic, I was actually quite surprised by how often I used dispositional

7
00:00:26,113 --> 00:00:31,553
attributions to explain other people's behavior. And now that I'm aware of it,

8
00:00:31,553 --> 00:00:36,315
I try to first look at perhaps situational attributions. For example, if my

9
00:00:36,315 --> 00:00:39,707
friend doesn't call me back, I try to look at perhaps reasons such as her phone

10
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:42,887
is dead, or maybe she's on the phone with her boyfriend, or she had to work

11
00:00:42,887 --> 00:00:46,332
late, instead of using a dispositional attribution and saying perhaps she's

12
00:00:46,332 --> 00:00:52,550
lazy or selfish. Can you think of any times in your life when you've used a

13
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,720
situational attribution instead of a dispositional one, or vice versa?
