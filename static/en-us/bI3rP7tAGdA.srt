1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,910
Now we're ready to write the code for crawling the

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,200
web. So our goal is to define a procedure, we'll

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,550
call it crawl_web, that takes as input a seed page

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,680
url. So, that's the url that identifies our seed page, and

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,170
outputs a list of all the urls that can be

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,460
reached by following links starting from the seed page. So,

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,800
if you're really ambitious you should try to do this

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,400
yourself without anymore help. That's going to be a pretty tough challenge.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,780
So we're also going to step through one way to do

10
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,280
this as a series of quizzes. But you should feel free

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,310
at any point, when you feel confident that you can do

12
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,960
it yourself, to try to finish for yourself, rather than following

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,250
the step by step quizzes that I'll show you. So we

14
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,260
will start defining our procedure crawl web, and we are going

15
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,810
to introduce two variables. The tocrawl variable that keeps track

16
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,560
of the pages that we need to crawl, and the crawled

17
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,330
variable that is a list of pages that we

18
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,820
have already crawled. For the first step, your goal

19
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,140
is to figure out, how to initialize these variables.

20
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,290
Which of the first value, tocrawl and crawled be?
