00:00:04,231 --> 00:00:08,394
lines about our problem. Here the x axis is going to represent the number of

3
00:00:08,394 --> 00:00:12,805
hours, and the y axis is going to represent our money. Knowing that you have $45

00:00:12,805 --> 00:00:17,221
to spend on the car rental, which of these equations represents the amount of

5
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:19,780
money you can spend? Choose the best answer.
