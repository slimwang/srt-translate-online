1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,800
Effective Inter-domain Traffic Engineering has three goals.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,220
One is predictability. In other words, it

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,960
should be possible to predict how traffic

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,660
flows will change in response to changes in

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,990
the network configuration. Another goal is to,

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,440
limit the influence of neighbouring domains. In particular,

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,050
we'd like to use BGP policies and

8
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,850
changes to those policies that. Limit how neighbouring

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,750
ASes might change their behaviour in response to

10
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,640
changes to the PGP configuration that we make

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,790
in our own network. And finally, we'd like

12
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,260
to reduce the overhead of routing changes by

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,250
achieving our traffic engineering goals with changes to

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,810
as few IP prefixes as possible. To understand

15
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,590
the factors that confound predictability Let's look at

16
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,240
how the inter-domain routing choices of a particular

17
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,460
autonomous system, can wreak havoc, on predictability. Let's

18
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,680
suppose that a downstream neighbor, is trying to reach,

19
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,860
the autonomous system at the top of this

20
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,410
figure. The AS here might wish to relieve congestion,

21
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,850
on a particular peering link. To do so,

22
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,640
this AS, might now send traffic to that destination

23
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,800
out a different set of atonimous systems. But once

24
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,650
this AS makes that change, note that it's choosing

25
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,020
a longer AS path. Now taking a path

26
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,140
of three half's rather than two. In response,

27
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,970
the down stream neighbor might decide not to

28
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,890
send its traffic for that destination Through this

29
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,330
attonomous system at all. Thus affecting the traffic

30
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:35,170
matrix that this AS sees. So, all the

31
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:41,360
work that went in to optimizing the traffic load balance for this AS is for not,

32
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,210
because the change that it made, effectively

33
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,560
changed the offered traffic loads and hence

34
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,760
the traffic matrix. One way to avoid

35
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,710
this type of problem, and achieve predictable traffic

36
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,510
flow changes. Is to avoid making changes

37
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,820
like this that are globally visible. In particular,

38
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:06,680
note that this change caused a change in the AS path link of the advertisement

39
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,650
to this particular destination, from two to

40
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,760
three. Thus, other neighbors, such as the downstream

41
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,120
neighbor here. Might decide to use an alternate

42
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,620
path as a result of that globally visible

43
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,870
routing change. By avoiding these types of

44
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,750
globally visible changes, we can achieve predicitability. Another

45
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,360
way to achieve effective inter-domain traffic engineering is

46
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,720
to limit the influence of neighbors. For example,

47
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,300
an autonomous system might try to make a path look longer with AS path

48
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,080
prepending. If we consider treating paths that

49
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,470
have almost the same AS path length as

50
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:46,504
a common group, we can achieve additional flexibility. Additionally, if we

51
00:02:46,504 --> 00:02:51,650
enforce a constraint that our neighbors should advertise consistent BGP

52
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:56,879
route advertisements, over multiple appearing links, should multiple

53
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,830
appearing links exists? That gives us additional flexibility,

54
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:04,420
to send traffic over different e-egress points to the

55
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,650
same autonomous system. Enforcing egress points to the same

56
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,640
autonomous system. Enforcing consistent advertisments turns out to be

57
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,510
difficult in practice, but it is doable. To

58
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:14,650
reduce the overhead of routing changes. We can group

59
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,270
related prefixes. Rather than exploring all combinations of prefixes

60
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:22,150
to move a particular volume of traffic. We can

61
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,380
identify routing choices that group routes that have

62
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,950
the same AS paths and we can move

63
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,430
groups of prefixes according to these groups of

64
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,380
prefixes that share an AS path. This allows us

65
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,430
to move groups of prefixes by making tweaks

66
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,000
to local preference on. Regular expressions on AS

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,500
path. We can also focus on the small

68
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,020
fraction of prefixes that carry the majority of traffic.

69
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,350
Ten percent of origin AS is responsible

70
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:53,160
for about 82 percent of outbound traffic,

71
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,790
therefore we can achieve significant gains in

72
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,690
rebalancing traffic in the network by focusing on

73
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,640
the heavy hitters. In summary, to achieve

74
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,270
predictability, we effect changes that are not globally

75
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,050
visible. To limit the influence of neighbors,

76
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,440
we enforce consistent advertisments and limit the influence

77
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,690
of a s pass length. And to reduce

78
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,839
the overhead of routing changes, we group pre fixed

79
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,380
according to those that have common AS paths.

80
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,020
And, move traffic, in terms of groups of prefixes.
