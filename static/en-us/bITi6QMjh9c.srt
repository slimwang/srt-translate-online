00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,830
add a grass texture to the ground plane beneath the bird. Just apply a simple

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,570
color texture. Since the plane is large, please repeat the texture 10 times in

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,450
each direction. See the exercises code for more details. When you're done the

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,670
view should look like this. One hint, don't forget about setting the wrap mode.

00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,330
I didn't do this at first, and it was extremely confusing as to why the texture

seemed to disappear.
