1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:02,250
>> So Andy, how'd you do on that one?

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,382
>> I did okay, but I could have sworn the truck in the back was the biggest.

3
00:00:05,382 --> 00:00:08,900
>> I know those were really tough. So how does this depth stuff work?

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,436
>> well, I think I understand binocular cues that Susan was talking about, these

5
00:00:12,436 --> 00:00:14,762
cues that require two eyes.

6
00:00:14,762 --> 00:00:17,161
>> basically it's the same way that 3D movies work.

7
00:00:17,161 --> 00:00:18,834
>> What do you mean by that?

8
00:00:18,834 --> 00:00:22,196
>> So, basically our brain's getting two different pictures. It takes the two

9
00:00:22,196 --> 00:00:25,094
different images, one from each eye, processes them and interprets them as

10
00:00:25,094 --> 00:00:26,189
depth.
