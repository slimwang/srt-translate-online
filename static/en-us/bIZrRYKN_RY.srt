[Thrun] In modern dimensionality reduction, the trick has been to define nonlinear,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
sometimes piece-wise linear, subspaces on which data is being projected.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is not dissimilar from K nearest neighbors,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
where local regions are being defined based on local data neighborhoods.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But here we need ways to interpret leveraging neighbors

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
to make sure that the subspace itself becomes a feasible subspace.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Common methods include local linear embedding, or LLE, or the Isomap method.

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000

There's tons of information on these methods on the World Wide Web.
