1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,430
Now we follow the idea of associativety to the extreme

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,870
and let any cache block be put anywhere in the

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,030
cache. Returning to our example, if this was a direct

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,620
map cache, where every block has only one place to go.

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,790
And this was a set associative cache, where there was

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,120
a small set of places that a block can go. Then

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,220
this is a fully associative cache where all cache blocks

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,170
are treated alike and can be put anywhere in the cache.

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,310
Looking at a more general notation, then we see

10
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,040
that full associativity means we don't interpret any of

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,620
the address as index anymore. It's all tag. This

12
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,710
means that when we ask if a particular address is

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,020
stored in the cache. The hardware has to check

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,480
tags for every cache entry. Or at least, do

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,420
it sequentially really, really fast. This fact, generally limits

16
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:51,170
fully associative caches to sizes between 64 and 256 entries
