1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,404
The opposite of cay plus 1 is less than or equal to sara is cay plus 1 is

2
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:10,618
greater than sara. The opposite of cay plus 1 is greater than or equal to sara

3
00:00:10,618 --> 00:00:16,251
is cay plus 1 is less than sara. And the opposite of cay plus 1 is not equal to

4
00:00:16,251 --> 00:00:20,991
sara is cay plus one equals equals to sara. You may have thought that the

5
00:00:20,991 --> 00:00:24,123
opposite cay plus 1 is less than or equals to sara should be cay plus 1 is

6
00:00:24,123 --> 00:00:29,181
greater than or equals to sara. But the opposite value has to disagree every

7
00:00:29,181 --> 00:00:33,859
possible value of cay and sara. Let's look at a representative set of

8
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:37,552
example's. Our original expression was cay plus 1 is less than or equals to

9
00:00:37,552 --> 00:00:42,164
sara. We found that when Cay has 3 Twitter followers and Sara has 4 Twitter

10
00:00:42,164 --> 00:00:47,634
followers, that's the boundary. So, I'm using that case and two cases, one on

11
00:00:47,634 --> 00:00:52,119
each side of that boundary to compare these three conditions to see which ones

12
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:57,422
are opposites. When cay has 3 and sara has 3, it's not true that cay plus one

13
00:00:57,422 --> 00:01:03,726
is less than or equal to sara. When cay has 3, and I have 4, this condition's

14
00:01:03,726 --> 00:01:09,539
true. When cay has 3 and I have 5, the condition is still true. Now for the

15
00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:13,504
next condition, we find that they disagree on conditions that are not right on

16
00:01:13,504 --> 00:01:19,975
the boundary. But, right on the boundary, they agree. So these conditions are

17
00:01:19,975 --> 00:01:25,046
not opposites. But this last condition is true for the first case, false for

18
00:01:25,046 --> 00:01:31,347
the boundary case and false for the last case. So, it differs in every case

19
00:01:31,347 --> 00:01:36,810
from the original condition. You could write out similar tables for the other

20
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:43,210
two original equations, but I think this is enough writing tables for now.
