1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,325
Let's just talk about a couple limit limitations on this,

2
00:00:03,325 --> 00:00:07,240
which are going to get us to the Fourier series in just a minute, okay?

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,850
For this integral to exist,

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,377
this Fourier transform, we don't actually want infinites, right?

5
00:00:11,377 --> 00:00:15,250
Because that's not so good when, when are, when we, when we try to like,

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,840
write down infinity, it just goes a really long time, all right.

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,060
One thing we'd say is that this whole thing is integrable,

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:27,580
okay, if the original function itself is integrable.

9
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,350
That is if I take the, the function, I actually have to take its absolute value.

10
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,970
If I sum it up from minus infinity to infinity, it, it can't explode.

11
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,040
It has to be limited to a value.

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,340
So you might ask, but wait a minute, I thought we had infinite repeating series.

13
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,600
>> I thought we had infinite repeating series.

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,870
We did when we were talking about Fourier series.

15
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,720
We're now talking about the Fourier transform,

16
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,000
where we're trying to keep things bounded.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,200
So the idea is that these integrals have to exist.

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,980
It's base, it's based on the same principle, but it's, it's this idea.

19
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,135
So in Fourier series, we talked about repeating functions.

20
00:01:01,135 --> 00:01:03,400
In Fourier transform we're talking about integral,

21
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,890
integrable functions, all right?

22
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,570
In a minute when we have a fixed length function, it'll be clear.

23
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,370
In fact, let's get to that right now.

24
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:16,260
You see it says, so obviously if there was a bound of width T.

25
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,560
Right, so if, if all my entire function fell within T, then obviously I could

26
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,590
just integrate from sort of, T, negative T over 2, to plus T over 2, right?

27
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,150
That would be the entire integral.

28
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,120
And that's going to lead us,

29
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,530
at least in my twisted mind, to this notion of the discrete Fourier transform.
