1
00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:04,293
Now let's take another sort of toy example, of two quantities that we could very

2
00:00:04,293 --> 00:00:08,451
easily relate to one another, with an equation, where one of the quantities

3
00:00:08,451 --> 00:00:12,260
depends on the other quantity. And think about the relationship between those

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:16,337
two variables a little bit more. So let's say that we have a candy machine, for

5
00:00:16,337 --> 00:00:20,575
which there is a set price for candy. So if I put one kind of coin in the candy

6
00:00:20,575 --> 00:00:24,832
machine, it gives me a certain amount of candy. So in this case the input, is

7
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:29,092
the amount of money that you put into the candy machine. Just like for Athena,

8
00:00:29,092 --> 00:00:32,398
with her soda machine the input was the money that she put into the soda

9
00:00:32,398 --> 00:00:35,990
machine. And the output here, is the amount of candy that comes out of the

10
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,880
machine, just like the number of sodas was the output for Athena earlier. So

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,604
which of these two statements do you think makes the most sense? For a given

12
00:00:43,604 --> 00:00:47,324
amount of money put in, there's more than one possibility for the amount of

13
00:00:47,324 --> 00:00:51,055
candy that the candy will dispense. Or for a given amount of money put in, there

14
00:00:51,055 --> 00:00:54,241
is at most one possibility for the amount of candy that the machine will

15
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:58,542
dispense. Think about how this machine works, and how you think that input and

16
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:00,759
output should be related to each other.
