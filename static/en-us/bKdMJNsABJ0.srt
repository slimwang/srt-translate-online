1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,570
So now that we will update channel economics for direct sales,

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:08,320
let's go take a look at what the channel economics would look like

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,550
if we were selling through an indirect channel, resellers.

4
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:19,340
So as you could see, we still have the same cost of goods to manufacture the product as before, $33.

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,890
Now, what's kind of interesting is if we will look at the R&D, selling costs,

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,700
and general administration cost, our R&D might be the same and keeping the lights on the building

7
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:35,510
might be the same, but our selling costs are lower because we're selling through resellers.

8
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:41,710
We still needed a direct sales person but this time instead of them talking to every possible end user,

9
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,410
they are actually talking to a few number of resellers.

10
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:53,270
So let's say instead of $20, our SG&A, sales, general, and admin costs plus R&D this time

11
00:00:53,270 --> 00:01:02,290
is $15 rather than 20, and that the total of getting the product out the door is now $48.

12
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:10,350
Just like before, our list price is $100 and in the store the end user expects maybe a 10% discount

13
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:17,220
and so the revenue to the sales channel this time, not to us, is $90.

14
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:24,890
But this time, we have resellers and the resellers don't work for us.

15
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:32,160
They're the ones actually selling the product, and they take the difference between $90

16
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,020
and let's say $70, which they're going to pay us.

17
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:44,500
And do their profit is $20 for carrying, stocking, and reselling our product.

18
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:52,670
And our profit is just $22 this time because we're selling through someone else.

19
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,200
But remember, our costs were lower.

20
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:02,710
So one of the tradeoffs in using what's called an indirect channel is that your selling costs

21
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:09,930
are lower but you're giving a big chunk of your profit to other people not part of your company.
