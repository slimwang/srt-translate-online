1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,760
Several factors conspire to make
this process of classification

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,270
much more complicated.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,220
This is as you would expect in AI.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,200
If it was an easy problem
it would not be part of AI.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,950
The first factor that makes this problem
complicated is that one data point

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,690
might be explained by
multiple hypotheses.

7
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,040
So I go to the doctor with high fever,
D5 here,

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:26,020
and several hypotheses about different
diseases might explain my high fever.

9
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,060
Which of this hypotheses, then, is true?

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,860
A second factor that
complicates things is

11
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,370
that one hypotheses may
explain multiple sets of data.

12
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,230
So the hypotheses that
Ashok has influenza

13
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,420
might explain not only that he has
fever, but also that he feels tired, and

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,172
also that he is shivering, and
also that he can't sleep at night.

15
00:00:46,172 --> 00:00:50,690
Go to your doctor with two data items,
one that have high fever and

16
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,920
the other that I am tired.

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,620
Now the doctor may come
up with a hypothesis, H3,

18
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,155
that Ashok suffers from flu.

19
00:00:57,155 --> 00:00:59,330
However, when H3 is present,

20
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,930
then one can expect other
symptoms to be observed as well.

21
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,613
However, the hypothesis of H3
may generate expectations but

22
00:01:06,613 --> 00:01:08,800
additional data items.

23
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,530
How, then,
may a doctor decide if H3 is true?

24
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,700
Well, one possibility is that
a doctor may ask Ashok additional

25
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,180
questions to collect additional data.

26
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,915
Do you shiver at night, the doctor may
ask, if that is one of the expectations

27
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:23,960
generated by the hypothesis
of having flu.

28
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,380
because the mapping is not only from
the data space to the hypothesis space,

29
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,910
the mapping is also from the hypothesis
space to the data space.

30
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:35,540
Diagnosis entails not only mapping
data to hypothesis, but also to

31
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,460
know the expectations of additional data
and, collecting that additional data.

32
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,810
Of course, both of the first two factors
may be present at the same time.

33
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,990
That is, one hypothesis may
explain multiple data items.

34
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,800
And multiple hypothesis may
explain the same data item.

35
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,310
So, in general,

36
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:56,730
this is a M to M mapping, multiple
hypothesis, multiple sets of data.

37
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,810
And, of course, this immediately
makes the diagnostic task harder.

38
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:04,270
The fourth factor that makes
the diagnostic task hard is that

39
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,710
these hypothesis could
interact with each other.

40
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,880
One of the common interactions between
hypotheses is called mutual exclusion.

41
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,030
Mutual exclusion occurs if
one hypothesis present,

42
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,040
another hypothesis cannot be true.

43
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,020
In this case, H3 explains D2, D3, D4.

44
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,100
And H6 expands D of 6, D of 7, D of 8.

45
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,540
But if H3 is present, H6 cannot be true.

46
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,150
And if H6 is present, H3 cannot be true.

47
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,490
This makes the diagnostic task hard
because if a patient goes to a doctor

48
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:37,720
with symptoms D3, D4 and D6, D7, then
the question becomes whether to include

49
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,160
H3 or
to include H6 to define our conclusion.

50
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,240
A fifth factor that makes the diagnostic
test hard is called cancellation.

51
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,180
Cancellation occurs when
two hypotheses interact

52
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,200
relative to a particular data item.

53
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,190
As an example, I may have flu, which
tends to increase a temperature, but

54
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,340
I may also have a lowered
immune function,

55
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,260
which tends not to show
higher temperature.

56
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,510
As a result, I may not show high fever,
but it's not because I don't have flu.

57
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,410
It's much more because
the symptoms of flu and

58
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,960
the symptoms of lowered immune function
are cancelling out each other.

59
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,630
>> So, we also saw this
in our initial exercise.

60
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,810
We chose Thetadesis as the most
parsimonious hypothesis for these data.

61
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,870
But imagine if we didn't
have that as an option.

62
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,890
If we didn't have Thetadesis, we may
have said that it's Betatosis, Iotalgia,

63
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:27,490
and Kappacide, because the elevated
A we see in Iotalgia cancels out

64
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,650
the reduced A we see in Kappacide, which
would account for our normal A levels.

65
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,595
>> In general, cancel interactions
are very hard to account for.

66
00:03:35,595 --> 00:03:38,095
In order to address these
factors that make diagnosis so

67
00:03:38,095 --> 00:03:42,325
complex, it is useful to shift from
the perspective of diagnostics solely

68
00:03:42,325 --> 00:03:45,865
as classification to a perspective
of diagnostics as abduction.
