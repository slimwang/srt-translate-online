Let's look at the approximation quality of these algorithms,

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,710
and we're going to start with the "Take 2" algorithm.

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,540
Here is the little graph for which we are going to try and example.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,330
As a first practice quiz, how large is a minimum vertex cover for this small graph here?
