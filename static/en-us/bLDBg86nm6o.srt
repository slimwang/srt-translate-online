00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,533
Let's go through an example of a repeated measures design, where every

2
00:00:03,533 --> 00:00:08,103
participant gets both treatments. These are two cell phones with different

3
00:00:08,103 --> 00:00:12,490
keyboard configurations. Let's say a researcher is interested in the effects of

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:18,226
these cell phone configurations on errors made in typing text messages. To

5
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:24,709
study this, 25 participants used each keyboard type. This is QWERTY since it

6
00:00:24,709 --> 00:00:30,926
spells Q-W-E-R-T-Y in the upper left and an alphabetical keyboard. And they

7
00:00:30,926 --> 00:00:35,418
typed a standardized 20 word text message within 30 seconds. The number of

8
00:00:35,418 --> 00:00:41,400
errors for each person using each type of keyboard was recorded. These

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,555
participants were randomly assigned to which type they used first. In the

10
00:00:45,555 --> 00:00:49,459
Google spreadsheet below, you'll find the data for the number of errors each

11
00:00:49,459 --> 00:00:54,606
person made using each type of keyboard. Find the mean number of errors for the

12
00:00:54,606 --> 00:00:57,923
QWERTY keyboard and for the alphabetical keyboard.
