00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,844
Like I said just a couple of lines of code. We have remembered to keep track of

2
00:00:03,844 --> 00:00:07,260
our context, our primary gain node, and all of our currently loaded sound

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,948
effects. We also have an enabled flag that we can use the turn the entire sound

4
00:00:11,948 --> 00:00:16,213
engine off if we want to. Note that we use an object to keep track of our

5
00:00:16,213 --> 00:00:20,812
effects instead of a list. This is important so that we can still query our

6
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,803
effects by our URL path.
