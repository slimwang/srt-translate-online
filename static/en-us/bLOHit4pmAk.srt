1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,180
So our app contains five activities now,
but they're not all connected.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,050
When we open our app,
we see the main activity, but

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,730
there's no way to open
the Numbers activity from there.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,720
So, let's figure out the missing
pieces on how to open new activity,

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,405
when a category is clicked on.

6
00:00:14,405 --> 00:00:18,105
So first, we need to know when
a user clicks on a certain category.

7
00:00:18,105 --> 00:00:20,905
Then we need to learn how to send
an intent to open an activity

8
00:00:20,905 --> 00:00:22,105
within our app.

9
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:25,325
So if you remember from the last course,
we learned about handling button clicks

10
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:28,025
on the Submit button
in the Just Java app.

11
00:00:28,025 --> 00:00:29,835
So, we can apply what we learned there.

12
00:00:29,835 --> 00:00:31,851
Now, let's start by making
the numbers category work.

13
00:00:31,851 --> 00:00:35,570
So in the activity_main.xml file.

14
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,360
This is where the numbers category
is defined in our app an android and

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,645
a view and this is not just buttons.

16
00:00:41,645 --> 00:00:44,040
Remembe,r that buttons
are subclass of view.

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,040
Any view can be configured to
respond to touch input and

18
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,870
I found it easier to define
these as text views.

19
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,050
And then, style the views to
look like the design marks.

20
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:57,410
Now, I can add on click attribute
on this text view X.M.L. element.

21
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,130
Just like we did on the Submit
button from the last course,

22
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,010
I can set the value to
be open numbers list.

23
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,380
Which tells Android to call
the function open numbers list,

24
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,360
when this text view is touched.

25
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,670
Note, that we haven't
implemented this function yet.

26
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:14,150
So, let's head over to the main
activity java file and do exactly that.

27
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:20,270
In the main activity file, I create
this new method called openNumbersList.

28
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,700
It needs to be a public method,
have a void return value.

29
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,370
Meaning that it returns nothing and

30
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,920
I have one input parameter,
which will be view.

31
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,490
If you're wondering how
I know what to write.

32
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,660
Check the documentation for

33
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,220
the injury on click attribute
in the instructor notes below.

34
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,770
All right, so
the open numbers list method

35
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,300
will get called when the numbers
Category view is clicked on or touched.

36
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,730
This means that all the lines of code
inside this method will get executed.

37
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,910
So, this covers step one
of handling the user click.

38
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,510
Now, I'm going to let you figure out
step two, which involves figuring out

39
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,830
the code that goes inside
the open numbers list method.

40
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,280
So you can set an intent to
open the numbers activity.

41
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,940
Don't worry about the other
categories for now.

42
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:02,130
All right, so when you're done,
you actually look like this.

43
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,980
Clicking on the numbers category takes
you to the numbers activity, and

44
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,910
it's expected that the other
categories don't work yet.

45
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,610
That will come in later coding steps.

46
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,720
If you need a hint on
how to accomplish this,

47
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,050

below the image quiz.
