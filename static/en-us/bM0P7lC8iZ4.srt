00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,110
At this point, I'm going to set you free. The lessons for the rest of this unit

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:07,012
will be showing a number of demos related to more advanced effects. Most of

3
00:00:07,012 --> 00:00:10,206
them have code samples you can look at and see what makes them tick. Rather

4
00:00:10,206 --> 00:00:12,789
than me describing the five things you need to do to enable textures and hook

5
00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:16,609
them up, just look at the code and documentation. 3JS makes many of these

6
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:20,778
effects surprisingly easy to use right out of the box. Be assured that there

7
00:00:20,778 --> 00:00:23,722
will still be some exercises in the problem set to get you applying some basic

8
00:00:23,722 --> 00:00:27,708
textures to surfaces. However, the effects on the lessons ahead are such that

9
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:30,652
I'd feel a bit guilty making you connect some bits of code together just to see

10
00:00:30,652 --> 00:00:34,906
the syntax. This is where the roller coaster really starts to go wild and the

11
00:00:34,906 --> 00:00:37,300
best way for you to learn is to rip into the code yourself and see how it

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,930
works.
