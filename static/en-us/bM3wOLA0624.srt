1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,660
So, now that we have seen how two or more bit histories work, let's do a

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,045
quiz about them. Let's say we have an

3
00:00:08,045 --> 00:00:12,415
N-BIT History, with a 2-BIT counter per history in

4
00:00:12,415 --> 00:00:16,735
each predictor entry. Let's say that we need

5
00:00:16,735 --> 00:00:20,090
1,024 entries in order for each branch to,

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,930
and each other instruction, to have its own

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,230
entry, so that they don't interfere with each other.

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,630
So, for the length of the history of 1, 4, 8 and 16, what

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,716
is the cost of the entire predictor in bits? I'm going to

10
00:00:35,716 --> 00:00:40,292
tell you that the cost with a 1-BIT of History is the

11
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:45,250
1-BIT History, and two 2-bit counters per entry.

12
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:50,240
So it's going to 5 bits times 1024. Is this

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:55,640
predictor good for each of the predictors for a pattern of N N N T that

14
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,650
repeats. And we know already that the 1-bit

15
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,700
history predictor is not good for this pattern because

16
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:08,410
it's too long for it. And finally what is the number of two bit counters in an

17
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,710
entry that we actually use when trying to

18
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,220
predict the repeating NT pattern? Meaning not taken, taken,

19
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:20,410
not taken, taken and so on. We already know that

20
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:25,220
in the N equals 1 predictor we need to both of our counters, so the

21
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:30,070
answer is 2. To further help you, I'm going to tell you that the

22
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:35,118
cost of N equals 4 predictor should be. The history is 4

23
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:40,325
plus 2 bit predictors I need 2 to the 4th on that

24
00:01:40,325 --> 00:01:44,508
times 1,024. You can compute what this is,

25
00:01:44,508 --> 00:01:47,296
you should put the real number here. So

26
00:01:47,296 --> 00:01:49,948
you should multiply things out for these two,

27
00:01:49,948 --> 00:01:52,690
here, you should just say yes or no.

28
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:56,380
Yes, if the predictor will predict this successfully

29
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,930
after the initial warmup period. Now, if it

30
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,900
want, and then how many two-bit counters are

31
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,440
we using for the not taken, taken, not taken,

32
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,810
taken pattern in this particular predictor.
