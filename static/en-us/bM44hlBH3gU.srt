1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,150
Inside the login.HTML I
will first add the code to

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,330
load the Facebook JavaScript SDK,
as shown here.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,330
Be sure to substitute the value
here with the code for your APP ID.

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,140
This next function calls
the SDK asynchronously, so

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,280
that the rest of the page
can load without it.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,830
The code here uses the Facebook SDK
in order to create a Facebook

7
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:18,860
log in button.

8
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,940
I can write whatever I want
inside the Facebook button here.

9
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,400
This button also specifies the scope of
authorization my app wants to request.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,280
When my button is clicked I'm also
going to invoke this send token to

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,470
server method.

12
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,390
So now we'll create a send Token To
Server method here inside of one of

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,510
my script texts.

14
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,630
This function here retrieves
my short-lived accessToken.

15
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:42,000
Here, I'm just showing how I can use
the Facbook SDK to also make API calls.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,980
Now I sent the access token
to the server via Ajax,

17
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,330
along with the state value.

18
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:49,730
I will name the route fbconnect, which I
will now implement on the client side.
