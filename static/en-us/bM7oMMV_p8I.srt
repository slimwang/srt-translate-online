1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is the second choice.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The extended Euclidean algorithm does exactly this.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It will give us that multiplicative inverse.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We won't go through that in detail now.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Maybe it'll be a good question for a homework problem.
