00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:02,001
Good to see you back for unit 4!

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:04,541
I'm sure you asked yourself after the last unit

3
00:00:04,541 --> 00:00:06,674
just what do we do with this scan primitive?

4
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:08,243
Well, today we're going to find out.

5
00:00:08,243 --> 00:00:10,011
We're going to look at applications of scan,

6
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:11,923
and then we're going to learn how to sort on the GPU.

7
00:00:11,923 --> 00:00:14,468
So let's get started.
