1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Of course, the step size simply is the total time divided by the number of steps.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
To store the positions and the velocities, we have to make space for one more entry,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
which is the initial condition.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We start the position vector at the right location,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
meaning that its x component is equal to the radius computed above,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and the y component of the velocity is equal to the speed computed above.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The other components are equal to zero. This is the forward Euler method as we know it.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And then we compute the distance between the ultimate position and the initial position

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
using this number function and we return that as the error.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So this is the result, what do we learn if we have the step size of 100 seconds,

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:03,000
our end result will be off about 1.5*10âˇ m about 15 million meters,

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and you see that this relationship seems to be linear.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We are going to look into that in the next second.
