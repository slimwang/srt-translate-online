Here is my surprising answer.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It is 68 friends.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Who would have thought?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The way to get there is with 0.8 chance you'll pick a type A who has 80 friends

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and with 0.2 chance you'll pick a type B who has 20 friends.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
If you work this out this is 64 + 4, makes 68.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Your friend in expectation wold have 68 friends where you would only have 50 in expectation.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So, sorry, I think you are unpopular in expectation.
