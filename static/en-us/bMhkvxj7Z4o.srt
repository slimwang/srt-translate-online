00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,110
There's a cool little video on the,
on YouTube.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,730
Let me just show that now and
it explains how this works.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,830
I'm actually going to cut out
the section when it starts talking about

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,100
rabbits, but that's because you guys
already understand how stereo works.

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:16,430
>> Microsoft's Kinect has a depth censor
that can tell how far away things are.

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,920
In this stream, brighter colors are
closer and darker ones are farther away.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,360
This video will explain how it does
this which is pretty clever and

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,250
not how many people
initially thought it worked.

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,940
>> By the way, these things
are relatively easy to implement.

10
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,030
You can implement these things too.

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,850
Just hook up your Kinect.

12
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,140
You can use, just write a little
program, or even Matlab.

13
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,690
You can do it directly and display it.

14
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,430
And it's kind of cool
to experiment with.

15
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,870
The thing that I like about this
video that you can see well is, he,

16
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:49,460
he sets it up so you can look at this in
a dark room using a IR-sensitive camera,

17
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,480
which, by the way,
most digital cameras are IR sensitive.

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,410
So if you do this, you probably look
at this on the video feed coming off of

19
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:59,580
your digital camera while you've
illuminated things with the Kinect and

20
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,370
you'll see it.

21
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,960
Now if you take a night
vision camera and

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,380
look at the projection from the kinect,
you won't see a grid of numbers, but

23
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,950
rather a random speckle pattern.

24
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,470
This accomplishes the same goal, though,
because no group of specks looks like

25
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,690
any other, so the Kinect automatically
knows the angle of every group and

26
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,260
can therefore triangulate
distances just like shown before.

27
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,980
The downside of this technology is
that it can only work indoors because

28
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,150
sunlight would wash out
the speckle pattern, and

29
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,000
similarly, multiple Kinects
would confuse each other.
