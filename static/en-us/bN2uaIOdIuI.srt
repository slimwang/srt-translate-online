1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,790
We've created a script to
change our scene to the island.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:08,754
However, right now, since we have to
manually type 00-FallingCoconut into

3
00:00:08,754 --> 00:00:11,750
our script,
it will also go to the island scene.

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:17,115
But, if we make the scene name
a variable, we can give our method

5
00:00:17,115 --> 00:00:20,965
the name of any scene and
it will load that scene for us.

6
00:00:20,965 --> 00:00:23,095
So let's do that now.

7
00:00:23,095 --> 00:00:30,410
So go back to MonoDevelop and
instead of it saying 00-FallingCoconut,

8
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:34,928
let's change this to sceneName.

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,690
But where does scene name come from?

10
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,050
Well, what we can do is actually put it

11
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:47,690
as a parameter to this method,
right here.

12
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:52,400
And what this means is,
whenever we call GoToScene,

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,520
we also have to specify
some name to go to.

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,480
And then whatever name that we
specify will be the scene that we load

15
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,930
down here.

16
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,250
So this is another way
of using variables.

17
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:08,290
And you can put a variable
right here beside a method.

18
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:12,240
And any time that you use that method
you just have to specify the variable.

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,350
So let's do that now.

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,520
So let's go back to Unity,
go to our vacation box, and scroll down.

21
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,070
And you'll see that it can't find any
method called go to scene anymore,

22
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,010
because we changed it.

23
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:30,790
We have a different method now,
that expects a scene name.

24
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,520
So let's go scroll down and
find that method.

25
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:40,350
So ChangeScene &gt; GoToScene and you'll
see in parenthesis it says string.

26
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,380
So it's detected that we
will need to supply a string

27
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,410
which will be the name of our scene.

28
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,240
So, let's click on that, and

29
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,660
now we have a textbox and
this is where we type the name

30
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:57,920
of the scene that we want to visit
when we click on this vacation box.

31
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,690
Just like last time, let's go ahead and
copy and paste the name of the scene,

32
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,470
which is 00-FallingCoconut.

33
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:10,419
I'm going to go back
to the vacation box,

34
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:15,450
scroll down,
find that text box in the event trigger,

35
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,298
and paste the name of the scene
that we want to visit.

36
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:24,905
I'm going to press Ctrl+s and save,
and then try it one more time.

37
00:02:24,905 --> 00:02:27,540
[BLANK_AUDIO]

38
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,140
And there we go, it works.

39
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,830
Same as before.

40
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:36,900
So the reason why we did
this is that it's much,

41
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,090
much easier and more configurable for

42
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:44,740
us to reuse this script across
different objects in our VR world.

43
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,010
So now,

44
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:49,040
instead of just being able to visit the
island scene, you can visit any scene.

45
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,810
Now, load this build on to your phone
and try it out in a cardboard viewer.

46
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,830
You'll notice that it works
just as it did in Unity.

47
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,080
With the only difference being that,

48
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,086
now when you depress the trigger,
it counts as a click.

49
00:03:01,086 --> 00:03:01,973
Give it a try.
