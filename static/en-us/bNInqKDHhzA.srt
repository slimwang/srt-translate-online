1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,460
Here is the answer.

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:05,592
That is the plateau occurs at y0 = w*/w.

3
00:00:05,592 --> 00:00:10,510
It's the maximum possible value
this expression could take.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,450
Just take i and
let it go to infinity and

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,790
you should be able to convince
yourself that that's true.

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,990
Now what this ratio also tells you
is that if you design an algorithm

7
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:23,030
that is not work optimal with respect
to w*, then you will pay a penalty.

8
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,330
That penalty will be reduced
maximum performance.

9
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,960
So what about the critical point,
x zero.

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,330
Again, according to this formula,

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,680
you reach the critical point
as soon as I is equal to B.

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,900
Overall, this says that when
you design an algorithm,

13
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,300
a good target is to try to get
an intensity that is B or greater.

14
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,660
By the way this is a good point
to introduce some terminology,

15
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,500
if your algorithm is to the right of
x zero we say it's compute bound,

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,230
if on the other hand it's to
the left we say it's memory bound.
