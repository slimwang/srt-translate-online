00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
for starters let's try finding the lane
lines using color the lane lines are

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,410
white so how do we select the white
pixels in an image to select a color we

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,039
first need to think about what color
actually means in the case of digital

4
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:18,539
images in this case it means that our
image is actually made up of a stack of

5
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:24,028
three images one each for red green and
blue these images are sometimes called

6
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:28,439
color channels each of these color
channels contains pixels whose values

7
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:34,619
range from 0 to 255 where 0 is the
darkest possible value and 255 is the

8
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:39,988
brightest possible value if zero is dark
and 255 is bright

9
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:44,280
what color would represent pure white in
our combined red green and blue image
