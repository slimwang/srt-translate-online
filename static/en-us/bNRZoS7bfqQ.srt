00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,040
So we just heard a little bit
about how to use headings

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,980
to improve the experience for
screen reader users.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,190
>> Right, pages with good headings
are so much easier for me to use.

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:13,190
But there are other things I
use to navigate web pages.

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,900
Voiceover and
other screen readers, for example,

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,540
allow me to navigate by links,
by form controls, and landmarks
