00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,233
The root that we need is 2x minus 1. We can get this by multiplying each term

2
00:00:05,233 --> 00:00:09,320
here by 2. The denominator of our fraction over here. If we set this equal to

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,532
zero, we can double check that it gives us the same root. And, sure enough, it

4
00:00:13,532 --> 00:00:16,787
still gives us a zero of x equals 1/2. Awesome.
