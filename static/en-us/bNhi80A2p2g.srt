1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,510
One of the considerations you have for

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:03,530
wearables is that some
watches are round,

3
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,870
and this is a new screen shape that
has never been dealt with before.

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,210
So if you're designing a wearable app,
you could have a round watch, or

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,270
a square watch.

6
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,810
There are two ways to deal with this.

7
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,870
You could design separate layouts for
round, and square watches.

8
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,670
Or you could design everything for
a square, and use what we call a box

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,710
insert layout to ensure that the content
always fits within the circle.

10
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,820
The down side is that it wastes
this space, on the edges.

11
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,060
The nice part about box insert
layout is that it provides a box for

12
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,250
your app to draw in, and

13
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,180
it promises that it will never make
the square leak outside the round area.

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,280
There is a sample code
delayed confirmation,

15
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,650
that uses box insert layout.

16
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,598
Let's start the sample up.

17
00:00:41,598 --> 00:00:43,444
File.
Import Sample.

18
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:45,278
Delayed Confirmation.

19
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:45,975
Next.

20
00:00:45,975 --> 00:00:48,608
And then,,
create the sample with the defaults.

21
00:00:48,608 --> 00:00:49,970
The sample is a bit tricky to run,

22
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,190
since it was not meant to be used
without the phone app triggering it off.

23
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,170
You cannot run it,
using the green play button like usual.

24
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:59,679
If you try to run it, it'll prompt you
to select the default activity, but

25
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:00,638
it can't find one.

26
00:01:00,638 --> 00:01:02,425
This is the error
message that you'll get.

27
00:01:02,425 --> 00:01:05,569
So to fix this, we need to load
up the Android manifest file, and

28
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:07,150
make a correction.

29
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,120
We add android exported equals true for
the activity, and

30
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,955
now it will be able to be found.

31
00:01:12,955 --> 00:01:16,640
So we're going to run it,
we also specify the default activity.

32
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,610
So we select the Main Activity here,
and now we can run it on the device.

33
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,080
We select that device, and we hit OK.

34
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,450
So you can see there's an added padding
to the top for the round display, but

35
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,890
not anywhere else.

36
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,501
Let's open up the layout
main_activity.xml.

37
00:01:30,501 --> 00:01:33,729
You can see there is an app
layout box equals top here.

38
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:37,510
If you change it to all,
it will box all sides of the display.

39
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,470
If you set it to none, or

40
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,440
forget to add this,
the box insert layout will do nothing.

41
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,180
So, make sure you get this right.

42
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,358
Let's run it again, now.

43
00:01:44,358 --> 00:01:49,373
After making this change, you can see
it working, and now boxing all sides.

44
00:01:49,373 --> 00:01:52,620
An easy, but inefficient way of
designing is to always design for

45
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,564
a round shape, and

46
00:01:53,564 --> 00:01:57,190
never ever put anything in any
of the corners on the edges.

47
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,948
This is easy because you only
need to maintain a single layout.

48
00:01:59,948 --> 00:02:03,700
However, the downside is that the unused
corners on the square watch might look

49
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,381
weird, and it waste a lot of space.

50
00:02:05,381 --> 00:02:07,380
So, this is probably not a great idea.

51
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,758
Finally, the most complete way
to do layouts for round and

52
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,550
square, is to use WatchViewStub.

53
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,980
This layout will inflate
either the rectLayout, or

54
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,690
the roundLayout depending
on the screen shape.

55
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,350
You can specify two
separate layout files, and

56
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,288
do a completely independent layout for
both types.

57
00:02:23,288 --> 00:02:26,836
The sample that we compiled, and
ran at the start of this lesson used

58
00:02:26,836 --> 00:02:30,832
WatchViewStub to show either hollow
round world, or hollow square world.

59
00:02:30,832 --> 00:02:34,871
The catch with this layout is that you
need to carefully maintain both layouts,

60
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:37,720
making sure that the same IDs
are present in both files.
