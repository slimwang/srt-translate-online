00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,846
We just said that 3/8 is a rational
number, but let's talk about a more

2
00:00:04,858 --> 00:00:10,369
general definition for this new set of
numbers. A rational number is any number

3
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:15,652
that we can write in the form A over B,
where both A and B are integers and B is

4
00:00:15,664 --> 00:00:21,637
not equal to 0. This is why these numbers
are called rational numbers. Because they

5
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:26,605
can be written as a ratio. Think about
this for a second. Plug in several

6
00:00:26,617 --> 00:00:31,985
different combinations of integers for A
and B to give yourself an idea of what

7
00:00:31,997 --> 00:00:37,596
some different rational numbers are. Then
tell me which of the following world of

8
00:00:37,608 --> 00:00:41,390
numbers diagrams correctly shows the
rational numbers?
