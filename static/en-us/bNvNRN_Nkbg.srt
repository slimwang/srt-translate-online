00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,860
The service worker will control any
page URL that begins with the scope.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,635
That means if your scope
is /foo/ it will not match

3
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:14,740
/foo but it will match /foo/bar.

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,010
Remember, that trailing
slash is important.

5
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:22,240
If our scope was /foo instead
without this trailing slash

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,070
it would match /foo here.
