00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,700
As I said earlier the Gang of Four book was immensely popular and

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:08,860
has spawned a whole, a whole movement within the software development community.

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,360
However, patterns are not without problems and

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,660
I want to look a few of them here. These come from Czenecki and

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,601
Eisenhecker book which is listed on my class resources page. First off,

6
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:21,906
patterns are primarily implemented using, using two standard

7
00:00:21,906 --> 00:00:26,437
object-oriented compo, compo, composition mechanisms, inherit inheritance and

8
00:00:26,437 --> 00:00:30,960
object composition. But using patterns can add complexity. Often,

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,760
there's the introduction of extra objects and extra levels of indirection. So

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,139
your code becomes more complicated even though you're using standard techniques.
