00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,824
Now that we've got that quackery out of the way, there's one serious topic I

2
00:00:03,824 --> 00:00:07,482
need to discuss, which is multiple inheritance. And that's the answer to the

3
00:00:07,482 --> 00:00:10,750
question of whether a class can have more than one base class. The answer

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,465
depends on the programming language. In Python the answer is yes. Other

5
00:00:14,465 --> 00:00:18,170
languages don't allow this. For example, Java only allows a single base for a

6
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,138
class and works out other mechanisms to solve some of the problems that we saw

7
00:00:22,138 --> 00:00:26,343
with multiple inheritance. In Python a class can have multiple bass classes and

8
00:00:26,343 --> 00:00:30,304
this is both very useful and potentially quite dangerous. So here's an example,

9
00:00:30,304 --> 00:00:34,000
so remember what we did before. We had a Discerning Bear, which was a subclass

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,840
of Grizzly Bear and it overrode the eat method of bear to be discerning and not

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,952
eat humans named Dave. So what shall we do if we want both discerning Grizzly

12
00:00:41,952 --> 00:00:46,084
Bears and Discerning Black Bears? Well, one solution would be to add a new

13
00:00:46,084 --> 00:00:50,959
subclass that would be a Discerning Black Bear that would also override the ID

14
00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:55,180
method and that would be a subclass of Black Bear. This seems like a bad thing.

15
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,840
We've got a lot of duplication and we've mixed up our notions of whether a

16
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,618
bear's discerning and whether it can climb or knock down trees. So here's what

17
00:01:02,618 --> 00:01:06,473
we're going to do instead. We'll define a new Discerning Bear class, which is a

18
00:01:06,473 --> 00:01:11,016
subclass of bear and overrides the eat method. Then we can create a Discerning

19
00:01:11,016 --> 00:01:15,340
Grizzly Bear, which is a subclass of both a Grizzly Bear and a Discerning Bear.

20
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:19,244
That means it will inherit the knock down method from Grizzly Bear and the eat

21
00:01:19,244 --> 00:01:23,380
method from Discerning Bear. And we could also define a Discerning Black Bear

22
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,220
class which would inherit the climb method from Black Bear and the eat method

23
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,059
from Discerning Bear. Here's what the code looks like, its the same discerning

24
00:01:31,059 --> 00:01:34,764
bear class we had before except for we have changed the base class which was the

25
00:01:34,764 --> 00:01:38,921
Grizzly Bear, now its just the bear. To define the discerning Grizzly Bear class

26
00:01:38,921 --> 00:01:42,953
all we need to do is inherit from two base classes, the Discerning Bear and the

27
00:01:42,953 --> 00:01:46,923
Grizzly Bear. We don't need to define any new attributes. We've got the

28
00:01:46,923 --> 00:01:50,840
behaviors we need by combining those two. Similarly for the Discerning Black

29
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,312
Bear all we need to do is inherit from the Discerning Bear and the Black Bear

30
00:01:54,312 --> 00:01:57,811
and we have everything we need. So this is pretty neat and can be very useful,

31
00:01:57,811 --> 00:02:00,852
but also can be a little tricky. So now we're going to have a quiz.
