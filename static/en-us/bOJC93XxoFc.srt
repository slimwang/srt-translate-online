00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,890
To give a complete algorithm,
for coarsening a graph,

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:06,360
you need a scheme to decide
which vertices to combine.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,770
One idea is to compute a matching.

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,000
So what's that?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,110
Here's a formal definition, a matching
of a graph is a subset of edges,

6
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,280
such that,
no two edges have a common end point.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,830
It's, basically, an independent set,
but for edges, as opposed to vertices.

8
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,030
For instance,
take these three highlighted edges.

9
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,880
They form a matching because
they don't share any end points.

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,450
That is, suppose you wanted to add this
edge to the matching, bad OMSCS student.

11
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:38,650
You can't add this edge because it would
touch an existing edge of the matching.

12
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:39,910
So that's a matching.

13
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:42,020
What's a maximal matching?

14
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,090
A maximal matching is one to which
you can't add anymore edges.

15
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,580
In fact, this matching is maximal.

16
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,540
In fact, if you go through all
the remaining unmatched edges,

17
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,670
you'll find that you can't add any
of them to the current matching.

18
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:59,130
I want to contrast maximal to maximum.

19
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:03,590
A maximum matching is the largest
matching, for example, this

20
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:08,020
graph has at least one more matching,
with more than three edges in it.

21
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:08,600
Can you find it?

22
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,530
Here's one, though there might be more.

23
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,760
Okay, back to maximal matchings.

24
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,280
Maximal matchings are easier to compute,
so we'll focus on those.

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,380
Indeed, this is a good time to check
that you understand the concept of

26
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,230
a maximal matching.
