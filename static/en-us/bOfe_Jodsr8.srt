1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,400
For this one, we'll have one square root of 5 plus one square root of 5. We

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,615
simply add the coefficients in front of the radicals together, to get 2 square

3
00:00:07,615 --> 00:00:12,248
roots of 5 or 2 times the square root of 5. We do the second one in a similar

4
00:00:12,248 --> 00:00:16,230
way, to add 3 and 1 to get 4 times the square root of 2. Here, we're

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,300
subtracting the same quantity from the original amount. So that would make 0.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,586
If you need a little bit more convincing on this one, keep in mind there's a 1

7
00:00:24,586 --> 00:00:27,607
in front of each of the radicals, so we can rewrite this expression by

8
00:00:27,607 --> 00:00:33,845
factoring out a fourth root of x. We'll have 1 minus 1, which we know equals 0

9
00:00:33,845 --> 00:00:39,131
and 0 times anything is 0. For the fourth one we subtract 1 from 3 to get 2

10
00:00:39,131 --> 00:00:44,820
times the cube root of a times b. Here, are the indexes of 3 match and the

11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,750
radicands are same ab, this means we can actually subtract the two radicals.

12
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,821
And finally for our last one, we have 1 root of 3 plus 1 root of 3 plus 1 root

13
00:00:53,821 --> 00:01:00,720
of 3. This gives us 3 roots of 3, or 3 times our square root of 3. I know these

14
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,733
are pretty tricky, so great work if you got at east three of them correct.
