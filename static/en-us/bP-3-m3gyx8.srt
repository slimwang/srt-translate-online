1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,113
Over this weekend, you will learn
about a variety of Firebase tools and

2
00:00:04,113 --> 00:00:07,362
you will use them to create
a chat app called Friendly Chat.

3
00:00:07,362 --> 00:00:11,333
The Friendly Chat app gives us a chance
to implement many of the features of

4
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:11,981
Firebase.

5
00:00:11,981 --> 00:00:15,955
So that at the end of the course, you
have enough foundation to be comfortable

6
00:00:15,955 --> 00:00:18,539
with diving deeper into
the features on your own.

7
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:25,059
You should be comfortable already with
making a simple mobile application

8
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:27,079
using a basic command line.

9
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:31,000
You should definitely have experience
calling a web or cloud API.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,060
Using Friendly Chat, your users can sent
and receive text and photo messages.

11
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,236
Five basis of platform
with the tools and

12
00:00:38,235 --> 00:00:41,762
infrastructure you need to build
better apps for your business.

13
00:00:41,762 --> 00:00:44,859
Why would you use Firebase at all?

14
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:49,192
Traditionally, may apps need to
access data over the network, but

15
00:00:49,192 --> 00:00:52,308
this isn't always
a straightforward process.

16
00:00:52,308 --> 00:00:55,396
Let's say that we're designing
a chat app like Friendly Chat, but

17
00:00:55,396 --> 00:00:57,140
then we're without using Firebase.

18
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,163
We need to decide where we
are going to store the messages, so

19
00:01:00,162 --> 00:01:01,659
we need to choose a database.

20
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,090
And then in order to access that
database, we also need to choose and

21
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,920
setup the server that's perfectly
accessible on the internet.

22
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,450
We then need to decide where we will
store larger items like photos,

23
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,969
because database storage and file
storage are often two separate services.

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,200
So to glue all of these services
together, we'll need an app server.

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,652
And on this app server,
we then take the request from our app.

26
00:01:26,652 --> 00:01:29,643
We route in to the different services.

27
00:01:29,643 --> 00:01:33,966
So, we need to write code to communicate
via the server with a database and

28
00:01:33,966 --> 00:01:34,888
file storage.

29
00:01:34,888 --> 00:01:38,570
Then we also need to pick a platform for
handling authentication, so

30
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:42,439
that we can monitor and control who
uses the app's features and we need to

31
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:46,709
implement whatever app code is necessary
to use this authentication service.

32
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,320
There are also separate options for
other features that we may want to

33
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:56,159
include in the app like analyzing user
engagements, showing advertisements and

34
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,929
maybe doing push notifications, but we
have to do the hard work in connecting

35
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,640
all of these surfaces together and
that's a lot of work.

36
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,360
Most of that work has nothing to do
with what makes our app unique and

37
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,169
fun to use.

38
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,585
All of it is plumbing,
front work and infrastructure.

39
00:02:13,585 --> 00:02:18,097
There's so much involved with setting up
what should really a simple chat app.

40
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:20,930
I'm tired just thinking about it.

41
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,688
There's no way we could make an app
like that in just a weekend.

42
00:02:24,688 --> 00:02:28,600
But if we use the tools and
the infrastructure provided by Firebase,

43
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,646
we could really make
Friendly Chat in just a weekend.

44
00:02:31,646 --> 00:02:36,192
Because Firebase handles authentication,
authorization and data storage and

45
00:02:36,193 --> 00:02:38,410
much more, so that you don't have to.

46
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:42,209
Firebase provides easy ways
to enable many features.

47
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:45,728
We will include the following
features in our Friendly Chat app.

48
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:50,719
We use the Firebase Realtime Database
to store data in the cloud and

49
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:52,840
to keep it in sync between users.

50
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,824
Firebase storage gives you a place
to store user uploaded content,

51
00:02:57,824 --> 00:03:00,371
such as photos, audio and video.

52
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:04,603
Authentication is easier than
it's ever been in the Firebase.

53
00:03:04,603 --> 00:03:08,715
Firebase handles all for requests
to verify the user's identity, so

54
00:03:08,715 --> 00:03:13,176
that you don't have to write that code
to your app and analytics are included

55
00:03:13,176 --> 00:03:17,359
to contract of how your app is being
used, then Firebase notifications

56
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,060
enables you to reengaged parts of your
audience from easy to use web interface.

57
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:28,349
You can send notifications to all your
users, to just a specific group of users

58
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:33,509
or even to a single user, so you can
target messages to different audiences.

59
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:38,819
With Firebase Remote Config,
you can test changes to your app and

60
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,019
see how they impact users.

61
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,939
This allows you to change the feature in
your app without rolling out an update.

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,729
You could even target groups
of users since you can

63
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,449
compare the success of
different configurations.

64
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:55,339
I know this sounds like a lot of work,
but believe it or not, you apply

65
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,620
all of these features to create a
Friendly Chat app in just this weekend.

66
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,289
Let's get started.
