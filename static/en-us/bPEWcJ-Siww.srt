1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,070
So now my question for you is, of course, which would Alice do

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,940
if she want to approximate vertex cover?

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:09,930
Should she run the take 2 algorithm, should she run the greedy algorithm,

4
00:00:09,930 --> 99:59:59,999
or should she actually run both algorithms?
