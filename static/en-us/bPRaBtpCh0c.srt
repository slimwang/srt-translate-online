00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,150
While Gradle provides a great model for

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:05,570
projects, allowing you to define
tasks and dependencies between them,

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:09,590
by default an empty build script
doesn't do much, or anything really.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,240
This is on by design.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,440
Gradle doesn't want to enforce any
opinions on how your build should work.

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,370
In fact, your Gradle build doesn't
necessarily have to build anything.

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,800
Fundamentally, Gradle
is an automation tool.

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,480
So, whether it's an Android project,
Java project, C/C++ project, or

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,910
database migration build, Gradle is
there to make cumbersome tasks easy.

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,880
However, in many cases our projects
will follow some conventions.

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,250
And those conventions carry over
into how we build our project.

12
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,190
We want to provide some way to
tell Gradle, what kind of project

13
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,960
we're building, and what capabilities
we want as part of our build.

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,680
Just like a big software project
is easy to understand when it's

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,900
broken up into highly
cohesive libraries,

16
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,320
it also makes sense to factor out
build logic into reusable components.

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,990
With Gradle we do this
through the use of plugins.

18
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:01,110
A good plugin extends the Gradle
model to encompass some new domain.

19
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,370
Providing new tasks,
new DSL elements to configure, and

20
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,510
sensible default behaviors.

21
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,070
A plugin can do anything that can be
done in a Gradle build script itself.

22
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,130
They can define tasks,
configure repositories, or

23
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,400
even apply other plugins.

24
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,950
Plugins can even extend the Gradle DSL,

25
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,860
allowing users to model
a specific domain.

26
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,210
Later on in this course,

27
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,530
we'll learn how the Google Android
team has done exactly this, to allow

28
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,450
developers to describe their Android
projects in Gradle build scripts.

29
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,390
Next, let's learn where we can find
out more about the hundreds of

30
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,280
Gradle plugins that
are freely available.
