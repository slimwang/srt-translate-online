00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,529
So, here's my code for doing this. The key part is using pickle.load reading

2
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:09,056
from the file. We're going to use a with, so we don't have to remember to close

3
00:00:09,056 --> 00:00:14,020
the file. Reading that file as fin, and that's the file we'll load from, and

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:19,140
we'll put the whole thing in a try block, so if it fails, we'll re-crawl the web

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,123
the slow way.
