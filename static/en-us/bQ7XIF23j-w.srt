1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:09,200
So two coins again, C1, C2. And let's say each coin has its own probability

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,920
of coming up heads. For the first coin, we're going to call it P1, and for the

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,720
second, P2. And for reasons that should be clear later, we write it as a

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,840
conditional. So that means, if the coin you're

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,852
flipping is C1, then the probability of heads

6
00:00:24,852 --> 00:00:26,710
equals P1. If the coin we're flipping is C2,

7
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,330
then the probability of heads will be P2. Now,

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,690
this alludes to the fact that I really want

9
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,020
you to pick a coin here. You're going to pick

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,430
one coin, and the probability of you pick coin one, C1, is

11
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:44,640
P0. And logically, it follows the probability of picking coin two, the other

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,950
coin, is 1 minus P0. And I'm interested in the probability that

13
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,620
heads come up under the scenario where you first pick a coin at random and then

14
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:58,788
flip the coin. And in this exercise, I give you some very concrete numbers. P0

15
00:00:58,788 --> 00:01:05,248
is 0.3, P1 is 0.5, and P2 is 0.9.
