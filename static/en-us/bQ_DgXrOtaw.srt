00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,520
Developers, entrepreneurs,

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,190
designers and all the rest,
please come a little closer.

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:11,130
Here's one of the secrets
that we wanted to tell you.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,970
>> The key is to focus on
the long time value of the users.

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,530
This is the best way for
sustainable, profitable businesses.

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,474
If there's one thing you should take
out from this lesson, this is it.

7
00:00:21,474 --> 00:00:22,612
>> So we're done.

8
00:00:22,612 --> 00:00:24,640
>> Almost.

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,940
Let's go just a bit deeper here.

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,520
You want to avoid a quick sell,
Netflix, Basecamp, Zendesk,

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:36,150
and many more are giving the user
the opportunity to try before they buy.

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,660
Moreover, they let users
use their service on almost

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,950
any device from any shape and form.

14
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,720
This is another critical success factor,
be everywhere.

15
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,290
One look at the amount of devices that
Netflix supports will reveal to you

16
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,930
what we mean by saying be everywhere.
