I want you to try a problem very similar to the one we just did. Try solving

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,628
this equation for t. Keep in mind that you may have to factor. First, get the

3
00:00:08,628 --> 00:00:12,837
t's isolated on 1 side of the equation, and then see if you need a factor, or

4
00:00:12,837 --> 00:00:16,053
just divide by a coefficient. Good luck.
