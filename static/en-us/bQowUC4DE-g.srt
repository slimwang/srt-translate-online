00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,370
We're pretty much done with the lesson now. So, we're just going to recap some

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,620
key concepts that you learned in this lesson. Simple linear regression is when

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,320
we look at the relationship between an independent variable. Which we often

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,320
symbolize by x, and a dependent variable, which we symbolize by y. We have data

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,050
values for x and y which we can plot in a scatter plot. For each point, these x

6
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:28,930
and y values are our observed values. When we calculate the regression line, we

7
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:36,000
get our expected y values. For this x value here, the expected y value is here,

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and we denote this by y-hat. The distance between the observed value and the

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,760
expected value is called the residual. And this is an error term. We find the

10
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,980
equation for our line of best fit, by minimizing the sum of squared residuals.

11
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:59,000
And we get that our regression line has a slope equal to r, Pearson's

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,160
correlation coefficient. Times the ratio of the standard deviations of the y to

13
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:10,910
the x values, plus our y-intercept. Since we know that our line of best fit

14
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:15,760
goes through the mean of x, and the mean of y. Then we know the y intercept is

15
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:23,020
equal to the mean of y minus the slope times the mean of x. We can then replace

16
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:28,770
that here. Our full equation for the regression line might look scary, but now

17
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,010
you know how to calculate all of these. You know how to calculate Pearson's r

18
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:37,880
and the standard deviation of the y values and the standard deviation of the x

19
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,280
values. And you know how to calculate the means. You'll never have to do this

20
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,410
by hand anymore, just through Google spreadsheet. After we have the equation

21
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:52,660
for the line of best fit, we can input values of x to get the predicted value

22
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:57,660
of y. It's super useful and super awesome. Great job.
