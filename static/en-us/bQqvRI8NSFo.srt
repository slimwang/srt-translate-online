1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,059
So we observed that the latency between where I am now, which is Palo Alto,

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:08,370
California, and Cambridge, Massachusetts is 100 milliseconds,

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,740
and that's what we measured using traceroute. And

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,256
the distance between those two locations is

5
00:00:14,256 --> 00:00:18,990
4,300 kilometers. So the question is, at what

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,352
fraction of the speed of light which is

7
00:00:21,352 --> 00:00:25,770
300,000 kilometres per second, did my data travel

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,730
between Palo Alto and Cambridge.
