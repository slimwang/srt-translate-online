1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,770
So did you try out all
those different queries?

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:05,700
If you did, you've seen several
modifiers that you can put on

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,640
select statements,
these are called select clauses.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,720
Where is one of them too.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:17,020
Limit offset is what you'd use if you
wanted to make several pages of results,

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,800
it takes two numbers.

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,250
The limit number tells how many
results go on one page, and

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,890
the offset,
tells how far into the results to start.

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:31,200
So if you wanted ten rows from your
table starting with the 151st row,

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,099
you'd use limit 10 offset 150.

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,690
Another clause is order by,

12
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,370
order by lets you say how you'd
like your results to be sorted.

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,690
That'll usually be by one or
more columns.

14
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,120
If you want them sorted from
the largest to the smallest, that is,

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,070
in descending order, then you add
desc to the end, for descending.

16
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,160
So if you wanted to do a query
against the animals table sorted first

17
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,030
by species.

18
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,050
And then within each species by name,
you'd say, order by species, name.

19
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,210
A clause that works a little
bit differently is group by.

20
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,140
You'll only ever use it with
aggregations like count, or sum.

21
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,010
What group by does is to say instead
of aggregating over all the rows,

22
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,700
just aggregate the ones that
share some column value.

23
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,960
LIke if you wanted to find out how
common different names are in the zoo,

24
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,610
you might do this.

25
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,460
Here we use as,
to give the count column a name.

26
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,460
Here the name is num.

27
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,670
So here's a quiz.

28
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,340
Here are three different situations.

29
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,720
Find the ten oldest gorillas.

30
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,150
List all the animals,
in alphabetical order, ten per page.

31
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:45,240
And find out which one species
we have the most animals of.

32
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,320
For each of these situations, which ones
of these select clauses would you use?

33
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,410
Where, limit, offset,
order by, or group by.

34
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,020
Check all of the boxes that fit.
