1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,172
We start our problem by multiplying by the reciprocal of our second fraction. We

2
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:08,900
flip it over. We can factor this first numerator as 5x plus 3 times 5x minus 3,

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,703
since this is the difference of two perfect squares. Our denominator is also a

4
00:00:13,703 --> 00:00:19,312
difference of two perfect squares. So we have 2x plus 3 times 2x minus 3. For

5
00:00:19,312 --> 00:00:24,196
this fraction, we can factor this numerator by finding the factors of negative

6
00:00:24,196 --> 00:00:29,310
18 that sum to negative 7. Those factors are negative 9 and positive 2. We use

7
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,790
factoring by grouping to get 3x plus 1 times 2x minus 3 for this first

8
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:39,822
numerator. And finally, for this denominator we find factors of positive 45 that

9
00:00:39,822 --> 00:00:44,630
sum to negative 14. Those two factors are negative 9 and negative 5. These

10
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,934
factors let us rewrite our middle term, and then we can use factoring by

11
00:00:47,934 --> 00:00:53,104
grouping. We get a denominator of 5x minus 3 times 3x minus 1. Now that we have

12
00:00:53,104 --> 00:00:57,545
all of our factors, let's cancel factors that simplify to 1. These two factors

13
00:00:57,545 --> 00:01:02,160
would reduce to 1, and these two factors would also reduce to 1, leaving us with

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,474
these factors for our answer. You're doing amazing at dividing rational

15
00:01:06,474 --> 00:01:09,703
expressions and factoring if you got this one correct.
