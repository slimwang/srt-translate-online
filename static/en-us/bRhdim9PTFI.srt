Another feature that might be really interesting to look at is the number of

00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,030
emails sent by a given person.

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:08,150

00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,380
It doesn't come to us straight out of the data.

00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,460
We have to look at the data and actually build this particular feature

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,660
ourselves, but that is one we will take a look at.

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:17,770
What type of data would that be?
