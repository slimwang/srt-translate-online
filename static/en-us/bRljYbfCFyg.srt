00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:03,914
Well for the atomic only technique, we're going to have 256 threads,

2
00:00:03,914 --> 00:00:06,053
each of which has to increment one bin.

3
00:00:06,053 --> 00:00:08,998
So we know we're going to need 256 increments.

4
00:00:08,998 --> 00:00:13,320
However, if we do all of our reduction within the block, with no atomics necessary,

5
00:00:13,327 --> 00:00:16,907
and only after we've reduced to a single 8-element histogram, only

6
00:00:16,914 --> 00:00:21,270
each 1 of those 8 elements must update the global histogram with an atomic

7
00:00:21,277 --> 00:00:24,053
to be able to complete the histogram calculation.

8
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:29,259
So, this is potentially a large savings in atomics, which is in turn going to help your performance.
