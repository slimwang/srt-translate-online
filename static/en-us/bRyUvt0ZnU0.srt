1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,340
So let's think about how
we can compute homography.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,020
Let's start off,
my two images from my scene again.

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,210
Again, this is
the Lord's Cricket Ground and

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,860
what I'm going to do is I'm going
to focus in on a specific region.

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,700
Let's say this region here and
this region here.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,440
The reason I'm actually picking
these is because there's a nice

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,020
planar rectangle in that region and
we can actually use that as an example.

8
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,120
Let's zoom these regions up.

9
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:33,600
So we'll take this as one of our images
and the second one would be this one and

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,430
let's look at them a little
bit more carefully.

11
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,480
So here is my two regions,

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,900
zoom and zoomed in the little
bit of the left panel.

13
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,870
It's done to kind of find this one.

14
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,510
This is my equation.

15
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,920
We know everything about it by now.

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,250
What we're really interested in
computing is a new P-prime from

17
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,690
using the transformation
from the original piece.

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,290
Let's find four points in this one and

19
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,550
I did say there was a reason I found
this region because now I can actually

20
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,890
find four points at the corners of
this sign that was on the grass.

21
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,180
I can find the same four points here.

22
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,470
So, P-prime would be here.

23
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,160
P is here, all right?

24
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:14,220
So these are all xys and these would be,
of course, in my new coordinate system,

25
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,180
x prime, y prime, using just this
equation, homogenous coordinates.

26
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,425
So, again, all ps and all P-primes.

27
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,830
So to compute the homography, H here,

28
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,320
given pairs of corresponding
points in the two images,

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,890
we need to set up a set of equations,
where the parameters of H are unknown.

30
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,300
So, in essence, these are my two sets.

31
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,800
I can most probably get the information
about where these locations are.

32
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,720
What I actually don't know is what

33
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,530
H would be between those two images,
right?

34
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,700
So that's what we want to compute.

35
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,200
We want to actually model
the transformation that

36
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,890
goes from this to this because
if I know this transformation,

37
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,870
I can use this for a variety of things.
