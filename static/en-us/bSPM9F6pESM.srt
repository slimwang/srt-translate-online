1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,598
We've really added 32 to this equation. Good work if you found the number 32.

2
00:00:05,598 --> 00:00:09,918
We take 16 and we multiple it by the coefficient of the factor in the front

3
00:00:09,918 --> 00:00:18,110
which is 2 so we know we have 2x squared here. Negative 18 x here and positive

4
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:22,512
32 here. We need to be careful when we complete the square when there is a

5
00:00:22,512 --> 00:00:27,137
factor that is not 1 in front of our expression. We didn't just add 16 to

6
00:00:27,137 --> 00:00:34,280
complete the square, we really added two times that amount or 32. If you think

7
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,420
about distributing the positive 2 it should make a lot of sense.
