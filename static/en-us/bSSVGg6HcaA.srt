1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,800
Here I am in the iOS simulator.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,580
Prepackaged with the simulator
are several different apps,

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,650
including Apple Maps.

4
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:10,760
To get Maps to actually focus in
on a location, we need to go to

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,980
the debug settings, and set our location
to one of the predefined locations.

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,780
Or you could even put in
your own custom location.

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,930
I'll just select Apple for now.

8
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,070
Then if you click the arrow in
the bottom left-hand corner,

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,440
it'll ask us whether we want to allow
Maps to use our location or not.

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,030
We'll click Allow.

11
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,870
And now we're focused in
on the location of Apple.

12
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,159
I'm going to start dragging
around on the map.

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,380
I want you to pay attention to
what's happening as I approach

14
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,940
into new areas that
haven't been loaded yet.

15
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,020
As we expect the map just continues to
load in these new grid squares, for

16
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,030
new locations on the map.

17
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,360
Now here's the fun part.

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,600
I'm going to use a networking tool,

19
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,080
which I'll introduce in just a moment,
to change our packet loss to 100%.

20
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,080
Essentially we have no
network connection.

21
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,060
My question to you is, what will happen
when I start dragging this map around,

22
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,700
when we have 100% packet loss?

23
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,260
Will Maps crash?

24
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,349
Will Maps display an error message that
we've lost the network connection?

25
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:08,660
Will Maps even allow us to drag at all?

26
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,160
Or will Maps load empty grid squares?

27
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,500
Put a check next to your answer.
