1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This last step is growing customers for the web/mobile channels.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Now if you remember we started here on the left. We didn't earn and paid media.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We got customers, acquired them, and activated them.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We've kept them trying to keep the churn to a minimum.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And now we're going to grow customers with the series of activities just like in the physical channel.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Can we up-sell, can we next-sell, can we cross-sell,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and can get referrals that will get us a viral loop.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
One of the most important metrics to think about now that we have an end-to-end funnel

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
is something called lifetime value and a lifetime value LTV is not your lifetime

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
but your customer's lifetime.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
How much will they spend with you and your company from the beginning to the very end.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And this is kind of an interesting idea because most startups and most founders

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
are focused on how do I get them to activate here?

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
But for you to be a successful company and actually thinking about

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
how much you could spend on them over here, you need to understand--

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
can I get them to spend more and more over time and how to keep them

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
longer and longer by reducing churn.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So one of the interesting equations for every startup is that

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
lifetime value needs to be greater than customer acquisition cost.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Seems intuitively obvious but what you want to make sure

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
is the amount of money you're collecting over here is bigger than the customer acquisition cost

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
to remember the amount of money you're spending from here to here.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That was the customer acquisition cost, CAC, here.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So lifetime value needs to be greater than customer acquisition cost.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And as you get more familiar with your company and start talking to investors,

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
the real interesting thing is what is this ratio?

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
For example, in SAS software, some investors think that number should be 3>1.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
In Telecom, it might be something else but the key idea is you are now not just focused

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
on the initial purchase but you're focused on the lifetime value.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
If you have world's most perfect business model, investors would love to see

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
this number much bigger than this number and so what you want to look for

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
is a well-balanced model that takes into account how much you need to acquire customers

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
but how much ultimately you'll extract from them over the lifetime.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What's the lifetime?

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That really is up to you and your investors on how many years you calculate lifetime value.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Some use 3 years, some use 5--that's a question that you and your investors will discuss.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
This acquisition cost versus lifetime value discussion really is a balancing act.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So what are some of the balancing acts?

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Well, in the customer acquisition cost, if all of a sudden, you could get a viral loop going,

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
well, that decreases your cost of acquisition.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
If in fact, your conversion rate between acquisition activation could be increased.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Again, it decreases your customer acquisition cost.

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
If you could do in physical channels, telesales or inside sales versus having a direct sales force,

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Again, your CAC declines. The idea is what can you do to make this very efficient?

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And therefore, also, on lifetime value, how do you reduce churn and attrition in keeping customers?

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Do you have scalable pricing? Are you cross-selling and up-selling a lot?

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Can you expand your product line?

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And again, are you getting a viral loop and referral loop from happy and satisfied customers

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
telling others word of mouth and so this is a balancing game,

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
and for first time entrepreneurs who are focused here,

51
00:03:41,000 --> 99:59:59,999
it's really important to think about customer acquisition cost and a lifetime value.
