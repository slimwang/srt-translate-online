1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,500
So what I'm about to show you are my
methods for doing these things

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,160
they may not correspond exactly
to what Rich Sutton did.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,970
So keep that in mind but
I've used these methods in practice and

4
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,560
found them to work really well.

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,254
Let's start with Learning T.

6
00:00:17,254 --> 00:00:23,720
Remember T of SA S prime
represents the probability

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:29,800
that if we are in state S, take action
A we will end up in state S prime.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,840
To learn a model of T.

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,480
we're just going to observe
how these transitions occur.

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,960
So in other words we'll have experience
with the real world we'll get back

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,900
on s, a, s prime and we'll just
count how many times did it happen.

12
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,310
So I'm going to introduce a new table.

13
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,630
I call T count or TC.

14
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,860
And it goes like this.

15
00:00:53,860 --> 00:01:01,000
So we initialize all of our T count
values to be a very, very small number.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,080
The reason for that is later on you'll
see that if we don't do that we could

17
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,380
get in a situation where
we have a divided by zero.

18
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,880
Then we begin executing Q learning.

19
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,990
And each time we interact with the real
world we observe, s, a, and s prime.

20
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:24,600
And then we just increment that
location in our T-count matrix.

21
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,360
So every time we see it transition
from S to S prime with action a,

22
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,130
boom, we add a one.

23
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,470
And that's pretty, it's pretty simple.

24
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:33,970
That's it.
