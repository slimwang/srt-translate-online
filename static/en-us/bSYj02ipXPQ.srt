00:00:06,093 --> 00:00:09,720
Congratulations, you've made it
through the lessons on pitch perfect.

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,010
You added to your knowledge of UIkit and

3
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,910
view controllers by getting
comfortable with stack views.

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,089
You even got to see how iOS can play
back audio, including changes to pitch.

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,490
This is just the beginning
of your journey,

6
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:26,550
in the next set of lessons you learn
more about swift, UIkit, networking,

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,410
concurrency and even persistence.

8
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:30,396
Before jumping ahead,

9
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:32,959
it's good to reflect on what
you've learned in these lessons.
