1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,140
So, we've talked in detail about what
the PseudoCode for this looks like.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,120
So, now what I want you to do is
translate the PseudoCode to code code

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,120
and add that to your app.

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,440
So, to be a little bit more explicit,

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,460
these are the instructions that
we've written out in PseudoCode.

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,550
And, you've actually already transformed
this PseudoCode into code code.

7
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,190
This is roughly equivalent to
Setting the onClick method for

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:31,650
the 3 Points button to relate
to the addThreeForTeamA method.

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,620
And then, coding in the Java code
the addThreeForTeamA method.

10
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,940
You've already done this.

11
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,610
Now, what you need to do is translate
these other two lines of PseudoCode into

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,490
code code.

13
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,300
And then, add them to your app.

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,150
You could go ahead and
type them here first,

15
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,080
if you'd like,
to see if they're correct.

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,100
Or, you could add them in your app
first,and then paste them back here,

17
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,400
to certify that you've
done them correctly.

18
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,090
Whichever you prefer.
