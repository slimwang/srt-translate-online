1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,295
The term that belongs in this slot is b over 2 a. We get that by dividing this

2
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:08,858
middle coefficient by 2. Since we know that this plus itself has to equal b over

3
00:00:08,858 --> 00:00:13,209
a. Now what term belongs here? Well, this needs to compensate for the amount

4
00:00:13,209 --> 00:00:17,676
that we're adding to the entire expression on the left-hand side. When we

5
00:00:17,676 --> 00:00:22,653
inserted b over 2a right here, this is just adding a constant that is b over 2a

6
00:00:22,653 --> 00:00:28,072
squared times that coefficient of a that's outside. This simplifies to b squared

7
00:00:28,072 --> 00:00:30,919
over 4a. So that's what belongs right here.
