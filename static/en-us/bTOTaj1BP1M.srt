00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,969
There are major shortcomings with
the electronic code-book method.

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:10,660
First, we observe that for the same key,
if two plain-text blocks are the same,

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,040
then their corresponding server
text blocks are also the same.

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,240
This is true if the two plain-text
blocks are in the same message, or

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,780
across two different messages.

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,380
As long as they use the same key.

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:29,040
This is a major weakness that can
be exploited by cryptoanalysis.

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:34,480
For example, if it is known that the
message always starts out with certain

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,665
predefined fields, then cryptoanalysis
can have a number of known plain-text,

10
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:42,030
server-text pairs to work with.

11
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,860
As another example,
if the message has repetitive elements,

12
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,880
then these elements can be identified
by cryptoanalysis as well.

13
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,084
In other words, whenever we see
two identical cipher-text bocks,

14
00:00:56,084 --> 00:01:01,210
we know that the corresponding
plain-text blocks are exactly the same.

15
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:05,282
And if we have obtained the plain-text
block off a cipher-text block,

16
00:01:05,282 --> 00:01:08,152
then if you see the same
cipher-text block again,

17
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:11,900
we know the corresponding
plain-text block already.

18
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,680
In other words, ECB does not provide a
very strong confidentiality protection.
