1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
Now that we know that each time this loop here runs, it puts at least 1 vertex from the minimum

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,800
vertex cover into its solution, what can we say about the running time of this algorithm here?

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:17,480
As in the previous unit, we can express the running time actually in 2 ways.

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,970
We can either use n, the size of the input, or we can use k,

5
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:27,210
which is the size of a minimum vertex cover for the input graph.

6
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,600
So when you run "Take 2" on a given input of size n,

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,600
and where the size of a minimum vertex cover is k,

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,550
how often is that loop here executed?

9
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,410
Does the loop run up to n times? So up to the number of vertices times.

10
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:50,270
Does the loop run at most k times? Or does the loop run at least k times?

11
00:00:50,270 --> 99:59:59,999
Please select the correct answer here.
