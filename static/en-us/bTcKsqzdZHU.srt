Suppose I give you this course graph.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,280
It happens to have a perfectly balanced
partitioning, with an edge cut of four.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,910
There are other balanced
partitionings of this graph, but

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,090
none with a lower edge cut.

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,600
Here's my question.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:19,270
Will this edge cut necessarily minimize
the edge cut of the next finest graph?

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,020
The claim says yes.

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,180
I want you to choose.

9
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,020
Is that statement true or false?
