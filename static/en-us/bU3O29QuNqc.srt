1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,220
In this app,
you can see a map of New York City.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,710
And I have control
over this map by touch.

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,120
I can pan around the map and as you can
see, I can pinch to zoom in and out.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,110
When I press the buttons at the top
of the map, map, satellite, and

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,410
hybrid, I can change the map type.

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:16,740
So if I touch satellite,

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,020
I now can see details of the buildings
taken from satellite pictures.

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,940
Here you can see Madison Square Garden.

9
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,690
And even when I zoom in I can begin
to see some of the seating plans in

10
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:26,610
Madison Square Garden.

11
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,160
And of course,
hybrid gives me a hybrid of the two.

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,150
I can see satellite but

13
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:36,580
I can also see data such as landmarks
like the Empire State Building and

14
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,880
street names such as 5th Avenue,
as you can see here.

15
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,120
I've done all of this using a Google
map object in my Java code.

16
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,080
This is slightly different from the
fragment that you used in the earlier

17
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:47,910
sample.

18
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,220
We're going to dive in to take
a look at how to do this next.
