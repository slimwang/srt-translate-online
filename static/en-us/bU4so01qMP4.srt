00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Here is my solution.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
First, we need to decrypt using RSA and the private key.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Before we can do that, we have to convert the cipher to an integer

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and then we apply RSA and the results needs to be converted back

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
to bits and padded if necessary.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Next, we break the message into two parts, G and H.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We hash the first part and XOR it with the second part to calculate the nonce.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We then hash the nonce and XOR it with the first part

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
to get back to the original bits

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and, finally, convert the bits back to a string.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Iâ€™ll leave it up to you to print out the plaintext.
