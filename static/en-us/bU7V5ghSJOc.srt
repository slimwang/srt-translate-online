1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,580
Now let's take a look at one of the hardest

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,490
things to deal with, with working with the app cache. The

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,370
fact that you have to remember to update the application

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,060
cache. Let's say, we change something in our file, let's add

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:16,050
a title. Now, let's save this and go back and

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,990
try to reload again. Now, you'll notice that even though I

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,460
saved the index.html file Nothing happened to the cashe. It's

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,290
because the only thing that was checked was the cashe file,

9
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:30,370
the manifest, and we didn't touch the manifest at all. So let's go back and do

10
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:35,720
that now. So in the manifest, we need to do some actual change to the file. We

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,410
can't just touch it with the command line

12
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,690
utility touch. That actually won't trigger a reload.

13
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:44,260
So let's just add a version number hit

14
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,190
save and now let's go back and reload again.

15
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,040
This time you'll see again we've downloaded the

16
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,430
cache. But remember what we are seeing here, what

17
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,900
the user is seeing here is not actually the

18
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,760
new content. It loaded it from the cache. And

19
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,260
then updated the cache, not in real time, that

20
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,580
way the user gets the content immediately, while they

21
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,330
still get updated content. Now we can listen for

22
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,400
the event on cache updated, and the cache update

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,940
event will tell us that the user really needs to

24
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,030
pick a good time to reload. We could surface that by

25
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,260
popping a dialog box that says, Hey, this application is

26
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,610
updated. Do you want to reload now? But, that can also be

27
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,290
postponed, and you can just presume that the user will

28
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,320
get a new version, when they hit refresh again. If I

29
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,140
hit refresh one more time, now it's pulling it from

30
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,740
the cache again, and I have the updated content over here.
