Hope you had a lot of fun working
with the PirateFleet app.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,020
In a short amount of time, we saw just
how much you can affect an application

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,230
by writing a few lines of code.

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,390
And it was real good practice.

5
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,900
In the real world,
you'll make many different projects and

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,470
many times, you won't be the original
author, but that's okay.

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,880
Sometimes it's best to start
with something that works,

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,840
then make small changes as you learn.
