00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,300
As we've already seen for the algorithm that Alice was using, the running time of an algorithm

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:13,430
can often very dramatically vary with the size of the input that the algorithm has given,

3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:19,290
but the running time can also change with the content or the structure of the input.

4
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,320
And here's the simple example to show you this.

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:31,490
So the algorithm takes as input a string s(0) to s(n-1), which means it's a string of length n,

6
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,450
so n characters in the string and here's the algorithm.

7
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,700
So the algorithm does something very simple given that string.

8
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,180
It counts the number of times that the character a appears in that string.

9
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:50,280
So it sets the counter to zero and then goes through all the characters in the string one by one.

10
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,380
And if that character is equal to a then it will increase the counter.

11
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:02,220
So as in the previous examples, we're going to take this line here as a simple operation

12
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,400
meaning to take one time step each time it's executed.

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,360
And we're also going to consider this one here as simple operation

14
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,310
meaning also this whole line here is going to take one time step each time it's executed.

15
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:20,520
Now, what I would like you to do as our next quiz is tell me the number of time steps

16
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,200
this algorithm takes for a given string s.

17
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,340
And to give you that answer, there are two things you need to know or two variables

18
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,190
you have to take into account.

19
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:35,270
One is n, the length of the string, and the other one as you're going to find out is a,

20
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:40,160
and with a, we're just going to denote the number of times that

21
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,300
the character a actually appears in that string.

22
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:48,490
So your answer is going to be some formula that includes n and includes a,

23
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:53,310
and I would like you to give me the running time by entering the coefficients in the following formula

24
00:01:53,310 --> 00:02:04,370
so it's going to be some number multiply by n plus some number multiply by a plus a constant.

25
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:08,250
Please enter those two numbers. So not the result of the formula.

26
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,310
It's the running time of this algorithm when it encounters a string of length n

27
00:02:13,310 --> 99:59:59,999
where the letter a occurs exactly a times.
