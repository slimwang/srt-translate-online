00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Narrator] The answer is 1011001,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and the way to get that is to look at the 2 possible messages.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We had for Y 1011001.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:22,000
For N, we had 1001110, and what we want to do is XOR them to figure out the difference between those 2.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The XOR of Y and N is equal to 0010111,

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and so this is the value that will flip a Y answer into an N answer.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Now we want to XOR that with the actual message that was sent.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We don't know the key, but we know that

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
that message is the result of XORing Alice's message with the key,

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and so by XORing those, we get this value 1011001,

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and if that's what Mallory sends, when Bob XORs that with the key,

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
what Bob will get is the XOR of Alice's message.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Alice's message XOR'd with this value,

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
which will flip Alice's message to be the opposite.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The point of this question is to illustrate the malleability of the one-time pad.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Someone who intercepts the transmission can alter it and change the meaning in predictable ways.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This is a very dangerous property for a cipher to have.
