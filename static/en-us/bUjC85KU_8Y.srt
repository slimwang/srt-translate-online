1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now, let's do something tricky. Let's use 8, 5, 8 for y, which gives us a mean of 7 for y.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And the following table down here 1, -2, 1. Let me test your intuition.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Is r larger than 0? r = 0? Or r smaller than 0?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Which means positive correlation, no correlation, negative correlation. Pick one.
