00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,970
At this point in the class, you've gotten a good idea of how jQuery works works.

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,630
You've used the three main types of selectors, and

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,890
you've started navigating around the DOM with traversal methods.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,240
That's awesome.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,290
But now it's time to start making changes to the DOM,

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,750
which is the whole purpose of jQuery.

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,800
To that end, you'll be using the jQuery API documentation in the next lesson.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,190
And rather than going through each method one by one, I will be walking you

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,250
through a series of challenges where you'll be tasked to take apart

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,310
the jQuery documentation to figure out how to make changes to a sample page.

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,220
To get started, I want to walk you through the general format of

12
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,040
the jQuery API documentation.
