1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,098
It turns out that the bus travels at 50 miles per hour, and the van travels at

2
00:00:04,098 --> 00:00:09,580
60 miles per hour. Great algebra solving if you got those two correct. We can

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,856
start solving this equation by multiplying both sides by the lowest common

4
00:00:12,856 --> 00:00:19,460
denominator. That would be x times x minus 10. We're really just cross

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:26,680
multiplying, so we get 200x equal 240 times x minus 10. Next, we distribute the

6
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:32,786
240 to get this equation and then we subtract 240x from both sides. This leads

7
00:00:32,786 --> 00:00:37,690
us to this equation which we can then use to solve for x. We just divide both

8
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:43,406
sides by negative 40. So we'll have 1x is equal to 60. Now that we've solved

9
00:00:43,406 --> 00:00:47,702
for x, we want to remember what it actually represents. In this case we know x

10
00:00:47,702 --> 00:00:52,860
was the speed or the rate of the van. So, we know the van speed is really 60

11
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:58,088
mph, and the bus's speed would have to be 10 less than that. So the bus

12
00:00:58,088 --> 00:00:59,560
traveled at 50 mph.
