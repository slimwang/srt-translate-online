1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,460
So we mentioned that a mobile user persona is

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,180
different than a web or desktop user persona. So I

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,960
think that a lot you might have started out

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,960
in web or desktop, so maybe we should start there.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,280
>> Yeah, what are the attributes of this web or desktop persona?

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,370
>> Well the first thing is that there always going to be plugged into power.

7
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:17,050
>> Yeah.

8
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,620
>> They generally have a constant internet

9
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,170
connection that's usually fast. And generally they

10
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,390
have a pretty big screen. And they have some sort of physical keyboard and a

11
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,930
mouse or touch pen. And they're seated with their

12
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,930
full attention usually on their laptop or their desktop.

13
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,123
>> Yeah, and this is so different then

14
00:00:33,123 --> 00:00:35,636
a mobile user because unlike mobile for web and

15
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:38,610
desktop applications. Let's say, you're writing a document or

16
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,520
you're working on a presentation, chances are. You're fully

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,490
immersed in the content that you're creating on

18
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,290
your machine. And another difference, actually, between web, and

19
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,360
desktop apps, and mobile apps. Is that when you

20
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,800
close a desktop app, they tend to go away.

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,000
Like you close a tab on your browser, but mobile

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,030
apps tend to run in the background quite a bit.

23
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,770
They're sensing your location, they've all kinds of sensors that

24
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,260
are providing input. And applications are doing something within the background
