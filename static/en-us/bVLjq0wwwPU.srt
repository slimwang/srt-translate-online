00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,960
Here is a short excerpt from
the National Institute of Standards &

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,910
Technology's document that
defines cloud computing.

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:13,290
This is a document that was read or
published, rather, on October 25, 2011.

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,155
Cloud computing is a model for
enabling ubiquitous, convenient,

5
00:00:17,155 --> 00:00:21,400
on-demand network access to a shared
pool of configurable computing

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,160
resources, including network servers,
services.

7
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,780
It can be rapidly provisioned and

8
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:34,750
released with minimal management effort
or service provider interactions.

9
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,180
I want you to place
the following underline phrases,

10
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:42,590
which there are five of them,
into these text boxes,

11
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:47,290
where each text box corresponds to
one cloud computing requirement.

12
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,650
If you need to list multiple
phrases in a single text box,

13
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:55,250
please comma separate them, and if you
need to leave a text box empty, or

14
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,840
blank rather,
then don't write anything in it.
