1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So here's a way we could define the lookup procedure.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It takes 2 inputs, the index and a keyword.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And as a reminder, I have drawn the structure of the index here.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's a list, each element in the list in an entry.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Each entry is a list itself.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Where the first part of the list is a keyword.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The second part is a list of URLs.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So what we want to do to the fine lookup is very similar to

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
what we did for add to index.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We want to go through the entries in the index

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
to try to find one that matches the keyword.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So letÃ¢ÂÂs write that again.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
That's going to be a for loop, and it's going to be

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
exactly the same code as we had before.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So we are going to look through the elements in the index each time

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
we go through their loop.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The variable entry will refer to 1 of those elements.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We're going to check if the value in position zero,

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
which is the keyword of that entry,

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
matches the keyword we're looking for.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
When we we're defining add to index,

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
what we did when we found a match was to pin the

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
URL to the list of URLs associated with that keyword.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What we want to do for lookup is different.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
All we need to do for lookup now is return the list of URLs.

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And we can find that by looking in position 1 of entry.

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
If we get to the end of the list without finding that keyword.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Well then we still need to return something

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and the way we describe lookup, what it should return is the empty list.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That means there are no URLs that we've found so far

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
that contain that keyword.
