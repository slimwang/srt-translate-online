00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,648
Children with ASD do not follow the patterns that are typical when developing

2
00:00:03,648 --> 00:00:08,090
their social and communication skills. If you recall from our lesson on

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,930
development, here we see that these children do not reach the same milestone

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,590
markers in the areas of social skills and communication as you typically

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:23,176
develop in children. Some of the symptoms or signs of AS include, making little

6
00:00:23,176 --> 00:00:27,397
eye contact, failing to respond to other people, tending to look and listen

7
00:00:27,397 --> 00:00:31,752
less to people and to their environment, and responding unusually when other

8
00:00:31,752 --> 00:00:39,293
people show signs of anger, distress or affection. Children with ASD seem not

9
00:00:39,293 --> 00:00:43,847
to respond appropriately, as defined by prevailing social norms to emotional

10
00:00:43,847 --> 00:00:49,818
queues and human social interactions. In addition, some children with ASD also

11
00:00:49,818 --> 00:00:56,350
engage repeatitive actions that are termed stereotypy or stereotyped behaviors.

12
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,185
Stereotyped behavior can be defined as persistent mechanical repetition of

13
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:06,106
speech or movement, or ritualistic movements like hand flapping or rocking. The

14
00:01:06,106 --> 00:01:10,540
number of individuals diagnosed with ASD has increased throughout the years.

15
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:15,656
And currently rates are approximately 60 per 1,000 births. Why do you think

16
00:01:15,656 --> 00:01:19,990
there has been an increase in the number of children being diagnosed with ASD.
