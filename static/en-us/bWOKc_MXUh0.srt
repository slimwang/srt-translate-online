00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,672
Previously, the condition was to keep running this loop, and keep counting

2
00:00:03,672 --> 00:00:08,750
until we hit $1 million. But now, we want to keep counting the years until we

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,824
hit $1 billion. So we change the loop condition to go up to 1 billion. Now if I

4
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:19,464
run this, I find out that it'll take about 1600 years for my $100 to grow to

5
00:00:19,464 --> 00:00:23,089
grow to a billion.
