00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,628
Here's our trusty book class again. And we're adding a method,

2
00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:07,473
getSecondSentence. Last time we could just use the zero as the beginning, but

3
00:00:07,473 --> 00:00:12,548
this time we're going to need to start where the first one left off. So we

4
00:00:12,548 --> 00:00:16,794
calculate the beginning the same way we calculated the end. But then start

5
00:00:16,794 --> 00:00:21,310
right after the period instead of at it. To get the end of the sentence, we'll

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,870
need to use a different version of the indexOf method. We're still looking for

7
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:30,142
a period. But now we want to start at the beginning of our sentence, that we're

8
00:00:30,142 --> 00:00:33,940
working on. And now we use the sub string method the same way as we did before.

9
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,826
And return book text dot sub string from begining of sentence to end of

10
00:00:37,826 --> 00:00:42,512
sentence plus one. I added a couple lines to the book tester, so we can

11
00:00:42,512 --> 00:00:46,232
actually test our second sentence method, and now I'll run the book tester

12
00:00:46,232 --> 00:00:52,900
again. Here's the result. I don't remember the second sentence by heart, let's

13
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:58,562
look at the Alice text again. It looks like the second sentences match, good

14
00:00:58,562 --> 00:01:00,000
work.
