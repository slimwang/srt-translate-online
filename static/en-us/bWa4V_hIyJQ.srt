1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:01,190
Alrighty!

2
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:04,500
It is time to get started on
The Responsive Blog Project.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,190
You can find a link to a zip
file with the project in it

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,790
in the downloadable section.

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,630
Note that the zip file is pretty large
because of all the images inside it.

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,220
So this is what the blog
looks like right now.

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:21,850
And you should be asking yourself,
ugh, what the heck is this ugly thing?

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,860
The good news is that, by the end of
the course, you'll be turning it into

9
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,740
something that looks a little bit like
this, which is definitely a lot nicer.

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,270
Now, responsive images can be as
much of an art as it is a science.

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,240
The way you make your images responsive
will totally depend on how you want to

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,120
use them in your sites.

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,110
When all is said and done, your blog
may look very different than this, but

14
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,180
that doesn't make it any less correct.

15
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,520
It's up to you to decide how you
want to beautify this blog and

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,170
make its images responsive.

17
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:57,060
To start working on this project, which
is really zoomed out here by the way,

18
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,890
I'm going to give you a few changes.

19
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,860
Some will be mandatory and
some will be optional.

20
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,629
Your goal is to make
these images look same.

21
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:07,980
Right now, they're massive, both in
their visual size on the page, and

22
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,780
this is zoomed out to 25% here so
they're really, really big.

23
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,900
And they're also big in a number
of bytes that they include,

24
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,498
in that they're simply way too large.

25
00:01:17,498 --> 00:01:18,440
Back at 100%,

26
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,790
it's pretty clear these images aren't
fitting inside their containers.

27
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,020
The images in the website need some
kind of width applied to them so

28
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,380
that they stay inside their container,
which in this case is an article.

29
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,070
Once you've done that, set a maximum
width on the article element to

30
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,690
give the blog a little
bit better structure.

31
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,134
I recommend starting with a width
of something around 50em's.

32
00:01:39,134 --> 00:01:42,430
Remember an em refers to the font size.

33
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,580
So a 50em element with
font sizes of 16 pixels

34
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,550
means that we are talking
about a width of 800 pixels.

35
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:52,700
By the way, notice how these images
are coming from images source

36
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,380
we will come back to that in a second.

37
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,360
Next up, check out this Volt.

38
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,150
You see how its natural
width is almost 3300 pixels?

39
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,450
That's just massive.

40
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,120
What's the point of so

41
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,420
many pixels when it's going to be
displayed at about 800 pixels wide?

42
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,490
Even on a 2x display,
you only need 1600 pixels across.

43
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,190
So there are so many wasted bytes here.

44
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,590
These images need to be a lot smaller.

45
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,470
I want you to use the tools and
techniques that you've been learning.

46
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,720
To reduce the resolutions and
compress the images.

47
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,500
See how low you can get
the resolution you can use and

48
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,460
how much compression you can use while
still keeping really crisp images.

49
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:33,600
To do so, you have Grunt, Image Magick
and Image Optim on your side.

50
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,840
And you definitely don't have to use these,
but

51
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,890
it will make you life a lot easier
if you do, especially Grunt.

52
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,950
If you've got Grunt up and running,
you should be able to use the Grunt

53
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:47,140
file in the project directory after you
run the command in the instructor notes.

54
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,840
The command will make sure
the grunt-responsive -images package

55
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,230
is installed.

56
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,682
Notice that Grunt is going to run
against images in the images_src/

57
00:02:54,682 --> 00:02:55,600
directory.

58
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,020
and put them in the images directory.

59
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,430
Right now the html all the images can be
found in the images source directory.

60
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,840
But once you've optimized them,

61
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,480
make sure you change their
directory to images.

62
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,080
There are links to lots of
documentation in the instructor

63
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,570
notes if you need help.

64
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:14,230
Right now, the page is coming
in around 3.1 megabytes,

65
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,590
which will take forever
to load on mobile.

66
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,630
Seriously, try loading this
site using the network

67
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,210
throttling options set to 3G.

68
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,920
You may want to grab a cup of coffee
while you wait a few minutes for

69
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,873
the page to load.

70
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:31,330
You can probably reasonably drop the
total bytes from the images below to 1.5

71
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,530
megabytes or even further.

72
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:38,360
In terms of optional changes, the images
are looking pretty lonely right now.

73
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,390
They need some captions.

74
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,680
So we'll add some.

75
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,600
In this solution video, you'll see me
add some captions using the semantic

76
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,780
figure tag, but you can use
whatever technique you'd like.

77
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,700
See the instructor notes for
more documentation on figure.

78
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,770
So, to summarize, first things first,

79
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,240
make sure the images fit
within their containers.

80
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,330
Then once you've done that,
make the containers a reasonable width.

81
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,370
And I recommend about 50em.

82
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,910
Once the images are actually
being displayed properly,

83
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,230
it's time to resize and compress them.

84
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:10,120
They should stay sharp but the page
should drop below 1.5 megabytes total.

85
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,470
In fact, I'd be willing to bet you could
do even better than 1.5 megabytes.

86
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,130
Make sure to use automation tools.

87
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,779
Otherwise, your life is going to be
much more difficult than it needs to be.

88
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,910
But to be fair,
it can be difficult installing Grunt, so

89
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,200
make sure you use the instructor notes.

90
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,110
And as an optional challenge,
add some captions.

91
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,900
Of course, make sure you're testing on
different devices and network settings.

92
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,800
And once you've done the first,
second, and

93
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,170
third parts of this challenge,
a code will appear on the screen.

94
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,600
Type that code in here to continue.
