00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,270
While we could solve our problem by calling our draw function with

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:08,720
setInterval or setTimeout, the better way is to use requestAnimationFrame.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,720
requestAnimationFrame, only sends a request if the last frame is

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,240
already finished drawing, or the window is actively being viewed.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,620
setInterval and setTimeout, execute no matter what.

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,420
So if your drawing takes a really long time to finish a single frame, and

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,640
your interval is really small, it can cause your browser to slow down or crash.

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,510
So when I add a call to requestAnimationFrame, after this drawImage call here.

9
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,460
It makes sure the canvas gets updated.

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,940
So when we hit Play, it should keep it in sync.
