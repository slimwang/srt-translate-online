00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay. A little bit more. I'm going to add a bonus problem to this final.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This is not required but if you do it you'll be eligible for a higher level of distinction in the class,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and again we'll enumerate all that in the instructor comments.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This bonus problem, and you may have seen this link in the demo I gave,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
is to add a page history to each page.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This history link--implement this.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
When we click this history link, the URL changes to _history and then URL.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In this case, we're going to front page it with a slash

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and you can see all the previous versions of a page.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Remember, in the original demo of the problem, I just had it say, "Welcome to the Final"

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and then I edited the page to say, "Your task is to build a wiki."

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm just including the first 100 characters or so of a page.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I can click on view of either of these links to view older versions of a page.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This is the most recent version. If I want to edit a page, I can still click edit.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Notice how the URL changes to _edit.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
If I add this other statement and I click save, you can see the page is updated.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And if I were to click on history, you can see that there's a new version at the top here.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This might be a little tricky.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But for those of you who can figure it out, this will be a really good exercise.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Let's go back to that other URL we are looking at before--new page.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This was a page we added in the first part of the assignment.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
If I were to click history on this page, we can see that this also has two versions.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The original version I made--Here's a new page--

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and then the other version that had some HTML in it.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Now you can see here of course in the history page, the HTML is escaped,

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and when we view the HTML is unescaped causing it to behave exactly like HTML.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We are not going to test on that because it's up to you to decide on your wiki

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
whether or not you want to trust your users not to put a bunch of garbage on your page or not.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You know that's a decision you can make as a website owner, and we won't grill you on it.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But of course in editing, the text area form should escape things properly if they're in there.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
so it can be edited properly, and that's all we've got.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
When you have that working, submit your URL here and good luck.
