1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,456
Let's first go through the process of
running and testing a project locally,

2
00:00:03,456 --> 00:00:04,827
then deploying to App Engine.

3
00:00:04,827 --> 00:00:06,759
The app's very simple, and
it runs out of the box.

4
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:08,878
Let's first run it and
see what it does, and

5
00:00:08,878 --> 00:00:11,241
then take a look at the code
that makes it happen.

6
00:00:11,241 --> 00:00:13,563
First, open up App Engine Launcher.

7
00:00:13,563 --> 00:00:17,440
Add a new project and point to the
directory for the hello endpoints app.

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,548
As you can see it gets added and
it will set a port for

9
00:00:20,548 --> 00:00:24,407
the web interface and
different one for the admin interface.

10
00:00:24,407 --> 00:00:27,183
The default port for
app engine is 80/80.

11
00:00:27,183 --> 00:00:29,763
If you add several projects
to the launcher, the port for

12
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:32,256
the next app you add to
the launcher will be different.

13
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,881
So when testing locally,
pay attention to that port number.

14
00:00:34,881 --> 00:00:36,657
Click the green Run button.

15
00:00:36,657 --> 00:00:39,975
Then click on the Logs button to
see the deployment process, and

16
00:00:39,975 --> 00:00:41,394
if there are any problems.

17
00:00:41,394 --> 00:00:42,276
Look at the logs.

18
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:44,959
Once the app is deployed,
you'll see several lines.

19
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:48,082
One will tell you the URL and the port
that the app can be accessed at.

20
00:00:48,082 --> 00:00:51,138
When you go to the URL for
that starting module default,

21
00:00:51,138 --> 00:00:52,576
you should see this page.

22
00:00:52,576 --> 00:00:54,317
Hm, it looks really basic.

23
00:00:54,317 --> 00:00:57,216
Since this course is about
the back end part of the app,

24
00:00:57,216 --> 00:01:00,320
we haven't put any CSS or
any other front end work into it.

25
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,201
So click on the buttons and
see what happens.

26
00:01:02,201 --> 00:01:07,942
You know, my name's not actually Zebra,
so I'm going to change that.

27
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:10,326
That's much better.

28
00:01:10,326 --> 00:01:11,033
Okay, great.

29
00:01:11,033 --> 00:01:12,228
The local server works.

30
00:01:12,228 --> 00:01:14,730
But if you want other people
to be able to access your app,

31
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,408
you have to deploy it onto App Engine.

32
00:01:16,408 --> 00:01:17,197
Let's do that.

33
00:01:17,197 --> 00:01:18,393
It's actually almost as easy.

34
00:01:18,393 --> 00:01:22,073
You just press the deploy button and
it'll want your Google login.

35
00:01:22,073 --> 00:01:23,793
The password is swordfish, by the way.

36
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:27,148
Let's take a look in the logs and
see how the deployment process goes.

37
00:01:27,148 --> 00:01:31,491
Hm, appcfg.py has finished
with exit code one.

38
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,813
Exit code one is usually
not a good deal.

39
00:01:33,813 --> 00:01:35,665
Let's see up here.

40
00:01:35,665 --> 00:01:36,914
Begin server output.

41
00:01:36,914 --> 00:01:38,609
This application does not exist.

42
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:42,034
App ID equals you, your project ID.

43
00:01:42,034 --> 00:01:44,509
Oh, it's complaining that
it can't deploy to that.

44
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:45,414
That's right.

45
00:01:45,414 --> 00:01:48,990
You have to actually enter your own
app ID into the configuration first.

46
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,270
So remember when you
created an App Engine app,

47
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,787
get that project ID from
the developer's console.

48
00:01:53,787 --> 00:01:56,388
Don't use the one that you see in
this video, it won't work for you.

49
00:01:56,388 --> 00:01:57,351
Get your own.

50
00:01:57,351 --> 00:02:01,239
Then, in the code,
open up app.yaml, and replace your

51
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:06,187
project ID in the application line
with the one you got from the console.

52
00:02:06,187 --> 00:02:07,720
And save that.

53
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,758
And when you go back to Google App
Engine Launcher you'll see that the name

54
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:11,690
has already changed.

55
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,211
Now you can deploy the app and

56
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:20,319
watch in the logs as it gets sent to
app engine compiled and deployed.

57
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,449
Eventually, you'll see,
completed updated of app, and

58
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:28,339
the URL for your app will
be your app id.appspot.com.

59
00:02:28,339 --> 00:02:33,297
If you go to your app id.appspot.com,
you should see the very same thing.

60
00:02:33,297 --> 00:02:36,397
So you now have the app running
both locally and on App Engine.

61
00:02:36,397 --> 00:02:38,498
So now it's time to
explore how it works.

62
00:02:38,498 --> 00:02:39,960
Let's take a look back at the code.

63
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,594
Let's take a look at helloworldapi.py,
and here we go, endpoints.api,

64
00:02:44,594 --> 00:02:46,034
that sounds familiar.

65
00:02:46,034 --> 00:02:48,356
Look at this, endpoints.method.

66
00:02:48,356 --> 00:02:51,203
Hm, one of these things,
endpoints.api and

67
00:02:51,203 --> 00:02:54,637
endpoints.method, oh this
uses Python decorators.

68
00:02:54,637 --> 00:02:56,850
Maybe we should talk about those first.
