1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,240
One of the most important parts
of making high quality software.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,800
Is rigorous testing.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,430
Simply typing in test values into
a function won't get us very far.

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,960
So to do real testing on large scale,
tests need to be automated.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,370
There are many types of tests, but

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,820
broadly tests fall
into one of two camps.

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,990
Unit tests and Integration tests.

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,690
Unit tests test individual classes or
methods in isolation.

9
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,770
Whereas Integration tests, test your
code in conjunction with some other

10
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,650
systems, libraries, or environments.

11
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,600
In addition to writing tests, we want to
automate the execution of our tests,

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:37,140
more importantly, we want to integrate
test execution into our build process.

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,980
The benefit of this is we can now
ensure that our tests are run

14
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,260
when our application is built, ensuring
that every change to our code is tested,

15
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,620
reducing the likelihood of unknowingly
introducing bugs into our software.

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,980
We won't get into the specifics
of how to write good tests, but

17
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,610
I hope I've convinced you on
the importance of testing.

18
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,030
Let's check out how can help us
easily automate our testing.
