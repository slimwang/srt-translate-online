The answer is 6 root 5, or 6 times the square root of 5.

2
00:00:05,608 --> 00:00:08,653
There are however a couple of steps between the last step I showed you and

3
00:00:08,653 --> 00:00:13,570
this answer, so let's talk about them. We know that square roots are the same as

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:18,300
exponents of one-half. So we can rewrite this as 6 squared times 5 all

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,250
to the one-half power. You learned earlier though,

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:26,745
about how exponents distribute to factors inside a term. That means this is also

7
00:00:26,745 --> 00:00:31,640
equal to 6 squared to the one-half times 5 to the one-half. Which, of course,

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,090
we can return to radical notation. The square root of 6 squared is just 6.

9
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,710
And the square root of 5 is an irrational number.
