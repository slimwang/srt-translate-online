00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,420
Let's look at the answer
to our miss rate quiz.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:07,790
In a well designed cache, we want
the hit rate to be high as possible and

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,300
the miss rate to be low as
possible because the hit rate

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,730
determines how often do we
have just the hit latency and

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,380
the miss rate is how often we have
to pay the full memory latency.

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,310
So, we definitely want the hit rate
to be larger than the miss rate.

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,670
We definitely do not want the hit rate
to be smaller than the miss rate.

8
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,220
We don't want them to be equal to each
other, because that means half of

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,580
the time, we are going to memory,
we won't hit much more than that.

10
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,580
We want the hit rate to be
almost 1 because that means that

11
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,690
almost always we are going
to have a cache hit.

12
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,625
And we definitely do not want the miss
rate to be almost 1 because that means

13
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,550
that we are almost never
hitting in our cache.
