1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,000
While we talk about the pervasiveness of cameras,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,440
we also have to discuss the availability of these cameras in all contexts.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,670
Camera phones would most probably be the widest selling

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,220
electronic platform out there.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,430
Initially it used to be things like television and, you know, VCRs and

6
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:22,780
stuff like that, but camera and camera phones have basically taken over.

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,860
Primarily because they're not just cameras, but they're phones and

8
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,390
communication devices at the same time.

9
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,600
Basically newer platforms like, you know,

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,940
YouTube, Flickr, all that kind of stuff is now becoming available.

11
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,330
That makes the distribution of content that's not just textual, much,

12
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,070
much easier.

13
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:44,250
People share images and videos a lot, but then at the same time, and

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,160
this is very, extremely important is our ability to analyze images, video,

15
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,980
has been enhanced because we can actually do analysis of text, speech, and

16
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,150
other types of things.

17
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,750
So multi-model analysis has of course grown considerably with the growth of

18
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,070
the internet and computational technologies which impacts our ability to

19
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,180
deal with photographs and images a lot, too.

20
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,780
And of course, not to forget, it's an important element in art, and science,

21
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,820
and research.

22
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,750
And more important these days, it's becoming an amazingly important tool for

23
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,100
social computing.

24
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,700
Instagram and other types of technologies are really basically made photography

25
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,040
as a first class medium and even things like Facebook, Google Plus, you name it.

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,090
Any social media platform supports and

27
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,100
leverages images and pictures extensively.

28
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,260
To help us understand this,

29
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,490
now let's look at some interesting ways of seeing how the trends have changed.
