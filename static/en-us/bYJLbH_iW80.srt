1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now I want to ask a few questions about this protocol to see that

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
you can understand some of the things that could go wrong

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
with this simplified version of TLS.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Here are some possibilities and keep in mind the threat model that we introduced earlier.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We're assuming an active attacker with limited computational power.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Check all the things that we should be worried about going wrong

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
the way the protocol is specified here.
