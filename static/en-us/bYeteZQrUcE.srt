Hi, welcome to Udacity's machine
learning nano degree program.

2
00:00:04,809 --> 00:00:09,820
My name is Luis Serrano and
I'm a Course Developer here at Udacity.

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,609
But before I worked here I was working
on machine learning at Google for

4
00:00:12,609 --> 00:00:13,689
a few years.

5
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:17,079
I was using machine learning algorithms
to generate video recommendations at

6
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:18,230
YouTube.

7
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,219
Machine learning is widely used for
many cool things.

8
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:24,969
Such as image and
voice recognition, spam detection,

9
00:00:24,969 --> 00:00:29,989
fraud detection, stock market, teaching
a computer how to play chess, and,

10
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:32,519
of course, self-driving cars.

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,560
So it may sound like something so
useful must be pretty complicated.

12
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,170
But I'm here to show you that machine
learning is actually pretty easy.

13
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,140
And most importantly a lot of fun.

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,550
So first off, what is machine learning?

15
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:52,619
Well, we have the world and in the world
we have humans and we have computers.

16
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:56,039
And one of the main
differences between humans and

17
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,240
computers is that humans
learn from past experiences.

18
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,060
Whereas computers need to be told what
to do, they need to be programmed.

19
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:08,689
And now the question is, can we get
computers to learn from experience too?

20
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:11,280
And the answer is yes, we can.

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,030
And that is precisely
what machine learning is.

22
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:19,272
Teaching computers to learn to
perform tasks from past experiences.

23
00:01:19,272 --> 00:01:24,804
Of course, for computers past
experiences are just recorded as data.

24
00:01:24,804 --> 00:01:28,742
So together, we're going to look at
a few examples in which we can teach

25
00:01:28,742 --> 00:01:31,118
the computer to learn
from previous data.

26
00:01:31,117 --> 00:01:34,623
And most importantly, I'm going to show
you that machine learning is actually

27
00:01:34,623 --> 00:01:36,208
pretty easy, and nothing to fear.

28
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:36,709
