00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,621
>> Now remember, Hart and Risley had families of a professional status,

2
00:00:03,621 --> 00:00:08,962
middle-class, or welfare. And what they found was that, children from

3
00:00:08,962 --> 00:00:16,119
professional families heard, on average, 2,153 words per hour. Children in the

4
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:23,608
middle-class family heard on average 1,251 words per hour. And, the children in

5
00:00:23,608 --> 00:00:29,720
the welfare families heard on average 616 words per hour. Therefore, we see

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,689
that the type of family that the child was in had a great impact on the overall

7
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:39,226
number of words that they heard. But, that's not all. That means that, for

8
00:00:39,226 --> 00:00:43,782
children in a professional family they had approximately 11,000,000 words per

9
00:00:43,782 --> 00:00:49,744
year. those in the middle class family heard approximately 6,000,000 per year

10
00:00:49,744 --> 00:00:54,702
and finally those in the welfare group heard approximately 3,000,000 words per

11
00:00:54,702 --> 00:01:00,463
year. Hart and recently found that by age four, the children from the welfare

12
00:01:00,463 --> 00:01:04,492
families could have heard about 30,000,000 fewer words, compared to those in

13
00:01:04,492 --> 00:01:10,638
the professional family. But that's not all. Let's look at one more important

14
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:12,180
finding from Hart and Risley.
