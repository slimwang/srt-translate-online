00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,649
We're going to start this new unit by looking at a quadratic equation. A

2
00:00:03,649 --> 00:00:07,944
quadratic equation has an x squared term in it. That's where the quadratic comes

3
00:00:07,944 --> 00:00:11,867
in. Let's look at one student's attempt to try and solve this. The student

4
00:00:11,867 --> 00:00:15,619
attempted to solve for x by isolating the variable. First, the student

5
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:19,863
subtracted x squared from both sides. And then subtracted 6 from both sides.

6
00:00:19,863 --> 00:00:26,131
Finally to isolate x, the student divide both sides by 5. So did the student

7
00:00:26,131 --> 00:00:29,440
find the number that x equals? Yes or no?
