00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,130
All right, welcome back to Computer Vision.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,272
Today, we're going to sort of finish up our edge detection unit.

3
00:00:05,272 --> 00:00:08,250
Which will then be used for things that you're going to be doing later.

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,620
Our last lesson we talked about the notion of edges and

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,920
how they related to magnitudes of gradients and derivatives of functions.

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,100
And we remembered what a gradient was in case that part of

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,019
your brain had fallen off.

8
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,780
And we talked about developing some operators that you could apply to

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,150
the image that would be computing these gradients.

10
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,890
We showed how they were sensitive to noise, and

11
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,160
we had to do worry about filtering in order to smooth these things out.

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,390
And we talked, we could sort of first filter the image.

13
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,870
And then apply the operator.

14
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,560
Or we could filter the operate.

15
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,700
We could, sorry, smooth the operator and apply that to the image.

16
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,380
And here is a,

17
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,580
a picture just reminding that by doing this, saved us that one operation.

18
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,380
So here is our function, f.

19
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,870
Here is the smoothing filter.

20
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,000
We take the derivative of that.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,820
And from then on in,

22
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,760
we could just use that operator to find these peaks and edges.
