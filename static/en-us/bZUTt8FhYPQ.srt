The answer is more. As we calculated earlier, Grant would only have $10,300 if

00:00:05,188 --> 00:00:11,317
interest is compounded just one time a year. Compounding interest in this way

00:00:11,317 --> 00:00:17,000
actually gives Grant more money after a year than annual compounding would. I

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,053
wonder how we could generalize about this.
