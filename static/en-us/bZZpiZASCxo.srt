1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,950
Now the work is just
the total number of vertices.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:06,100
In this case, there's a 4x4 grid so
that means the work is 16.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,670
What about the span?

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:12,600
Now the span is going to be the longest
path from the start to the exit.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,800
Now in this DAG, all paths happen to
have the same length, which is 7.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,290
Here's an example of one such path.
