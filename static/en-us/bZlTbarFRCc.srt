1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,678
So what about biology in aggression? It turns out that overall gender is the

2
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:08,226
best predictor of aggression. Men being more likely to commit crimes such as

3
00:00:08,226 --> 00:00:13,280
murder, battery and assault. Culture may also account for some of this in that

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,111
aggressiveness may be a product of socialization. It appears that many

5
00:00:18,111 --> 00:00:22,940
societies encourage males to be more aggressive than females. But our biology

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,825
clearly plays a role too. Do you remember when we discussed testosterone in our

7
00:00:26,825 --> 00:00:31,380
less non-motivational emotion? Well, testosterone is a male sex hormone.

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,797
However, you'll recall that women also have testosterone and that's important

9
00:00:34,797 --> 00:00:40,292
for our sexual response. We see that testosterone is related to aggression. In

10
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:43,607
that those with higher levels of testosterone correlate positively with the

11
00:00:43,607 --> 00:00:47,919
tendency towards aggression and violence. Now something else that's important

12
00:00:47,919 --> 00:00:52,234
to aggression is serotonin. It turns out that low levels of serotonin actually

13
00:00:52,234 --> 00:00:57,122
make aggression more likely in humans as well as in other animals. So we see

14
00:00:57,122 --> 00:01:00,112
that our biology plays a role in aggression and our social influences can play

15
00:01:00,112 --> 00:01:05,491
a role in aggression. Now, are boys aggressive in the same way as girls? And

16
00:01:05,491 --> 00:01:09,373
how does the social world influence our aggressive behaviors. We see that boys

17
00:01:09,373 --> 00:01:14,130
may model other boys or men and imitate aggressive behaviors such as, punching,

18
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,630
kicking and so forth. And then as for girls, we do see that they can be

19
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:25,050
physically aggressive. Often times, girls engage in what we call indirect

20
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:29,660
aggression. That's not necessarily hitting or punching but engaging in

21
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:34,306
behaviors that may exclude an individual. For example, girls may be more likely

22
00:01:34,306 --> 00:01:38,266
to talk badly about a person, spread rumors about a person or make fun of a

23
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:44,490
person. Or generally just engage in ways to psychologically hurt an individual.

24
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,010
We can argue that the pain of being punched in the face or having rumors spread

25
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:52,595
about you can be very similar. Because as we've said a few times, the

26
00:01:52,595 --> 00:01:56,885
experience of physical and psychological pain both activate the same areas of

27
00:01:56,885 --> 00:02:00,459
the brain. Now, let's go back to Susan
