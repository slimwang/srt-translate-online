00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,048
So this concludes our little
addendum to object recognition.

2
00:00:04,048 --> 00:00:07,859
And what it will do is it will let me
later talk about, well actually, it will

3
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:11,793
let me later not talk about activity
recognition being done the same way,

4
00:00:11,793 --> 00:00:15,968
where instead of doing it over
just images, you do it over video.

5
00:00:15,968 --> 00:00:20,620
But code words are a very, sort of,
standard approach in computer vision

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,210
these days, and so
it's important that you know about it.

7
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:27,630
So I, I went and stole some new slides
to make this just for you guys.

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,600
So I hope you appreciate it.
