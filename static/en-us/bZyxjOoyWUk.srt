If f of x is this function of ordered pairs, what would be the inverse of this

2
00:00:03,807 --> 00:00:09,344
function? When you write your inverse function here, write is as a set with

3
00:00:09,344 --> 00:00:14,940
curly braces on the ends. And then write your coordinate pairs seperated by

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,189
commas.
