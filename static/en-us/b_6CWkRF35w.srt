00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,264
Now that you have a good grasp of the strength and direction of linear

2
00:00:03,264 --> 00:00:08,138
relationships, we need a way to quantify these characteristics. The number that

3
00:00:08,138 --> 00:00:12,423
quantifies the relationship is called the correlation coefficient, denoted by

4
00:00:12,423 --> 00:00:18,402
r. You have seen r before when we did t-tests. This is also known as Pearson's

5
00:00:18,402 --> 00:00:23,490
r, named after a statistician as usual. We will describe the formula so that

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,730
you know what it is, and we'll focus on interpreting r. r is a fraction just

7
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:35,890
like many of our other statistics. The numerator is the covariance of x and y.

8
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:41,984
This is a function. This does not mean Cov or some number times x, y. This is

9
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:47,144
the covariance of x and y which is in itself a statistic for how much x and y

10
00:00:47,144 --> 00:00:54,846
co vary, in other words how much they vary together. In the demoninator is the

11
00:00:54,846 --> 00:01:00,064
standard deviation of x times the standard deviation of y. And this describes

12
00:01:00,064 --> 00:01:05,660
how the two variables vary apart from each other rather than with each other.

13
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:09,549
Another way of writing it is like this. Even though r is a ratio, it's not

14
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:14,988
interpreted as a percentage. However, r squared is the percentage of the

15
00:01:14,988 --> 00:01:21,275
variation in y explained by the variation in x. You saw this before when we did

16
00:01:21,275 --> 00:01:25,435
t-tests, and you saw how we explained a certain percentage of the difference

17
00:01:25,435 --> 00:01:29,725
between sample means, or between a sample mean and the population mean, that's

18
00:01:29,725 --> 00:01:36,979
due to the different treatments. r squared here has the same interpretation. r

19
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:42,004
squared is called the coefficient of determination. r measures the strength of

20
00:01:42,004 --> 00:01:47,240
a relationship, by looking at how closely the data falls along a straight line.

21
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:52,104
If it falls perfectly along a straight line in the positive direction, then r

22
00:01:52,104 --> 00:01:57,504
is positive 1. And if the data fall perfectly along a straight line in the

23
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:03,774
negative direction, r is negative 1. Data that are not correlated at all have a

24
00:02:03,774 --> 00:02:08,768
correlation coefficient of zero. Usually data will not fall along a straight

25
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:14,290
line, but sometimes it comes pretty close. And then r in this case might have a

26
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,629
correlation coefficient of 0.8, which is actually pretty high.
