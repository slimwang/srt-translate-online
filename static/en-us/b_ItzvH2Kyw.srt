Great job on completing lesson two stage five.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,810
In lesson two stage six, we've split the tweet topology from stage five into

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:12,530
individual files for spouts, bolts, and the tweet topology.

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,570
This structure is more typical of larger programs.

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,800
And this exercise is intended to give you practice searching for

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,380
required fields in your correct spout, bolt, and

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,590
topology class files to complete a real topology.

8
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:30,060
In part one, complete the tweet topology to attach the tweet spout

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,800
with the parallelism of one.

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,450
Attach the parse tweet bolt with a parallelism of 10 and the count bolt with

11
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:43,000
a parallelism of 15 and the report bolt with a parallelism of 1.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,780
Remember to enter your Twitter OAuth credentials.

13
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,000
And finally, build and run your final topology.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,300
Refer to your solution in lesson two stage five if necessary, but

15
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,740
try to solve the exercise without referring to your previous work.

16
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,420
Finally, refer to lesson three stage one if you need the solution.

17
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,010
Lastly, when you've completed your tweet topology and

18
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,850
it's running correctly why don't you post a screenshot or

19
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:11,300
video to the forum and comment or help out some of your fellow learners.

20
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:11,800
Good luck.
