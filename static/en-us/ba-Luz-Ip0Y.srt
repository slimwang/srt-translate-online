1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,784
So, we want to recreate a scale for

2
00:00:02,784 --> 00:00:07,762
the x axis that maps values
from 250 to 100,000.

3
00:00:07,762 --> 00:00:12,810
And keep in mind that we want to create
a log scale rather than a linear scale.

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,150
So, in order to do that, I'll bring
up my y axis scale code again, and

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,740
then make some changes.

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,960
So, first, I want to change my
y variable to the variable x.

7
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:27,590
I want to be careful that I don't
overwrite the scale that I just made.

8
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,550
And since the x scale
is a logarithmic scale,

9
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,260
we'll change the linear
function to a log function.

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,401
We have an input domain
of 250 to 100,000 and

11
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:42,360
that maps to a range
from 0 to 600 pixels.

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,230
Keep in mind that the range that we
want to map the data to corresponds to

13
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,030
the width of the entire svg element.

14
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,950
You need to switch the values here back
to their normal order because we want

15
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:58,530
the lowest input value to correspond
to the lowest output pixel value.

16
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,110
And similarly, we want the highest input
value to correspond to the highest

17
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,000
pixel output value.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,690
Unlike the y axis,
the x axis starts at 0 at the origin and

19
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,470
then increases moving out to the right.

20
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:13,160
And finally,

21
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,340
I just want to check that my x axis
scale returns the correct values.

22
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,290
For an input of 250,
it should return 0 pixels.

23
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,480
And for an input of 100,000,
it should return 600 pixels.
