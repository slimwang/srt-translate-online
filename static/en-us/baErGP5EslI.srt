00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,254
Now once an object is created, it will one day have to die, because that's the

2
00:00:03,254 --> 00:00:07,535
ebb and flow of the universe. Now once it dies, we need to remove it from the

3
00:00:07,535 --> 00:00:11,055
physics simulation, and can do so by calling the destroy body function on the

4
00:00:11,055 --> 00:00:15,535
world object. Now we rap up this call in a remove body function so that

5
00:00:15,535 --> 00:00:18,901
external systems don't need to know about the presence of the world object from

6
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:20,760
box 2 D.
