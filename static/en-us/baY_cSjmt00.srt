2
00:00:02,999 --> 00:00:04,719
In this lesson we discussed
variables and constants.

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:07,231
Two of the most basic
ingredients of any application.

4
00:00:07,232 --> 00:00:11,359
As you've seen, you can accomplish many
simple tasks using just variables and

5
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:12,349
constants.

6
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:15,709
But soon you'll start combining
variables into larger constructs

7
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,910
to build solutions to
more complex problems.

8
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,809
Next up we'll download Xcode and
start working in Swift playgrounds.
