00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,150
Let's look more closely at the product of these two factors and this polynomial.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,929
Do you remember that number puzzle that we've been playing? Well, there's a deep

3
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:12,331
connection going on between these factors and this number puzzle. We know all

4
00:00:12,331 --> 00:00:17,110
three of these forms are equivalent. And for the number puzzle, I'm going to put

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,940
a 30 in the top and 11 in the bottom. So what are the answers to this number

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,823
puzzle? Write them in here.
