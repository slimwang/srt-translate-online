00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,826
>> So here's the word equation we came up with in the last problem. Clearly

2
00:00:03,826 --> 00:00:07,922
though, considering I had to write this on two separate lines, there are a lot

3
00:00:07,922 --> 00:00:11,924
of words here and this is going to be kind of confusing to keep track of. So,

4
00:00:11,924 --> 00:00:15,734
let's use some different variables. I'd like to let x equal the number of

5
00:00:15,734 --> 00:00:19,451
nozzles made and I'd like to let y equal the total amount spent on nozzle

6
00:00:19,451 --> 00:00:23,472
production. So, with those substitutions, our equation will look a little bit

7
00:00:23,472 --> 00:00:27,372
cleaner. With these substitutions, it's pretty clear that this equation is

8
00:00:27,372 --> 00:00:31,392
written in slope intercept form, which we are now very familiar and comfortable

9
00:00:31,392 --> 00:00:35,327
with. So thinking about where the slope should show up in this equation and the

10
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:39,922
information that we're given. What number do you think the slope is equal to in

11
00:00:39,922 --> 00:00:40,858
this equation?
