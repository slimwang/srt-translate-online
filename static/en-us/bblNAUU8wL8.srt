00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Norvig] And the answer is it will take about N squared on average.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It will be more time proportional to N squared.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And the way you can see that is to think about how long it's going to take

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
to get the very last item of this swapped array filled in.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So say all the items are true all the way through,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
except there's 1 holdout that we haven't got yet. This one is still false.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
About how long will it take until we randomly choose a number

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
so that we can make this one be true?

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And the answer is there's N of these.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And each time we're going through and we're generating indices,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
so it's going to take about N random numbers before we get that.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So for each of these N elements of the array

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
we can expect on average to take N or less.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
For the first one it will be easy.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The second one will be a little bit harder. The last few it will be harder still.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But in the average case, the complexity is going to be on the order

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
of N times generating a random number for each of the N elements of that array

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
or order of N squared altogether.
