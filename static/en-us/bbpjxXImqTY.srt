00:00:00,355 --> 00:00:02,110
Let;s talk briefly about
some of the pros and

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:05,890
cons of using third party
authentication and authorization.

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,850
If you use third party authentication,
authorization,

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,685
you don't have to think about how to
encrypt and store user passwords.

5
00:00:11,685 --> 00:00:14,950
We can just let the OAuth
provider worry about that.

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:15,890
Another bonus is that,

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,540
users don't have to fill in another
form to create an account on your site.

8
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,330
Less friction for

9
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,800
signing up should hopefully lead to an
increased number of users on your site.

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,620
Also, it means that users don't have
to remember another password for

11
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,460
your site, and you don't have
to keep their password secure.

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,490
That means if your
site gets compromised,

13
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,640
you didn't just leak your users'
passwords to the attacker.

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,540
A neutral issue to point out is
that users need to have an account

15
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,010
on a third-party provider site
in order to log in to your site.

16
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,630
If they already have an account such as
Google or Facebook then that's great.

17
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,370
They can quickly be signed into
your app with just a few clicks.

18
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,380
But if they do not, then there's
an extra step of making an account

19
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,950
they may not be willing to go through
first before coming back to your site.

20
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,520
For this reason, you want to support
login via sites that are very popular

21
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,250
and already have a lot of users.

22
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,810
Having Google and
Facebook login is a good idea, and

23
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,410
can be beneficial to you and your users.

24
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,000
But it's important to make sure that
you're using all providers that

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,030
hopefully already cover a large
portion of your potential client base.

26
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,790
So there's a strong case for
using third-party

27
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:16,960
providers to store user credentials and
then use that for your own site.

28
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,630
But there are also some downsides
to this approach as well.

29
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,620
Maybe some of your users already
have a third-party account but

30
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,620
don't want to use that account on
your site for privacy concerns.

31
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,530
Most people don't like using apps
that could potentially post to their

32
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,230
social media networks on their behalf.

33
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,970
This is an important reason
to keep the OAuth scopes.

34
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,100
The resources you request
permission to access to a minimum.

35
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,360
And request access only to
things your app actually needs.

36
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,310
Just because you're authenticating with
Google doesn't mean that you have to

37
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,700
ask for permission to mess with all the
users Google resources and information.

38
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,860
And even though you can
authenticate with Facebook,

39
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,360
it would be a good practice
to let the user know you're

40
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,940
app does not have the authorization
to spam all of their friends.

41
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,680
If you're going to create a web app
that works completely offline, or

42
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,890
under intermittent internet connections,

43
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,620
a local authentication system
may be a better option.

44
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,370
The security for
most OAuth providers is pretty good, but

45
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:07,410
maybe it's not enough for
the application you're creating.

46
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,360
If you need the ability to
change the requirements for

47
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,590
password strength, or implement your
own form of two-factor authentication.

48
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,830
Then, third-party authentication
may not be the best option.

49
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,160
These are all cases where you might
consider creating your own OP system.

50
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,670
However, remember, that if you do decide
to do it yourself, you'll need to

51
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,970
address the many security challenges
to make sure that both your servers and

52
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,730
your user accounts
cannot be compromised.
