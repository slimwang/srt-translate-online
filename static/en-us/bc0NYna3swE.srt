00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,660
Let me show you three different types of kernels that are used

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,960
in doing various types of of H detection.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,510
The Prewitt, the Sobel, and the Roberts.

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,650
The Prewitt kernel basically uses negative values in this and

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,460
positive values, and of course a transpose.

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,450
The Sobel gives it a little bit more heavier thing to the middle kernel.

7
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:21,720
Our middle values.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,750
Remember we looked at trying to look at points where sometimes just giving it

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,530
a ramp in the middle gives a little bit more information locally.

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,710
Transpose of this is, of course, here.

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,190
The Roberts one is even simpler,

12
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:39,110
except it actually basically puts in values at the two different end diagonals.

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,400
And uses that to compute radiance.

14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,050
Let's try this on our input image.

15
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,780
I'm just showing you the response for the derivative in x.

16
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,250
You can extrapolate and see what it would look like in y.

17
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,550
You notice that, of course,

18
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:57,700
it does actually a pretty good job in trying to compute the gradients.

19
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,030
Or the gradient in x, in this instance.

20
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm aware that the, perhaps at resolution, you can't see the details.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But hopefully, you'll trust me.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,390
And we'll try to make some of these available to you.

23
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,920
Of course, we're interested in computing edges.

24
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,970
So from this set of input images in Hx,

25
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,210
let's see what we can what edges would look like.

26
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,060
I have yet to explain how we're going to go to edge from here.

27
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,530
But I just wanted to show you examples right now.

28
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:24,720
This is basically doing edge detection from the original image

29
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,300
using the Prewitt, the Sabel operator, and the Roberts one.
