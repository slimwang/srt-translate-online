1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now, the third concept is the concept of equilibrium.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
An equilibrium is an outcome such that no player

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
can benefit from switching to a different strategy,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
assuming that the other players stay the same.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And there was a famous result from John Nash, economist,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
who was shown in the movie and book "A Beautiful Mind"

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
proving that every game has at least 1 equilibrium point.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The question here is which, if any, of these outcomes

9
00:00:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
are equilibriums in this game?
