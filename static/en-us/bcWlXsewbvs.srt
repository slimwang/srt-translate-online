1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,740
You'll see that once we
know the properties and

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,650
relationships of the entities
we want to create,

3
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,500
the Model Editor is
extremely easy to use.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,060
To open Story Board we
click on Story Board file.

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,690
To open the Model Editor
we click on the Model file.

6
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,590
Let's get some screen room and
we can see how it works.

7
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,060
You'll see that inside
the modelling tool we have our

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,970
entities here in the left column.

9
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,298
And then we have the area for editing
the entities over here in this center.

10
00:00:23,298 --> 00:00:26,400
We want to learn how to use this tool so
let's just be bold here.

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,780
Let's completely recreate our entities.

12
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,900
To delete the entities, we just click
on the entities and press Delete.

13
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,480
It's kind of risky but
not anything to be too nervous about.

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,690
They're easy to re-create.

15
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,580
We'll create two entities and then
we'll give them their attributes and

16
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,760
relationships.

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,550
We add entities with this
Add Entity button down here.

18
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:45,470
It can be a little bit hard to find
because it's so low on the screen.

19
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,890
Let's click it twice
to add two entities.

20
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,710
Now we click the entities once,
wait, and then

21
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:54,370
click them again to change the name, and
we can do this for both of our entities.

22
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:59,670
Now that we have our entities, let's
click on Movie and add its attributes.

23
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,470
Let's add four attributes to the movie.

24
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:06,960
Let's set their names to ID,
poster path, release date, and title.

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,630
Then all we have to do is
select the right data types.

26
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,170
ID is an Int, and in general
we'll use Int 64 for Int values.

27
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,720
Poster path is a String.

28
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,990
Release date is a Date.

29
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,360
And title as a String.

30
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,040
It's really as straight forward as that.

31
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,870
Person is similar.

32
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,780
We click Person, and
then add three properties.

33
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,300
After we add them we have
to give their data types.

34
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,410
ID is Int 64.

35
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,530
Image path is a String.

36
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:30,600
And name Is a String.

37
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,910
Hopefully you're getting the impression
that you'll not need to spend a lot of

38
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,920
time inside this Model Editor tool.

39
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,540
Once you know what it is you want to
build, it's pretty easy to build them.

40
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,090
There's one last thing we need to do.

41
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,120
We still need to make our Relationships.

42
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,250
This is a topic we should
cover in more detail.

43
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,120
We'll visit this again
later in the lesson.

44
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,100
But, let's start by setting
them up here in the modeller.

45
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,700
Let's start with the movie entity.

46
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,150
In this app, each movie object
is tied to a single person.

47
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,840
To add a Relationship,
we click on this plus.

48
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,880
Movies have a property named
actor that point to a person.

49
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,460
That's the name of the Relationship.

50
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,790
The person class is the Destination.

51
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,810
We'll talk about these
Destinations more.

52
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,870
In the person entity,
we have a Relationship named Movies.

53
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,050
Again we add a Relationship and
we set it to Movies.

54
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,310
We'll set the Destination for
this Relationship to the Movie object.

55
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,480
Remember that we discussed that
Relationships have inverses.

56
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,410
If a movie is tied to a person,
then that person is tied to the movie.

57
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,730
We set these inverses
in the third column.

58
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,010
This is kind of cool.

59
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,750
Notice that once we
set the inverse actor,

60
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,590
the inverse is automatically set for
person's movies property.

61
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,560
We're almost done, but
there's one more step.

62
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,370
We said before that the Relationship
between a person and

63
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,910
movies is a too many relationship.

64
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,360
That means that one person
can have many movies.

65
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,530
We need to set that here
in the Model Editor.

66
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,060
To do that, we open up the left panel.

67
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,530
We click on the Relationship and we
come over here to the Entity Inspector.

68
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,360
Here we can set
the Relationship to Too Many.

69
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,160
But what is this?

70
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,150
That opens up some additional options.

71
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,360
What are the Arrangement and
Count Bounds?

72
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,090
What is this Delete Rule?

73
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,090
There are a lot of things we need
to learn about these Relationships.

74
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,350
Let's look into these in more detail
