00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,460
Here's how I would have
answered the question.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,600
I would have marked supply voltage,
clock frequency, and activity factor.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,830
If you disagree,
let's duke it out in the forums.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,290
Let's start with capacitance, C.

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:14,380
Why didn't I check it off?

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,250
Partly it's because I never really
understood what capacitance is.

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,920
Electricity and magnetism have always
been a bit of a weak point for me.

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,030
Curse you, Michael Faraday, with your
brilliant intellect, chiseled jaw,

9
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,120
haunting eyes and delicate,

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,690
albeit slightly sooty 19th
century industrial good looks.

11
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,790
Personally, I wouldn't pick capacitance
because it's a geometric and

12
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,910
electrical property of the materials
used to build the chip.

13
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,670
I don't normally think of controlling
that at the level of my algorithm

14
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:41,790
or software.

15
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,920
Though in the future, who knows.

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,660
Next, let's consider voltage and

17
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,960
frequency together since they're
supposed to vary together.

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,180
In fact, there's a feature of many
modern processors and memory systems for

19
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,460
changing these.

20
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,830
It's called Dynamic Voltage and
Frequency Scaling, or DVFS for short.

21
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,430
DVFS is typically controlled in
hardware, but there are some

22
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,830
processors and operating systems
that offer software level control.

23
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,970
In Linux, for instance,
there's something called cpufreq.

24
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,980
Speaking of freaks, look,
it's CPU Rick James!

25
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,515
She's CPU freaky.

26
00:01:12,515 --> 00:01:16,365
[SOUND] Lastly,
there's the activity factor.

27
00:01:16,365 --> 00:01:18,607
I've checked it off, but
it would be fair for

28
00:01:18,607 --> 00:01:22,520
a hardware person to tell me I
have an overactive imagination.

29
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,100
Remember the activity factor is about
how frequently state transitions occur.

30
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,870
So if you know what at the algorithm or

31
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,820
software level that there are big chunks
of the processing system that you don't

32
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,050
need you might imagine
turning those chunks off.

33
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,640
For instance,
suppose you're doing a reduction.

34
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,580
Algorithmically, you know this
operation is mostly about

35
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,530
streaming the input data.

36
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,780
So, that implies there's
no reason to cash it.

37
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,630
Therefore, if the hardware gave
you a knob to turn the cash off,

38
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,030
you might do that.

39
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,030
Anyway, traditionally the topic
of the dynamic power equation is

40
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,000
one which mostly hardware and
low level software folks think about.

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,430
But, in the spirit of Danny Hillis's
question, I wanted to get you thinking

42
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,500
about whether there are interesting
algorithmic implications as well.
