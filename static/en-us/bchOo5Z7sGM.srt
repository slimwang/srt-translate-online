1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,469
So I've typed jQuery right here and I'll go ahead and press Enter.

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:05,302
And there it is.

3
00:00:05,302 --> 00:00:09,140
It's just a function that takes in a couple of parameters and returns something.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,960
Incidentally, JavaScript functions are also objects.

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,580
So, the correct answer is that jQuery is a function and it's also an object.

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,450
There's no magic or anything special going on.

7
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:23,880
It's just JavaScript.
