1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
For this problem, we have to order these six graphs by the clustering coefficient of the red node,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and the graphs will be ordered from the lowest clustering coefficient to highest.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Looking at the six graphs, we can see that c is a star network,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and star networks have a clustering coefficient of zero.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That is the lowest clustering coefficient.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You can see that d is a click to the clustering coefficient of one

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
as that will be the highest clustering coefficient.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Both b and f have two edges connecting the neighbors of the red node.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Let's take a look at those two.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Intuitively, since b has seven neighbors and f has five, b has a larger click and f has a smaller click,

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and since they both only have two neighboring edges and b has load larger click,

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and actually calculating the clustering coefficient, we can see that yes, b is smaller than f.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
For a, the degree of the red node is five and there are five links between the neighbors,

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
so we have a clustering coefficient of half and for e degree of the red node is seven,

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and they are seven links between these neighbors, so the clustering coefficient is 1/3.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So, the final answer is c, b, f, e, a, d.
