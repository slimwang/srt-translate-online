1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,390
It's very important to have co-founders,
mainly because as one

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:10,690
person you can fall sick, you can become
frail, you can run out of energy or

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,859
steam, or something can get in
your way as an obstacle and

4
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:18,070
a co-founder can help you
overcome that obstacle.

5
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,070
So where one is strong two are powerful.

6
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,830
Where two are powerful,
three are ultimate.

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,020
It also helps keep things balanced.

8
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:30,360
It's good to have other opinions
that are not just your own.

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,910
I'm not saying sole proprietorship
doesn't work, it just requires

10
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,200
that much more out of you and
sustainability can be a challenge.

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,335
So having a co-founder is a very
good way to have somebody

12
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:50,130
like-minded support the business
in a similar manner to you,

13
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,370
while bringing their own
strengths to the table.

14
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,710
So, for me, the key advantage
to having a co-founder is that

15
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,560
you get to share the load.

16
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,600
You both bring your
strengths to the table and

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,860
you're trading your strengths against
the other person's weaknesses.

18
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,780
And that makes for
a very strong cohesive thing.

19
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,380
Affectively you're marrying this
other person for some period of time

20
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,350
because you're both very committed
to what it is you're trying to build
