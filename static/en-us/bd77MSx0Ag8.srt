00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Congratulations! You've finished something really complex.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You've made your own bar charts, your own histograms, and your own scatter plots.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Isn't this a lot of fun? Isn't statistics really great?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Did you learn that by just looking at data, you can already understand a lot.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So the purpose of this unit was to empower you to instruct the computer to plot data,

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and the reason why I told you this is because the very first step every statistician does

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
is to look at the data if you're given data.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Now on the next unit, I will give you something that'll bend your mind.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I will give you data that depending on how you look at it

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
will get you a very different conclusion.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Stay tuned and check out the next unit where I will bend your mind.
