00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,240
Another percept of the clock radio is the tiny bar on the front that indicates

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,780
the current station. This device is physically controlled by the StationKnob,

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,740
and like the knob, can take an infinite number of positions.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,340
It can be modeled as a single state with no transitions. Now, we would expect

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:22,650
that the StationKnob and the station indicator are coordinated with each other.

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,840
After all, when you turn the knob you would expect the indicator to move.

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,770
And later we'll figure out how, using our state chart modeling notation,

8
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:35,980
we can connect those two, those two concurrent activities together.

9
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,160
But for now we'll just treat them as separate machines.
