1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,010
The first and

2
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:06,160
probably the most popular of Kruchten's five views is the logical view.

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,680
This conveys the structural breakdown of the computational, communicational, and

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,660
behavioral responsibilities of the system.

5
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:18,120
There's lots of ways of conveying logical views.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,560
Probably the most frequently used is a box and arrow diagram.

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,766
We'll see a slide in a second.

8
00:00:22,766 --> 00:00:29,060
You've already encountered some of the UML diagrams

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:33,030
that can be used to convey the logical view, including the class model diagram,

10
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,230
interaction overview, and collaboration diagrams.

11
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,010
And also, we will be seeing the components and

12
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:43,380
connectors that are part of architectural description languages.

13
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,940
Here's a random box and arrow diagram.

14
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:51,280
It contains boxes which indicate the, the the functional components of a system,

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,320
and arrows connecting them indicating some kind of dependency between the boxes.

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,522
Box and arrow diagrams have the benefit of being familiar.

17
00:01:00,522 --> 00:01:04,879
And usually can convey a whole lot about the high-level architecture in terms of

18
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,530
a single slide.

19
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,740
However, they have the disadvantage of being imprecise.

20
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,400
Just what is it that those arrows mean?
