00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay everybody. We are gonna talk about the final exam.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This is basically building on everything you've learned in this class.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's just another cohesive project, and what I'm going to ask you to do is build a wiki.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
For those of you who don't know what a wiki is, I will give you a demo.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It should look something like this. Here's the front page of a wiki.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
A wiki is just a website where any page can be edited.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
For example, if I were to click edit on this page,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
you see the HTML of this page and I can add some text.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Let's add a blank line. So I just added some text in this text box and I click save.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Then we save the page and then it has this text in here.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Now, one of the things that's cool about a wiki or at least in this one that we want you to build is

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
you can go to any URL or in this case /newpage, which doesn't exist yet.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If the URL does not exist, it'll redirect you to another URL.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
In my case, I'm using /_edit and then the page name where you can edit some content in here.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And if you were to click save, it will take you to that URL.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
In my case /newpage with the content and of course you can edit this content.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Let's add a link to the front page.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We just use the anchor tag with an href to slash, which is the front page.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And if we click save, we can see that it renders that HTML I typed as a link.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
If I were to click on this link, it'll take me to the front page, which is a slash.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
W'll go through the specific requirements in the instructor comments, but the important thing--

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
the first thing--is if you type in a URL that doesn't exist, you go to an edit page.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If you type in a URL that does exist, it renders the content of that page,

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and you can edit the content of that page if you want.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Now, I've been logged in this whole time. You should have user accounts integrated in this.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
If I were to click logout here, it keeps me on the same page.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What this did is that it did just like we did in Unit 4.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It cleared my user clear key and just redirected me to the page that I came from.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I can view any page logged out, I can view the front page as well,

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
but I can't edit any pages. See, the edit link is gone.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Now, we can't grade how things look very well, so we're not going to bother doing that,

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
but we will try to submit an edit form while being logged out and that should fail.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Now, I will log back in. Now notice it's the same signup form we've been using all along.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Actually, in the version I'll put online, I'll probably clean this up a little bit before I do that,

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
because it's been bugging me in the code, but this is actually

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
the exact same code I've been using the whole time.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'll log in as my user and you can see now I have a new edit link.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
That's the gist of the main wiki--of course, instead of clicking login,

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I could also click signup to create a new user.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
This is the same form we've been using for this entire class with the errors and whatnot.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
If I were to try to create a user that already exists, I give out that error.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That's why I'm going to sign a different user spez2, click submit, and I'm logged on as spez2.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That is the main task that I'm going to ask you to do. Log in. Log out. You've already done that.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Editing a page. It's basically a simple form submission and some fancy redirecting in there.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Again, in the instructor comments we'll include more specifically how to do that.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
When you have that working, submit the URL here.
