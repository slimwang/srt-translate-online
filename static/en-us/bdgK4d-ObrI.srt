1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,895
Now that we've learned that being clear
about value is really important for

2
00:00:03,895 --> 00:00:05,120
in-app purchases,

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,330
what else can a game developer do
to improve their in-app purchases?

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,820
>> You also want to be clear about
how to use purchases in your game.

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,520
Lots of games use tutorials to
show you how to use new items.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,120
>> When you show a player how
to use an in-app purchase,

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,820
they're much more likely
to use them in the future.

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,930
>> Also, make sure to have
variety in your purchases

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,700
to keep people interested.

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,698
And think about introducing new
items as people play the game.

11
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:33,610
>> So you could introduce a group of
items the first day someone plays

12
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,735
a game and then a different
group of items a week later.

13
00:00:36,735 --> 00:00:40,370
>> Yep, variety is a great way to
keep players interested in your item.

14
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:44,620
And one place, though, you should
avoid variety is your price points.

15
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,800
Most successful games offer between
one and five price points for

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,600
all their in-app purchases.

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,250
>> This goes back to clarity, because
the value for items at each price point

18
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,960
has to be very clear, and
too many options can get confusing.

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,560
>> So to improve your in-app purchases,

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,360
teach players how to use them,
offer variety, and be clear about value.
