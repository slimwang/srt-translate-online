1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,620
Up to this point,
all the apps that we've been building,

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,980
we've assumed there's a,
a perfect network connection.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,130
And we know that we
can't always trust this,

4
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:11,220
in the real world or, networks are flaky
sometimes, sometimes non-existent.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,150
So, I brought Jason in to talk about
what we can do in those situations.

6
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,560
>> Yeah.
Thanks Jared.

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,710
The problem with an app like
the Favorite Movies app,

8
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,640
is we have to fetch everything
every time we use it.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,800
So you think the movie poster's coming
down, you fetch them all to populate

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,410
the table, but then as soon as
the cell scrolls off the bottom and

11
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,160
back up, we don't re-fetch that poster.

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:30,660
>> Mm.
>> Each time.

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,300
>> Right.

14
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,150
>> It'd be nice if we could

15
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,560
take that media and store it onto
the hard drive to make it persistent.

16
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,440
>> So, that's one type of data,
but what will we do with a more

17
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,440
structured data that we have,
the movie structs themselves,

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,390
that contain movie titles and
Other information about movies?

19
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:44,926
>> [CROSSTALK].

20
00:00:44,926 --> 00:00:46,540
>> Yeah, that's no problem.

21
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,250
We, we pull down that JSON.

22
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,250
We punched it into an array of struts.

23
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,240
We can take that entire array and
persist it onto the hard drive in tact.

24
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,540
We can pull it out and
populate the table with it again.

25
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,590
>> Cool, so this is the type
of stuff we'd be learning in

26
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:00,700
the persistence course.

27
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,620
>> Yeah.

28
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,640
Keep in mind you don't need to use any
of this in the On the Map app, but

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,180
it's fun to fetch data
as much as you want.

30
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,550
But in the Persistence course
we'll learn these techniques.

31
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:10,050
>> Oh.
