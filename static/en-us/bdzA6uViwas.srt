1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is commonly 12,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
which is simply we can have 6 state variables,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and in each of those the helicopter might have its own velocity.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So for each of these variables, we have the state variable itself

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and its velocity, which makes a total of 12.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This is completely nontrivial and something you probably can't know.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We just have to learn, but when you think about it, you realize this is the most general case

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
of a vehicle that can move in 3D at every possible location,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
every possible orientation at any velocity.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That's called the dynamic state of a free-flying object.
