1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,500
I'm still a little fuzzy
on this likelihood thing.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,140
Let's jump back to the moon.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,730
Did I tell you about my star sensor?

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,880
I use it to navigate around.

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,370
There are hardly any other landmarks.

6
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,610
When I point it to a region in the sky,
it says, bright star.

7
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,700
That is, if there is a bright
star in that region.

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,870
If I told you that I was looking at
this particular region in the sky,

9
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:27,870
how likely is it that my star sensor
would go off and say bright star?

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,060
Choose the appropriate radio button
underneath on a three point scale.

11
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,580
From least to most likely.

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,690
Now do the same for
these other regions in the sky.

13
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,900
Remember that I'm asking you
to estimate the likelihood P

14
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,070
of bright star given the sky region.
