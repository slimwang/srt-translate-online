00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,768
In another lesson later on we're going to be looking at architectural views.

2
00:00:03,768 --> 00:00:08,189
But to anticipate that I'll just mention that

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,190
architectural description is not just a diagram, it's a set of decisions. And

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:16,950
in fact the, in order to fully communicate that set of decisions,

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:22,340
many diagrams and/or textual documents might be produced. We call

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:27,270
these architectural views. Because the set of decisions may be large, and

7
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:32,880
there may be many different aspects to it, okay? Over the course of time various

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,218
different kinds of diagrams and tables have been developed and found useful and

9
00:00:38,218 --> 00:00:43,100
so we want to be aware of what those are so if you are confronted by a situation

10
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:48,040
where you need to convey some aspects of the architecture, you have you're aware

11
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,030
of the various diagrams and, and textural processes you could apply.
