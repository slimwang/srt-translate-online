1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,969
Since passwords have problems and

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:06,600
we said that's only one of the ways
in which you can do authentication,

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,860
let's look at some of the other ways
in which authentication can be done.

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,471
So the second one was
something you have.

5
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:15,840
So a token or a smart card or
something like that,

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,060
obviously if it some thing you have,
then you must have it on them.

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:23,861
If you don't have your token or your
smart card or your smartphone, if that's

8
00:00:23,861 --> 00:00:28,682
been used as the something you have,
you can't obviously access the system.

9
00:00:28,682 --> 00:00:31,088
And people sometimes
forget these things and

10
00:00:31,088 --> 00:00:34,693
don't have them on them when they
need to access especially banks,

11
00:00:34,693 --> 00:00:38,690
when they give you these tokens or send
you some sort of a code through them.

12
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,040
If you don't have that with you,

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,400
you're not going to be able
to access your account.

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,300
So, not having them
would cause a problem.

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,330
So you do have to have them that that's
one of the requirements when you

16
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,286
use this method.

17
00:00:50,286 --> 00:00:50,884
So obviously,

18
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:55,530
if it's something that you must have, it
should be able to talk to the system, or

19
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,130
the human has to enter the PIN or
whatever code that is sent to them.

20
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:04,330
But if it's a smart card, the smart
card has to talk to the system,

21
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,960
which requires you have to
have a reader, for example.

22
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,370
You should be able to
swipe the smart card and

23
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,760
it should be able to communicate.

24
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,150
So that adds the hardware
requirement which increases cost.

25
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,790
Even if you have it at the other
end they should have a reader.

26
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,010
If they don't have it then you
can't use it with that system.

27
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:25,310
How is authentication implemented
with something you have?

28
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,580
If you have a smart card
we were just talking about,

29
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,130
then it can talk to the system,

30
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,670
then there could be some sort of
challenge/response kind of a thing.

31
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,070
So the system can say, if you really
belong to the user that is being

32
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,930
claimed, or claim is being made about
the identity of a certain user then

33
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,430
that user's smart card
has a certain secret.

34
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:50,740
Use that secret to sort of maybe
respond to my challenge, encrypt it or

35
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,170
something like that, or
do something to this challenge.

36
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,000
And the response should demonstrate
that the secret that is stored

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,080
in this smart card is the one that
is used to generate the response.

38
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,580
So, sometimes, if you have some
processing this smart card.

39
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,020
Smart card can do this
sort of computation,

40
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,538
generate a response that could be sent.

41
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:13,490
So this PIN and chip kind of cards,
the chip can do this kind of work, and

42
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,600
that's how this would we implemented.

43
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,960
The problem with this is that
there is added cost, and

44
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,360
of course sometimes there could be
misplaced trust in this kind of

45
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,330
tokens or cards that we're talking
about for something you have.

46
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:32,630
There's of course the very well
known case of the RSA breach,

47
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,810
where the master key was compromised.

48
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,220
And as a result of that,

49
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,920
all the SecureID tokens that RSA
stronger authentication relied on,

50
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,710
you couldn't count on doing correct
authentication using those.

51
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:50,460
So there's added cost we are talking
about but there's also vulnerabilities

52
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,990
or attacks that can limit
the strength that authentication,

53
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,230
the stronger authentication that
these kind of tokens provide.

54
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,180
So, something you have,
you don't need to remember those complex

55
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,120
passwords we're talking about, but
we need to be aware of the fact, and

56
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,090
that they have their
own set of problems.
