1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,810
So, these two points where x intercepts at 2, 0 and negative 2, 0. And these

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:12,950
two points are the y intercepts. They're at 0, 3 and 0, negative 3. Now we can

3
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:18,168
connect these points with a smooth curve and then we'll have our ellipse. So,

4
00:00:18,168 --> 00:00:22,326
for our circle, we had equal amounts of x squared and y squared and our radius

5
00:00:22,326 --> 00:00:27,061
was 6. So, we started from the center and we moved 6 units left and right and

6
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:32,470
up and down to graph that circle. Now, for our ellipse, we're going to move two

7
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:37,698
units left and right in the x direction. And three units up and down in the Y

8
00:00:37,698 --> 00:00:42,860
direction. These two points are the X intercepts, and these two points are our

9
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:47,732
Y intercepts. Now, there's an easier way to graph this ellipse than finding the

10
00:00:47,732 --> 00:00:52,321
X intercepts and Y intercepts. Remember that this equation is the same as this

11
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:57,034
equation, so let's graph this one instead. I'm going to get rid of this

12
00:00:57,034 --> 00:01:00,206
equation first and now I'm going to write this equivalent equation in its

13
00:01:00,206 --> 00:01:07,370
place. We'll have x squared divided by 4 plus y squared divided by 9 equals 1.

14
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:12,736
And remember that we're basing this equation on the Pythagorean Theorem. So we

15
00:01:12,736 --> 00:01:18,840
can really think of 4 as 2 squared and we can really think of 9 as 3 squared.

16
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,730
We could have graphed this ellipse by looking at these two numbers. The squared

17
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:28,082
number underneath the X squared term tells us to move two units left and right

18
00:01:28,082 --> 00:01:32,635
from the center. So, since this is a two squared, we move two units to the

19
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:37,294
right from the center, and two units left from the center. The squared number

20
00:01:37,294 --> 00:01:41,572
under the Y squared term tells us to move three units up and three units down

21
00:01:41,572 --> 00:01:47,024
from the center. This gives us a same four points and we are able to graph our

22
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:51,397
ellipse. In general this is the equation we use for an ellipse, centered at the

23
00:01:51,397 --> 00:01:55,880
origin. Notice that there is no number added or subtracted to the x or to the

24
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:02,040
y. So, the center would be at 0, 0. Now what I have gone ahead and done is

25
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,808
added this equation into decimals/g. And I've created sliders, or adjustments,

26
00:02:06,808 --> 00:02:11,230
for the values of a and the values of b. Notice that if a and b are both 1, we

27
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:16,572
get a circle centered at the origin. This is the idea that we'll have equal

28
00:02:16,572 --> 00:02:21,850
amounts of x squared and y squared, and the radius would just be 1. Now, if I

29
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:26,730
increase a, we stretch in the x direction 1 unit to the left and 1 unit to the

30
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:32,100
right. This gives me an ellipse since I have more X squared than I do Y

31
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:38,227
squared. And, we could keep stretching our ellipse. We could have an A value of

32
00:02:38,227 --> 00:02:43,420
3, an A value of 4, or an A value of 5. Since the A value is underneath the X

33
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,687
squared term, that's the direction it stretches in. In order to stretch the

34
00:02:47,687 --> 00:02:53,302
ellipse vertically up and down, we want to adjust the b value. We can make the

35
00:02:53,302 --> 00:02:59,162
b value be 2, or 3, or even 4. And notice that if we bring it up all the way up

36
00:02:59,162 --> 00:03:03,580
to 5, again we'll have a perfect circle. Since we have even amounts of X

37
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,489
squared and Y squared. This is why it's helpful to identify the A value and the

38
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:13,216
B value to graph an ellipse. The A value tells us how far we should move from

39
00:03:13,216 --> 00:03:16,807
the center left and right, and the B value tells us how far we should move from

40
00:03:16,807 --> 00:03:19,830
the center up and down.
