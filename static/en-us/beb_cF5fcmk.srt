00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
One easy way to recover the depth with 3D vision is called Stereo.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Humans use stereo all the time.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We have two eyes--eye 1 and eye 2--

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and these eyes have a so-called displacement,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
which just means that one eye is further left than the other eye.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We're looking at the scene from slightly different angles.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Humans can actually recover the depth of the scene

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
in many situations where objects are nearby.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's look at this in more detail.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
In stereo vision, we're given two cameras--usually both with identical focal length.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Here are the pinholes, and here are the image planes.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
An object in the scene is being seen by both cameras.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
If I draw the optical axes over there,

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
which are the axes orthogonal to the image planes that go through the pinholes,

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
you will see that the projection of this point depends on the displacement,

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
or the baseline, of the so-called stereo rig.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Clearly, these two images see the point at a different angle,

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and it reflects itself by different coordinates

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
where this point is being projected onto the image plane.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The idea of stereo is to screen objects and use the displacement,

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
often called "paralax," of those two different projections to estimate

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
the depth or the range of the object.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me just ask a simple quiz about stereo.
