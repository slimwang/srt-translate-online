00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's now work with a different data set. We write 2, 5, 8 for y, which gives us the mean for y.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Before doing any calculations, let's take a guess what r might be.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Is r is going to be 1, r going to be 3, r going to be 2, or is r going to be 0.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check one of these boxes over here.
