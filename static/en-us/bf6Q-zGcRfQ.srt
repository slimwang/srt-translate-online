1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:05,470
So the answer is, at this point, x references the object 3 which is an integer.

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:10,489
So it has type int. After the next assignment, now x references the string,

3
00:00:10,489 --> 00:00:14,836
hello udacious one, which has type str. At this point, while we're inside the

4
00:00:14,836 --> 00:00:19,252
definition of the function double, double takes a parameter named x. Note that

5
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:23,998
this is a different x from that x. This x is defined inside the body of the

6
00:00:23,998 --> 00:00:28,740
double procedure. This one is visible outside it. We don't actually know what

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,126
object this x references yet. It doesn't reference as an object until we call

8
00:00:33,126 --> 00:00:37,672
double and pass in a value. So its value is actually unknown. So at this point,

9
00:00:37,672 --> 00:00:41,820
the object x with references unknown and the type of x is also unknown, but

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,098
importantly, this is a different x from that one. The type of that x is still

11
00:00:47,098 --> 00:00:52,345
type str. After the last assignment and I didn't make this part of the quiz, the

12
00:00:52,345 --> 00:00:56,815
type of x is now type function. And the point of this quiz is to illustrate that

13
00:00:56,815 --> 00:01:01,076
Pythons types are dynamic. And the real emphasis of that is the fact that the

14
00:01:01,076 --> 00:01:05,492
type of x at this point could be unknown. We can define a function, have a

15
00:01:05,492 --> 00:01:09,573
variable named x. It doesn't have a type until it's associated with an object.
