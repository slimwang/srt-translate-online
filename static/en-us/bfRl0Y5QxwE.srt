1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:01,662
So we have all our bands.

2
00:00:01,662 --> 00:00:01,782
>> Yup

3
00:00:01,782 --> 00:00:03,980
>> And I want to start putting them on

4
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,390
stages. They have to, they have to play.

5
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:05,930
>> Right.

6
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:09,760
>> Right. So I'm going to go into these records. Okay, so here's

7
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,290
the band, and the stage field is blank, as is set time.

8
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,242
>> Yep. And let's say we want to play, they're

9
00:00:18,242 --> 00:00:22,670
going to play at what, 10 a.m., at stage four stage.

10
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:22,870
>> Okay.

11
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,780
>> Okay, so that's good.

12
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,990
but what if I actually wanted them to play at

13
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,520
two different set time? Like, you know, one at 10:00 a.m.,

14
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,730
and maybe again at 11:00 or maybe at a totally different

15
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,890
stage? Is there a way to do that? It feels like

16
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,400
I would have to create an entirely new band or something,

17
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,390
a new record. That's turning a relationship into something a little

18
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,630
bit more complicated than just a simple one to many. So,

19
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,150
let me actually show you on the tablet what I mean.

20
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:47,460
>> Okay.

21
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,910
>> We're starting off with, we have our stage records.

22
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,670
And I'm only representing it as one stage box, but this could be any of the

23
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:02,830
stages that we have. And then each of these stages has a specific time we can

24
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:09,007
book them for. So like, 10 a.m., 11 a.m., 12 p.m., etcetera.

25
00:01:09,007 --> 00:01:09,902
>> Sure

26
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:13,760
>> And then, for each of these time slots, you could have any sort of band

27
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,194
playing there. So, let's say we had you know, our first band playing at 10 a.m.,

28
00:01:19,194 --> 00:01:23,400
but then for your second band, you want them playing at 11 and 12.

29
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,930
>> Oh, okay. Yeah, you're right, this

30
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,460
is getting more complicated as a data model.

31
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:32,580
>> So this is clearly not how we represent something in sales force.

32
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:32,930
>> Right.

33
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,110
>> Instead of now having a one to

34
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,940
many relationship, we have a many to many relationship.

35
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,940
Where a stage can have many bands But bands

36
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,310
can be playing at multiple stages at many times.

37
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:43,720
>> Right.

38
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,280
>> We're no

39
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,070
longer tracking you know, what stage are the bands playing at, but it's more-so

40
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,820
what time are they playing at those

41
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,780
stages. Because now there's another unique classification there.

42
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,000
>> Mm. So we've added this sort of like intermediate object.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,840
>> Exactly.

44
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,980
>> And what we'd call that intermediate object in

45
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,210
Salesforce is a junction object And what a junction

46
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:06,220
object does is it represents every unique instance that

47
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,660
we relate a band record to a stage record.

48
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,870
>> Okay, that makes sense.

49
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,110
But what would, this isn't how we draw our scheme

50
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,250
in SalesForce, so, what would this actually look like in SalesForce?

51
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,150
>> Right. Before, we had just stages and bands.

52
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:22,840
>> Right. And the relationship had that little

53
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,450
line with the three forks at the end.

54
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,896
>> Right, our stage had many bands. But now, we

55
00:02:28,896 --> 00:02:33,600
have stages, bands and this junction object called Set Time.

56
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,760
>> Okay.

57
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:34,890
>> How do

58
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,330
you think that this relationship will look, when mapping it out?
