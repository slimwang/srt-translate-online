00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,766
We've been using the word set to describe
these different groups of numbers and

2
00:00:04,766 --> 00:00:11,144
that's exactly what a set is, a collection
of numbers. So, the natural numbers is the

3
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:19,367
set 1,2,3 and so forth. And the whole
numbers is the set 0, 1, 2, 3 and so

4
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:27,313
forth. And we might represent the set of
integers like this with ellipses on both

5
00:00:27,313 --> 00:00:33,278
ends to represent going on to infinity. We
usually denote sets with these curly

6
00:00:33,278 --> 00:00:38,048
braces around the numbers and commas
between the numbers we give certain sets.

7
00:00:38,048 --> 00:00:42,355
Like the ones we've talked about special
names. But really a set can be made up of

8
00:00:42,355 --> 00:00:47,604
any numbers that we put together for
whatever reason. So for example, this set

9
00:00:47,604 --> 00:01:02,428
-4, 7, 19 is a set. And so is -38, 56,
100.5. As is 9. Now, since all of the

10
00:01:02,428 --> 00:01:06,834
numbers in the set of natural numbers are
also in the set of whole numbers, we call

11
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:12,258
the natural numbers a subset of the whole
numbers. A subset of a set, is another set

12
00:01:12,258 --> 00:01:18,419
of numbers that are all contained in the
original set. So its a little bit of

13
00:01:18,419 --> 00:01:23,006
practice to make sure you understand what
sets and subsets are. Here's a random set

14
00:01:23,006 --> 00:01:34,182
of numbers, -4 -3, 0, 0.6, 1, 5, and 8. Which
of the choices below are subsets of the

15
00:01:34,182 --> 00:01:37,370
set? You may pick more than one answer.
