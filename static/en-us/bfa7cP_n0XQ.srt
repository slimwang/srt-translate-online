1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,810
The navigation controller works
especially well when combined

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:03,880
with the table.

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,960
This arrow accessory on the right
of the table view cell is a common

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,100
UI component.

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,440
It's standard to
the master detail pattern.

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,165
So what governs the appearance
of this detail view?

7
00:00:14,525 --> 00:00:17,955
Here in the UITableViewDelegate
protocol, you see the method

8
00:00:17,955 --> 00:00:22,015
didSelectRowAtIndexPath which we
talked about in the previous lesson.

9
00:00:22,015 --> 00:00:24,815
When a table row is selected we
want to show the details for

10
00:00:24,815 --> 00:00:26,385
the selected object.

11
00:00:26,385 --> 00:00:28,975
So we use the method
didSelectRowAtIndexPath

12
00:00:28,975 --> 00:00:32,549
to push the detail view controller
on to the navigation stack.

13
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:35,880
One of the following code snippets
was copied from the next iteration

14
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,820
of the Bond villain's app.

15
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,470
Which looks like the right way to
push a detail view controller?
