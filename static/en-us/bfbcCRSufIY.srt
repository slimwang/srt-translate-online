00:00:03,819 --> 00:00:08,434
fact, the coolest part about 3D printing and the things that I think is the most

00:00:08,434 --> 00:00:12,836
untapped source of 3D printing is that you can really make anything with 3D

00:00:12,836 --> 00:00:19,217
prints. So we can get way beyond what we used to do, or take as manufacturing, I

guess you'd call them design constraints. Where, those, one of those design

00:00:24,351 --> 00:00:28,566
constraints is now leaving. So we can really get into what does good design
