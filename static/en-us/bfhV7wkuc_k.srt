00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,700
Let's take a sneak peek
into the future and

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,040
see the final version of the app that
you'll be building with Firebase.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,820
Meet the Friendly Chat app.

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,470
Friendly Chat, as the name implies,

5
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,950
is a chat app that lets
you chat with friends.

6
00:00:11,949 --> 00:00:16,088
And you can do so in real time with
text messages and uploaded pictures.

7
00:00:16,088 --> 00:00:18,389
When you first open the app,
you will see this screen,

8
00:00:18,388 --> 00:00:20,039
which is a login screen.

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,219
And can login with both Google and
with your email.

10
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:26,089
I'm going to go ahead and
sign in with my email.

11
00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:29,109
Once signed in, you can view all
the chat messages that have been sent,

12
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:31,989
even messages that were sent
when the app was closed.

13
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:34,089
You could even respond to a message.

14
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,360
And that response could be text
like this one, or a picture.

15
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:39,380
And one of the messages for

16
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,210
the app, my friend who is also using
the app gets the message in real time.

17
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:43,800
Cool right?
