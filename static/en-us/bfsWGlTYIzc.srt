00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,440
Assume we are using the Anderson's
queueing spinlock implementation

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,730
where each array element can have
one of two values: has-lock, and

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,210
let's say that's zero, and must-wait,
let's say we use one for that.

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,660
Now if a system has 32 CPUs,

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,780
how large is the array data structure
that's used in the queueing spinlock?

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,680
Your choices are 32 bits,
32 bytes or neither.

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,790
Choose the correct answer.
