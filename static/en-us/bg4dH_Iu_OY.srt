1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,480
So we talked about a number
of commercial policies.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,570
For example, a Clark-Wilson and
Chinese Wall.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:07,939
So here we have a scenario.

4
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:11,870
In this quiz, we have a scenario
where there's a law firm that has

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,710
two different client companies.

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,340
And the interesting thing about
these client companies is that they

7
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,200
compete with each other.

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,300
And lawyers work on cases
related to many companies.

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,080
So some of them work on company A,
others work on company B, or

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,940
whatever it is.

11
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,870
And they need to access the documents.

12
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:33,470
So to ensure proper access, in this
case, which policy should you be using?

13
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,990
That is the quiz question.

14
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,910
The two options are Clark-Wilson and
Chinese Wall.
