00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
For this question, your goal is to implement cipher block chaining.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We've provided some code in the ID to get you started on this.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Here's the function we want you to write.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The inputs will be plaintext, which is just an array of bytes that needs to be encoded,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
key, which will be a bytes array to be used as the key for the block encoder,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
the initialization vector, the block size, and the block encoder.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
To reinforce the idea of a block box encoder,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I've written 3 examples.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The first 2, non_encoder and xor_encoder,

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
are silly toy encoders, and the last one, aes_encoder,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
uses the pycrypto implementation of aes.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Your code should work with all 3 of these encoders.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Finally, there is a test function which you can use to test your implementation.
