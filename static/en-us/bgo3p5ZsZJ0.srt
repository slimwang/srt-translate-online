1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
The speedup here is traumatic, just because we write the square root here.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:15,290
It's over a trillion and the reason is that 2⁵⁰ is about 10¹⁵ whereas 2^√⁵⁰, so the ^√⁵⁰ is about 7,

3
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:20,390
2^√ is about 134.

4
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:26,320
You have 100 and 34 versus 10¹⁵, which is a speedup of over a trillion,

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,560
and we're still within the laws of NP completeness using this function here.

6
00:00:30,560 --> 99:59:59,999
We can call this loophole 1 in the laws of NP completeness.
