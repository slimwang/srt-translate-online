1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:07,154
This parabola has a vertex at 1, 2. Excellent work if you figured it out. We

2
00:00:07,154 --> 00:00:12,074
want to start by factoring a negative 3 from these first two terms so we'll

3
00:00:12,074 --> 00:00:17,970
have negative 3 times x squared minus 2x. We'll leave a space in order to

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,821
complete the square and then we'll have negative 1 on the end. The b value is

5
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:27,229
negative 2 here. So, we need to add b over 2 squared in order to complete the

6
00:00:27,229 --> 00:00:33,650
square. B divided by 2 equals negative 1, and this number squared is positive

7
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:40,214
1. This means, we add 1 in order to have a perfect square here. But, we really

8
00:00:40,214 --> 00:00:46,862
just didn't add 1 here, we really subtracted 3. We'll have negative 3x squared

9
00:00:46,862 --> 00:00:53,719
here, positive 6x here. And negative 3 here. So, in order to make our equation

10
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:58,096
balanced, we'll have to do the opposite of negative 3. We'll have to add 3 to

11
00:00:58,096 --> 00:01:04,495
the same side of the equation. This is so that we really add 0. We don't want

12
00:01:04,495 --> 00:01:08,590
to change our equation, we really just want to leave it balanced. We can

13
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:13,426
rewrite this as a perfect square, writing x minus 1 squared to replace this

14
00:01:13,426 --> 00:01:18,529
trinomial. The factor of negative 3 stays in front, and then we combine

15
00:01:18,529 --> 00:01:24,340
negative 1 and positive 3 to get positive 2. This is our equation in vertex

16
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:31,745
form. And we can see that the vertex is h, k. Positive 1 and positive 2. Keep

17
00:01:31,745 --> 00:01:35,210
in mind the y value were equal to 2, then that means that this entire

18
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:41,646
expression would have to equal zero. Which means the binomial x minus 1 must

19
00:01:41,646 --> 00:01:48,330
equal 0. So, we set it equal to 0, which means x would have to equal 1. That's

20
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:52,975
the x coordinate of our vertex. So, we have this for our vertex, and then we

21
00:01:52,975 --> 00:01:56,818
can get two other points by moving one left and one right of the vertex, and

22
00:01:56,818 --> 00:02:04,041
then three units down. We can see that more clearly here. One unit left and one

23
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:10,166
unit right, and then three units down. That's our a value. So, we have the

24
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:15,485
points 0, negative 1 on our parabola, and we have the point 2, negative 1. And,

25
00:02:15,485 --> 00:02:21,513
notice that these y coordinates are three units less than our vertex.
