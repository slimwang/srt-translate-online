1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is 8.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's go through it together to see why.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Sentence only has one re-write rule.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
These are sometimes called "production rules" as well.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Only one production rule. Only one thing to do with it.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We're always going to get started with optional adjective followed by subject

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
followed by verb.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This could go to accurate or nothing.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The subject could go to William or Tell.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The verbs could go to shoots or bows.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We have two choices here, two choices in the middle, and two choices at the end.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
When we multiply that out, we get eight possibilities--

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
accurate William shoots, accurate William bows, accurate Tell shoots,

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
accurate Tell bows, William shoots, William bows,

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Tell shoots, Tell bows--eight possibilities in total.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
William Tell was a 15th century Swiss folk her.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Famously, he did not bow.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
He was requested to bow to the hat of a city leader or some such.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
In exchange, he was asked to shoot--or offered to shoot--the apple off of his son's head,

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
using a crossbow. This is not a crossbow.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
At least two of the sentences above--William Bows, Tell bows,

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
accurate William bows, accurate Tell bows--four of them didn't happen

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
as far as the story goes.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Even if you're not familiar with this story, you may have heard the overture.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It's actually quite a bit of fun.
