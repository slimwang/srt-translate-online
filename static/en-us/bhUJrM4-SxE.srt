Congratulations, you finished the first lesson. In the problem set you'll

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,990
get a chance to practice what you just learned. Don't forget

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,630
to go to the discussion forum in case you have questions.

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,660
Or maybe you just want to chat. In the next lesson, we'll

00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,260
flesh out our data model, and represent more of the complexity

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,340
of a music festival. In doing this, we'll learn about different

00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,840
types of relationships that Salesforce provides. We'll start thinking about how

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,540
to play around the layout of our app. See you then.
