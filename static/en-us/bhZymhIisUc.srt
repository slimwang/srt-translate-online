1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,469
So how do we transform our
code to something that

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:06,350
actually allows us to load
different icon packs?

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,140
A lot less than you might think.

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,150
In fact, because all of our logic for

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:14,610
retrieving a URL from a weather
condition ID is in our utility method,

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,490
we actually don't need to touch any of
our fragments or notification code.

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,620
Kind of like we planned it that way, hm.

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,210
>> We will have to update our
setting screen, though, adding a new

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,290
list preference to allow users to
select which icon pack they want.

10
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,292
If you remember back to our
temperature units list,

11
00:00:33,292 --> 00:00:35,318
preference is driven by two arrays.

12
00:00:35,318 --> 00:00:38,768
One for the options the users sees,
and the other for the values,

13
00:00:38,768 --> 00:00:42,760
what actually gets written in
to the shared preferences.

14
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,840
We'll use our URL templates for
the values.

15
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,500
Just need to replace our single
URL string with our options and

16
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,250
values string arrays,
wire up the list preference,

17
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,690
then do that last piece of magic.

18
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:01,300
Update our utility method to read the
URL template from shared preferences.

19
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,120
Sounds easy enough?
