00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,620
So next, I will attempt to make my program wait for a certain period of time.

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,610
To find about this, I went back to

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:11,890
Google, and then typed python make my program wait.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,100
One of the first links there was this

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,670
website called stackoverflow.com. Now this will soon become

6
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,490
one of your favorite websites as a programmer.

7
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,830
it suggested to use something called time.sleep which suspends

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,670
the program for a given number of seconds. Okay, back to the program. Now since

9
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:35,345
I'm still in testing phase I will try to suspend the program only for about ten

10
00:00:35,345 --> 00:00:39,900
seconds; we can change this number later. I also know that I have to import the

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:45,930
time module. Okay, let's save this and run. Alright.

12
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,001
It seems like the program is waiting for a few seconds before it

13
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:56,752
opens the web browser.

00:00:56,752 --> 00:00:59,660

15
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,170

16
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:08,580
Another item bites the dust.
