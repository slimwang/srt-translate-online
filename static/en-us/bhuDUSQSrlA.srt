The next question on this homework is to implement login.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let me give you a demo of what this is going to look like.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I am at this URL\login.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
After doing the register portion of this homework, the first part, this is going to be very simple.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Basically, it's a similar form to the registration except it only has a username and password.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If you type in a valid username and password and hit submit,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
it redirects you to the welcome page.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It sets the cookie, and it takes you to the welcome page.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If you were to type in an invalid password or a username that doesn't exist,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
you get an error message that says invalid login.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Only when you type in a valid username and password do you get redirected

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
to the welcome page. Mm-kay? Cool.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This welcome page has the same cookie that I had before.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That gets set on a successful login.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
When you have this working, submit the URL here. Good luck with this one.
