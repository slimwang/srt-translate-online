1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:01,620
All right you're done.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,130
Let me show you how I solve this one.

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:10,980
Alright, let's first take a look at
sw600dp dash port activity main.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,480
In other words, this is the layout
our portrait tablet is going to use.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,140
Now as I said we're going to
start with a relative layout.

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,680
Inside the relative layout
we begin with a toolbar.

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,870
Which is pinned to the parent top.

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,730
And is the width of the parent.

9
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,790
Also it is height action bar size.

10
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,060
Pretty reasonable.

11
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,930
Notice that we have an elevation
of appbar_elevation.

12
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,050
All of these in this draw
are going to have the same elevation,

13
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,100
so they don't cast
shadows on each other.

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,260
The next thing we do is
we have an image view.

15
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:42,470
The ImageView is below our toolbar and
it's a listPreferredItemHeight.

16
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,280
Pretty straight forward.

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,770
We center it, give it the elevation.

18
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,130
Finally we have just a View.

19
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:54,100
This View also has the same elevation
with the same background color, and

20
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,290
it's below the image view.

21
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,720
And its height is this
details_app_bar_overlap dimension

22
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,940
which we know is 24 dp.

23
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:05,330
so now if want our detail
container to overlap this view

24
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:09,310
all we have to do is say,
instead of it being below this view,

25
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,550
we say it is layout below
the image view, which is here.

26
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:15,090
That will cause it to overlap, and

27
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,500
we inset it exactly the way
we've inset everything else.

28
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,530
We use paddingLeft and

29
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,390
paddingRight in this case on inset
material which is of course 16dp.

30
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,940
Finally, we can put
our forecast fragment

31
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,790
just below that detail container.

32
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:29,730
Pretty straightforward.
