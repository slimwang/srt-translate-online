1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,510
Okay, this is fairly straightforward.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:06,570
Let's use the index to tally
page counts for each test word.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:11,790
For instance,
gong appears in pages two and four.

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,690
Fly is in one and three, okay?

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:15,790
We're even.

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:21,000
Pepper is in one and
two, and one and four.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,630
Oh, and shoe is in one and three.

8
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,980
Clearly, the winner is one.

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,130
This is a very simple and
naive bag-of-words approach.

10
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,578
But sometimes it works pretty well.

11
00:00:32,578 --> 00:00:36,070
For more realistic cases, you might
have to do something slightly more

12
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,670
complicated, like matching
word distribution histograms.

13
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,190
But the central idea remains the same
for both text as well as visual words.
