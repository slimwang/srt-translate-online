1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:04,948
So here's, here's one way of kind of combining the things that we eventually got

2
00:00:04,948 --> 00:00:10,550
around to with, with Jared. Given is a vector of integers named X. Produced is

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:16,024
a vector of integers named Y. The output vector Y must be ordered, in order,

4
00:00:16,024 --> 00:00:21,450
okay? And the contents of Y must be somehow the same as. The contents of X.

5
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,430
That is everything in X must be in Y, everything in Y must come from X, and

6
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,000
the number of occurrences of each item in Y must be the same as the number of

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,330
occurrences of each item in X. Even that seems a little a little long and

8
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,760
so we'd like to now take this same problem and

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,970
see what it looks like when we express it in a precise mathematical notation.
