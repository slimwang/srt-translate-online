00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,582
When evaluating expressions, it's important that we use parentheses. I didn't

2
00:00:03,582 --> 00:00:06,480
use parentheses on that last quiz, because I only had two variables, and one

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,394
operation between them. But we should always use parentheses when replacing

4
00:00:10,394 --> 00:00:14,782
variables. Here's why. Here's an expression of triangles and circles. One thing

5
00:00:14,782 --> 00:00:17,918
that we want to be careful about, is what's the operation between symbols and

6
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:22,551
numbers? Well, we assume that there's multiplication between variables, or

7
00:00:22,551 --> 00:00:26,008
symbols, and numbers. We don't often show it in algebra, but we want to make

8
00:00:26,008 --> 00:00:29,436
sure that we always include that there. We'll see other examples of this later

9
00:00:29,436 --> 00:00:32,607
throughout the course. I'm going to assign a value of the triangles to be

10
00:00:32,607 --> 00:00:36,312
negative 1. And I'm going to assign the values of the circles to be 3. We

11
00:00:36,312 --> 00:00:40,920
want to use parenthesis when we replace variables because of negative sign.

12
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,014
Here's what it would look like. I would have 3 times negative 1, because the

13
00:00:44,014 --> 00:00:48,408
triangle is negative 1. Then times 3, because a circle is 3 plus 4 times

14
00:00:48,408 --> 00:00:53,890
negative 1 again for the triangle. And it's squared. And then times 3, for the

15
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:59,259
circle. And on the end, I would have minus negative 1. To the third. Here, this

16
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:02,938
circle is really an exponent. So I have 3 times negative 1 times 3, which is

17
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:08,621
negative 9. I know negative 1 squared is negative 1 times negative 1. Negative

18
00:01:08,621 --> 00:01:15,216
1 times negative 1 is just positive 1. So I have negative 9, then plus, and

19
00:01:15,216 --> 00:01:19,735
then I have 4 times 1 times 3, which is 12. Now, on this end part here, I have

20
00:01:19,735 --> 00:01:23,952
to do negative 1 cubed first. I know powers come first. I've rewritten the

21
00:01:23,952 --> 00:01:27,315
statement over here, so now negative 1 cubed is really negative 1 times

22
00:01:27,315 --> 00:01:31,927
negative 1 times negative 1. I know three negative 1s make up negative 1, the

23
00:01:31,927 --> 00:01:36,476
first two would be positive 1, then I'd make it negative. So I have negative 9

24
00:01:36,476 --> 00:01:41,840
plus 12, subtracting a negative is really adding a positive. Negative nine plus

25
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,762
12 is three, plus one, is four. When I plug in the value of negative one for my

26
00:01:45,762 --> 00:01:48,476
triangles, and when I plug in the value of three for the circles, I get an

27
00:01:48,476 --> 00:01:50,450
answer of four.
