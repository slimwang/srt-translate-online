1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,460
To get started,
let's create a disc folder

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,670
that holds all generated files
separate form the source files.

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,810
This wasn't a problem with sass as we
generated the CSS into a separate high

4
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:12,699
level CSS folder.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,100
But it would be with JavaScript
because we don't want our source and

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,630
distribution files to co-mingle.

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,680
The process is pretty simple.

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,333
We first copy our index.html
into the dist folder,

9
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:29,928
then generate our css into dist css, and

10
00:00:29,928 --> 00:00:35,444
finally generate our combined
JavaScript file into dist JS.

11
00:00:35,444 --> 00:00:37,724
Since we've already got our CSS set up,

12
00:00:37,724 --> 00:00:41,340
let's change what's needed
in our styles task.

13
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,890
Here's our styles task
in the grunt file.

14
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,000
And we can see our destination is
set to just the CSS directory.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,210
To make it show up under
this dist directory here,

16
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:56,860
we just changed
the destination to dist/css.

17
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,800
And, when we run gulp styles, we can see
that the files have been generated and

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,990
dropped in the correct folder.

19
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,630
Next, let's copy the index.html
in images to the dist folder.

20
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,270
We simply set up two new tasks and

21
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,056
call them something like copy-html and
copy-images.

22
00:01:15,056 --> 00:01:19,923
In the copy-html task,
we grab the index.html file

23
00:01:19,923 --> 00:01:24,606
with gulp.src and just pipe it to
the destination in the dist folder.

24
00:01:24,606 --> 00:01:29,600
For the copy-images task, we do
the same thing, but instead of copying

25
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,530
a file or grabbing a locator to a file,
we're grabbing all the files

26
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,360
in a specific directory in piping
them to our new destination location.

27
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,890
You'll want to set up a new gulp.watch

28
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,560
next to the others that watches
the original index file.

29
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,470
You could do the same with the images,
but they don't change that often.

30
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,900
And don't forget to add the two
new tasks to the array that's

31
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,550
passed as part of the default task,

32
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:59,500
otherwise the files don't get copied
over the first time we run gulp.

33
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,360
Just a final fix before we can see our
page run again minus the Java Script

34
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,000
which will come in a bit.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,770
You'll need to modify
the browserSync.init function call and

36
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,550
make it point to the dist directory,
now I've already done this for you.
