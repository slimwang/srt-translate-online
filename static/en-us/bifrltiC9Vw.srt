00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,654
The length of the box, since it's folded up, would be 7 minus 2x inches. Since

2
00:00:05,654 --> 00:00:11,670
the initial length is 7 inches, and then from each corner, we take out x, we're

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:17,403
taking 7 minus x minus x, which is just equal to 7 minus 2x. So, that means our

4
00:00:17,403 --> 00:00:19,878
new l for the box is just 7 minus 2x.
