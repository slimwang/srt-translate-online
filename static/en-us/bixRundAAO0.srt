1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,130
So here is an example of video
that actually has been tested for

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:03,870
these kinds of things.

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,720
I'm just showing example, so this is the
first at one of the earlier attempts at

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,690
trying to do rolling shutter removal,
so this was the original video they had.

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,930
This is known as the helicopter
data and, of course,

6
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,520
you notice lots of non-rigid warps.

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,350
So this is our original footage that we
want to actually start playing around

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,550
with, see a lot of non-rigid
deformations everywhere.

9
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:27,180
So when we applied the first system, the
one basically found a crop window, and

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,860
tried to do this as a global shutter

11
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,580
we also could not actually
stabilize it very well.

12
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,280
We see a lot of non-rigid
warping going on.

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,570
So what we basically have to do
is go back to drawing board and

14
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,300
start thinking about how
we can actually do this

15
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,540
knowing a little bit more about
how a rolling shutter works.

16
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,760
Not going to go into a lot
of detail right now.

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,060
I'm just going to kind of say is what
we basically did was we actually

18
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:53,830
took the whole image and
kind of dissected it into small regions.

19
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,470
Almost the scan rates that are coming
down as I move the camera, and

20
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,330
applied the same kinds of processing
of computing the homography and

21
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,900
all of that for different regions and
different slices itself and

22
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,280
used that to figure out, what is the
likelihood of this region moving here.

23
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,030
Use that as an estimate, and then,

24
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:15,470
of course, unwarp it, knowing more about
how each and every region would move.

25
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,533
So, the problem we had was we didn't
know exactly what the readout dor each

26
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:20,870
and every camera was.

27
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:25,602
We basically kind of said is, well,
let's look at multiple motion models.

28
00:01:25,602 --> 00:01:28,790
So I basically had a different motion
model for each one of them and

29
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,410
then blend them back using
a mixture of Gaussians.

30
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:35,960
So, in essence, we took two of them
this way, another two and basically did

31
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,870
a blend between those and then I
did a blend between the other two.

32
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,880
Remember the kinds of blend concepts
we've looked at similar in this context

33
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,310
and what we did was basically use
a mixture of Gaussians to kind of take

34
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,750
all of the homography information for
each integral region and use that and

35
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,830
unblend it or unmerge or unwarp the
image to correct for all of the motion.

36
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,740
So here is the original video again.

37
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,580
Lot of non-rigid warping
going on in the middle.

38
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,370
This is basically the solution
using our newer approach now,

39
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:07,400
we actually look at
the rolling shutter also.

40
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,130
Now you may be noticing that
the input thing is moving around.

41
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,560
That's partly the artifact
of our cropping algorithm.
