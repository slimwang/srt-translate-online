1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,110
Let's do a quick comparison of switches and routers.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,930
Switches typically operate at layer two. A common protocol at

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,930
layer two is ethernet. Switches are typically automatically configuring

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,890
and forwarding tends to be quite fast, since packets only

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,280
need to be processed through layer two on flat

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,130
look ups. Routers, on the other hand, typically operate at

7
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,651
layer three where IP is the common protocol. And

8
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:25,970
router level topologies are not restricted to a spanning tree.

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,580
One can even have multipath routing, where a

10
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,970
single packet could be sent along one of

11
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,160
multiple possible paths in the underlying router level

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,830
topology. So, in many ways ethernet, or layer two

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,470
switching, is a lot more convenient, but one

14
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,670
of the major limitations is broadcast. The spanning

15
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,720
tree protocol messages and ARP queries both impose

16
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,230
a fairly high load on the network. So this

17
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,570
raises the question of whether it's possible to

18
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,460
get many of the benefits of the auto configuration

19
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,440
and fast forwarding of layer two without facing

20
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,160
these broadcast limitations. As it turns out, there are

21
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,790
ways to strike this balance. And in the

22
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,330
third part of the course, when we talk about

23
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,950
network management, we will look at some ways

24
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:16,120
to scale Ethernet to very large topologies. For example,

25
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,270
in data center networks. We'll also explore

26
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,130
how an emerging technology called Software Define

27
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,030
Networking, or SDN, is effectively blurring the

28
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,470
boundary between the layer two and layer three.
