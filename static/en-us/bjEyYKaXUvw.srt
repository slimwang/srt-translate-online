Before we talk about cognitive architectures in more detail,

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,500
first let us characterize what is a cognitive agent.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,030
Now, there are many views of what a cognitive agent is. Here is

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,940
one characterization of cognitive agent which is very popular in modern AI.

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:20,660
A cognitive agent is a function that maps a perceptual history into an action.

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:26,370
So it's B asterisk map into A where the asterisk on P stands for

7
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:32,759
the history percepts. So this characterization says that one of the major tasks

8
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,490
of cognitive agents is to select actions. You're driving a car. What action

9
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:41,550
should you take next? You're having lunch, what action should you do next?

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,970
You're conversing with someone, someone else, what action should you do next?

11
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:52,340
All the time we are taking actions, we as humans. And the question is,

12
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,040
what should we do next? We base that action in part on the history of

13
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,980
percepts in that particular situation. So this characterization

14
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,820
captures the basic notion of cognitive agent in a very concise manner.
