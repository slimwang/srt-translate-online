00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,941
What pattern do you notice between the original points and those that are

2
00:00:03,941 --> 00:00:08,977
reflected in the x-axis? How do each of the coordinates change? First start out

3
00:00:08,977 --> 00:00:13,957
with a general point. Let's call it x comma y. What point will I end up with

4
00:00:13,957 --> 00:00:18,549
after reflection in the x-axis? Fill in the new coordinates right here.
