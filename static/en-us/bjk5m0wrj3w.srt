How about we do this in a spreadsheet. So first let's find the population

2
00:00:04,209 --> 00:00:10,404
standard deviation. We already know that the mean is 2.5. So we'll say, equals

3
00:00:10,404 --> 00:00:18,216
A1 minus 2.5, and we'll square it. So those are the squared deviations. Command

4
00:00:18,216 --> 00:00:26,354
c, command down, command shift up, highlighting these four cells. Command v and

5
00:00:26,354 --> 00:00:34,669
we have all of our squared deviations. Now to take the standard deviation we

6
00:00:34,669 --> 00:00:44,224
take the average of cell B1:B4. So that's the variance. And then we take the

7
00:00:44,224 --> 00:00:48,484
square root of the variance to get the standard deviation. So we get 1.118

8
00:00:48,484 --> 00:00:54,516
approximately. Okay, now let's do the same thing with our sample means. So we

9
00:00:54,516 --> 00:01:02,854
already know that the mean of all our sample means is 2.5. So here we'll write

10
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:11,722
equals A6 minus 2.5 squared. So we get our first squared deviation. And now

11
00:01:11,722 --> 00:01:18,976
we'll go to that cell, push command c, go to cell A6, command down, go to cell

12
00:01:18,976 --> 00:01:26,502
B21, command shift up, highlighting all these cells and then command v. And now

13
00:01:26,502 --> 00:01:30,822
we get all of our squared deviations, now we'll find the average squared

14
00:01:30,822 --> 00:01:39,538
deviation or the variants. B6 through B21. And then we'll take the square root,

15
00:01:39,538 --> 00:01:45,725
to find the standard deviation. So the standard deviation of our sampling

16
00:01:45,725 --> 00:01:53,315
distribution, or the distribution of sample means, of size n equals 2, is about

17
00:01:53,315 --> 00:01:58,271
0.79. We're going to call this SE.
