1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here is my answer.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I found all the first letters, which are the first letter of a word

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
where there is at least one other letter, because it's okay to have a zero by itself.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You just can't have a zero followed by another digit.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I found all those first letters, and then for each first letter

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I added in a letter not equal to zero, conjoined them all with and and put that into the body.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Here's an example. For YOU equals ME-squared,

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I have lambda with the variables just like before

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and this result just like before, but I've added in Y not equal 0 and N not equal 0

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and the old value.
