00:00:08,295 --> 00:00:13,297
Well let's take the case where you're
a manager and you don't feel like

3
00:00:13,297 --> 00:00:18,000
you have the capacity or maybe you
don't have the shared language.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,386
It sometimes happens that people
there's a fork in your career and

5
00:00:21,386 --> 00:00:24,800
over time you become less
technical as a manager.

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,605
That doesn't block your empathy,
so you can see and

7
00:00:27,605 --> 00:00:29,790
hear what your team is struggling with.

8
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:35,271
So I think often it's enough to create a
space in which experimentation is okay,

9
00:00:35,271 --> 00:00:36,168
it's safe.

10
00:00:36,168 --> 00:00:40,873
I don't want to dig too deeply
into the psychology of managing in

11
00:00:40,873 --> 00:00:43,643
the text space, but I will say this.

12
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:48,375
Both the goal and the role of
a management position inside of in

13
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:53,430
tech today is one of supporting
teams and team learning.

14
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,186
So you can just take the approach of
my role here is to create a space

15
00:00:58,186 --> 00:01:02,855
in which this team can learn its way
out of the pain that it sees and

16
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:04,515
that is often enough.

17
00:01:04,515 --> 00:01:05,340
Could you add money?

18
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,338
Could you add resources?

19
00:01:06,338 --> 00:01:10,865
Sure and
you should at every responsible moment.

20
00:01:10,865 --> 00:01:16,091
But prior to that, you just need to
encourage a strong culture of learning.

21
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:19,807
As a manager I think your
primary role especially early

22
00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:24,488
is to create a culture of learning to
to make it sort of safe and open for

23
00:01:24,488 --> 00:01:26,780
people to experiment and learn.
