1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,720
Selling 3 wiper sets would have given
Grant 3 times the cost of 1 wiper set,

2
00:00:04,829 --> 00:00:09,994
which would be 3w dollars. And selling 12
nozzles would have given him, well, 12n

3
00:00:10,006 --> 00:00:15,387
dollars. We need to add these 2 quantities
together to get the total amount of money

4
00:00:15,399 --> 00:00:20,564
that Grant would of made from all these
canceled orders. So our answer is just 3w

5
00:00:20,576 --> 00:00:20,902
+ 12n.
