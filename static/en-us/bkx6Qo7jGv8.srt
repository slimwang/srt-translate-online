00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,632
All of the numbers that we've worked with fall under the category of complex

2
00:00:03,632 --> 00:00:09,132
numbers. Complex numbers can have both real and imaginary components. So that

3
00:00:09,132 --> 00:00:14,137
means that real numbers and imaginary numbers are each subsets of the complex

4
00:00:14,137 --> 00:00:20,166
numbers. Within the real numbers, we have all of the same categories as we did

5
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:20,874
before.
