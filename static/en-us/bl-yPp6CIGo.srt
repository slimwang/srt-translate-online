1
00:00:00,272 --> 00:00:03,675
All right, before we go into the code
of displaying an Interstitial Ad,

2
00:00:03,675 --> 00:00:05,640
let's discuss this a little bit.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,930
Because there are two important things
to think about with Interstitial Ads.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,550
The first one, is about
the format of an Interstitial Ad.

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:18,100
As we know, the Interstitial Ad consumes
the entire screen of the device.

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,960
Therefore, it's important
not to interrupt the user

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,990
while they are engaging with your app.

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,630
So the first important things to think
about, is to display Interstitial Ads

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:33,870
with our natural breaks in your app,
for example, between levels in a game.

10
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,060
The second important thing with
Interstitial Ads is to prepare

11
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,100
the loading of the ad before showing it.

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,918
Why is this important?

13
00:00:41,918 --> 00:00:45,870
Well, loading an Interstitial Ad
can take time, in particular,

14
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,400
if the network is slow.

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,570
When the time has come to display an
Interstitial Ad, you don't want the user

16
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,340
to sit there and wait for it to load,
you want it to be displayed immediately.

17
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,290
Therefore, we load it in advance.

18
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,030
We prepare the loading
before we're showing the ad.

19
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,720
So how do we do that.

20
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,480
Well, let's start by looking
at the class Interstitial Ad.

21
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,550
This is the class we use to load and
show an Interstitial Ad.

22
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,630
So it has a method called loadAd.

23
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:18,360
But this method is just requesting
the ad to be loaded and

24
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,110
to avoid blocking the UI thread,

25
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:24,260
it will return immediately
before the ad has been loaded.

26
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,360
So how do we know when
the ad has been loaded?

27
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,710
By setting an AdListener,
we can overload to onAdLoaded method.

28
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:35,280
So when the Interstitial Ad has finished
loading, this method will be called, and

29
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,880
we can then proceed to call
show on the Interstitial Ad.

30
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,540
So, this is the flow that we
will implement in our app.

31
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:46,140
You should also know that Interstitial
Ad has a method called isLoaded.

32
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,500
So if you're not interested in knowing
exactly when the ad has been loaded,

33
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,140
then you could simply call loadAd.

34
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,670
And when the time has come to show the
ad, you check if the ad has been loaded.

35
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,000
If it has been loaded,
then you call the show method.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,330
Otherwise, you do not
show the ad at all.

37
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,370
Now let's check out the code
to implement this flow.

38
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,139
Let's open up
the InterstitialActivity Java file.

39
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:14,210
The first thing we've done here is to
add an InterstitialAd field called

40
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:18,610
mInterstital, there are no
changes to the onCreate method.

41
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,430
So let's go and
look at the loadInsterstitial method.

42
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,200
This code should already be there
because we set it in the previous

43
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,340
exercise.

44
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,110
So let's look at the other code.

45
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,550
First, we're creating an instance
of the InterstatialAd.

46
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,830
Then, we're setting the AdUnitId.

47
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:36,710
And we set it to this string that
will return test InterstitialAds.

48
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:40,430
And this string, we defined in our
resource string file, so we have to get

49
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,880
it using the getResources().getString
and then the resource ID.

50
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,060
And now comes the flow
that we talked about.

51
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,970
Here, you can see that we're setting
the listener for the InterstitialAd.

52
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,050
Let's talk about this in a little while.

53
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:57,220
But we're setting a listener here and
then the execution drops down here.

54
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,120
So now, you can see, we're creating
an AdRequest using the builder.

55
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,680
And then we're calling the loadAd
method on our InterstitialAd instance.

56
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,979
Providing the AdRequest as an argument,
and as we saw before,

57
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:11,656
this method will start
the ad loading process, but

58
00:03:11,656 --> 00:03:15,680
it will return immediately
before the ad has been loaded.

59
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,000
That's where our listener comes
into play, and as you can see,

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,420
we're creating an anonymous class here
based on our ToastAdListener class.

61
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,170
And as you can see,
we're overloading the onAdLoaded method.

62
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,150
So since we're setting
the listener here,

63
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,110
this method will be called when
the ad has completed loading.

64
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:36,400
So we call our parent method that
will display the toast message,

65
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,199
since that is what we defined
in the ToastAdListener class.

66
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:44,520
And then we set the text of our
disable button to Show Interstitial.

67
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,960
And we also enabled that button.

68
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,910
That means that the user
can now press this button.

69
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,230
And when that happens,

70
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,690
the showInterstitial callback
method will be called.

71
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,010
So what are we doing
is showInterstitial.

72
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,690
Well, with simple check if
the Interstitial Ad has been loaded, and

73
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,700
this may seem like an unnecessary check,

74
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,690
since we know the ad has been
loaded since onAdLoaded was called.

75
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,670
But we're doing it any how.

76
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,450
And then the time has come to actually
show the Interstitial Ad, and

77
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,029
when this happens, the ad will actually
be displayed in full screen mode.

78
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,310
And for the button,
we go back to a previous state,

79
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,450
setting the text Interstitial Not Ready
and then disabling it.

80
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,100
And finally, going back to our listener.

81
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,360
If the ad could not be loaded, the
onAdFailedToLoad method will be called.

82
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,510
In that case, again,
we show the toast message and

83
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:37,070
then we set the ErrorReason
to the text of the button.

84
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,610
That's it, that's the code we have
to implement the Interstitial Ad.
