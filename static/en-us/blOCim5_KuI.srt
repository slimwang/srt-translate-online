1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,830
And so here we have a sphere.

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:06,820
And the idea of a Gaussian sphere is it represents all possible surface normals.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,898
So suppose I have a shape, and I'll just draw us some sort of shape like that.

4
00:00:10,898 --> 00:00:12,640
It's kind of a potato looking thing.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,840
Right, if I have some point here, it has a surface normal in some direction.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,280
Well that surface normal is right here on the sphere.

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,730
And likewise, if I has a normal here,

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,090
that one would be right there on the sphere.

9
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:31,180
Okay? So there's a mapping, from all the surface normals to the Gaussian sphere.

10
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,910
And in particular if I have z as a function of x y and

11
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,160
I'm only worrying about things pointing up.

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,180
Then essentially, only the top half of that sphere do I have to worry about.

13
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,730
Right? So there's going to be a relationship between every normal, and

14
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,686
a point on the Guassian sphere.

15
00:00:46,686 --> 00:00:50,770
So, the p q space that I was just talking about is actually a projection of

16
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:51,820
the Guassian sphere.

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,760
And the way it works is as follows.

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,200
Imagine, and I'll draw this in 3D in a minute.

19
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,660
A map by here in the 2D.

20
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,390
Imagine I have a, an origin at the center of the sphere and

21
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,900
I come out, at the location of that normal and

22
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:09,850
I hit a plane that's located at the top pole of this sphere.

23
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,190
So here I'm showing it in, in 2D.

24
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:13,960
It just makes it a little bit easier.

25
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,130
But actually to look at p q space, we have to look at this in 3D.

26
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,245
So here the idea is, here's my little normal who is there, and

27
00:01:21,245 --> 00:01:23,740
it points up until it hits this plane.

28
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,634
And that location would be p0, q0.

29
00:01:26,634 --> 00:01:27,236
All right.

30
00:01:27,236 --> 00:01:28,618
For this particular normal.

31
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:31,042
And this z equals 1 plane up here,

32
00:01:31,042 --> 00:01:36,150
that's sometimes called the gradient space or the p q plane projection.

33
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,410
And the idea is that every normal, has a p q value.

34
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,640
So I can represent normals just by their p q value.

35
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,008
And so now we're going to use that to define our reflectance map.

36
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:50,049
Got it, cool.
