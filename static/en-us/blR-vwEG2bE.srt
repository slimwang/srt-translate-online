1
00:00:00,274 --> 00:00:05,328
If we take the car, we travel 4,500 km at 200 km per hour.

2
00:00:05,328 --> 00:00:07,978
That's going to take 22.5 hours.

3
00:00:07,978 --> 00:00:16,120
The throughput is 2 people divided by 22.5 hours, which equals about 0.089 people per hour.

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,652
For the bus, we're traveling 4,500 km at 50 km per hour,

5
00:00:20,652 --> 00:00:23,154
and that's going to take us 90 hours to get there.

6
00:00:23,154 --> 00:00:26,423
However, the throughput is 40 people divided by 90 hours,

7
00:00:26,423 --> 00:00:30,836
and that's going to give us a much better throughput of 0.45 people per hour.

8
00:00:30,836 --> 00:00:32,732
These two trends aren't necessarily opposed.

9
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:35,599
Improved latency often leads to improved throughput,

10
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:39,335
and sometimes improved throughput also leads to improved latency.

11
00:00:39,335 --> 00:00:42,418
But the GP designers are really prioritizing throughput.

12
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:44,441
That's really the focus of their efforts.
