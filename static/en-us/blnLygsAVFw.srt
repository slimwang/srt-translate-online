1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,983
I'll just create a couple.

2
00:00:05,326 --> 00:00:09,160
And it's going to shake the phone.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,138
Do the shake gesture.

4
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:13,760
A little weird.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,050
This time the spiders did
flee from the screen, but

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:21,340
instead of spreading out radially from
the center, they crossed over the middle

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,740
to exit off the screen, and
that's not how it should work.

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,460
They should be spreading out
radially from the center.

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,180
Let's look at that again.

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,564
We'll create some more spiders.

11
00:00:32,564 --> 00:00:33,510
Woah, okay.

12
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,080
It looks like we have another problem.

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,550
Maybe the bugs aren't being deleted, but
we'll look at that in just a second.

14
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:49,010
Let's shake it again, and
that's the same problem.

15
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,670
So this is probably related
to the disperse animation.

16
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,170
Let's go ahead and take a look.

17
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,540
So I'll stop at this point,
just need to stop for a second.

18
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,540
So here's the disperse bugs animation,
and

19
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,120
we can see that we're setting
the off screen position.

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,010
And whatever this off-screen position is
being set to, that's what we're trying

21
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,790
to update the bug frame to is
this new off-screen position.

22
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,531
It's causing the bugs to cross
over the middle of the web.

23
00:01:15,531 --> 00:01:20,106
So right now we're taking the bugs
center coordinate to calculate this off

24
00:01:20,106 --> 00:01:24,536
screen position, we're taking the bug
center coordinate, the X, and

25
00:01:24,536 --> 00:01:28,384
we're subtracting it from the view
center coordinate for X and

26
00:01:28,384 --> 00:01:33,050
we're multiplying it by -20, and
we're doing the same thing for the Y.

27
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:38,501
We're taking the bug.center.y,
and then the view.center,

28
00:01:38,501 --> 00:01:42,870
it's y, and
we're also multiplying it by -20.

29
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:47,098
So let's try this calculation by hand
and see what it really looks like.

30
00:01:47,098 --> 00:01:51,498
So let's say that we have this
fictitious view in spider and

31
00:01:51,498 --> 00:01:55,549
that the spider's enter,
it's X, is maybe 180.

32
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:59,080
And let's say view centers,
it's X is maybe 150.

33
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,229
And if we subtract these two
values we get positive 30.

34
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:06,070
And if we multiply that by
negative 20 we get negative 600.

35
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,600
And with a new center
value of negative 600,

36
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,670
this would cause the spider to move all
the way from it's position to where it

37
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:16,920
currently is across the center to some
point all the way over here on the left.

38
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,320
So think that's our problem.

39
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,890
Instead, I think if we multiply maybe
by a positive value, we can move

40
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:27,330
to the right, away from the center
instead of left, across the center.

41
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,390
So let's go back to the code now and
fix this.

42
00:02:30,515 --> 00:02:34,765
So I'll change these to positive 20's,
and once we build and run again,

43
00:02:38,655 --> 00:02:43,042
create a bunch of spiders,
and simulate shaking device.

44
00:02:43,042 --> 00:02:43,842
And nice, there we go.

45
00:02:43,842 --> 00:02:48,302
All the spiders are now running away
in a radial pattern like we wanted.

46
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:50,722
Now there's one last bug
which I think you noticed,

47
00:02:50,722 --> 00:02:55,620
it's maybe more of a lack of
implementation instead of a bug.

48
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,210
But when we tried shaking the bugs and
then created some more,

49
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,980
we noticed all these bugs came
running back onto the screen.

50
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,610
So, where are these
extra bugs coming from?

51
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,610
My thought's maybe we're
forgetting to move them.

52
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,490
So let's just check back in
the visual debug controller.

53
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,860
And see if our hunch is correct.

54
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,920
So we go to the empty bugs from view.

55
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,000
That's where this should be happening.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,180
There we go.
Model that.

57
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,410
I left a message to remind myself, and

58
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,700
I haven't done it to empty
the bugs from the view.

59
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,420
In this case, I'll forgive you if you
copy the code over from the final

60
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,020
working version because
that's what I'm about to do.

61
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,840
This should just be a simple fix.

62
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,870
So if we go up, it debugs from view.

63
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,802
Here we go.

64
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,280
Let's put that in.

65
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,401
Try it one more time.

66
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:51,880
And create some bugs,
shake them off the screen, and

67
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,340
then if we create some more,
should be no new bugs crawling back on.

68
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,320
Looks good.

69
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:04,873
Let's do a couple of different types

70
00:04:04,873 --> 00:04:10,080
of bugs, just for checking sake.

71
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,960
Shake them off, and
everything looks good.

72
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,160
And that's it.

73
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,350
That's all the bugs that I know that
are in the visual debugging scene.

74
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:21,519
And I hope you're able to find and
fix all these bugs on your own.

75
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,690
But most importantly, I hope that
your confidence is growing, so

76
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,670
that you can go forth and
when you're faced with bugs like this,

77
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:32,530
or any bugs in your application, you
know what tools are available to you,

78
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,320
and you can use them to
debug your applications.
