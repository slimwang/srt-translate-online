00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,390
Okay, here's the answer.

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:04,460
You need to shop that op is associative.

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:05,689
You don't need all this other stuff.

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,850
In particular,
associativity means that op of a, b,

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:16,870
then op with c has to be the same as a,
op with b and c.

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,510
Basically you put
the parenthesis where you want.

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,810
So let me just quickly run through
some of the other options.

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:27,180
So the constraint of constant time only
affects the work in the span of a scan,

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,760
not its correctness, so
this is not relevant.

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,490
What about being in place?

11
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,500
Well, our algorithm
uses op as a function,

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,110
so being in place doesn't matter.

13
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,710
Now the fourth option
commutativity is interesting.

14
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,790
Like a sociativity,
it's kind of rearrangement property.

15
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,650
But actually, it's a stronger
property than what we need.

16
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,560
In fact, you should go back and
look at the parallel scan, and

17
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,200
you will observe that it always
only combines consecutive values.

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,709
So that means,
we really only need a sociativity,

19
00:00:53,709 --> 00:00:58,240
It's not too hard to show that our
definition of op is in fact associative.

20
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,190
But it's mostly messy algebra.

21
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,720
I'm super lazy so
I'll leave that as an exercise to you.

22
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:07,260
As an aside there's a really neat and
very general framework for

23
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,870
many other kinds of recurrences.

24
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,350
These include things like segmented
scan, which you just looked at.

25
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,710
