Now that we've talked about how to write exponents using MathQuill, I'd also

2
00:00:04,074 --> 00:00:08,083
like to tell you what we do with fractions. You'll notice that if you want to

3
00:00:08,095 --> 00:00:12,146
type 3 over 4 and get it to look exactly like this, all you need to do is type

4
00:00:12,158 --> 00:00:17,029
3/4. Then, just like with exponents, if you want to continue typing something

5
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:21,108
after a fraction, to get out of being in the denominator of the fraction, you

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,355
just use a right arrow key. And then, you can continue typing like normal. So,

7
00:00:25,367 --> 00:00:28,940
try out those first two with the instructions that I've given you. And then, for

8
00:00:28,952 --> 00:00:32,182
the last one, which is a challenge problem, you get to use your new found

9
00:00:32,194 --> 00:00:35,544
understanding of our wonderful MathQuill tool to write both exponents and

10
00:00:35,556 --> 00:00:37,631
fractions. And even an exponent in a fraction.
