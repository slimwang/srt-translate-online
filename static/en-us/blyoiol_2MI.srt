00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,687
Let's try some practice. Here are two new functions. And I want you to find

2
00:00:04,687 --> 00:00:08,812
each of these. Remember that for these you should have 1 number as the final

3
00:00:08,812 --> 00:00:14,110
output, and here you should have a function that uses x. Good luck.
