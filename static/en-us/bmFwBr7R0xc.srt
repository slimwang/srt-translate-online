00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,350
Information theory has a very interesting history. Claude Shannon was

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,950
a genius mathematician who was working at Bell Labs who came

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,470
out with this information theory. He's also called as the father

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:13,590
of the information age. Why it is interesting, is because at

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,340
the time Bell Labs had a communication mechanism set up

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,720
and they had just figured out long distance communication, but they

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,570
had no idea how to charge people. So you could send

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,260
a message and they would charge you per message, or they

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,210
could find out how many words were in those message

10
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,800
and they would charge you per word, but none of

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,650
them made sense because you could sometimes write shorter sentences

12
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,335
and can be much more information. So it really became

13
00:00:37,335 --> 00:00:40,340
necessary to find out what is information and Shannon was

14
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,640
the first person to ever try to work on that

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,150
problem and figure something out. But information theory has also

16
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,460
a background from physics and that is why it has words

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,510
like entropy in it. The physicists who studied

18
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,680
thermodynamics were the first scientist to actually understood

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,290
information. If you are interested in learning more

20
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,600
about the physicists background of information theory, you should

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,490
read up on Maxwell's Demon. Maxwell's Demon is

22
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,720
a very famous part experiment that Maxwell came

23
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,810
out with. In physics we believe that energy

24
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,290
can neither be created or destroyed, but Maxwell's Demon

25
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,910
proves that energy can, can ordered into information

26
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,100
and the combination of energy and information can neither

27
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,380
be created or destroyed. But let's come back

28
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,840
to the big world and let's discuss how Claude

29
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,040
Shannon looked at it. So his task was

30
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,440
to send messages from one place to the other

31
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,940
and try to figure out which message has

32
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,990
more information. So, let's start with a simple example.
