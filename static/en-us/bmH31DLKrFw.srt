00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,450
In the last chapter we learned about
the service worker life cycle.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,939
Thankfully you don't have to keep
all of that state in your head,

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:07,230
there are dev tools for that.

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,610
At the time of recording this, some of
our dev tools are still in development,

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,650
but I recommend giving them a go.

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,110
I'm using Chrome Canary which is
google's almost nightly build of chrome

7
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,270
with all the experimental stuff.

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,370
As a developer, I recommend installing
it so you get all the new features and

9
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,260
tools before everyone else.

10
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,770
It runs completely independently
of regular chrome, so

11
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,530
installing this won't mess
with your other settings.

12
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,610
Check out the instructor's notes for
links to download Chrome Canary and

13
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,872
once you've launched Canary
open the WITTR up again.

14
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,485
Once you've got Canary all set up,
check the check box and

15
00:00:37,485 --> 00:00:39,445
we'll have a play with
the latest dev tools.
