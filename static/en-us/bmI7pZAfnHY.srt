1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,670
Well, let's have a look at how to do this. Again, we're giving an arbitrary

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:08,955
point on the flag. Let's remember that x moves this way, y moves this way. So,

3
00:00:08,955 --> 00:00:14,590
in this case the y value doesn't matter at all. What matters is where x is. The

4
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:18,860
total width here is given to us, so this cutoff here is width over 3 and this

5
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:24,912
one is width times 2 over 3. So, the first condition here is going to be x less

6
00:00:24,912 --> 00:00:31,667
than width over 3 or maybe less than equal width over 3. Let's settle that. So,

7
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:35,876
let's assume that the width was 300, then x could be any value between 0 and

8
00:00:35,876 --> 00:00:44,056
299. The first 100 values, from 0 to 99 should be blue. The values from 100 to

9
00:00:44,056 --> 00:00:51,510
199 should be white. And the values from 200 to 299 should be red. So, the last

10
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:58,848
value that stays in this branch here should be x equals 99. With the 300, width

11
00:00:58,848 --> 00:01:03,176
over 3 is 100. So the less than is correct. We want to be less than 100 to stay

12
00:01:03,176 --> 00:01:07,780
here. As soon as we're between 100 and less than 2 3rds of the width, we want

13
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:14,005
to be in the middle brand, branch. And, finally, if neither of those is true,

14
00:01:14,005 --> 00:01:18,570
then we want to be here. And thats the code. The takeaway is, if you need to

15
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:24,726
make multiple decisions, then you use the if, else if, else clause. Sarah has

16
00:01:24,726 --> 00:01:28,054
prepared a bunch of practice problems for you, so that you get more exercises

17
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:31,760
that involve making these kinds of decisions. Have fun.
