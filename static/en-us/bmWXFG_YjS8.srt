1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,530
In ESP the IP header
is not authenticated.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,900
So what if we want to
authenticate the entire packet?

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,560
We can use authentication header or.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,870
There are several fields
in the IP header.

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:19,300
For example, time to live or TTL,
that may change in transmission.

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,370
The values of these fields
are not included, or

7
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,300
zero out when the message
authentication code is computed.

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,490
Does not encrypt anything, but we can
use ESP to encrypt the payload and

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,890
then apply To authenticate
the entire packet.

10
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:42,020
If Is used with transport mode, the
authentication code is in the Header,

11
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,840
which is inserted after the origin or
IP header.

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,420
Other important IP set
information in the Header

13
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,270
includes the security parameter
index and a sequence number.

14
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,377
And again,
we will discuss these shortly.

15
00:00:56,377 --> 00:01:02,150
If Is used with tunnel mode, the Header
is inserted after the new IP header.
