Let's press on with this function we were working with before. Now I've talked

2
00:00:03,867 --> 00:00:09,190
before about 0's or roots of functions. We know that these are values of x that

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:15,368
when substituted into our function make the function itself f of x equal 0. So,

4
00:00:15,368 --> 00:00:19,616
for this function in particular If we know that f of a equals 0, then what

5
00:00:19,616 --> 00:00:25,525
numbers can a equal? What values can it take on to make this true? Please write

6
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:29,263
your answers in this box and separate them with commas.
