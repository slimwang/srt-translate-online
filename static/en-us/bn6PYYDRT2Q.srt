1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,940
Over the next two projects,

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:05,490
you're going to create a ruby simulation
game that we're calling Survivor.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,150
Where contestants compete in tribes
to be the last person standing.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,090
We'll dive more into the rules later.

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,180
When you're done it will look
a little something like this.

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:14,872
Look, I won.

7
00:00:14,872 --> 00:00:17,520
Because there's so much text going on

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,930
we're going to colorize the output
to make things a little bit clearer.

9
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,990
Colorizing output is definitely
something that we could reuse in

10
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,780
a future project.

11
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,400
So we're going to turn it into a gem.

12
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,860
Yes, we know there's already
a colorized gem, but we don't care.

13
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:31,730
This is a chance to learn.
