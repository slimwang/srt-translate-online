An object oriented analysis the above groupings that you've produced from

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,630
candidate classes. In object oriented analysis a class is a description of

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:16,079
a group of related objects, these objects are also sometimes called instances.

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,100
We're going to use UML class model diagrams. And in those diagrams,

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,225
classes are represented as rectangles, possible vertically partitioned into

6
00:00:27,225 --> 00:00:34,530
sub-compartments. Thus, taking what you have, we can come up with some

7
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,990
initial class model diagram that has rectangles for counters and

8
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:44,660
leafs and piles and parts and trees. And in your case in your case node.
