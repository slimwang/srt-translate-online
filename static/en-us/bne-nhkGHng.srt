1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
For the mean, we add up those numbers.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The sum is 342 divided by 9,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
because it has 9 numbers,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
gives us 38.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
For the median, we re-sort them,

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and we find that 9 is the number in the middle.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And for the mode, it's easy to see that there are 4 occurrences of 9.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Every other number only occurs once.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Obviously, sometimes there could be ties.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
There could be 2 elements in the center

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
or 2 numbers that could be for the same mode,

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and we just assume that ties are broken at random.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So pick either number; it doesn't really matter.
