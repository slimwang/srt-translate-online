1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,410
Now that we understand the high level

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:07,230
goal of GMS, the most important parameter in

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:13,680
the working of GMS system is age managemet because we need to identify what is

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,210
the globally oldest page whenever want to

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,500
do replacements And let's see how that algorithm

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,450
works and how it is managed. So in any distributed system, one of the goals

7
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,520
is to make sure that any management

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,220
work is not bringing down the productivity of

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,900
that node. In other words, you want

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,090
to make sure that Management work is distributed

11
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:42,100
and not concentrated on any one node and you know in the GMS system, since we

12
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:50,330
are working with an active set of nodes. Overtime, the node that is active,

13
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:54,330
may become inactive and a node that was inactive

14
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,760
may become and so on. And so you don't

15
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,250
want the management of age information to be assigned

16
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:03,230
to any given node. But it is something that

17
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,800
has to shift over time. And that's sort of

18
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,280
the fundamental tenant of building any distributed system. Is

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,540
to make sure that we distribute the management work

20
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,680
so that no single node in the distributed system

21
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,520
is overburdened of that. That's a general principle,

22
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,530
and we'll see how that principle is followed in

23
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:26,070
this particular system. So we break the management.

24
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,360
Both along the space axis and time axis, into

25
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,270
what is called epochs, and there are two

26
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,910
parameters that govern an epoch. One is T, which

27
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,770
is the maximum duration of an epoch. That

28
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,740
is, an epoch is in some sense a granularity.

29
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:47,260
Of management work done by a node. And that management work done by a node

30
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,850
is either time bound, maximum T duration, or

31
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,580
space bound, maximum M replacements. So if, in

32
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,940
the working of the system, if M

33
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:03,060
space replacements. Have happened, then that epoch is

34
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,310
complete, so we go to a new epoch. There'll be a new manager for age management.

35
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,580
Or if the duration T is complete, then

36
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,630
again, the epoch is complete, and so we pick

37
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,460
a new manager to manage the next epoch. And

38
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,230
we'll see in a minute how we pick the

39
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:27,090
new manager. And T maybe on the order of a few seconds. And M, which is the

40
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,330
number of replacements, maybe on the order of thousands

41
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,870
of replacements. So at the start of each epoch

42
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,800
what happens is every node is going to send

43
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,730
the age information to the initiator. That is.

44
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,840
Every node is going to say, what is the

45
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,240
age of the pages that is resident at this

46
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,320
node. All the local pages, all the global

47
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,790
pages, universe of all the pages that exist

48
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,330
at this node, what is the age information

49
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,980
associated with that? And remember that the smaller the

50
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,650
age, the more relevant the page is. So the

51
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,580
higher the age, the older the page. So, in

52
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,070
picking a candidate, we're always going to pick an

53
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:11,210
old page to replace. So, that's the age information that

54
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:15,390
each of these node ascending to the initiator. So,

55
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,440
in one sense. Its set of pages, N2 sends

56
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,160
its set of pages, and so on. Everybody is

57
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,430
sending to the manager node that I'm calling the initiator,

58
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,170
the age information. What the initiator node is going to

59
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:30,020
do is two things. It's going to find out what

60
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:34,560
is the minimum age of all the M pages

61
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,290
that are going to be replaced. Remember that. Smaller

62
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,240
the age, the better. So what it is going to

63
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,690
say is out of all the pages that exist

64
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,710
in the entire cluster, what are the oldest M

65
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,080
pages that are going to be replaced in the upcoming

66
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,690
epoch, and for those M old pages, out of those M old pages, what is the minimum

67
00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:00,010
age? So any page with less than the minimum

68
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,060
age are pages that are active and that are

69
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,920
going to survive this upcoming epoch. Whereas, any page whose

70
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,020
age is older than that minimum age, is part

71
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,910
of this set of M pages that are going to

72
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,150
be replaced in the upcoming epoch, and those are

73
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,459
the replacement candidates. That's minimum age. So

74
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,670
it computes the minimum age. And it also

75
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:24,050
computes given the minimum age and given the

76
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:28,450
distribution of the age demographics coming from N1,

77
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:35,330
I know out of these pages coming from N1 what fraction of the pages that belong

78
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,760
to N1 are going to be replaced in the

79
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,630
upcoming epoch. And that is the weight parameter

80
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:47,680
for this particular node. For instance, if it turns out that N1 has 10% of the

81
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,090
candidate pages that are going to be replaced

82
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,830
in the next epoch, then its wage is 0.1.

83
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,429
If N2 is going to account for 30% of

84
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:59,160
the replacements 30% of the M replacements in the

85
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,790
upcoming epoch. Then N2's weight is going to be

86
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,240
W2 and so on. So what this initiative does

87
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,350
is it computes this min age and it also

88
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,050
computes the weight for each one of the nodes,

89
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,350
and that's what is sent back to each node.

90
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,450
So each node is going to see the min age and

91
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:22,290
also the weight for all [UNKNOWN]. Each load is

92
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,810
not only receiving its own weight, that is its

93
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,260
own fraction of the [INAUDIBLE] pages that are going

94
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,490
to be replaced, but it is also getting the fraction

95
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,140
of the pages that are going to be replaced from

96
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,790
each of its peer nodes in the entire cluster. And

97
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,030
we'll see how this information is going to be used

98
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,840
by each one of these nodes. And of course, we

99
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,590
don't know the future, all that the initiator is doing.

100
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:48,880
Is that is saying that it is expected replacement. W1

101
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,160
is expected share of replacement that's going to happen in N1.

102
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,520
W2 is expected share of replacement that's going to happen in

103
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,470
N2 and so on. And when the next epoch

104
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,780
starts actually. That can be different, depending on what

105
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,110
happens in these [INAUDIBLE]. But, that's the best that

106
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,000
we can do is use the past to predict the

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,870
future. That's what the initiates doing. It is using

108
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,370
the past, the age information that it got from all

109
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,950
the notes, in order to predict the future in

110
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:21,600
terms of where these end replacements are going to happen.

111
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,860
What is the minimum age of the pages that are going to be

112
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,410
replaced in the next epoch. So that's what is being done by the initiator.
