00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,840
Okay, so if you look at the top of your
table, you'll see that we have even

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,510
more even toed ungulates or
tridactyla than any other order.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,820
Even the carnivores don't come close.

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,920
And if you scroll way down to
the bottom of the output you saw,

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,720
now the dolphins and whales.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,700
And what exactly is a narwhal
doing in a zoo anyway?
