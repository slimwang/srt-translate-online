00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,100
Now, hopefully, you've learned
how to test some good edge cases.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:07,180
With that in mind, lets go back
to our previous hypothetical.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:12,149
If you provide strings in values,
values-en, and values-fr,

4
00:00:12,149 --> 00:00:16,360
and the users device
language is set to Japanese,

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,990
which strings on XML will they see?
