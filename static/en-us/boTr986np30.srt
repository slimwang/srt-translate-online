1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
In this problem, you're going to use the SIR model

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
to look at a situation in which people's immunity doesn't last.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
In other words, after someone who has been infected moves to the recovered population.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Here, she can become susceptible again.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We're going to call this waning immunity and we'll set the constant over here waning time

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
to equal the amount of time that it takes for a person's immunity to fade away.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Most of the information we've given you in the supplied code you've seen before,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
but there are couple of things that are particular to this unit.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You'll see another transmission coefficient,

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
which is a measure of how frequently each day, each infectious person might infect someone else.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You could also think of it as the likelihood that an interaction between an infected person

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and a susceptible person went up with the susceptible person becoming infected.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Just make sure that you know that its unit is 1 per person per day

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and the first thing that we want you to do is to define waning time right here.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So eventually we have a system in stead state

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
where the number of recovered people is equal to 2 times the number of infected people.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Think about what this means in terms of the time that people should spend infected

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
versus the time that they should spend recovering.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Just for reference, I've include the equations for the standard SIR model right here.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Remember that this equation don't include waning immunity.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
First think about how you need to change them in order to reflect the situation at hand.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Once you figure that out, you'll need to translate your mathematical expressions into code.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We've already created list for S, I, and R for you.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And we set the initial values for susceptible, infected, and recovered populations right here.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Next comes a for loop, part of which you'll have to fill in.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We've given you S to I, right here,

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
which is a number of people moving from susceptible to infected during one-time step.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We've also given you I to R,

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
which is a number of people going from infected to recovered in a given time step.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What you need to do is to define R to S.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The number of people who in one-time step become susceptible again after they've recovered.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Just to be clear, all three of these are measured in number of people,

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
not in number of people per time.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Make sure that you check that your units are correct.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Your last task is to modify the recursive functions right here for S, I, and R.
