1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,900
All right, so now that we have
a mental model of the app in our head,

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,504
let's talk about how we're going to
modify the app in lesson one.

3
00:00:05,504 --> 00:00:08,243
In this lesson we'll learn how
to create new activities and

4
00:00:08,243 --> 00:00:09,829
navigate to them using Intents.

5
00:00:09,829 --> 00:00:12,314
That'll allow us to have
multiple screens in our app.

6
00:00:12,314 --> 00:00:14,899
This will involve revisiting
many concepts, like Intents,

7
00:00:14,899 --> 00:00:17,570
that we learned in the Android for
beginners course.

8
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,930
Then we'll move into demystifying
how the click is actually handled in

9
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:21,437
Android.

10
00:00:21,437 --> 00:00:23,821
From there, we'll learn more
about event listeners and

11
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:25,510
a new concept called interfaces.

12
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,860
These key steps will set
up a good foundation for

13
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,920
our app as well as a good foundation for

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,350
the object-oriented programming
concepts to enter in lesson two.

15
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,838
First we're going to dive deeper
into the MainActivity.java file.

16
00:00:36,838 --> 00:00:39,890
This class should look pretty familiar
to you based on your experience from

17
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,000
the Just Java app in the last course.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,760
Read through the file as best you can.

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,190
It's expected that you won't
understand all the syntax.

20
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,720
And there's no need to memorize
every line of code in this file.

21
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,300
We just want you have a basic
understanding of the important parts

22
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:51,990
of this file.

23
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,780
Then if you need to change anything
later, you'll know which part to go to.

24
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,260
After you've read the file, complete
the following matching exercise.

25
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,554
For each block of code on the right,

26
00:01:00,554 --> 00:01:03,340
figure out what text description
accurately describes it.

27
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,920
Put the letter A through
E in the blanks here.

28
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,050
And we know that you haven't seen some
of these vocabulary words before.

29
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,541
So you may have to do some research or
educated guessing.

30
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:16,279
And if you do need help, search online
in the Android documentation using

31
00:01:16,279 --> 00:01:18,340
the text descriptions here on the left.
