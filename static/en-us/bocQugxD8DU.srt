1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,350
Although this example may appear to be
abstract, it is actually quite realistic

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,390
because it is similar to many
real world APT instances.

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:12,530
In this example, the CEO gets
an email with a PDF attachment

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,210
showing pie charts of sales activities.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,640
When he opens the PDF document
inside browser, for example, so

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,770
that he can use the Acrobat Reader
plug in to view the document,

7
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:29,540
the crafted attack data embedded in the
PDF document would cause a zero exploit

8
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,890
that broke out the plug in sand box in
a browser and compromised the browser.

9
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,800
In a detail of such attack can be for
example a buffer overflow attack that

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,750
lead to control flow hijacking and
taking over the browser.

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,510
Then the injected attack code will
download a malicious browser extension.

12
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:51,625
Record that a malicious browser
extension is the malware embedded within

13
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,070
the browser.

14
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,910
From this point on, each time the CEO
send an email to his employees

15
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:01,020
with an attachment, for
example a PDF document,

16
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,120
the malicious browser extension
would infect the attachments.

17
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,630
Eventually, the malware gets
on the computer of a user

18
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,690
who has admin privilege of
the company's server, and

19
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,760
therefore the malware can
steal the credentials

20
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,300
that will lead the malware into
access into the companies servers.

21
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,310
From this point on,

22
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:23,010
the malware can then steal the most
valuable data from the company.

23
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:27,400
This example captures a number
of key characteristics of APTs.

24
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,740
Fist, the users, including the system
admins do not realize that

25
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,420
their computers and
their network have been compromised.

26
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,410
Second, the APT activities blend
in with normal user activity.

27
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:41,379
For example, the APT does not
just send email by itself,

28
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:44,830
it only modifies emails sent by the CEO.

29
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,770
Third, it takes its time in or
to get to the key individual and

30
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,440
steal his credentials.
