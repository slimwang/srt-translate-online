Welcome to the assignments for lesson two. Now the assignments for

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,540
this lesson are probably the most involved and time consuming of

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,860
the entire class. They may take you three to four hours

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,530
to complete if you do them thoroughly. So, if you do

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,350
find yourself getting drained or bored or just running out of

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,220
time, don't rush through them. You should do these well if

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,040
you're going to do them at all. But, you should feel

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,860
free to either skip ahead to lesson three, or if you're

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,790
getting bored, just take a break. If you do decide

10
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,479
to take a break, I would definitely, set a calendar

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,859
invite for yourself to remind you to come back for

12
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:37,750
the class. It's pretty easy to forget that. Good luck
