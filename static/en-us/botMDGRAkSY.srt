00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,500
In our high fives and smiles study, measuring smiles was an objective measure.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,000
That is, it's something that we can actually see and measure. However, we could

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,180
have also asked the fellow Udacians to rate their level of happiness when I

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,375
gave them a high five. In asking them to rate their happiness, we use a

5
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:22,030
self-report measure. And, this is a subjective measure. Now, I want to have

6
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:26,270
Susan here give you more examples of different objective and subject measures.

7
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:31,110
Another type of objective measure is a physiological response. Heart rate is

8
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:35,730
one example of a physiological response, sweating is another physiological

9
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:41,170
measure. Physiological measures are also objective because we can quantify

10
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:46,390
those responses. For the heart rate, we can use pulse to determine heart rate.

11
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:50,970
Sweating, we can measure temperature and we can also measure the galvanic skin

12
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:55,880
response. One problem with self-report measures is that we can't be sure

13
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,250
they're completely accurate. But that is the only we can get that information

14
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:04,640
is to ask the participant. Think that to Lorens reaction who tickles the snake.

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,260
We could use different psychological measures to assess her response. We can

16
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,030
use an objective measure meaning we could watch her run away. We could also

17
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,540
look at her nervous laughter and that would be an objective measure. We could

18
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:22,020
also ask self report. Hey Loren, how did you feel when you saw that snake. A

19
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,130
physiological objective measure. We could have measured her heart rate, which

20
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,290
would have increased due to her fear response. We could have also measured her

21
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:35,210
sweating. Most psychological experiments try to get both objective and

22
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,210
subjective measures.
