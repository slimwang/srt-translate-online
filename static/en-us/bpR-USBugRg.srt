1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is 0.27.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We first consider the possibility we have actually have cancer, in which our tests

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
will give us a positive result of 0.9 chance, and then we add the possibility of not having cancer

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:24,000
that's 1-0.1 or 0.9, and then when one gives us a positive result with 0.2 chance or 1-0.8.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Resolving this gives us something like this that is 0.09+0.18 adds up to 0.27.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So now, I want you to write the computer code that accepts arbitrary P₀, P₁, P₂

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and calculates the resulting probability of a positive test result and here's my answer.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
My code does exactly what I have shown you before.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It first considers the possibility of cancer multiply this with the test sensitivity P₁ and then it absorbs

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
the opposite possibility, and of course, the specificity over here refers to a negative test results,

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
so we take 1 minus that to get the +1.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Adding these two parts up give us the desired results so let's try this.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Here's my function f with the prime that we just assumed, and if I hit, run I get 0.27.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Obviously, I can change the prime with this.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So suppose we make it much less likely to have cancer in the prior from 0.1 to 0.01

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
then my 0.27 changes to 0.207.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Now realize it is not the posterior in Bayes' rule. This is just the probability of getting a positive test result.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You can see this if you change the prior probability of cancer to zero,

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
which means we don't have cancer no matter what the test result says,

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
but there's 0.2 chance of getting a positive test result,

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and the reason is our test has a specificity of 0.8 that is even in the absence of cancer,

22
00:01:52,000 --> 99:59:59,999
there's 0.2 chance of getting a positive test result.
