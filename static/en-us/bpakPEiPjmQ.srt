1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So each complexity class here follows a number of conditions

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
or has a number of conditions that define it,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
so P is defined as being the class of all problems

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
that can be solved in polynomial time on a deterministic RAM,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and NEXPTIME, for example, is defined

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
as the class of all problems that can be

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
solved in exponential time on a non-deterministic RAM.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Now when you want to arrange those classes into a sort of hierarchy,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
then you always have to think about which conditions

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
are more restrictive than others.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And I hope it's clear by now that determinism

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
is more restrictive than non-determinisms.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So basically, we can say non-determinism

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
is stronger than determinism.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Of course, this is very hand weary,

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
so don't show this to a theoretical computer scientist,

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
but for here it is okay to think about it that way.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Now what about exponential time and polynomial time,

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I think that is a very clear one.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So exponential time clearly should give you at least as much power as polynomial time,

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and this basically gives us the hierarchy,

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
because polynomial time is clearly the most restrictive one,

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and non-deterministic exponential time is clearly the most powerful one.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So we can already say here that P goes into the very inner circle

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
whereas NEXPTIME goes out here.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Now what about NP and exponential time on a deterministic machine?

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
When we talked about non-determinism,

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
we already found out that polynomial time non-determinism

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
can always be simulated in exponential time determinism,

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
which means that exponential time on a deterministic machine is

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
at least as powerful as non-deterministic time on a polynomial time machine.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So NP goes into the second circle here

33
00:01:33,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and EXTIME into the third.
