1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,589
Now that you have a SettingsActivity,
you can make a PreferenceFragment.

2
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:06,400
Do the following steps.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,910
First thing is to add a support
preference library to the gradle file.

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,900
You can copy it from
the instructor notes below.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,620
And then create an xml folder
under the res directory and

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,359
create a preference xml
file in that folder.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,072
Inside, create both an EditTextPeference
and an ListPreference.

8
00:00:25,071 --> 00:00:28,570
The EditTextPreference would be used for
the location, and the list for

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,990
the units.

10
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:32,670
And don't forget to use
the resource files.

11
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,390
Then create a class called
SettingsFragment and

12
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,250
have it extend
the PreferenceFragmentCompat.

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,939
After that, replace the layout for the
settings activity with a fragment tag.

14
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:46,129
Make sure to add the correct theme,
so that it actually runs.

15
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:46,820
And finally,

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,090
implement the updates to the preference
summaries when the values are changed.
