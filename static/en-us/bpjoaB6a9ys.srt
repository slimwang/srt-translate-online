00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,120
We often call an encryption
scheme a cipher.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,920
You may not have realized this,
but encryption has been used for

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,800
thousands of years.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,920
For example,

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,360
there is an evidence that Ancient
Egyptians used some sort of ciphers.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,360
And then there is
the famous Caesar's cipher,

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,170
as well as other similar schemes.

8
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,640
There are several types of ciphers.

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,630
Symmetric ciphers, range from ancient
schemes to present day algorithms.

10
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:33,700
Asymmetric ciphers are relatively new,
only invented in the late 70s.

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,130
Most security protocols now
use both types of schemes.

12
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,540
Typically, they first
use asymmetric ciphers

13
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,250
to authenticate both parties
involved in the communication.

14
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:51,120
And then establish and exchange
a encryption key for the communication.

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,307
Then they use symmetric ciphers, and

16
00:00:53,307 --> 00:00:57,370
the established encryption key
to encrypt data and traffic.

17
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:02,200
They can also use asymmetric ciphers
to digitally sign the data, so

18
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,516
that they can ensure data authenticity.
