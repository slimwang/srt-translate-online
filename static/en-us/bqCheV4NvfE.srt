00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,719
This lesson is about the policies and

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:06,000
programs the US Federal Government
has created

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,540
to encourage the adoption of electronic
records and other health IT tools.

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,950
And to provide incentives for

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,720
their use in ways that will improve
the quality and efficiency of care.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,050
Healthcare providers have had
a financial incentive to do

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,280
all available tests and
procedures once someone is sick.

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,970
And have had little or no incentive
to keep their patients well.

9
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,630
Until recently there was
no incentive except for

10
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:36,070
special situations like HMOs
that we discussed in lesson one,

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:41,170
to invest money in health IT systems
that might actually reduce income

12
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:45,800
by helping avoid unnecessary or
duplicative tests and procedures.

13
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,700
These incentives are often referred to
as pay for performance, or P for P.

14
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,900
In the typical P for P system, providers
are rewarded for doing tests and

15
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,210
procedures that scientific evidence
suggests are beneficial for

16
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,840
either managing or
preventing chronic disease.

17
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,890
For diabetes this might be an annual
blood test called hemoglobin A1C

18
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,970
that we'll discuss later on.

19
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,130
It might also be screening their
patients for obesity and smoking and

20
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,090
counseling them to lose weight or quit.
