1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,555
Now for this example we're going to
look at a function called ColorFromHex.

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,770
This function takes color represented
as an integer, specifically a UInt32 or

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,530
32 bit integer.

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,893
Now we're going to use hexidecimal
notation, because it's easier to read.

5
00:00:15,893 --> 00:00:18,629
You may have seen colors represented
this way if you've worked in web

6
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:19,308
design before.

7
00:00:19,308 --> 00:00:25,090
When a color's represented with six
hex digits, like this pink color here,

8
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,900
the first two hex digits represent
the red part of the color.

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,670
So this cc represents
the red part of the color.

10
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,980
The next two digit represent
the green part of the color.

11
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,400
And the last two digits represent
the blue part of the color.

12
00:00:39,758 --> 00:00:44,650
So the ColorFromHex function is going to
use the bitwise & operator to isolate

13
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:45,960
each of these component parts.

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,390
It's going to isolate the red part,
the green part and the blue part.

15
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,396
That's what's happening with each
of these bitwise & operators here.

16
00:00:53,396 --> 00:00:56,924
Then, with the shift operator,
it converts the R, G, and

17
00:00:56,924 --> 00:01:00,400
B components into a number
that's between 0 and 255.

18
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,360
Finally, it divides the RGB components
by 255 so that the number is

19
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,650
fixed between 0 and 1, because that's
how a UI color is constructed.

20
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,910
If you had trouble following that,
then don't despair.

21
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:18,580
I've included a fun link, here,
to a video that really captures how red,

22
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,150
green, and blue values
are combined to create a color.

23
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,139
And if you look down here at the bottom
where we've called the function,

24
00:01:25,139 --> 00:01:28,290
we've actually split out pink into
its red, green, and blue components.

25
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,920
And then we've printed out the colors
that combined to make this pink color.
