1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,210
For that, you'll need a more complex storage

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:06,860
system like WebSQL or IndexDB. WebSQL provides a sequel

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,870
light based database directly in the browser. You can

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,400
use sequel queries to access data and to find

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,980
relationships. And ,you can have structured data in

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,530
your value storage as well. Now, this is significantly

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,510
more complex. Than the simple and limited key value

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,550
storage and local store. However, there's two main problems

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,450
with it. The first problem is, although this

10
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,950
API is available in Chrome, Safari, and Opera

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,100
and IOS Safari in the Android browser, even,

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,750
it's not available on IE or Firefox. The

13
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,650
second problem is clear from the specification, which

14
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,580
is no longer being maintained. In short, web

15
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,990
sequel is a dead end. It's out there

16
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,680
in Chrome, the Android browsers, Safari and IOS

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,250
Safari, and Opera. But, it's not available in IE

18
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,270
or Firefox ,and it's likely that it never will be.
