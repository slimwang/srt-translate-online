00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,560
Here's the project in Adam and

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,250
let's look through some
of the files it gives us.

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:09,990
We've got a bunch of files for
set up, package managers and testing.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:16,160
Up in the directories the important
ones are public, dist, config, and app.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,680
You put your static assets like
font files and images in here.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,980
When you're ready to move your site
to the web, Ember can build and

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,410
bundle everything together and
put it in here.

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,020
Configure is where you add code that
changes the configuration of the project

9
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,698
or if the project needs to change
based on the environment it's in.

10
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:36,250
But probably 99% of your time will
be spent in the app directory.

11
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,450
Let's go through it.

12
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,420
Ember is highly dependent on routes.

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,910
So router dot.js is not
hidden away in a folder.

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,510
We'll be looking at routes and
routing next.

15
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:48,700
Here's the apps index file, we actually
won't really be touching any of this.

16
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,810
Here's the project's main set of file,
we also aren't going to be doing

17
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,270
anything in here either,
templates are very important to Ember.

18
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,600
Any HTML we write will be in here.

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,690
Remember when we looked at
our app in the browser and

20
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,600
it said welcome to Ember?

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,380
That file is right here.

22
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,540
Styles is for where we can put
any custom CSS for our project.

23
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,120
I said routing is important to Ember.

24
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,960
Not only is there router file, but
there's also this routes directory.

25
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,700
This is where individual
route files will live.

26
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,290
We'll be looking at this next.

27
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,690
Models is where we would put
schema files for the apps data.

28
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,450
If we want to add additional
functionality to our templates,

29
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,190
we'd create helper files and
place them in here.

30
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,480
In Ember, controllers are very
similar to components and

31
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,680
are actually being phased
out in future versions.

32
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,880
So we won't be working with controllers.

33
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,910
Ember makes it really easy to create
our own custom HTML elements.

34
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,770
It refers to them as components.

35
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:43,730
The functionality goes in here, while
a component's HTML file goes in here.

36
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,350
All of this was generated
with the ember-new command.

37
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,410
Ember favors convention
over configuration,

38
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,690
meaning that Ember has its
way of doing things and

39
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:54,950
as long as you do it the Ember way, you
won't have to worry about configuration.

40
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,290
An example of this is where to
put a file and how to name it.

41
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,640
A component has to live in
the components directory and

42
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,280
be named a certain way.

43
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,850
We don't want to worry about all
of embers conventions though, so

44
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,410
we'll just use embers CLI to
generate and maintain our files.

45
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,230
The first thing to do with
a new app is to set up routing.

46
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,360
So let's set up some routes.
