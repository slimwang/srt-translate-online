1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,944
You've made a good point.

2
00:00:01,944 --> 00:00:02,510
Hm.
So

3
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:06,230
Firebase is not storing all of the data
that you need to represent a user

4
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,550
in the AuthData object.

5
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:08,480
Don't get me wrong,

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,520
when you log in, Firebase does provide
a bit of information about the user, and

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,620
it passes along most of that
information in the AuthData object.

8
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,130
But the pivotal thing is that you can't
control the properties that are stored

9
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,670
in the AuthData object.

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,080
If you need to associate data with
a user beyond whats in the AuthData

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,420
object, you need to explicitly store
it in your own Firebase database.

12
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,090
And because Firebase doesn't store a lot
of app-specific data about the user.

13
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,590
This is a fairly common
practice among devs.

14
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,940
Many developers will have user objects
that hold app-specific user information

15
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,200
that not available in
the AuthData object.

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,160
So, as we have done other times in
the app when we need to create new data,

17
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,600
we are going to make a POJO.

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,100
>> Yehey!

19
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,300
>> Your POJO should include a Name,
an Email for

20
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,700
convenience although it is technically
part of the AuthData object.

21
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,530
And a Timestamp for
when the user joined.

22
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,480
Now, what I want to know is
where in the code should you add

23
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,820
your new users to Firebase?

24
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,230
Well, there are two ways
that a user can log in.

25
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,630
With Google and
then with email and password.

26
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,680
And the code watch would be
a bit different for each.

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,080
So I'm going to start with a spec for
implementing the email and

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,490
password functionality.

29
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,110
Okay, so in what class do you
think you should create and

30
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,270
write your users to
the Firebase database?

31
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,950
Specifically for
the email password provider.

32
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,170
You can put your answer here.
