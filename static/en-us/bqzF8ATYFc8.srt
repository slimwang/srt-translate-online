00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,335
You may have heard about special right triangles before. They're special,

2
00:00:03,335 --> 00:00:07,310
because they have a 90 degree angle for one of their angles. We're going to

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:12,556
take a closer look at this one. It's a 3, 4, 5 right triangle. We call it that,

4
00:00:12,556 --> 00:00:18,500
since the ratio of the legs is 3 to 4 and the hypotenuse is 5. The legs are

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,258
just the sides of the triangle that form the right angle. And the hypotenuse is

6
00:00:22,258 --> 00:00:26,938
the side that is directly across from the 90 degree angle. Not only is the

7
00:00:26,938 --> 00:00:30,394
hypotenuse across from the 90 degree angle, it's also the longest side of the

8
00:00:30,394 --> 00:00:34,778
entire triangle. We're going to look at an interesting relationship between the

9
00:00:34,778 --> 00:00:39,298
legs of the triangle and the hypotenuse. I'm going to shrink the triangle, and

10
00:00:39,298 --> 00:00:46,150
then I'm going to draw boxes off of each of the legs and the hypotenuse. These

11
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,498
boxes are actually squares, so this square has side lengths of three, this

12
00:00:49,498 --> 00:00:54,587
square has side lengths of four, and this square has side lengths of five. What

13
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:59,480
I want you to do is to tell me the area of each of these squares. You can type

14
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,960
those numbers here.
