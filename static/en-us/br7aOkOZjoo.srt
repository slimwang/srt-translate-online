1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:06,630
And the answer is 0.78. And the way I got this, you might have picked point C1.

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:14,620
That happens with 0.3 probability, and then we have a 0.5 chance to find heads.

3
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:19,322
Or we might have picked coin two, which has a probability of 1 minus 0.3, 0.7,

4
00:00:19,322 --> 00:00:25,804
and then chance of seeing head is 0.9. We work this all out, we get 0.78.
