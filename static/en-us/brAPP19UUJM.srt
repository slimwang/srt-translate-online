1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,120
Research has shown that this process
is subject to at least three

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,930
common sources of error,
an incomplete knowledge base.

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,530
The physician can't know everything
given the rapidly increasing store house

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,255
of medical research and knowledge.

5
00:00:14,255 --> 00:00:17,490
And error in perception or judgement.

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,050
Physicians are still human and
are subject to human error.

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,760
And a lapse an attention.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,130
Physicians are also very busy and
may not sufficiently focus on each case.
