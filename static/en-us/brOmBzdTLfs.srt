1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,526
Here we talked about
the nature of the data, okay?

2
00:00:02,526 --> 00:00:05,160
It's sensitive data who
gets paid how much.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,649
Company obviously doesn't want to
disclose that to people for

4
00:00:08,649 --> 00:00:11,499
whatever reasons,
even within the company or outside.

5
00:00:11,499 --> 00:00:15,852
So the user who is creating this file
is obviously should not be able to

6
00:00:15,852 --> 00:00:18,568
share it with whoever he or
she feels like.

7
00:00:18,568 --> 00:00:20,840
Even if they try to be cautious and

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,233
careful, remember, they can make
a mistake or they may not be.

9
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:29,529
We talk about going back to threat
models, talk about insider threat.

10
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:34,067
Someone can be unhappy and do
something that could harm the company.

11
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:38,328
So it shouldn't be at the discretion
of this user who is creating a file.

12
00:00:38,328 --> 00:00:43,218
This kind of data really needs to, the
company needs to, not just mandate but

13
00:00:43,218 --> 00:00:45,108
control how it can be shared.

14
00:00:45,108 --> 00:00:49,695
So, really, this is an example
of where a mandatory access

15
00:00:49,695 --> 00:00:54,468
control model would be the right one for
controlling access to

16
00:00:54,468 --> 00:00:58,995
the data that is in this file
that has people's salaries.

17
00:00:58,995 --> 00:01:01,837
DAC and MAC,
these are two different models.

18
00:01:01,837 --> 00:01:06,677
And this is a scenario where DAC is
not going to be able to address or

19
00:01:06,677 --> 00:01:11,430
meet the needs that we have for
how this data should be accessed.
