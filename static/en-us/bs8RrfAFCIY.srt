1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,661
Well, there's 1 row of pixels which is not diverged down here,

2
00:00:03,661 --> 00:00:07,288
1 row of pixels which are not diverged down here.

3
00:00:07,288 --> 00:00:15,235
So there's 1022 rows of pixels that do have diverged warps, 1 here and 1 here, 1 on each side.

4
00:00:15,235 --> 00:00:24,576
So the answer is 1022 times 2 warps, which is 2044 warps or 1920 threads.

5
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:27,373
And we launched a million threads to deal with a million pixels in this image,

6
00:00:27,373 --> 00:00:32,770
so that means that just over 6% of the threads in this entire kernel

7
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,981
are running at perhaps half efficiency for part of the kernel,

8
00:00:36,981 --> 00:00:40,256
which is probably not worth trying to optimize.
