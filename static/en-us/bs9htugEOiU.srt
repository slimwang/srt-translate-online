00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,171
jQuery makes it really easy to select specific elements in the DOM.

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:08,329
If I wanted to select an element like this one, for example, or

3
00:00:08,329 --> 00:00:13,585
maybe if I wanted to collect a collection of elements like these two list items,

4
00:00:13,585 --> 00:00:17,920
I can use jQuery selectors to quickly access them.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,348
Remember how we could pass a string into the jQuery object?

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,060
We call this string a jQuery selector in that it

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,530
allows us to select a part of the DOM.

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,950
You can use jQuery to select a collection of DOM elements based on tag name,

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,450
class name, or id.

10
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,270
I'll start with selectors by tag name.

11
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,370
Passing the string of the tag name will result in a jQuery collection of all

12
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,140
the elements of a certain tag.

13
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,382
I'll test this by opening up my browser's JavaScript console on the Udacity Web

14
00:00:50,382 --> 00:00:52,810
site, which, as you may remember, uses jQuery.

15
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,580
If I wanted to do something with all the divs on the screen,

16
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,480
I could select them by passing div into the jQuery object.

17
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,360
And there we go.

18
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,410
We can open up the object that got returned to see a collection of DOM elements.

19
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:09,560
In a moment, you'll be trying out selectors by manipulating a real Web site.

20
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,698
In index.html, you'll find the site's HTML.

21
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:17,411
In an app.js, you'll be writing JavaScript to modify the page.

22
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,280
You can press the Test Run button to see what the page looks like.

23
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,220
Notice how we have this comment in the app.js file.

24
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,126
For this quiz, set the listElements variable equal to a jQuery collection of

25
00:01:30,126 --> 00:01:32,295
all the list elements on the page.

26
00:01:32,295 --> 00:01:34,030
Hit Submit when you're done.

27
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,250
Here's a quick hint.

28
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,848
You can check your answer with a console.

29
00:01:36,848 --> 00:01:40,762
If you console.log the listElements variable, you can open up the browser

30
00:01:40,762 --> 00:01:44,631
console to see if you've selected the jQuery collection that you wanted.
