1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,090
What resources can partners bring?

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,270
Well, obviously if they have something you need

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,180
that you normally would have to develop

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,370
and they would sell to you or license to you,

5
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,120
that allows for you to get to market faster.

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,620
Or, it might be a complementary product or service

7
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,090
that you just couldn't afford to build or can't get around to for a while,

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,590
and that allows you to offer a broader product offering.

9
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,300
Or, yes you could do it, and you could probably do it in the same time,

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,180
buy why do something that's their expertise with your money?

11
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:35,320
It might just be easy to buy their product, integrate it in yours,

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,680
and now all of a sudden you're no longer doing their invention

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,310
but focusing on your core business.

14
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,950
For start-ups, trying to understand what it is you want to focus on

15
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:51,170
versus what is it you require in terms of activities and resources and suppliers

16
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,830
is a real strategy. Partnerships are not kind of an add-on.

17
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:59,410
They really allow you to capitalize on the unique customer knowledge

18
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,230
or expertise of others.

19
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:05,160
The final reason is, they might be channel partners

20
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,740
or they might be partners overseas to new markets

21
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,250
that you weren't planning to get to this year or even this decade

22
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,280
and allows you to generate a source of income

23
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,920
that would be unavailable to you for years.
