00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,020
If you open up this tutorial site,

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,150
there's a lot of great
information about intents.

3
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,870
We give you a hint to look at section
one dot two about starting activities.

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,930
There's a nice diagram about one
activity opening another activity.

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,290
The sample code also
looks pretty interesting.

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,010
Assuming that this code is called
from within an activity file,

7
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,902
we create a new intent using a
constructor where we pass in two inputs.

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,700
Here's the Android intent
documentation page and

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,270
this is the constructor we're calling.

10
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,140
We need to pass in a context and
a cost component.

11
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,080
All right, so back to the sample code.

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,110
This first input needs to be
the context, so we pass in this.

13
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,050
Which were first the current activity.

14
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,410
In general, the context will help
the intent know more about the current

15
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:42,370
state of the app.

16
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,980
So, that I can put the second activity
in front of the current activity and

17
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,020
later, the back button
on the device will work.

18
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,800
The second input of this constructor is,
to take in a class component.

19
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,210
This is the name of the activity we
want to open, which is activity two.

20
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,100
We need the DOT class
extension at the end,

21
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,810
to identify this specific Java class.

22
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,050
The new intent is created and
stored in a variable called I.

23
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,700
Then in this next line of code,
we call the start activity method and

24
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,930
pass in the intent I as our input.

25
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,420
So this allows Android to start
a new activity, called Activity two.

26
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,300
Let's copy this code and
see if we can use it in our app.

27
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,950
And, it looks like we get
an error in Android studio,

28
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,730
saying that it cannot resolve
the symbol, ActivityTwo.

29
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:25,890
And that's because there is no activity
in our app called ActivityTwo.

30
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,710
Let's rename it NumbersActivity,
which we do have in our app and

31
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,730
that seems to resolve all the errors.

32
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,470
So let's go ahead and
run this on our device.

33
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,570
Nice, it works.

34
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,780
Now, we haven't formally
discussed what we just did though.

35
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,480
So, let's unpack everything and
see what's actually what happened.
