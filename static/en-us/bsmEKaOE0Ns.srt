1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
And, of course, there's going to be more challenging quizzes here,

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,510
but for a warmup I think it is very good to understand the difference

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,480
between computability and complexity theory.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,250
The first question, how fast a computer can find a way between 2 points on a map,

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:16,880
belongs in complexity theory because here it's a question of resources.

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,430
So "how fast," that is a question about the time that a computer needs,

7
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,990
and therefore, investigating this question belongs in complexity theory.

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:30,300
Asking if a program can decide if another program is malware,

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,640
that belongs in computability because we are not asking

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,960
about any resources, we're just if it's possible in principle.

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,780
We're asking, "Can a program do that?"

12
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,350
We're not asking how fast or with how much memory it can do that.

13
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,790
In the third question we are, again, asking about resources.

14
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:54,290
We're asking about how much memory, and therefore, this 1 belongs in complexity theory.

15
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:58,840
The question about memory is something we are not going to look at much in this course.

16
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,460
Actually, I think we are not going to look at it at all.

17
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:06,770
We're going to be concerned mostly with time, how fast a computer can solve a given problem,

18
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,470
and, toward the end of this unit, we are going to pose the ultimate resource question

19
00:01:11,470 --> 99:59:59,999
and ask, "What are the limits of computation in general?
