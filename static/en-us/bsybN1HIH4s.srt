00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,748
>> So now, you've learned about three measures of center, the mean, median, and

2
00:00:04,748 --> 00:00:09,800
mode. Now, for your final quiz, we're going to solidify the ideas that we talked

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,887
about in this lesson with the pros and cons of each. Which of these have simple

4
00:00:14,887 --> 00:00:20,217
equations or will always change if any data value changes? Which of these are

5
00:00:20,217 --> 00:00:25,352
not affected by change in bin size? Which of these are not affected severely by

6
00:00:25,352 --> 00:00:30,635
outliers? And finally, which of these is easy to find on a histogram? Remember,

7
00:00:30,635 --> 00:00:35,856
that bin size refers to when we're creating the histogram of the data. So, check

8
00:00:35,856 --> 00:00:40,754
which ones apply to each of these measures of center, and that's your final

9
00:00:40,754 --> 00:00:41,187
quiz.
