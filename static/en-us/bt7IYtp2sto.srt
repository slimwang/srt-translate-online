1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,105
This notation is very succinct.

2
00:00:02,105 --> 00:00:06,520
And so we can actually rewrite some
things that we've talked about already

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,470
in this very nice operator based form.

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,990
And it makes it look smaller, and
neater, and easier to work with.

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:15,250
So just to try to prove that to you,

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:21,310
the equation Q star, that's a value
function, equals B applied to Q star

7
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,630
is another way of writing something that
we've talked about a bunch of times.

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,460
So I was hoping you'd be
able to fill that in here.

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,773
And also, the notion that if we
define some value function Qt to be,

10
00:00:32,773 --> 00:00:38,180
like a whole sequence of value
functions, where each value function

11
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:43,050
Qt is defined as the Bellman
operator applied to Q(t-1).

12
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,739
These both are things that weâ€™ve
talked about and have names,

13
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:50,300
and I just want to try to get you
to connect those to each other.

14
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,880
>> Okay, I will do my best.
