00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,520
As I mentioned earlier, Quicksilver was done in

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,880
the early 80s, and here is a sketch reproduced

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,870
from their paper. An interesting thing that you

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,016
notice is that this sketch is very similar to

5
00:00:11,016 --> 00:00:13,046
what I showed you as the current structure

6
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:16,410
of network operating systems in the earlier panel. It's

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,740
a microkernel based design and Quicksilver was the

8
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,600
same vintage as Mach from CMU. And having seen

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,120
the structure of operating systems in

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,560
earlier lessons, this picture should be very

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,770
familiar to you, that all the system

12
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:38,190
services are provided above the microkernel. And

13
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,500
the microkernel is only responsible for Process

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,420
Management, IPC, and Machine Control, and all

15
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,120
of the system services such as Window

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,300
Manager, File System, Virtual Memory, and Communication,

17
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,550
all of them sit above the microkernel,

18
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,740
and the system services are implemented as

19
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,350
server processes. Now, the late 80's was

20
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,070
exciting time for distributed systems. There were no

21
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,940
laptops in that time. We were moving

22
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,680
from CRT terminals, Cathode Ray Terminals, connected to

23
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,870
mainframe to the era of office workstations,

24
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,920
what we routinely call as desktops these days.

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,060
Quicksilver was conceived as a workstation operating

26
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,870
system. And the ideas that are enshrined

27
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:27,560
in the Quicksilver operating system predates over

28
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,070
concurrent with many things that we take for

29
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:33,330
granted today, such as network file system,

30
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,120
remote procedure call, the Internet, the World Wide

31
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,170
Web, and so on. What sets Quicksilver

32
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,330
apart from the competition at that time when

33
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:47,630
new services such as window manager for managing the real estate on the

34
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,910
workstation screen and how it should be

35
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,780
integrated into the operating system as a

36
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,350
whole? Services that may not be available

37
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,520
in the workstation itself, for example, a

38
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,600
file server maybe remote. So integrating communication

39
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,600
into the design of the operating system

40
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:14,260
was key and services that are within a workstation and across workstation

41
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:19,660
on the network in the distributed system need to recover from failures. Rather

42
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:26,290
than ad hoc mechanism for each server to recover from such failures, Quicksilver

43
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:29,420
was the first to propose transaction

44
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,470
as a unifying concept for recovery management

45
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,723
of the servers. It was the first

46
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:39,557
operating system to propose transactions in operating systems

47
00:02:39,557 --> 00:02:42,610
and that's the reason you see transaction manager

48
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,811
as part of the service provided by the

49
00:02:44,811 --> 00:02:48,370
operating system. A quick personal note, I

50
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,905
was a graduate student at University of Wisconsin,

51
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:54,780
Madison in the early '80s, and spent a

52
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,210
year in IBM research working with the group

53
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:02,740
that conceived and designed this Quicksilver operating

54
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,100
system. My dissertation research, which was on

55
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,370
hardware support for inter process communication, used

56
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,990
as an experimental platform, a precursor to

57
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,250
the Quicksilver operating system which is called

58
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,760
925. Recall what I told you earlier

59
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,360
that Quicksilver was intended as a workstation

60
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,650
operating system, and 925 was the name

61
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,350
of the operating system that was a precursor to Quicksilver.

62
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,270
And as you can imagine this is a pun on

63
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:36,555
office workstation nine to five. That was the name given

64
00:03:36,555 --> 00:03:40,420
to internally to the precursor of the Quicksilver operating system.
