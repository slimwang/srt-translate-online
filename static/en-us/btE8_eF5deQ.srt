>> I know the second rate must be 8% because that was from our other fund. The

2
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:11,579
second amount was y. That's the amount we invested at 8%. We don't know it, so

3
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:17,487
that goes here. We convert 8% to a decimal and get 0.08y or .08 times y. Our

00:00:17,487 --> 00:00:23,121
total interest we actually knew. We gained $787.50. So that goes here. This quiz

00:00:23,121 --> 00:00:26,854
is pretty tough, and there's a lot of algebraic reasoning going on. So don't

can continue to make sense of this word problem.
