1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the result, once again, is found in the truth table,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
which is why this table is so powerful.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Let's look at where in the truth table we get a positive test result.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I would say it is right here,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
right here.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If you take corresponding probabilities of

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
0.09 and 0.18,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and add them up,

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
we get 0.27,

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,693
and that's the correct answer for getting a positive result.
