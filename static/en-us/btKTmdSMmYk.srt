00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now let's look at the relationship between correlation and regression

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
as we make changes to our data.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's consider the following simple data set.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We have x of 1, 2, and 3 and y of 4, 7, and 13.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Consider the regression coefficient for the equation y = bx + a

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and the correlation coefficient.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
