1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,330
Once the layout is mostly done,

2
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:04,678
you can start dealing with all the fun visual stuff like the background colors,

3
00:00:04,678 --> 00:00:08,460
the margins, the padding, the borders, the fonts, etc.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,620
Colors and margins are pretty easy to test with Dev tools as we've seen so

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,280
far, but what about fonts?

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,230
How do you find a font that looks close enough to the one that was

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,720
provided in the design?

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,900
There's really no super easy way to do that apart from asking the designer to

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,360
kindly use the free web fonts and then tell you which one they used.

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,675
That might not work however, so you might be left with the task of going

11
00:00:28,675 --> 00:00:32,710
online to find the closest web font that matches what you had in the design and

12
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,640
one of the best places to get fonts is with Google at Google.com/fonts.

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,190
It's fun to go on here and just browse around to see what you can find.

14
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,100
You can look around, you can filter, and

15
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,290
then find a font that looks closest to what you're given in the design.

16
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,260
All right, I like this one.

17
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,600
It looks kind of close to my handwriting, but not really.

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,910
Anyways, let's click on this and we can go ahead and add it to our website.

19
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,780
We'll scroll down and then all we have to do is add this code.

20
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:56,920
So I'll click on it and

21
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,990
copy it and then we'll come up here to the head of our document and paste it in.

22
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:04,819
So the link that we just copied from Google tells browsers to download the font,

23
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:08,840
but we still need to go into CSS and make sure the font is actually being used.

24
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,770
Back in the Google Fonts page, I'm just going to go ahead and

25
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:15,940
copy this code right here, and I'll past this into our CSS file.

26
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,750
In this case, I'm applying the font family Indie Flower,

27
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,840
which we are going to download to everything on the page,

28
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,270
and we know it's everything because of this asterisk.

29
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,180
So I'll save the CSS and let's reload the page.

30
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,760
When I hit refresh, we should see this font change and there we go.

31
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,000
Our new font has now been applied to the page.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,620
Scrolling down, we should see it on everything.

33
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,250
There we go, our featured work, appify, appify, and

34
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,600
appify all have the cool new font now.

35
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,810
Play around with Google fonts for

36
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,120
a bit and then see if you can answer this question.

37
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,120
Which of these fonts is closest to the font that we see in the mock up?

38
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,780
Is it Play, Rambla, Lato, or Orbitron?
