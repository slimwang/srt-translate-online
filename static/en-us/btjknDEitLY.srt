1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,199
So here is the answer, I feed in all the missing

2
00:00:02,199 --> 00:00:05,524
values for you. And let’s try to check a few.

3
00:00:05,524 --> 00:00:08,482
For example, let’s take the elements related to

4
00:00:08,482 --> 00:00:12,011
X1. We move from X0 to X1 which added one

5
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:13,999
of the remainder indiscernible . We move

6
00:00:13,999 --> 00:00:15,970
from X1 to X2, which added another one, so

7
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,629
we have two, but we also had one observation

8
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:22,793
in X1, we incremented by two because of the

9
00:00:22,793 --> 00:00:27,045
measurement string, 0.5. One over that is 2

10
00:00:27,045 --> 00:00:28,613
so when we added the measurement end up

11
00:00:28,613 --> 00:00:30,496
with 4. Let’s pick this off tagging element over

12
00:00:30,496 --> 00:00:33,283
here. This was only affected when moving from

13
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:36,340
X1 to X2 and it was a minus 1. This element

14
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:41,017
over here was affected when we sensed L1 from

15
00:00:41,017 --> 00:00:43,417
X1 and again the off tagging element is

16
00:00:43,417 --> 00:00:46,668
negative. So we added minus 2 over here.

17
00:00:46,668 --> 00:00:48,531
It’s quite involved, as you can see. Let’s

18
00:00:48,531 --> 00:00:50,411
take a number on the right side, the minus 2

19
00:00:50,411 --> 00:00:53,088
over here. This is adding up a re-contribution

20
00:00:53,088 --> 00:00:56,219
to X2. The first one occurred when we moved

21
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,151
into X2 from X1 at which point we added two

22
00:01:01,151 --> 00:01:04,325
. But in X2 we also measure length by L1 with

23
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:07,092
a measurement value of two. We have to multiply

24
00:01:07,092 --> 00:01:12,726
that for a two to arrive at four and subtract it,

25
00:01:12,726 --> 00:01:14,257
so we have made minus four, you get

26
00:01:14,257 --> 00:01:16,971
the minus two. If you work out at all these

27
00:01:16,971 --> 00:01:21,131
examples, using the math we explained in class

28
00:01:21,131 --> 00:01:22,959
and working in the effective measurements get

29
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,226
a default effect of two for every value you add,

30
00:01:26,226 --> 00:01:28,443
you arrive at exactly this matrix over

31
00:01:28,443 --> 00:01:30,196
here. I hope you got a good number

32
00:01:30,196 --> 00:01:34,000
of numbers right that was not an easy task.
