00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,490
To begin, you want to get your
project up-to-date for this task.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,370
To do that, on the command line
in the wittr project directory

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,718
run git reset hard to get rid
of any local changes you have.

4
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:13,100
And git checkout log request
gets the project into the state

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,021
where it's registering a service
worker and logging requests.

6
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:21,790
Over in the service worker script file,
public/js/sw/index.js.

7
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,450
It's just logging requests.

8
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:27,520
I want you to alter the service
worker so it responds with some HTML.

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,665
It can be whatever HTML you want as
long as it includes the class name

10
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:33,960
a-winner-is-me.

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,000
So a strong tag with
the class a-winner-is-me

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,050
would be a valid response for this task.

13
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,250
Once you've written the code,
test it's working in the browser.

14
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,636
Like we saw Jake do in the previous
chapter, in the sources tab,

15
00:00:46,636 --> 00:00:50,543
check Force update on page load so
you can see your changes straight away.

16
00:00:50,543 --> 00:00:53,371
You'll know what's working
when you refresh the page and

17
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:55,720
you get something like this.

18
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,010
To confirm everything's working,
head over to the settings page and

19
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,640
type HTML response into
the test field and press enter.

20
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,425
This will double-check if
everything is working.
