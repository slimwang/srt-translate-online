00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,230
Now we've heard from Ashok,
from Sebastian and

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,490
from myself about what
artificial intelligence is.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,415
Notice especially though what
Sebastian said about Bayes' rule and

4
00:00:08,415 --> 00:00:09,460
Bayes' networking.

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,630
AI is partially about discerning
the unseen cause of the data

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,290
that we can see.

7
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,850
There's another place where we do
that a lot though, data science.

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,710
A large part of data science is
looking at patterns in data and

9
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,690
hypothesizing a cause.

10
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,460
So let's briefly hear from Dave Holtz
and you'd ask if he's data science

11
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,250
course about their perspective
on these kinds of problems.
