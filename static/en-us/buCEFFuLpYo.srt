00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,200
In this video, I'll show you how to install

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,350
R Studio, which is a graphical interface for programming with

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,650
the R language. Simply open up any web browser and

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,262
go to RStudio.com then you want to go to download now.

5
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:14,800
You are going to run R Studio from your desktop so

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,790
click on this link. Now here's where I want you

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:22,160
to be very careful. R studio requires R first, so

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,310
if you don't already have the programming language R installed,

9
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,540
you need to download it here. Now this is a really easy link to

10
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,530
miss so make sure you click here first to install R, before installing R studio.

11
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,430
Once you're at cran.rstudio.com, you want to select

12
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,290
the download for the Mac OSX version. This

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,740
will bring up another page and then you can download the latest version of R.

14
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,170
It may take some time to download so you might

15
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,650
want to take a break and then come back to the

16
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,330
computer. Once you've opened up the package, follow the instructions for

17
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,740
installing R. You should end up getting a successful message for

18
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,670
the installation. Now you're ready to go and install R

19
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,600
studio. The website will recommend the best version of RStudio for

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,010
you so just click on whatever one comes up for you

21
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:11,050
first. Once you've downloaded this, you want to open that package. Now,

22
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,160
