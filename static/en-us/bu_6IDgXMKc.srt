00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,959
From the last problem, we found out there is an infinite number of solutions to

2
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:07,993
this inequality. We know a way to write those answers. And, I don't want to list

3
00:00:08,005 --> 00:00:12,058
them out because that could be tedious. So, let's use a solution set. A solution

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,568
set is all the answers to this inequality. To find them, we solve this

5
00:00:15,581 --> 00:00:19,609
inequality just like we solve an equation. We subtract 2 from both sides to get

6
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:23,993
3 x is greater than 6. Then, we divide both sides by the coefficient in front of

7
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:28,210
the variable, we divide by 3. And the answer is x is greater than 2. So, any

8
00:00:28,222 --> 00:00:32,743
number larger than 2 will make this inequality true. Let's use the solution set

9
00:00:32,755 --> 00:00:36,998
to write our answer. We can show the solution in two ways. We can use a number

10
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:41,485
line or interval notation. We use an open parentheses at x equals 2 because x

11
00:00:41,497 --> 00:00:45,903
can't actually equal 2, its got to be bigger than 2. And then, we draw an arrow

12
00:00:45,915 --> 00:00:50,360
in the direction of the numbers that are all bigger than 2. 2 is considered to

13
00:00:50,372 --> 00:00:55,168
be the lower bound of our solution set. We use an open parentheses for 2 so that

14
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,099
we don't include it. We can remember, because is we plug in 2 here, we'll get 8

15
00:00:59,111 --> 00:01:03,350
greater than 8, which isn't true. So, we don't include 2 in the solution. We use

16
00:01:03,362 --> 00:01:07,342
an open parenthesis for positive infinity because we can't actually reach

17
00:01:07,354 --> 00:01:11,425
infinity. Any number bigger than 2 will work. You might be used to seeing an

18
00:01:11,437 --> 00:01:15,424
open circle at 2, which is correct. For this class, though, we'll only use the

19
00:01:15,436 --> 00:01:18,220
parenthesis when showing answers on the number line.
