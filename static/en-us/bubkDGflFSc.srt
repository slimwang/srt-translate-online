The answer is that scaling and translation transforms are being done. There are

2
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:07,595
two ways to solve this problem. One is to look at the matrix and see if there

3
00:00:07,595 --> 00:00:11,320
is some sort of scaling and translation happening. The other is to realize what

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,929
the transform is doing. It's defining a regular box in space by making it a

5
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:17,869
different size along each axis, that's a scale, and by moving its origin

6
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:22,467
elsewhere, that's a translation. Notice that if the left is equal to the

7
00:00:22,467 --> 00:00:25,475
negative of the right, which is the common case, the x translation value will

8
00:00:25,475 --> 00:00:29,940
be zero. Similarly, if the bottom limit is equal to the negative of the top,

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,522
the y translation value is also zero. This means the box is centered along the

10
00:00:34,522 --> 00:00:38,350
negative z view axis, and so doesn't need to be translated in these directions.
