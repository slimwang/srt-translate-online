00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So I'm going to introduce a cipher called the One-Time Pad,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and this is actually a perfect cipher,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and we'll define more precisely what that means,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
but it's a cipher that reveals no information at all about the key or the message,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and it's actually the only one.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And--you might be wondering--well, if we're starting right at the beginning of the class

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
with a perfect cipher, what's there left to do?

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's perfect, but it's very impractical.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And the reason it's very impractical is because it requires huge keys.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So to understand the One-Time Pad, the first thing we need to understand

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
is the XOR function--which is a name for the exclusive or--

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and it's often written as a plus with a circle around it.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The truth table for XOR is this:

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
the value of A XOR B is true if one of A or B--but only one of them--is true.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So that's why we end up with this truth table.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
XOR has lots of useful properties that make it the favorite function of every cryptographer,

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and I'll see if you can figure out one of these on your own.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So the question is: for any values X and Y,

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
what is the value of x XOR y XOR x?

20
00:01:12,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So here are your choices: 0, x, y, or it depends on x.
