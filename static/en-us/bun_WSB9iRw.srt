00:00:00,144 --> 00:00:03,781
Good morning, afternoon, or evening wherever you happen to be.

2
00:00:03,781 --> 00:00:07,509
This is John, and I'll be presenting Unit 1. So let's get started.

3
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:12,248
Like a lot of American kids, when I was probably 6 years old I tried to dig a hole to China.

4
00:00:12,248 --> 00:00:14,082
I know I'm not the only kid who tried this.

5
00:00:14,082 --> 00:00:17,923
In general, you can probably conclude that American kids are a, ambitious,

6
00:00:17,923 --> 00:00:20,334
and b, not particularly good at geography,

7
00:00:20,334 --> 00:00:22,017
at least when they're six years old.

8
00:00:22,017 --> 00:00:24,863
Needless to say I was not successful. Why?

9
00:00:24,863 --> 00:00:29,194
Besides having the attention span of a gnat, I just couldn't dig a hole fast enough.

10
00:00:29,194 --> 00:00:32,664
The question I'd like to pose today is how could you dig a hole faster?

11
00:00:32,664 --> 00:00:37,818
I also meant there's 3 ways I could have gone faster. One, dig faster.

12
00:00:37,818 --> 00:00:41,572
Instead of, say, removing one shovelful of dirt every 2 seconds

13
00:00:41,572 --> 00:00:45,246
maybe with a lot of effort I could have removed 1 shovelful every second.

14
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:49,349
This certainly would help, but I think we can all agree that there's a limit to this speeding up.

15
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:53,458
It's not likely I could go ten times as fast no matter how hard I work.

16
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:56,195
My shovel would probably explode.

17
00:00:56,195 --> 00:00:58,025
Two: buy a more productive shovel.

18
00:00:58,025 --> 00:01:03,153
Let's say a shovel with two or even three blades instead of one. An interesting approach.

19
00:01:03,153 --> 00:01:05,438
Perhaps a better shovel would make me more productive.

20
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,608
But again, I think we can agree there's diminishing returns in making shovels better.

21
00:01:09,608 --> 00:01:13,602
It's not likely I could use a 10- or 20-bladed shovel.

22
00:01:13,602 --> 00:01:16,014
And number 3, hire more diggers.

23
00:01:16,014 --> 00:01:20,479
I have a younger sister and a brother. Perhaps I could have persuaded them to help me dig faster.

24
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,684
This is probably the approach that would have been most productive overall toward my whole digging project.

25
00:01:25,684 --> 00:01:28,471
Of course, adding more diggers comes with it's own problems.

26
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:31,143
How do I manage them? Will they get in each other's way?

27
00:01:31,143 --> 00:01:34,869
Will more diggers help me dig my hole deeper instead of just wider?

28
00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:39,363
Well, as you probably figured out I am not just talking about digging holes.

29
00:01:39,363 --> 00:01:45,129
Each of these three methods for digging holes faster has a parallel in terms of building a faster processor.

30
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:48,611
When I talk about digging faster I'm actually talking about asking

31
00:01:48,611 --> 00:01:54,274
our processor should run with the faster clock to spend a shorter amount of time on each step of a 
computation.

32
00:01:54,274 --> 00:01:59,179
However, in a modern processor turning up clock speed also increases power consumption

33
00:01:59,179 --> 00:02:02,848
and we're the limit as far as power consumption on a chip.

34
00:02:02,848 --> 00:02:05,191
When I talk about buying a more productive shovel,

35
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:10,465
I'm actually talking about asking our processor to do more work on each step, on each clock cycle.

36
00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:13,242
But like the super shovel, a single processor has also reached

37
00:02:13,242 --> 00:02:16,379
diminishing returns on how much work it can do per cycle.

38
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:19,773
To be a little more technical, the most advanced CPUs are at a limit,

39
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:24,404
as far as how much instruction-level parallelism they can extract per clock cycle.

40
00:02:24,404 --> 00:02:26,754
And when I talk about hire more diggers,

41
00:02:26,754 --> 00:02:31,022
I'm referring to parallel computing in a way that we hope to teach you in this class.

42
00:02:31,022 --> 00:02:36,654
Instead of having one fast digger with an awesome shovel, we're going to have many diggers with many shovels.

43
00:02:36,654 --> 00:02:40,272
Instead of having one or just a few very powerful processors,

44
00:02:40,272 --> 00:02:43,971
we're going to have many, many weaker, less powerful processors.
