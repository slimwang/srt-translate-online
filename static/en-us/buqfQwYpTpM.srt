00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I think to some extent the answers here are debatable,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
but the best answer that I would give to this question is

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
definitely a software under test that interacts directly with hardware devices

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
would consider the timing of inputs important.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Also definitely software that interfaces with other machines on a network

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
might consider the timing of inputs important.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Software under test that's multi-threaded won't necessarily

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
depend on the time at which inputs are delivered,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
but it certainly might, and finally,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I would not consider software under test that prints time values into a log file

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
to necessarily depend on the timing that its inputs are delivered.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's this kind of software--of which there are many examples--

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
a software that does care about time values because it's printing them

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
but probably its logic doesn't depend on these time values

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
because they're just being output to a device, and they're not being

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
depended on in any meaningful way.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Again, your mileage may vary on this, but my opinion is that

18
00:00:53,000 --> 99:59:59,999
a, b, and c are the best answers.
