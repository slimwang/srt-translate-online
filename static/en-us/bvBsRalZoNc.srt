00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,830
Let's talk about JSON Web Tokens.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,410
They're often abbreviated as JWT and
they're pronounced like the English word

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:10,420
jot, like,
let me jot a note down about that, Sir.

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,240
JWT is a useful standard because
it sends information that can be

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,396
verified and
trusted with a digital signature.

6
00:00:15,396 --> 00:00:20,040
Additionally, JWTs are a compact means
of storing data that's easy to decode or

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,814
encode in most languages.

8
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:25,290
JWTs are also ideal for authentication
and information exchange because of

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,100
their size and
the fact that they can be signed.

10
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,859
The most common uses for
JWT is authentication, and

11
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:33,680
we'll explain how that's done soon.

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,380
Since JWTs can be signed, you can ensure
that senders are who they say they are,

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,790
and that data hasn't been tampered with.

14
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,380
Now, because of the benefits
I outlined earlier, and

15
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,910
because of their
simplicity to set up and

16
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,650
use, we'll be using JWTs in this
course to authenticate our services.
