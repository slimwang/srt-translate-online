00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,710
So let's see Java RMI at work. On

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:05,590
the server side, it's a three-step process to make

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:08,140
the server object visible on the network. You

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:13,910
instantiate the object. Once you instantiate the object, you

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:19,630
create a URL, whatever you want to call the URL. And then you go to the Java run

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,330
time, and the facility that's available in the Java

7
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,910
run time For binding the URL that you created

8
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,470
with the instance of the object that

9
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,920
you created. The object that you instantiated;

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:36,070
it binds it to this URL and it is now in the naming service

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:41,080
of the Java runtime system. For clients to be able to discover the existence

12
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,610
of this new service that you created and made it available on the network.
