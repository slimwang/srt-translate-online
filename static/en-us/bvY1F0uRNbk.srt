00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,120
Are you a robotics expert?

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,550
Because you've just
brought Giga Gal to life!

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:07,040
This level has had a lot
of challenging stuff in it,

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,000
figuring out how jumping should work,
keeping track of the complex set of

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,500
anums that define Giga Gal's state,
loading up all the right assets, and

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,890
making sure they're
drawn at the right time.

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,940
While jumping around
randomly sure is fun,

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,780
I think this game is missing something.

9
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,350
Maybe some platforms to jump on?
