00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,200
Here is a quick quiz analyzing
the memory requirements

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,170
of the three concurrency
models we talked about so far.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,990
The question is,
of the three models mentioned so

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,880
far, which model likely requires
least amount of memory?

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,649
The choices are the Boss-Worker Model,

6
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:19,910
the Pipeline Model and
the Even-Driven Model.

7
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,030
Also answer why you think that
this model requires the least

8
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,100
amount of memory to see if
your reasoning matches ours.
