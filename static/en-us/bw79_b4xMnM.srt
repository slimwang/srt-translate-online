00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,230
When discussing how to position
views in the last quiz,

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,160
you may have mentioned
using a relative layout.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,850
I know we did.

4
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,670
But I want to introduce you to another
way that you can build the layout for

5
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,890
our app that would be more ideal,
using nested viewgroups.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:18,120
Nested viewgroups means putting
viewgroups inside other viewgroups.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,150
That way you can build more interesting
and complex layouts like these.

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,050
Let's see how you would build
up one of these layouts.

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,620
Say, for example, you have a vertical
linear layout with three views,

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,840
an image view and two text views.

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,000
What if you wanted to overlay
some text on top of this image?

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,470
Well, with a linear layout,
you can't overlap views.

13
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,390
But with a relative layout, you can, so

14
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:42,470
we can replace this child with
a relative layout instead.

15
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,750
Then, we can put the image view
inside this relative layout.

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,950
This image view is now aligned to each
edge of the parent relative layout.

17
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,410
So, there you see an example of a
relative layout that's contained within

18
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,899
a larger linear layout.

19
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:59,850
You can have many combinations of
view groups within other view groups.

20
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,900
For instance, you can have a relative
layout as a root view for an app.

21
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,270
That can contain a couple of views
like an image view and two text views.

22
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:12,910
You can also add a linear layout as
a child of this broader relative layout.

23
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,490
This linear layout itself can contain
other children like two image views.

24
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,340
You can nest as many view groups
inside other view groups as you want.

25
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,540
However, be careful because
the more nesting that you do,

26
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,810
the more expensive it will be for
your app to lay out on the screen.

27
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,990
The relative layout, in particular, is a
very flexible layout but it can be very

28
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:39,490
complex to calculate the position of
each of these views relative to others.

29
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,380
So it's recommended to not have
too many layers of nesting

30
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,380
within a relative layout.

31
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,730
I pulled some examples from real life
Google apps to show you some cases where

32
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,840
it would be useful to
use nested view groups.

33
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,060
The Google Now app shows you
cards of relevant information

34
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,250
based on your current situation, like
the current time or current location.

35
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,310
If you like a certain
team like the Red Sox,

36
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,040
good choice, then it can show you
the score for the latest game.

37
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,570
To build out the layout for this card,
you can imagine using a vertical linear

38
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:12,160
layout because the information
is displayed as rows.

39
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,130
However, the first item in this vertical
linear layout is not just a single text

40
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,380
view, it's made up of multiple views.

41
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,562
In fact, you would build this first
item as a horizontal linear layout,

42
00:02:22,562 --> 00:02:25,325
made up of an image view and
two text views.

43
00:02:25,325 --> 00:02:28,085
Same for the second item in
this vertical linear layout.

44
00:02:28,085 --> 00:02:31,205
You would build it with a horizontal
linear layout containing an image view

45
00:02:31,205 --> 00:02:32,865
and two text views.

46
00:02:32,865 --> 00:02:35,785
Another card in the Google Now app
shows relevant stocks that you

47
00:02:35,785 --> 00:02:37,315
may be interested in.

48
00:02:37,315 --> 00:02:39,710
I wish the Google stock
was still at that price.

49
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:43,390
Anyways, you can also build out this
layout as a vertical linear layout,

50
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,740
because you can imagine the rows here.

51
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,410
Except these middle entries
aren't just a single text view,

52
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,640
they're made up of multiple text views.

53
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,280
For this line item relating
to the Google stock price,

54
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,340
you could use a horizontal linear layout
and fill it with four text views.

55
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,670
Same for the other stock prices as well.

56
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,690
These horizontal linear layouts
are children of this broader

57
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:03,620
vertical linear layout.

58
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:09,050
In the Google Play music app,
you can, of course, listen to music.

59
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,260
While this looks like
a complicated layout to build,

60
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,850
you can actually break it down into
smaller view groups that you recognize.

61
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,530
This pattern feels like
a vertical linear layout

62
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,260
with three different children.

63
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,620
This first child can be built
using a relative layout,

64
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,200
because the views
are relative to each other.

65
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,360
The second child can also be
built using a relative layout,

66
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,990
because the views
are overlapping each other.

67
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,800
And this third child here looks
like a horizontal linear layout

68
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,080
made up of five different buttons.

69
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,480
Again, we can use nested view
groups to build out this screen.

70
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,970
This is just one way to
build out the layout.

71
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,318
You can build it in many
other ways as well.

72
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:48,667
In the Google Maps app, earlier we
saw that there are detailed pages for

73
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:51,500
individual locations, like restaurants.

74
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,150
You can't build out this screen
with just a single linear layout or

75
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,420
a single relative layout.

76
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,740
You need to nest a bunch
of view groups together.

77
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,500
On a broad scale,

78
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,860
we can see that the information
is almost organized into rows.

79
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,400
So, we can use a vertical linear
layout as the parent view.

80
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,900
One child could be
this whole layout here.

81
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,330
Another child could be
this row of buttons.

82
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,725
Another child would be this
description and so on.

83
00:04:13,985 --> 00:04:16,894
But within each child is
not just a single view.

84
00:04:16,894 --> 00:04:18,935
We have multiple views.

85
00:04:18,935 --> 00:04:23,762
This child in the broader linear layout
is made up of three individual views.

86
00:04:23,762 --> 00:04:26,472
So you can use
a horizontal linear layout

87
00:04:26,472 --> 00:04:30,042
with equal weights to each view so
that they get spread out evenly.

88
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:34,662
This child in the broader vertical
linear layout can also be made

89
00:04:34,662 --> 00:04:37,636
up of a horizontal linear layout
with an image view and a text view.

90
00:04:37,636 --> 00:04:43,036
If you keep scrolling this page, you
see more information on the restaurant.

91
00:04:43,036 --> 00:04:47,276
Again, I can imagine the individual
rows of information here.

92
00:04:47,276 --> 00:04:49,873
Using a vertical linear layout for
all this information still works,

93
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:54,503
and, again, some rows are more
complex than just a single text view.

94
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:58,313
This row shows a bunch of available
times where you can make a reservation,

95
00:04:58,313 --> 00:05:01,143
and it's made up of three different
buttons that you can arrange using

96
00:05:01,143 --> 00:05:03,063
a horizontal linear layout.

97
00:05:03,063 --> 00:05:07,563
This row of pictures can be built using
a horizontal linear layout as well.

98
00:05:07,563 --> 00:05:10,383
And actually,
within this horizontal linear layout,

99
00:05:10,383 --> 00:05:13,360
this first child is not
just a single image view.

100
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,230
It's an image view with a text view.

101
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,680
So you could use a relative layout
to build out this first child.

102
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,520
So you could see how there can be
view groups, within view groups,

103
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,100
within view groups.

104
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,790
There's actually more view groups
beyond just relative layout,

105
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:30,905
and linear layout, there's also
frame layout and grid layout.

106
00:05:30,905 --> 00:05:33,705
We're not going to have time to cover
those in this course, but I definitely

107
00:05:33,705 --> 00:05:37,215
recommend that you go out and learn
about them on your own because sometimes

108
00:05:37,215 --> 00:05:39,796
those would be better than just
using a relative or a linear layout.
