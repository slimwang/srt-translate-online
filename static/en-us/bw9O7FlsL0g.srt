1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,222
>> All right, Michael. So I, all I have written up

2
00:00:02,222 --> 00:00:06,030
here for you is, are a maximum a posteriori equation, right?

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:10,394
So the best hypothesis is the one that maximizes this expression.

4
00:00:10,394 --> 00:00:13,576
Nothing new, right? So I want to do a little trick, the

5
00:00:13,576 --> 00:00:16,860
same trick that you did before. So, you noticed that when

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,160
we had E to the something, that we could use the

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,250
natural log on E to get rid of everything. So I

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,300
am going to try to do the same thing here. In the

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,940
nat, why did the natural log work again?

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,360
>> Well, it's the inverse of the E, but it let us turn products into sums.

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,120
>> Right. And the other reason it worked is because it's a.

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,320
>> Oh, it's monotonic.

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,470
>> Right, it's a monotonic function and

14
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,580
so it doesn't change the argmax. So, I'm

15
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,710
going to do the log of both sides here. But this time I'm going to do

16
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,200
log base 2, for no particular reason other

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,970
than it'll turn out to help later. So,

18
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,470
I'm just going to take the log of

19
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,340
this entire expression, which, because it turns products

20
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,350
into sums, gives me this. And by the way for

21
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,980
those of you who haven't noticed, I drew in a little

22
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,804
bit of notation here. When you write just LG, it's just

23
00:00:57,804 --> 00:01:01,640
log base 2. Okay, so, we agree that the answer to

24
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,190
this equation and the answer to this equation is the same.

25
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,310
And now I'm going to do one other little trick, exactly

26
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,440
the trick that you used before. I'm going to change my

27
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,380
max into a min, by simply multiplying everything by minus 1.

28
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,160
>> Okay, I don't quite see where you're going here.

29
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,370
>> But you agree that

30
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,710
we haven't changed the answer.

31
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,910
>> I agree that we haven't changed the answer.

32
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,012
>> Okay. Do a log in there, do a minus

33
00:01:20,012 --> 00:01:21,490
sign in there that took us from a max to a

34
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:26,900
min, but I haven't changed the answer. Now, do you recognize anything

35
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,790
about these expressions? I'll give you a hint. Information theory.

36
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:35,070
>> Okay. So, information theory is usually entropy,

37
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,920
which is like sum of P log P stuff.

38
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,430
>> Right.

39
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,650
>> I'm not seeing that.

40
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,530
>> Well, there you, there's your log and there's your P.

41
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,516
>> Sure. [LAUGH]

42
00:01:43,516 --> 00:01:43,880
>> [LAUGH]

43
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,320
>> It's not P times that though.

44
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,100
>> That's true. But we know from information theory, based exactly on this

45
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:55,040
notion of entropy, that the optimal code for some event with probability P has

46
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,990
length minus log base 2 of P. So, that just comes straight out of information

47
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,760
theory. That's where all the entropy stuff comes from. Okay. So, if we

48
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,740
have some event that has some particular probability P of happening,

49
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,360
the best code for it has this structure, minus log of P.

50
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,480
>> Okay.

51
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,140
>> So, if we take this fact that we know, and

52
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,748
we apply it to here, what is this actually saying? This is

53
00:02:20,748 --> 00:02:26,432
saying that, in order to find the maximum a posteriori hypothesis,

54
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:31,234
we want to some how minimize two terms that can be described

55
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,399
as lengths.

56
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:34,540
>> Okay. I can see that.

57
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,560
>> So my question to you is, given that this definition over here, that an

58
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,173
event with probability P has some length minus

59
00:02:41,173 --> 00:02:43,180
log P, what is this the length of?

60
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,870
>> So that would be the length of

61
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,840
the probability of the data given the hypothesis.

62
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,723
>> Mm-hm.

63
00:02:47,723 --> 00:02:51,200
>> And the length of the hypothesis, or the probability of the hypothesis.

64
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,530
>> Well no, it's just the length of that hypothesis.

65
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,390
>> Oh, because the event is what has the length.

66
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,990
Oh, I see. So it's the length of the data,

67
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,260
given the hypothesis, and the length of the hypothesis.

68
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,405
>> Right. So let's write that out.

69
00:03:01,405 --> 00:03:04,134
>> But I was just doing, like, pattern matching

70
00:03:04,134 --> 00:03:05,950
there. It's not clear to me what a length

71
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,870
of a hypothesis is. Hypotheses are functions. I don't

72
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,440
know how to take a tape measure to a function.

73
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,260
>> That's fair. So this is the length of the hypothesis. Right?

74
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:14,730
>> Yep.

75
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:19,160
>> So, you said you don't know what that means. But, let's think about

76
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,022
that out loud for a moment. What does it mean to have a length of

77
00:03:22,022 --> 00:03:24,730
a hypothesis? That's really sort of the number of

78
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,540
bits you need to describe a particular hypothesis, right?

79
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,090
>> Okay.

80
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,101
>> Okay. And in fact, that's exactly what it means.

81
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:32,681
That's why we use log base 2. So, if we want

82
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:35,801
to minimize the length of a hypothesis, what does that mean,

83
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:38,950
the number of bits that we need to represent the hypothesis?

84
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,915
>> The number of bits that we need to represent the hypothesis is, I guess,

85
00:03:42,915 --> 00:03:45,385
in some representation, or, so in this case

86
00:03:45,385 --> 00:03:48,370
I guess it would be some optimal representation.

87
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,570
We are taking all the different hypotheses and writing them out. The ones

88
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,790
that are more likely have a higher P of H, because that's the

89
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,840
prior. And those are going to have smaller lengths than the optimal code.

90
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,460
And the ones that are less common are going to have longer codes.

91
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,860
>> Well, let's make it more concrete.
