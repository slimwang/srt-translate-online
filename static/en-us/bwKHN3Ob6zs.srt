00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,790
The school of AI that works on cognitive architectures makes sort of

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,190
fundamental assumptions about the nature of cognitive agents.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,530
First, that cognitive agents are goal oriented, or goal directed.

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,460
They have goals and they take actions in the pursuit of those goals.

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:21,149
Second, that these cognitive agents live in a rich, complex,

6
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:26,650
dynamic environments. Third, this cognitive agent used knowledge of the world in

7
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:32,020
order to pursue their goals in this rich complex dynamic environments. Fourth,

8
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:37,373
that this knowledge is particular abstraction that captures the important things

9
00:00:37,373 --> 00:00:43,950
about the world that the level of abstraction and removes all the details. And

10
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,550
at that level of abstraction, knowledge is captured in the form of symbols.

11
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,800
Fifth, the cognitive agents are very flexible.

12
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,160
The behavior is dependent upon the environment. As environment changes, so

13
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,160
does the behavior. And sixth cognitive agents learn from their experiences.

14
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,150
They're constantly learning as they interact with the world.
