1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:05,290
Now the two indices that Alteryx
produces, the Adjusted Rand Index and

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:09,679
the C-H Index are calculated for
each of those solutions and

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,800
then combined to form its own dataset.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,469
The means, medians,
minimums and maximums and

5
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:21,219
interquartile ranges are all calculated,
so that we can get a sense for

6
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:26,879
how good the cluster solution is for
each number of clusters that is tested.

7
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:31,000
Alteryx then provides
a visualization of this data

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,429
that is typically a good way
to evaluate the results.

9
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:38,969
To see the visualizations in Alteryx,
you just need to add a browse tool

10
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:42,560
to the cluster diagnostics tool and
click run.

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,400
Keep in mind that depending on
which clustering method you choose,

12
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,530
the time it takes to go through
this process, because there are so

13
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,950
many iterations, can vary considerably.

14
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:57,318
On these charts, along the y-axis
is the value of the index.

15
00:00:57,317 --> 00:01:01,989
And the x-axis is
the number of the clusters.

16
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:08,120
For each cluster number, it displays a
box and whisker plot of the index value.

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,960
With the black line
representing the median, and

18
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:15,949
the blue area representing the area
between the first and third quartile.

19
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:20,150
The whiskers show how far
out some of the values are.

20
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:25,090
For the AR Index, the higher the index,
the better the stability of the cluster.

21
00:01:26,168 --> 00:01:29,520
For the C-H Index, the higher the index,

22
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:34,209
the better the distinctness and
compactness of the clusters.

23
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:38,819
So what we are looking for is where
the median of the index is high and

24
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:42,489
the spread of the various
iterations is minimized.

25
00:01:42,489 --> 00:01:48,228
In other words the minimum and maximum
and interquartile range is compact.

26
00:01:48,228 --> 00:01:53,420
In this instance, using the K-Means
method, the Adjusted Rand Index

27
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,719
might indicate that clusters
number 6 and 7 could be good.

28
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,329
With 7 having a little higher median but

29
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,840
with a bit more spread of
the interquartile range.

30
00:02:03,849 --> 00:02:08,319
The C-H Index indicates clusters
number 9 through 12 might work,

31
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,349
with probably 10 being
the best solution,

32
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:16,219
with that having the highest median and
a fairly compact spread.

33
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:20,430
These results aren't
all that conclusive.

34
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,659
So the next step would be
to run the same diagnostics

35
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:26,079
using the two other methods available.

36
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,310
The K-Median and Neural Gas methods and

37
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,650
compare those results to see if
there's a standout kind of solution.

38
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,569
Keep in mind that when
comparing methods,

39
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:41,189
you need to pay attention to
the scale of the index results.

40
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:46,346
In this case, the C-H Index
ranges from about 4,000 to 5,700.

41
00:02:46,346 --> 00:02:51,330
When comparing,
the boxplots might look the same but

42
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,418
could be relatively higher or
lower than another method.

43
00:02:55,418 --> 00:02:58,210
Also, this could be where
you begin to reconsider

44
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,969
the variables that you are using
in your clustering process.

45
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:06,030
With our example, it pretty much
revolves around the actual climate

46
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,729
metrics, so we won't worry about that.

47
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:10,399
But with other business cases,

48
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,510
such as segmenting a population
of customers, you begin to have

49
00:03:14,509 --> 00:03:20,030
much more flexibility around what you
want to use to determine your clusters.

50
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:24,509
Again, as a reminder, the type of data
that you use will be dependent on

51
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:26,389
the objective of your segmentation.

52
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:30,419
Regardless of
the clustering methodology,

53
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:35,009
building a clustering model should
be considered an iterative process

54
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:40,519
where you need to determine how many and
which variables provide the best model,

55
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,990
as well as how many clusters
provide the best model as well.

56
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:50,189
So a typical process is to run some
initial cluster models, attempt to

57
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:55,699
validate the results with what is known
both with internal validation methods,

58
00:03:55,699 --> 00:04:01,969
using indices, as well as with external
validation, which we will cover later.

59
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:04,449
And then we run the modelling process

60
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:07,979
with differing variables to see
if improvements can be made.

61
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,259
Also as I mentioned,

62
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:13,780
each software package will
use their own set of indices.

63
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,800
The key here is to make
sure that you understand

64
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,259
what the specific index is measuring and
the appropriate way to evaluate it.
