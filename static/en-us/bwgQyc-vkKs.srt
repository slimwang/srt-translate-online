1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,580
So again,
this is what we're interested in.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,430
A scene, and
of course we have two projection planes.

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,790
And we know from our work
that we did in modeling or

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,440
being able to kind of look at warps,
that we basically need to find a new p,

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,590
prime, that basically is kind of a warp
our projection from the original p.

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,250
And these are the two images we have.

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,010
Of course if you recall, we knew how
to do this with an equation like this.

8
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,410
And of course, this was
the homogenous coordinate system, and

9
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,810
these are trying to
get to the new pixels.

10
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,870
This is basically used in order to
introduce a concept of homography

11
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,440
between two images.

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,090
So the idea really is,

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,960
how can we relate two images,
which have the same camera center?

14
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:45,420
Again remember, the camera was
rotating and getting newer points.

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,610
And again this rotation might
actually create a different plane.

16
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:51,940
I refer you back to some of the earlier
visuals I showed you on that one.

17
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,940
So the basic idea and
this is, this is a rectangle.

18
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,690
And again remembering the properties
of these types of equations.

19
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:04,750
A rectangle should make, should map
to any arbitrary quadrilateral.

20
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,930
Again lines should remain lines.

21
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,140
They do not have to be parallel.

22
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,390
So the shape of this para,
this region might change, but

23
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,800
overall it will remain a quadrilateral.

24
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,320
It'll have straight lines.

25
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,220
So again,

26
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,200
parallel lines won't be parallel,
but lines will remain straight.

27
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,330
As we know again, this is something
we have looked at before when we

28
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,770
looked at this whole equation.

29
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,890
Now, of course you may remember,
that i in this one is always equal to 1,

30
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,790
and we have eight parameters
that we need to now model.
