1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,340
Now, what you expected?

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,520
Remember when using border box,
the content, padding and

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,170
the border are included in the actual
width and height of the element.

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:12,600
Only margin is not included,

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,620
because margin is the space on
the outside of the element.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,862
The box model on the right
is 300 pixels tall.

7
00:00:19,862 --> 00:00:24,193
But the actual element itself
is only 250 pixels tall.

8
00:00:24,193 --> 00:00:27,910
The box model on the left
is 515 pixels tall, but

9
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,000
the element is 300 pixels tall.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,830
So this is the correct answer.
