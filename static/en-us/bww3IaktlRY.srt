00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:04,040
In Victor's screen cast,
we also saw him navigating by landmark.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,720
HTML5 introduced some new elements
which help us to find the semantics of

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,138
a region of the page rather than
of a single interactive element.

4
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:15,730
These are .

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,811
This represents the main
content of a page.

6
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:21,121
Typically there should
only be one main element,

7
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:25,740
since otherwise it raises the question
of which one is really the main, main.

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,700
Header, this is either a page banner
like it is here, or else a grouping

9
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,910
element for any introductory content
at the start of any type of section.

10
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,800
Footer, similarly a footer may be
either a page footer as it is here and

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,550
contain information about the page or
site.

12
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:45,300
Or maybe a footer to
a particular section of a page

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,330
with extra information
about that section.

14
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,770
Nav, this represents a section of a page
that links to other pages like the top

15
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:58,450
nav bar or to parts within
the page like a table of contents.

16
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:03,160
Article, this is for self-contained
sections of content like a blog entry,

17
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,860
news article or forum post.

18
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,050
A handy test for an article is
whether its content would make sense

19
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:14,050
in another context such as cross-posting
a blog post to several different blogs.

20
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:19,710
Section, this is a completely generic
section of a document or application.

21
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,670
Since it doesn't really give much of
a clue as to what its content might be,

22
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,300
we typically include
a heading inside as well.

23
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:31,010
And aside, an aside represents any
content which is tangentially related

24
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,630
to the content around it.

25
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:36,701
In the context of article like this
one this might be a little pull out or

26
00:01:36,701 --> 00:01:37,326
sidebar.

27
00:01:37,326 --> 00:01:40,722
Or in the context of a page it might
be a page sidebar containing some

28
00:01:40,722 --> 00:01:43,280
extra navigation or
information about the page.

29
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,340
An aside will often be
rendered as a side bar.

30
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,300
But for example, in a responsive layout,

31
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,420
you might fill in a side below the main
content for small view port sizes.

32
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,980
There's a very good chance that your
start sheet already contains classes

33
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,735
like header, navigation and so on.

34
00:01:59,735 --> 00:02:03,205
For example, you've got a header
a section which has a particular colour

35
00:02:03,205 --> 00:02:07,505
theme and a bottom border to delineate
it from the rest of your site.

36
00:02:07,505 --> 00:02:10,275
And you might want links in your
navigation section to look different

37
00:02:10,275 --> 00:02:12,645
from links in the rest of the site.

38
00:02:12,645 --> 00:02:16,345
Using semantic elements, provides
a more terse way to express the same

39
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:19,955
information while also potentially
providing more information for

40
00:02:19,955 --> 00:02:20,805
screening ready users.

41
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,010
While these elements don't have any
default styling beyond just having

42
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:29,110
display block by default, you can use
your stylesheet just as you would for

43
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,800
a class name to select for

44
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,560
these elements to make them
fit your site's design.
