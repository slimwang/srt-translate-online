A lot of the time, you can't exclude zero. I'm writing a program that

2
00:00:04,083 --> 00:00:07,790
calculates the average altitude of an area. Since some parts are below sea

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,961
level, negative altitudes are allowed. And an altitude of zero would be allowed

4
00:00:11,961 --> 00:00:15,815
too. Can you modify the average method so that the sentinel is a letter Q

5
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:20,078
instead of a zero? It's possible to do this without a loop-and-a-half. If

6
00:00:20,078 --> 00:00:24,238
you're feeling adventurous, you can try Googling Java 7 Scanner, and finding

7
00:00:24,238 --> 00:00:29,514
the documentation about the hasNextDouble method. I'll talk about this in the

00:00:29,514 --> 00:00:30,629
answer video.
