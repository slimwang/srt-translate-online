1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,030
Now that we've written the code to save
the food preference in the data layer,

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,390
we can create variables in tag manager
to hold the special of the day for

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:09,650
each kind of food preference.

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:15,500
First, we need to create a data layer
variable to hold the food preference.

5
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:21,130
So you go to the variable screen,
create a new variable.

6
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,390
And this time, it's important
to choose data layer variable.

7
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,660
Name the variable, this name is for
you to identify what's in the variable.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,310
And then you configure the variable.

9
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,092
The only thing you can figure for

10
00:00:37,092 --> 00:00:41,190
Data Layer Variable is the name of the
variable that you using in your code.

11
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,810
This name must exactly match
the key you set in your code.

12
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,913
So in my case I used the key food_pref,
so

13
00:00:50,913 --> 00:00:57,963
my variable must be configured for
the variable name to be food_pref.

14
00:00:57,963 --> 00:01:00,750
You can set the default
value if you like.

15
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,290
I'm going to set it to unrestricted.

16
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,040
Create the variable.

17
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,230
Now we have the food pref variable.

18
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,770
The next thing to do is to
create the daily specials for

19
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,210
the different food preferences.

20
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,440
So, the easiest way to create a new
variable is to copy an existing one.

21
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,630
So, I'm going to copy daily-special-en,
copy.

22
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,820
Make sure to rename it.

23
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,270
Notice that the type
is a value collection.

24
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,620
Configure the variable, set the value,

25
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:35,330
choose a nice vegan special of the day,
whatever sounds good to you.

26
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,920
Since we copied an existing variable
we've got the triggers that came with

27
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,870
that variable.

28
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,790
And we need to get rid of them.

29
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:47,890
So delete all the existing triggers and
create a new custom trigger.

30
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,060
Now, this list of triggers doesn't
include the trigger we want, so

31
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:52,930
we create a new one.

32
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,120
And it's going to be the vegan trigger.

33
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,960
Custom is good.

34
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,270
And then you want it to fire when
the food preference is vegan.

35
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:11,650
Look for the food preference contains,
or even contained, equals vegan.

36
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,930
Save the trigger,
create the variable, and

37
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:19,210
now we have the daily-special-vegan
to the value collection variable.

38
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,500
As well as the food pref which
is a data layer variable.

39
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,690
And don't forget to publish.

40
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,117
Okay, it's your turn now.

41
00:02:26,117 --> 00:02:29,538
So you're going to create the food
pref variable and the trigger and

42
00:02:29,538 --> 00:02:32,410
we'll start out showing
a vegan daily special.

43
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,890
To start with, create the food-pref
DataLayer variable and

44
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:41,330
then create a value collection
variable for the vegan daily special.

45
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,670
And the easiest way to
do that is to copy and

46
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,104
edit the daily-special-en
that already exists.

47
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:54,070
Choose a custom trigger for it and
then create and use the vegan trigger.

48
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,410
And what's the last step
that you mustn't forget?

49
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,270
Publish.

50
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:01,120
Okay, go ahead and do these things.

51
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,360
And then try it out on your app.
