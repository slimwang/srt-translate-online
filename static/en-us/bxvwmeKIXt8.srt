1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So one other thing we spent almost no time on in the beginning

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
and a lot of time on now is spam prevention.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So you think on a site like reddit, where it's like the Wild West, there's no rules,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
like anybody can submit anything, that it would just be quickly overrun with spam.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You'd be surprised. Now that reddit is big, yes. Reddit receives lots of spam.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But at the time you kind of--If you understand spammers' motivations, it's really easy to prevent.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
A spammer's motivation is basically they want links,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
but an easy way to prevent their links from providing any value

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
is to add an attribute to your anchor tag that looks like this.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So if you have a link with this extra attribute, rel=nofollow, it basically tells Google

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
this link shouldn't be followed for search quality purposes.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Because the way Google works, right, is it looks at a given page

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and however many pages elsewhere on the Internet link to that page gives that page some authority.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And you can basically say I don't want to give this link any authority.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So every link on reddit has rel=nofollow until it has a certain number of points,

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
because we didn't want to put rel=nofollow on all links because we like the way the Internet works.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And we figured if a link was good on reddit, that link should have some authority.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Understanding that spammers all they really want are links

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
to increase the authority of their page to get more traffic there really helps.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So this is one thing we did. Another thing we did was...Spam is rarely cemented by an individual by hand.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
There's almost always automated tools.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Looking at the behaviors of these bots that were submitting contents to reddit.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
They always had these kind of gaps, behavior gaps, that humans would never do.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
For example, a bunch of users will all use the same password.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Before we were hashing passwords, it was really easy for us to tell. They were all using the same passwords.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If there were 100 users all submitting crap but they had the same password, it was all spam,

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and we could just remove it.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And that worked out really nice. Eventually we started, you know, hashing passwords, and we lost that ability.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But we had learned some other tricks along the way.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
One is that the users didn't understand the site.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
They would always submit a link and then comment on their own link.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And users, legitimate users, rarely commented on their own link as the first comment.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And so we would just look for links that had 1 comment by the same author and mark it as spammers.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Spammers on a community site that behaves differently from other sites online,

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
noticing that these peopel use the site in weird ways was enough to catch most spam.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We didn't have to do any fancy, like, look for Viagra or look for suspicious-looking links.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
A lot of these behavior heuristics worked really, really well.

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Submissionary. This is another heuristic. Legitimate users didn't submit that often.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Or if they did, the time between submissions was stagnated,

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and spammers would often just submit a bunch of links at the same time.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We look for those signs and ban the links.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The most important thing that reddit did, and still does, is don't let them know when they're caught.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
When we'd ban a submission on reddit, that user would still see their submission on our hot page or on their user page.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
If their vote doesn't count, it would still look like it would count,

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and if you try to figure out on reddit if you vote counts or not,

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
it's really difficult to tell because on reddit there's a delay between when you click that button and when we update the score.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm not going to get into the details, but suffice it to say, it's really, really hard.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And we've done this, we've spent a lot of time, making it so that users don't know when they're caught.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And I've had to do this on ASCII Chan and on my blog as well

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
because a lot of you guys have submitted a bunch of crap to ASCII Chan and my blog that I didn't want to appear.

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
A lot of that stuff is just sitting in memcache and only you see it,

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
but if you were to change computers, you would find that that submission disappears.

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I think being subtle about when you've detected that somebody is spamming is really, really important.

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's not the only solution, but security through obscurity works really, really well if you keep things obscure enough.
