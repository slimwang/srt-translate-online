1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,190
All right, Michael.

2
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:05,935
So the first thing that I want to delve
into is the notion of solution concepts.

3
00:00:05,935 --> 00:00:08,020
>> Mm-hm.

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,110
>> Now, we've actually talked about
various solution concepts and

5
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,660
game theory one and game theory two but

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,830
we never actually, I don't think,
sort of explained what they were or

7
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,270
even pointed out that we were talking
about different solution concept.

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,930
>> So do we need to talk about
the concept of solution concepts?

9
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,240
>> That's right, we need to talk
about the concept of concepts

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,870
because it's concepts all the way down.

11
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,100
All right, so here's the basic idea.

12
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:34,160
A solution concept or really just
a concept is basically just a rule for

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,150
predicting how a game
is going to be played.

14
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,960
So the one that we spent the most time
on was Nash as a solution concept and

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,490
particularly Nash equilibrium.

16
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,300
And so in the notion in
the language of solution

17
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,650
concepts you're basically saying that
there's a rule there's a kind of

18
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:52,450
formal process by which some particular
game's going to be played and that is

19
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,780
you're going to play with the idea that
you're getting into a Nash equilibrium.

20
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,730
An equilibrium in general and

21
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,900
a Nash equilibrium in particular
because it doesn't makes sense.

22
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,650
So we talked about a few
others mention a few others so

23
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,379
we talked about Nash at length.

24
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:08,090
>> And
what made Nash a Nash was that that

25
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,760
all the players were playing in a way
that they couldn't unilaterally improve.

26
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,380
Right?
So they were

27
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,940
doing best responses to whatever
it was the other player was doing.

28
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,200
>> Right but actually that wasn't
really what made it Nash so much.

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,620
Well it was but the big emphasis
there is actually on equilibrium.

30
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,900
The idea is that you were
in an equilibrium because

31
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,000
it was in no individual's best interest
to move or to change in any way.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,510
In the particular kind of equilibrium
we're talking about was Nash.

33
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,080
Okay.
So

34
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,750
in fact I want to talk about correlated
equilibrium because that's a different

35
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,080
kind of equilibrium,
that's still in equilibrium,

36
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,420
but is different from Nash and
in some ways turns out to be

37
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,540
better under certain circumstances and
I'm going to even argue that

38
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,750
in fact we use correlated equilibrium
all the time in real life.

39
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,610
I'll give you an example
of that at the end.

40
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,490
>> But it's correlated,
so related to Nash?

41
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,130
Yes it is and
in a very particular way and

42
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,265
I will tell you how in a moment,
awesome.

43
00:02:01,265 --> 00:02:03,460
Okay so we're going to talk about
correlated equilibrium because that's

44
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,060
what I'm interested in but I shall point
out that there are several others.

45
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,270
There's trembling hand,
there's Stackelberg competitions.

46
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,308
There's subgame perfect.

47
00:02:11,308 --> 00:02:14,720
We actually talked about subgame
perfect and when I say we I mean you.

48
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,420
>> RIght, in the context of
multi-stage game sequential games.

49
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,580
>> Right, game theory too.

50
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,290
But it's still a solution concept so
this notion of concepts and

51
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,340
solution concepts is not limited
to a simple Matrix Games but

52
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,060
actually all of these work whether
the games are repeated or not.

53
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,560
>> Okay.
>> There's also Bayes Nash we did not

54
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,320
talk about that.

55
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,940
Coco you mentioned Coco.

56
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,890
But I'm not going to talk about that and
there are a whole bunch of others and

57
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,150
they just kind of go on and on and on
and I think when I talk about correlated

58
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,740
equilibrium and explain how this
solution concept entire back in

59
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,180
you might see various other ways you
might come up with solution concepts.

60
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,810
I mean Trembling Hand sort of
scares me a little bit but

61
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,810
are we going to go into any
details about that in Stackelberg?

62
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,997
No I am not going to talk about this,
I'm not going to talk about this,

63
00:02:54,997 --> 00:02:57,276
I'm not going to talk about this, and
I'm not going to talk about this.

64
00:02:57,276 --> 00:02:58,831
And you know what I'm not
going to talk about this,

65
00:02:58,831 --> 00:03:00,280
I'm going to talk about that,
sound fair?

66
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,000
Sounds like a segue.

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,720
>> Sounds like a segue.
