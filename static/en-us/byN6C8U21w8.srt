1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,120
Okay let's look at the two options,

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,980
so the first one says professional
code of ethics requires you.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,910
So if you read the IEEE or

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:12,790
ACM code of conduct that I was
talking about, actually does ask you.

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:17,510
And personally that may
be something If I don't

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,940
want others to violate my privacy I
have to give the same to others and

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,300
not do things that
violate their privacy.

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,220
So my ethical standards or
professional code of conduct

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,820
says even though the file has come to
your computer, the information it has

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,610
is none of your business,
you shouldn't be looking at it.

11
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,670
So, that's what I would
pick in this case.

12
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,360
You shouldn't be liable under CFA
because you didn't break into that

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:43,980
computer, okay?

14
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,840
You didn't use unauthorized
access to pull this data out,

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,660
so because of that I will
not pick the second option.
