Let us now look at a different problem, not a 2 by 1 matrix problem but

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,720
a problem called the guards and

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,770
prisoners problem. Actually this problem goes by many names, Cannibals and

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:14,120
missionaries problem, the jealous husbands problem and so on. It was first seen

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:19,070
in a math text book about 880 and has been used by many people in AI for

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:23,800
discussing problem representation. Imagine that there are three guards and

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,790
three prisoners, on one bank of the river and they must all cross to

8
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:32,750
the other bank. There is one boat, just one boat and they can only take one or

9
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,900
two people at a time, not more and the boat cannot travel alone.

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,330
On either bank, prisoners can never outnumber the guards, if they do they will

11
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,080
overpower the guards. So, the number of guards must at least be equal to

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,020
the number of prisoners on each bank. We'll assume these are good prisoners.

13
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,340
They won't runaway if they're left alone. Although they might beat up

14
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,490
the guards if they outnumber them. That's the beauty of this class.

15
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:01,230
We lead with real problems, practical problems. We also make up problems to

16
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,160
help illustrate specific things. I think you're going to have fun with this one.
