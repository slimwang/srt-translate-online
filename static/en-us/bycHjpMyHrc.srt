00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,090
We have a server that can say hello, so

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,220
now let's add some more
functionality to it.

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,840
Most modern websites have
more than just one page, so

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,280
let's figure out how to add
this feature to our web server.

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,770
In this section we will see that our
server can handle different types of

6
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,990
GET requests, and respond with
different types of messages.

7
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,590
Instead of replying with hello,

8
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,110
let's make a page that also replies in
Spanish when we visit the hola URL.

9
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,280
I'm going to copy my if block
from before and paste it below.

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,020
I will change the message
that said hello in English,

11
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,480
to hola in Spanish,
using this special entity code that

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,820
HTML will render as
an upside-down exclamation point.

13
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,340
I will also add an anchor tag to link
back to my original hello page, just so

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,010
we can see how that's done here.

15
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,050
Now, I'm ready to try and
run this and see what happens.
