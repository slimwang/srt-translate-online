00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Most solvers available on the market do not accept the differential equation in this form--

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
the second-order differential equation, which is not an explicit form.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What you instead have to provide is a function that returns the first derivative, the rate of change.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The trick is to turn this differential equation into two differential equations of first order.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Here is a hint for you--the first equation should be that the derivative of x with respect to time

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
is some new variable called y, and now you have to provide the second equation

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
for the derivative of y with respect to time.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Should that be 7-3<i>y+4</i>x or 7-3 times the derivative of x plus 4x

9
00:00:44,000 --> 99:59:59,999
or 1/3<i>7 minus the second derivative plus 4</i>x or 1/3<i>7 minus the first derivative of y plus 4</i>x.
