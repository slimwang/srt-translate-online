00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,670
Let's use this new knowledge to add mutual exclusion

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:06,300
to our digitizer, tracker program. Hopefully now we won't

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,230
have the same problem but before, were we could

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,160
end up reading from a frame that was only

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,140
half filled with the data we wanted, because bufavail got out of sync. So we'll

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:20,330
create a new mutex lock variable. And we will set

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:25,560
this lock Before we do our manipulation and unset it afterwards.

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,780
We'll do that both in the digitizer part and then also in the tracker part.

9
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,460
What's wrong with this program? Does it not have any concurrency? Will we end

10
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:41,340
up with deadlock, where there's no thread to run? Is it that two threads cannot

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,700
use the same lock? Or is it that two procedures cannot use the same lock?
