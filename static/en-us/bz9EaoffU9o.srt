If you're wondering who "Ada" is in all of those strings,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Ada is Augusta Ada King, who is arguably the world's first computer programmer.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Back in the 1840's, in England, she started to think about how to program mechanical computers--

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Charles Babbage was proposing to build such machines--

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and Ada was the first person to really think about how to program them.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Grace Hopper wasn't the first person to think about

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
doing things other than arithmetic with computers.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Back in the 1840's, Ada was already thinking about that.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You can see this quote here from her:

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
"It might act upon other things, besides number,

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
were objects found whose mutual fundamental relations

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
could be expressed by those of the [abstract] science of operations..."

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The "it" that she's talking about is the analytical engine that Babbage was proposing to build.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
He never succeeded in building it--

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
in the 1840's, the technology for building it

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
was not quite good enough to make a machine that precise.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
But he had a design for it,

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and Ada was thinking about programming it to do more interesting things.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The quote goes on to talk about actually using it to compose music.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
["...and which should also be susceptible of adaptations

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the engine..."]

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
People do use computers to compose music today.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's debatable whether or not you actually want to listen to that music,

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
but certainly it's something computers can do.
