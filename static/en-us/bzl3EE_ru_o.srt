1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,700
This trinomial is the quantity x plus 3 squared. We get the sign and the number

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,254
of the binomial from the value b divided by 2. This 3 winds up inside of our

3
00:00:10,254 --> 00:00:14,974
parentheses or our perfect square. Now this is also the perfect time to check

4
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:19,277
your work. If you square this or if we multiply this out, we should wind up

5
00:00:19,277 --> 00:00:23,810
with this trinomial. We can quickly write this out to get a product of x

6
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:28,269
squared plus 6x plus 9. You could also probably do this in your head. This is a

7
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:32,040
great way to check to see if you went from this step, to this step correctly.
