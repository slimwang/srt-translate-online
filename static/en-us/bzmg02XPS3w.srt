Let's do another quiz about history predictors. Let's

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,680
say we have a program in which we have

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,460
two nested loops. One i goes from zero through

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,930
seven. And then within we have a nested loop

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,940
of j goes from zero through seven. Let's say

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,530
we do something that doesn't have much branching behavior

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:22,340
in it. This type of nested loop structure is

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,320
very common when you have things like matrices or

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,820
even image processing. In particular, for image processing, it's

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,470
very common. For example, compression or decompression are working in

11
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,930
blocks of, let's say, 8 by 8 pixels in this

12
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,610
case which will mean that there are loops like this

13
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,130
all over the code. Let's say that the code, when

14
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,980
it does this nested loop, just does something else and

15
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,140
then very quickly comes back to it to do another

16
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,510
round of this, so this is not just executed once,

17
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,910
the whole thing is executed many, many times. If we are building a history

18
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:01,240
based predictor that should do well on this code, it needs at least how many

19
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,880
entries, and each of these entries should

20
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,290
have, how many bits of history, and how

21
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,840
many 2 bit counters do we need to enter as a result of this history?
