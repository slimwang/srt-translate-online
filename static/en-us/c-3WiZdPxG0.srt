00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,103
Once again, we have a rational function with a fascinating graph. It never

2
00:00:04,103 --> 00:00:08,781
crosses the line x equals 2, or the line y equals 1 half. Let me take a second

3
00:00:08,781 --> 00:00:13,260
to draw them on here. Here we have the line x equals 2. We can see that on

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,875
either side of it, the graph is getting closer and closer. But it's never going

5
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:21,582
to actually touch the line. This is called a vertical asymptote. Let's look at

6
00:00:21,582 --> 00:00:26,430
y equals 1 half, and there we go! This is called a horizontal asymptote.

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,832
Similarly, on either side, the graph is getting closer and closer but never

8
00:00:29,832 --> 00:00:33,800
actually touching it. We're going to talk a lot more about these kinds of

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,029
asymptotes and others in the next couple of lessons.
