1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:05,120
So use the term psychoactive. You might wonder what is psychoactive? Well,

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,488
psychoactive drugs are any drug that affect or change mood, cognition or

3
00:00:10,488 --> 00:00:16,557
behavior. So, for example, cocaine is a psychoactive drug. It changes mood, it

4
00:00:16,557 --> 00:00:20,526
improves cognition, it makes one think and feel powerful, like a competent

5
00:00:20,526 --> 00:00:25,940
person and behavior. It increases motor activity. However, cocaine is not

6
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:32,159
prescribed for any of these things. Now, that leads us to psychotropic drugs.

7
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,165
These are drugs that are prescribed, this is the key, to affect or change mood,

8
00:00:37,165 --> 00:00:43,440
cognition, or behavior. So, an antidepressant, such as an SSRI, as we learned

9
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,315
about in Lesson 3, are prescribed to affect and change mood, cognition, and or

10
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:54,310
behavior. That makes anti depressants psychotropic drugs.
