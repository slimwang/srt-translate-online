Thanks, Rado.

Now that you understand what intents
are in glorious metaphor,

3
00:00:06,332 --> 00:00:10,080
let's use them to do something useful.
We'll replace the Toast,

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,780
with an intent to launch 
the DetailActivity.

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,200
You'll need to pass 
in weather forecast data

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,030
for the detail activity to display.
For more information,

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,890
see the intent extra contants
defined in the intent class.
