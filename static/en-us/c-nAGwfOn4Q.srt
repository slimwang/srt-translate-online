To start this unit, we'll look at Math Quill so you can input exponents and

2
00:00:03,727 --> 00:00:07,582
scientific notation with ease. You might have already discovered how to enter

3
00:00:07,582 --> 00:00:11,468
exponents using Math Quill, and even if you haven't here's a quick walk-through

4
00:00:11,468 --> 00:00:15,404
on what to do. First you want to type the letter x, this will create an x in

5
00:00:15,404 --> 00:00:19,774
your math quill box. Then you want to type carrot symbol, you notice that right

6
00:00:19,774 --> 00:00:23,862
before you type the carrot symbol your cursor bar will appear after the x.

7
00:00:23,862 --> 00:00:28,096
Immediately after you type the carrot key, the cursor bar will move up and in

8
00:00:28,096 --> 00:00:32,685
the position for an exponent, or a superscript. You will then type the number 4

9
00:00:32,685 --> 00:00:36,419
to get the 4 as the exponent. And here's where you can run into trouble. If you

10
00:00:36,419 --> 00:00:41,230
keep continue typing, you will be typing exponents or powers. To move the cursor

11
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,600
bar back down to the main line, you want to hit the right arrow key. Hitting the

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,632
right arrow key gets us to the main line and now it continues typing the rest of

13
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:52,712
our expression. So finish entering this expression, and then try these other

14
00:00:52,712 --> 00:00:57,008
ones. There's also a challenge problem down here. It contains both an exponent

15
00:00:57,008 --> 00:00:58,163
and a fraction.
