1
00:00:04,778 --> 00:00:06,378
It worked.

2
00:00:06,378 --> 00:00:07,650
>> What worked?

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,900
>> My web app.

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,830
I just got my database working, and
i just posted my first picture.

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:13,480
>> Awesome, can I see?

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,680
Whoa, that looks pretty cool.

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,990
>> Yeah, I'm super excited.

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,870
But, most of my friends are using their
phones to view my web app, and so

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,480
I was thinking maybe I want to
make a Project COMPASS mobile app.

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,170
>> Well, it sounds like your next step
is to get into mobile programming.

11
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:34,150
By 2020, there will be over
6.1 billion smartphone users.

12
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,710
The majority of the world will have
access to the web through their

13
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:37,960
mobile phone.

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,760
That means there's a huge demand for
mobile programmers.

15
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,450
Specifically iOS programmers and
Android programmers.

16
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,250
What's different about mobile
programmers is that they work closely

17
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,870
with the actual hardware
of mobile phones.

18
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,450
Many mobile apps like Snapchat use
hardware features such as mobile

19
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,580
cameras.

20
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,016
Let's take a look at what
types of problems and

21
00:00:57,016 --> 00:00:59,087
projects mobile programmers work on.

22
00:00:59,087 --> 00:01:03,129
Mobile developers work on projects
such as building apps that

23
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:06,590
are responsive on different devices.

24
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,170
Creating apps with
a clean user interface so

25
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,030
that it's intuitive and easy to use.

26
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,780
Syncing apps to servers so
that it can present data to a user.

27
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:22,070
Taking apps from a functional state to a
production ready state through handling

28
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:27,560
cases, accessibility features,
localization widgets, and libraries.

29
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,340
Building high performance apps by taking
advantage of mobile device hardware

30
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,860
such as cameras and microphones.

31
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,720
The Medium app is a great example
of a well designed mobile app.

32
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,030
It's responsive to
different screen sizes and

33
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,470
there's a clean user interface.

34
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:47,980
It also syncs with different servers to
get data from websites like Twitter and

35
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,760
other new services.

36
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,180
It also takes advantage of mobile
device hardware such as the camera, so

37
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,160
that users can take pictures and
post them to their Medium blog.

38
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,450
As of July 2015 there are over
3 million mobile apps.

39
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,400
Whether you decide to build an iOS or

40
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,979
an Android app, mobile applications
create a multibillion dollar industry.

41
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,200
Let's chat with Sydney about her
experiences as an iOS developer.
