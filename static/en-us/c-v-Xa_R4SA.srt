00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,310
Let's use another type of visualization that's helpful for seeing

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,230
the distribution of a variable called a box plot. Now if

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,950
you're unfamiliar with a box plot, you can find resources in

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:12,280
the instructor notes, and there's also a link to Udacity statistic

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,310
class so you can test your own knowledge. You may recall

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,880
earlier that we split friend count by gender in a pair

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,190
of histograms using facet wrap. The code looked like this. Instead

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,360
of using these histograms we're going to generate box plots of friend

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,120
count by gender, so we can quickly see the differences between

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,470
the distributions. And in particular we're going to see the difference between

11
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,490
the median of the two groups. And remember again the the

12
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:38,400
q plot function automatically generates histograms (/g) when we pass it a

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,550
single variable. So we need to add a parameter to tell

14
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,430
q plot that we want a different type of plot. To

15
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,040
do that, we're going to use the gym called box plot. Now,

16
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,420
I'm going to use the same data set as before. So I'm going to

17
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,980
keep this and q plot. Now, what's different about box

18
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,320
plots is that the y axis is going to be

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,980
our friend count. The x axis, on the other hand,

20
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,080
is going to be our categorical variables for male and female, or

21
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,150
gender. Notice that we use the continuous variables. Friend count

22
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,100
as y. And the grouping, or the categorical variable as x.

23
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,790
This will always be true for your box plots. I

24
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,450
forgot a parenthesis here and then let me just reformat my

25
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,980
code so it looks a little bit cleaner. There we go.

26
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,380
Running this code, we can see that we get our two box

27
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,910
plots. Let's zoom in to get a closer look. The boxes here

28
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:28,170
and here cover the middle 50% of values, or what's called the

29
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,390
inner quartile range. And I know these boxes are hard to see,

30
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,350
since we have so many outliers on this plot. Each of these

31
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,600
tiny little dots is an outlier in our data. We can also

32
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,480
see that the y axis is capturing all the friend counts from

33
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,170
zero all the way up to 5,000. So we're not

34
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,790
omitting any user data in this plot. And finally, this horizontal

35
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,920
line, which you may have noticed at first, is the

36
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,380
median for the two box plots. And you might be wondering

37
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,830
what makes an outlier an actual outlier. And well, we

38
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,700
usually consider outliers to be just outside of, one and a

39
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,390
half times the IQR from the media. Since there's so

40
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,680
many outliers in these plots, let's adjust our code to focus

41
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,860
on just these two boxes. We'll have you do this in the next

42
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,950
programming exercise. See, if you can altar our code to make that adjustment.
