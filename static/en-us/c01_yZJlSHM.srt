Since we're talking about functions that are even,
functions that are odd,

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,628
and potentially functions that are neither even nor odd,

3
00:00:07,628 --> 00:00:12,639
I've a graphed a bunch of different curves over here for you, curves and lines,

4
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,371
and I've labeled each of them with a letter.

5
00:00:15,371 --> 00:00:21,471
I'd like you to tell me whether each of these graphs represents an even function, an odd function,

6
00:00:21,471 --> 00:00:23,749
or neither an even function nor an odd function.
