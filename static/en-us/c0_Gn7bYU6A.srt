1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,300
In this course, we're going to do a considerable amount of algorithm analysis,

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:09,960
which is why we're going to do an overview of the techniques and notations that we're going to use.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,240
If you've already had an algorithm course before and it terms like Big O-notation or RAM

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,360
or a worst-case running time are already meaningful to you, then you might try

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,800
and go directly for the quizzes for the respective sections.

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,700
Let's try it out with a little quiz.

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:30,180
What I want you think about is the various factors that we need to take into account

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:35,060
when we are analyzing an algorithm or more precisely, when we are analyzing the running time

9
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,520
of an algorithm because that would depend on the number of factors.

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,950
What I would like you to think about is what factors

11
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,590
can determine the running time of an algorithm.

12
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,640
So here are six different possibilities.

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,830
First the size of the input, secondly the content or structure of the input,

14
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:56,620
third the type of computer that we are using for the algorithm,

15
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:03,280
fourth the amount of memory the computer has, five how the algorithm is implemented,

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,260
and six the programming language that we're using to implement the algorithm.

17
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,780
I want you think of each of those six aspects and then make a check mark

18
00:01:12,780 --> 99:59:59,999
where you think that this aspect can influence the running time of an algorithm.
