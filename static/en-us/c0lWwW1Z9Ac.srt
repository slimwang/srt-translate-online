00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,568
The first thing you had to do which you probably did, is find the average of x

2
00:00:03,568 --> 00:00:11,796
and y. 5 plus 6 plus 1 plus negative 4 divided by 4 is 2. 3 plus 7 plus 8

3
00:00:11,796 --> 00:00:18,212
divided by 3 is 6. So we have our means. And here are our deviations. Here are

4
00:00:18,212 --> 00:00:25,480
our squared deviations. Then when we sum them up, we get 62 and 14.
