1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,510
Which fields or items in a header row,

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:08,250
would you expect to see in a comma
separated value file of stock data?

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,100
So here are the options.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,596
Number of employees for
the company, date/time,

5
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:18,702
company name, price of the stock,
company's hometown.

6
00:00:18,702 --> 00:00:19,692
Good luck.
