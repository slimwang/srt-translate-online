00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,050
So once Alice has programmed this algorithm--here--she, of course, tests it.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:08,850
So she constructs small test instances that she can solve herself

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,670
and runs them through this algorithm.

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,790
Now, one thing I would like you to figure out--

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,970
now if she actually runs a small test instance through this algorithm--

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,030
is how many loops that algorithm goes through.

7
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:27,870
And by 'loops' I mean how many times those lines--3 to 5, here--are executed

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,780
for a certain network.

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:34,590
So let's say that the network consists of 5 communication centers.

10
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,270
So for a network with 5 communication centers, I want to know how often

11
00:00:39,270 --> 99:59:59,999
lines 3 to 5--this part here--are executed.
