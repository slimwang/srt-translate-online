00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,695
A surface is a container for
your content and provides grouping and

2
00:00:03,695 --> 00:00:05,619
separation from other elements, but

3
00:00:05,619 --> 00:00:09,350
there are other lighter weight ways
to visually group the content.

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,590
So when should you create a surface?

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,040
Let's look at an example.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,760
Here, we have a surface for the app
bar and a surface for each list item.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,170
The issue here is that the surfaces
act as a kind of cognitive speed bump.

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,540
While it's useful to visually separate
the app bar from the content,

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,210
placing each item on
an individual surface

10
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,780
lowers your speed in
scanning down the list.

11
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,080
A much cleaner approach is to simply
draw the content on a single service

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,660
using a subtle separator.

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,570
Conversely, in this example, placing
each of these very different items onto

14
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:48,670
their own separate surface let's you
visually process each one individually.

15
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,870
A good rule of thumb is if content
is homogeneous, when scanning and

16
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:57,700
comparison will be important, then it
likely belongs on a single surface.

17
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,070
If you need to present a collection
of heterogeneous items,

18
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,030
then individual surfaces
are appropriate.

19
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,510
Directing attention is
a powerful technique, but

20
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,810
needs to be used judiciously.

21
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:13,230
Having too many separate surfaces on
a screen at once can be distracting.

22
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,190
As a very rough rule of thumb,

23
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,490
try not to have more than around
five surfaces on the screen at once.
