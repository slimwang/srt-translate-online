1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,870
The answer is that all of them are true.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,210
Lets consider these two matchings,
one blue and

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:07,420
one orange in this example here.

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,170
When I take the symmetric difference,

5
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,160
these edges that are in both
matchings will get deleted.

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,940
Every vertex can have
degree at most two.

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:20,530
Because it can only get one edge
from M and one edge from M prime.

8
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,710
And indeed, every path is
alternating with respect to M and

9
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,900
M prime for essentially the same reason.

10
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,880
The third point follows almost
immediately from the first.

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,210
Since in a graph where the degree
is at most two disjoint paths and

12
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,240
cycles are the only
things that can happen.
