00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,370
This kind of reflection model is called Toon Shading, or Cel Shading, or

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,770
sometimes Posterization. Toon is short for cartoon. Cel is short for celuloid,

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,020
the material for the transparent sheets that are used when animation is drawn

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:16,178
by hand. There are all sorts of variations for this type of rendering. For

5
00:00:16,178 --> 00:00:18,673
example, you can change colors based on the shading level and get more

6
00:00:18,673 --> 00:00:22,164
elaborate effects. In this rendering, a separate image processing shader is

7
00:00:22,164 --> 00:00:25,790
used to detect the edges of the object, and outline them. This type of

8
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,790
illumination model is one example of what's called Non Photorealistic

9
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,622
Rendering, or NPR for short. Photorealistic means "looks like a photo." If you

10
00:00:31,622 --> 00:00:32,630
think about it, there is a nearly infinite number of ways to draw things that

11
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,634
do not look realistic. The running joke is that we've been doing

12
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:37,118
non-photorealistic rendering on computers for decades, since realism is hard to

13
00:00:37,118 --> 00:00:45,806
achieve. The way I see it is that non-photorealistic rendering has an intent

14
00:00:45,806 --> 00:00:51,574
behind it. Just as we assign different fonts to text to convey a different

15
00:00:51,574 --> 00:00:56,785
impression, NPR is a choice we can make about 3D rendering. Scott McCloud and

16
00:00:56,785 --> 00:00:59,975
his book, Understanding Comics, talks about amplification through

17
00:00:59,975 --> 00:01:03,862
simplification. The idea is that by displaying only the relevant pieces of

18
00:01:03,862 --> 00:01:07,904
information, you strengthen your message. For example, an automobile owner

19
00:01:07,904 --> 00:01:12,253
manual usually has simplified drawings instead of photos. Non-photorealistic

20
00:01:12,253 --> 00:01:17,010
techniques often try to convey information in a more sketchy or artistic way.

21
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,986
For example, a sketchy look can let the viewer know that the result they're

22
00:01:19,986 --> 00:01:22,930
looking at is in just an early stage of design.
