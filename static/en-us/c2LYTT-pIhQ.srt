1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,050
Before we go any further,
I want to show you something

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,840
that every web developer needs to know,
developer tools.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,850
This may seem a bit overwhelming
at first but I promise,

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:10,650
you'll learn to love them.

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,330
I'm going to open up Google Chrome and

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,317
visit one of my favorite websites,
ESPN.com.

7
00:00:16,317 --> 00:00:19,260
Now, I could demonstrate this
using another web browser

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,470
that has developer tools.

9
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,760
But for this demonstration,
I'm going to use Google Chrome.

10
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,544
If I right click this page and select
the inspect option in the drop down,

11
00:00:27,544 --> 00:00:29,478
it opens Google's developer tools.

12
00:00:31,838 --> 00:00:35,299
Remember how I said it would seem
overwhelming, I wasn't kidding,

13
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:37,590
there's a ton of stuff here.

14
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,830
To keep this simple, I'm only
going to focus on the elements tab.

15
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:44,300
But know that the other tabs can
give you a much closer look into how

16
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,390
a website is built, how it performs,
and what's going on behind the scenes.

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,950
Let's try something out.

18
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,560
If you notice, under this elements tab,
we have some HTML.

19
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,550
This is actually the HTML for
the page we're currently viewing.

20
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,330
This is more obvious when I
start hovering over elements

21
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:05,740
in HTML because Google Chrome highlights
the corresponding elements on the page.

22
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,430
That's pretty sweet.

23
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,210
And if I click on one of these elements,
then in the bottom right hand corner,

24
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,620
I can see what styles
are being applied to it.

25
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,000
That's even better.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,520
It looks like the element I've
selected's got a lot going on.

27
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,215
Let's try unchecking one of these
properties to see what happens.

28
00:01:20,215 --> 00:01:22,880
Whoa, did you see that?

29
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,980
The background color of
the navigation just disappeared.

30
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,080
That's because I change the CSS
being applied to this element.

31
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,899
By unchecking the box, I removed the
background color this div normally uses.

32
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,180
Let's try another one.

33
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,270
I'll select one of these articles.

34
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,980
And let's try changing
the background color.

35
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,460
Wow.

36
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,380
Now these articles look like
they're floating on the page.

37
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,220
Each article just runs
up against the next one.

38
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,850
And it's not easy anymore to
tell where one starts and

39
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,840
where the next one begins.

40
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,870
Now don't worry.

41
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,000
These changes aren't permanent.

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,190
And they're only visible
to me on this computer.

43
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,920
If I refresh the page,
everything returns back to normal.

44
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,620
As you can tell,

45
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,980
I could spend all day playing around
with the styling on this page.

46
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,500
But hopefully, what is more obvious
to you is that you see how beneficial

47
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,080
developer tools can be
to a web developer.

48
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,110
They literally tell us exactly
how the page is built.

49
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,310
You can see both the HTML and

50
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,500
the CSS that is creating the page
that you see in the browser.
