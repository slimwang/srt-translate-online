Although the example you just saw about eye color nicely demonstrates the

2
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:10,868
principles of dominant and recessive traits. The particular trait of eye color

3
00:00:10,868 --> 00:00:16,770
is not actually as simple as we just explained it. The trait of eye color is

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,347
actually controlled by multiple genes that affect the outcome. And we call this

5
00:00:22,347 --> 00:00:27,880
a polygenic trait. However, there are some traits that are controlled by a

6
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:33,873
single gene in an actual dominant recessive fashion like we just explained.
