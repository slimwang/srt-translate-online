1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,830
if we have more categories, then we have more of these to add up. We have this

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,350
ratio for the first observed and expected value. We add the ratio for the

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:15,040
second observed and expected value, all the way to n. On average, we'll get a

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,100
larger sum for ten categories compared to two. So in general, the more

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,010
categories, the more likely we'll get a larger chi squared statistic.
