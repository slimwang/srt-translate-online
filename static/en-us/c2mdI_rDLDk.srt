1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:05,180
So to solve that problem we're going
to turn to unsupervised learning.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,920
Unsupervised learning means
training without any labels.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,390
It's easy to find texts, lots of texts,
take the web for example, or

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,160
even just Wikipedia.

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,650
That's plenty of text to train on,

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,120
if you can figure out
what to learn from it.

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,590
Here's a very very simple but very
powerful idea that we're going to use.

8
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,540
Similar words tend to
occur in similar contexts.
