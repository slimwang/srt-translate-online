1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,660
So currently the work class contains
two string variables, one for

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,910
the default translation and
one for the Miwok translation.

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:12,140
And both of these variables are private,
but we have public methods

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,720
that other classes can call to get
access to the state of the object.

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,340
So now to add support for
images, we're going to need to

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:24,430
add a new variable to keep track of the
image associated with each word object.

7
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,716
Well what should the data
type of this new variable be?

8
00:00:26,716 --> 00:00:30,627
Well we could store the actual image but
that actually takes up a lot of

9
00:00:30,627 --> 00:00:34,640
memory because all our illustrations
are not trivial in size.

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,170
Plus for

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,570
a really long list of words, if we
ever scroll to the bottom of the list.

12
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,840
It would be a waste to store
each image in the word list

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,780
if the images have strolled off screen.

14
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,910
Plus it would blot the amount of memory
resources that the word list would use.

15
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:53,040
Now, a more efficient way is to just
store the resource ID for each image.

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,859
A resource ID something like
R.drawable.number_one is

17
00:00:57,859 --> 00:00:59,697
actually an integer.

18
00:00:59,697 --> 00:01:01,974
So instead of storing an actual image,

19
00:01:01,974 --> 00:01:05,780
we just store the name of the resource
so that we can find it later.

20
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,070
So we can think of that
situation like an address book.

21
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,890
You don't need to store someone's
whole house into your address book.

22
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,210
Instead you can just store
someone's mailing address.

23
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,550
And in case you need it later.

24
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:22,050
You can look up that mailing address and
go find their house.

25
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,670
So back to our situation,
when the list view asked for

26
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,070
a list item layout for this word.

27
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:31,287
It's the word adapter's responsibility
to return the resource ID, so

28
00:01:31,287 --> 00:01:33,994
something like R.drawable.number_one.

29
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:37,721
And turn it into an actual image of
an acorn that will be displayed onto

30
00:01:37,721 --> 00:01:39,310
the screen.

31
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:43,940
So we see here that each word class
holds two strings and one integer for

32
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,830
the image resource ID.

33
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,100
So to follow the convention for

34
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,580
the other variables in this class,
we want these state variables

35
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,840
to be declared with the private
access modifier and not public.

36
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,558
So this means that only methods
within this class can access these

37
00:01:59,558 --> 00:02:01,114
private variables.

38
00:02:01,114 --> 00:02:04,802
So, we can trust that methods within
this class will modify the image

39
00:02:04,802 --> 00:02:06,710
resource ID properly.

40
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,060
We don't want the variable to be public,
because other classes

41
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,520
could change the image resource ID into
something invalid, which would cause our

42
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,760
app to crash when we try to translate
the resource ID into an actual image.

43
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,120
Now back to the first
question of the quiz

44
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,340
which asked what additional state
what a word object contain?

45
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,790
Well we'll need a private integer
variable for the image resource ID.

46
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,740
And since this variable's private,
we need a public method so

47
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:38,130
that other classes can access the image
associated with this word object.

48
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,260
And by the way,

49
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:44,040
only create public access modifiers
to access private variables.

50
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,950
If you intend for
other classes to need those methods.

51
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,810
If we created additional variables for

52
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,020
ourselves to manage
the word object internally.

53
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,320
They don't need to be external facing.

54
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,090
We don't need to create
public get methods

55
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,450
to expose those variables
to outside callers.

56
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,720
So back to the second question
of the quiz that asked,

57
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,620
what additional method should we have?

58
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,330
We would need a public method
called getImageResourceId

59
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,450
to return the integer image resource ID.
