1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So in our original version of the grammar, only 4 strings were derivable.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Here's our grammar from before.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm going to add just 1 rule, and that one itty bitty rule

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
is going to give me phenomenal cosmic power.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Here I've added a rule to allow us to make compound subjects.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This rule is super special awesome.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Let me show you a new derivation that uses this new rule.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Starting from sentence, we go to subject verb,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
subject and subject verb, students and subject verb,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
students and subject think, students and teachers think.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Here, right here when we turned this subject into subject and subject,

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
that's when we were using this starred rule.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And notice that now, rather than a 2-word sentence,

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
we've produced a 4-word sentence.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Amazing. Do students and teachers think?

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That beggars belief.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Both of us think? Teachers certainly don't think.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Let's see how this plays out.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This new power that we've discussed

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
is called recursion in grammar.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You're already familiar with recursion in programming

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
where a function calls itself.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Here we can replace a non-terminal subject

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
with that same non-terminal and some other stuff,

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
so just as we might define factorial in terms of factorial of x - 1,

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
we can define subject in terms of subject and subject.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This is a recursive rewrite rule, and thus the whole thing

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
is now recursive grammar.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Recursive grammars, that's where all the real power is

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
because in essence, it allows a bit of a loop,

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and this gives us some room for creativity.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This is how we can have a finite structure

33
00:01:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that admits infinite utterances but not all utterances.
