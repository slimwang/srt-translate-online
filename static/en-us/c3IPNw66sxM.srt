1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,560
So Joe, we're going to build
this earthquake app, but

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,050
where should we start?

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,030
>> Well, every great app starts
with having a clear vision for

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:08,970
its existence, right?

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,750
In this case,
we'd like to enable users like you

6
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,520
to get a better sense of the seismic
activity near them, or around the world.

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,470
>> Cool.

8
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,060
>> But our idea for an app could be many
other things, like a meme creator, or

9
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,830
a restaurant finder, or
even a task management app.

10
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,470
At the end of the day, it should
be something that adds value and

11
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,700
is a joy to use.

12
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,190
Otherwise, why distribute it?

13
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,280
>> Yeah, absolutely.

14
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,990
So I guess we should get really
crisp on what kind of information

15
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:36,610
we want to show and what kind of
controls we want to give to the user.

16
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:37,380
>> Yes, indeed.

17
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,850
In app-speak, we call this
designing a killer user experience.

18
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:42,820
>> I had some ideas too.

19
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,750
Do you want to see some sketches?

20
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,290
>> Absolutely,
nice work on the napkins by the way.

21
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,450
Super scrappy.

22
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,315
>> Yeah, you know how it is.

23
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:49,930
>> Mm-hm.

24
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,570
>> It's a pretty simple idea, actually.

25
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,940
We display a list of earthquakes and we
highlight the magnitude of each one, and

26
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,100
we share some important information
about where and when it occurred.

27
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,610
>> Very cool, I love it.

28
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:03,970
Giving prominence to the magnitude here
makes sense and you got location and

29
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,349
date and time.

30
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:09,690
It'd also be a great idea to sort the
results by maybe magnitude or recency.

31
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:10,270
>> Yeah.

32
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,710
>> Or how about allowing the user to
focus in certain locations around

33
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:14,310
the world?

34
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:14,900
>> Yeah, exactly.

35
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,040
Okay cool, so, where can we find
a reliable source of earthquake data?

36
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,525
>> We can just grab
data from the Internet.

37
00:01:21,525 --> 00:01:25,300
>> Okay, but when I Google search,
all I'm getting are a bunch of websites.

38
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,330
How can I use that in an app?

39
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,110
>> Let's modify that
search a little bit.

40
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,162
>> Okay.

41
00:01:29,162 --> 00:01:31,725
>> You'll want to add web API in there.

42
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:34,398
>> API, what's that?

43
00:01:34,398 --> 00:01:39,070
>> API is just short hand for
Application Programming Interface.

44
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,930
It's how a software product or service
makes certain parts of its functionality

45
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,250
or data available to
use in other software.

46
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:49,910
It's the app's way of saying,
if you want to build something new using

47
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,950
some of our data or functionality,
here's how we can work together.

48
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,590
>> Cool, it sounds really powerful.

49
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,900
>> Yes it is, totally.

50
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,850
It's like a programmatic
partnership that when done well,

51
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,589
can create some serious value,
even impact the world.

52
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,830
When you see apps posting to Twitter or
Facebook or

53
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,460
displaying housing prices
on a Google map or

54
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,700
live streaming video, taking credit
card payments to an online store,

55
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:19,680
even mustering users to aid in disaster
relief, they're all probably using APIs.

56
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,770
And the possibilities and

57
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,179
problems that can be solved
with them seem to be endless.

58
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,540
>> Okay Joe, I don't know.

59
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,450
I'm pretty pumped, but in our case,
we're looking for an API that can

60
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:32,330
integrate information about earthquakes
from the Internet into our app.

61
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,620
>> Yup, exactly.

62
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,910
But the process we'll be following can
be used for all kinds of app ideas.

63
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,840
>> Hey, Joe, check this out.

64
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,070
I think I found just the one.

65
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,000
For this quiz,

66
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,670
what are some possible places to find
earthquake data on the Internet?

67
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,190
Do a search, and
find at least two websites, and

68
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,140
put them in the field here.
