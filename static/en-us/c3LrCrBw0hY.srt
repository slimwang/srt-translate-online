1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,268
You ready to fill some of these in?

2
00:00:01,268 --> 00:00:02,988
You might not know all of
them right off the bat, but

3
00:00:02,988 --> 00:00:04,202
I think we can piece them together.

4
00:00:04,202 --> 00:00:05,742
>> Okay,
well if we're going to work together,

5
00:00:05,742 --> 00:00:07,050
I think we can do
a pretty good job here.

6
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,460
Well can I ask you a question first?

7
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,140
>> Sure.
>> Do you know the answers?

8
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,725
>> No, [LAUGH] but
I'm confident they exist.

9
00:00:12,725 --> 00:00:14,260
>> Okay, good, so let's work this out.

10
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,350
So I do think I know one of them and
it's really easy.

11
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,680
So the one that I'm going to do that's
really easy, is writing V in terms of Q.

12
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,720
>> Excellent choice, sir.

13
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,670
>> Right, so if you think about the
equation, which we have conveniently not

14
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:31,170
written on the screen, the value
is immediately a max over actions.

15
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,380
So I think, it's just the max
of over actions of Q(S,a).

16
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,086
>> Yeah, exactly so, very good.

17
00:00:38,086 --> 00:00:41,387
>> So one way of saying that is that
the true value of a state is just,

18
00:00:41,387 --> 00:00:43,470
you're going to take the best action.

19
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,170
>> Yeah, and so that also gives a nice
interpretation of what Q values are.

20
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,520
Right, it's the value of each of
the actions you could take in the state,

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,580
the best of which is the one
we're actually going to take.

22
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,706
>> Right, exactly, exactly.

23
00:00:53,706 --> 00:00:57,413
So I think there's a similar
argument to make for C.

24
00:00:57,413 --> 00:01:00,374
So I guess, I don't know where
you want to put the max, but

25
00:01:00,374 --> 00:01:04,262
I guess what I'm thinking of is, you
had a state followed by an action, and

26
00:01:04,262 --> 00:01:05,223
that gives you Q.

27
00:01:05,223 --> 00:01:10,010
But in C, you have sort of the state
followed by an action, and a reward.

28
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,420
So C is happening after the reward,
right.

29
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,410
So it should be the reward
that you get plus C.

30
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,710
Right, so is that right?

31
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,520
That makes sense, right?

32
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,687
>> Yeah, that feels right to me.

33
00:01:19,687 --> 00:01:24,176
So one of the things that's interesting,
already, is that means if we have C and

34
00:01:24,176 --> 00:01:27,220
we want V, we still need to
know the reward function.

35
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,600
But if we want V and we know Q,

36
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,900
we don't need any other special
knowledge about the way the model works.

37
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,560
The Q values kind of encapsulate
all that we need in terms of,

38
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,900
at least for computing V.

39
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,880
>> Okay, but that's because,
let me just see I understand that.

40
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,450
I think you're right,
that's a cool insight,

41
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,800
but basically, we need to know what
the reward was after we did the state.

42
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,059
So we yeah okay that makes sense,
we have to kind of keep that with us.

43
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:51,718
All right I'll buy that.

44
00:01:51,718 --> 00:01:54,022
>> Okay, so let's see what happens
in some of the other boxes.

45
00:01:54,022 --> 00:01:56,320
>> Right, so this is harder for me,

46
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,588
because I think doing V in terms of Q
and C is easier because it's the future.

47
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:04,340
V is the like the first thing
before the future comes along.

48
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,330
And Q and C captures the next
set of things in the sequence.

49
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:11,310
But here, I guess I want to
know how that's going to work.

50
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,550
>> Well, I like the way that you started
when you thought about this box here.

51
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:18,074
You said that the V
equation starts with max A.

52
00:02:18,074 --> 00:02:20,054
Well what does the Q
equation start with?

53
00:02:20,054 --> 00:02:24,683
Good.
>> [LAUGH] Right.

54
00:02:24,683 --> 00:02:29,346
And then after that, oh,
well once you have the rewards,

55
00:02:29,346 --> 00:02:34,690
it's just, discounted value where
you're going to end up next.

56
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:35,816
>> So what's the end of this thing?

57
00:02:35,816 --> 00:02:37,070
>> V of S prime.

58
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,250
>> Yes.
>> Right, so the trick there,

59
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:43,350
is to realize that you don't
have to go backwards in time.

60
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,860
You just have to unroll
the infinite sequence,

61
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,600
until you get to the point where you
can now express it in terms of V.

62
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,200
>> Exactly, and
that's the trick to all these, in fact.

63
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,570
>> Right, so, in fact, I don't know how
you're going to fit this, but I could

64
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:03,630
just substitute what I learned about
how V can be expressed in terms of C,

65
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:08,850
by just substituting that bit,
for the V that you did in Q.

66
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,390
Express in terms of V.

67
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:16,303
>> So it's as if we fill in the same
answer that we did, and then we say,

68
00:03:16,303 --> 00:03:18,042
okay, well what's V?

69
00:03:18,042 --> 00:03:21,644
We know V in terms of C looks like this,
and we just can keep,

70
00:03:21,644 --> 00:03:24,650
[LAUGH] I guess we need
to keep doing that.

71
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,050
That can't be right.

72
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:26,760
>> Why not?

73
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,170
I mean,
I don't think you have to do that.

74
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,100
>> No, because in fact.

75
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,815
This is already C.

76
00:03:32,815 --> 00:03:33,351
>> Exactly.

77
00:03:33,351 --> 00:03:34,860
>> So that's not so bad actually.

78
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,430
But again, to getting Q from
C requires us to know R.

79
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,810
Getting V from C, requires us to know R.

80
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,460
Getting Q from Q, doesn't require
us to know anything other than Q.

81
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:47,480
And same from V from Q,
Q from V, we need both R and T.

82
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,530
>> Great.
>> All right, so let's do this last row.

83
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,208
>> Wait, I have a question.

84
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,840
>> Sure.
>> Do I need a gamma in front of

85
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,670
C for Q?

86
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:56,250
>> I'm going to say no, because
the equation for gamma starts, sorry,

87
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,740
the equation for C starts with gamma.

88
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,360
>> Oh, you're right.
Okay, yeah, yeah that's right.

89
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,937
Okay, cool.

90
00:03:59,937 --> 00:04:01,040
All right, so how do we do this one?

91
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,850
We'll start the same way.

92
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:05,140
We'll start off, just writing
the definition of C as it is.

93
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,700
Which is usually then what?

94
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,810
Plus?

95
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,960
>> The next reward I'm
going to get followed by C.

96
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,060
No, I'm missing something.

97
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:11,740
Wait what am I missing?

98
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,935
This is where me not having
written down the equations,

99
00:04:13,935 --> 00:04:15,220
now comes back to bite me.

100
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,240
There's a max of A in there somewhere.

101
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,140
I ended up in S prime, so
now I need to take an action.

102
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,826
So it's max over A prime, then I'll
get the reward, and then I get C.

103
00:04:23,826 --> 00:04:24,797
>> Yeah, so we could do [LAUGH],

104
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:27,230
we could write C in terms of C, but
that's not what we're trying to do.

105
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,590
We were trying to write C in terms of V.

106
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,790
The thing with the max
in front of it is V.

107
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,400
Boom.

108
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,770
>> Right.
Because it already contains

109
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:34,840
everything we need to know.

110
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,020
>> Right, yeah.
So in particular, the continuation for

111
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,980
being in some state taking some action
is the discounted next state value,

112
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,500
which we already have in this case,
we have V.

113
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,960
>> Yeah, that's exactly right.

114
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,120
>> All right, last box!

115
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,080
>> All right, so
there's a similar argument there.

116
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,640
I think you just write the same thing,
and then just replace V with,

117
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,240
max A prime over Q(s,a).

118
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,060
There you go.

119
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,540
>> Yeah, that seems plausible.

120
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,430
>> So is everything that you said before
still true about how I don't need to

121
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,150
know R?

122
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,910
I guess so.
>> Read down the columns.

123
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,190
If we have the C function,
we can get the V and

124
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,290
the Q from it if we just have R.

125
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:13,100
If we have the V function,
then we can get the Q and the C, but

126
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,950
we actually need the T, the transition
function in the case of getting C, and

127
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,430
we need the reward function and
the transition function to get Q.

128
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:24,080
And if we have the Q function already,
then we don't need anything special,

129
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,100
except for if we want the continuation,
we need the transition function but

130
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,380
not the reward function.

131
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:32,020
So this is why that the C function
turns out to be a really useful form,

132
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,330
if the reward function
is hard to represent.

133
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,790
We're going to be able to
kind of work around it.

134
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:40,770
And Q function is actually really
powerful, because it gives us answers to

135
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,780
lots of other questions without
having the know the model.

136
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,750
>> That makes a lot of sense to me.

137
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,460
Okay, that's good.

138
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,260
That's really cool.

139
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,150
>> So, what we should do next I think,
is talk through how we can

140
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,540
actually make a reinforcement
learning algorithm out of this idea.

141
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,040
>> I like that.
