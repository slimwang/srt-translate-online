00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,480
As always, we start by changing division to multiplication, we multiply by the

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,879
reciprocal of the second fraction. I'm multiplying these binomials together, so

3
00:00:08,879 --> 00:00:14,067
I want to make sure that I use parentheses. I have x plus 5 and 5 plus x. If I

4
00:00:14,067 --> 00:00:17,902
think back, I can remember that these two are actually identical, they're the

5
00:00:17,902 --> 00:00:22,390
same factor. So, we can simplify those or cancel those to make one. This leaves

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,804
me with 5 minus x in my numerator and x minus 5 in my denominator. And here we

7
00:00:26,804 --> 00:00:32,357
have opposite polynomials. The 5's are opposite in sign as are the x's. We know

8
00:00:32,357 --> 00:00:38,093
opposite polynomials really reduce to negative 1. So negative 1 is our final

9
00:00:38,093 --> 00:00:38,973
answer.
