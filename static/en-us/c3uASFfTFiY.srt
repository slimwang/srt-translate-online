1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,260
Let's add a drop down so

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,110
the user can pick when they
want to eat the menu item.

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,470
I've added a dropdown with options for
breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,990
Now we just need a button.

5
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,350
There we go.

6
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,670
We're now set with all HTML content.

7
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:16,250
But choosing an item still doesn't make
it appear up in the order tracker.

8
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,000
Let's wire the different
parts of our app together.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,110
Ember controls user
interaction through actions.

10
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,220
The default action is a click.

11
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:28,200
So adding this action to our
button will listen for a click.

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,220
It'll call the chooseItem function and
pass along the item's name.

13
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,360
This function is defined in
the menu items component's file

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,780
inside an actions object.

15
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,580
Let's set up the action and
action handlers.

16
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,660
Clicking the button now calls this
function with the items name.

17
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,530
We need to create this function
in the Component File.

18
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,730
All actions need to be
inside an actions object.

19
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,170
Note that this is actions with an s
while this is action without an s.

20
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,140
the function is called choose item and
it receives the menu name.

21
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,340
When the button is clicked.

22
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,460
The order manager service needs to
be updated with the new selection.

23
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,070
We don't have access to the order
manager in this component yet.

24
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,460
So we just need to inject it.

25
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,550
Now have access to the order
manager service under this name

26
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:14,930
to update the service when the bun is
clicked, we first get the service and

27
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,240
tell which meal to add the item to.

28
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,645
Remember that this method already exists
on the order manager service object.

29
00:01:20,645 --> 00:01:23,510
I've hardcoded the default
meal time to breakfast but

30
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,890
users really should be
able to choose the meal.

31
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,730
I switch things around to use this
property which still defaults to

32
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,690
breakfast but

33
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:33,670
with this set up we can use
the template to update this property.

34
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,360
This adds an action to the select
element that fires on change instead of

35
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,650
one being clicked.

36
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,160
It calls the change
category function and

37
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,930
passes along the value
that was selected.

38
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,490
The change category function
just updates this field.

39
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:50,560
Now we can choose a menu item and
have it show up in the order tracker.

40
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,460
How awesome is that?

41
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,770
Now we just need a way to let
the user cancel one item and

42
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,350
change the active day.

43
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,360
We'll add both of these to
the order tracker component.

44
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,020
So if a menu item has been picked for

45
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,390
a meal,
we want to let our users cancel it.

46
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,440
This will check if a menu
item has been picked.

47
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,090
This is just an x symbol that,

48
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,490
when clicked,
will remove this day's breakfast item.

49
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,780
Let's create this action
handler in the component file.

50
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,600
This remove function tells
the order manager service

51
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,360
to remove the menu option for
the meal time of the past and day.

52
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,570
To let users choose the day
they're adding meals for,

53
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,940
we'll add an action to this div.

54
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,200
Remember that we're looping
over each day of the week.

55
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,980
So this day will change with each loop.

56
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,200
Clicking this div will call this
action passing along this day.

57
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,800
The set day to function just tells the
service to update the selected day and

58
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,560
we're finished.

59
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,530
Our app displays content handles user
interaction and manages data and

60
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,830
it does all of this instantaneously and
with no patriot precious.
