1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,886
In this spreadsheet, and then copy and paste the data into a new spreadsheet and

2
00:00:05,886 --> 00:00:11,600
then try and find the average number of Facebook friends. Hm, okay, link to

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:19,428
Udacian's Facebook friends, equals, I can't type anything. Okay, oh copy and

4
00:00:19,428 --> 00:00:29,326
paste the data into your own spreadsheet. How do I do that? Now from Google

5
00:00:29,326 --> 00:00:40,630
drive, looks like I have to sign in, I can go to create spreadsheet. Let's call

6
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:45,750
this the same thing that says here, this way I can reference back to this in the

7
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:53,214
future. Okay, so I have to Copy and Paste the data, edit, Copy's not there, I'm

8
00:00:53,214 --> 00:01:02,507
going to copy it by brute force. Force command C. Maybe I'll just try copying

9
00:01:02,507 --> 00:01:12,774
the data. Command c, command v, yay it worked. What's something else I could've

10
00:01:12,774 --> 00:01:20,456
done? File, maybe download as Microsoft Excel. Hey maybe this'll work. It did! I

11
00:01:20,456 --> 00:01:26,922
have an exact copy of the data and I can do the exact same thing in Microsoft

12
00:01:26,922 --> 00:01:34,626
Excel. Well, I think I'll use Google Docs for now. Do-do-do-do-do. Oh no, I

13
00:01:34,626 --> 00:01:39,984
accidentally clicked on it and it's gone, but here it is in my drive. From your

14
00:01:39,984 --> 00:01:45,462
Google account, you can see all the options here at the top. And here's my

15
00:01:45,462 --> 00:01:53,484
spreadsheet. Let's get to know this spreadsheet. This is cell A1, this is cell

16
00:01:53,484 --> 00:01:58,372
A2. Each cell has a name just like you and me, except we usually don't have

17
00:01:58,372 --> 00:02:03,328
numbers in our names. There's no comma or special characters in the name of the

18
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:07,754
cell, and it's always the letter first and then the number. What do you think

19
00:02:07,754 --> 00:02:14,357
this cell is? Let's put a header on this data so we know what it is. Insert row

20
00:02:14,357 --> 00:02:18,505
above. This is the header, and is not part of the data, it just tells us what

21
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:26,140
we're measuring. So that means, the data is from cell A2 to A28. Now I wonder

22
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:31,290
what cool stuff we could do with this data? How about data, sort, range. Oh,

23
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,347
data has header row. I almost said data has header row. Sort by number of

24
00:02:35,347 --> 00:02:45,054
Facebook friends, indeed. What else could we do? What's this? That looks like

25
00:02:45,054 --> 00:02:50,062
sigma sum. Here's a bunch of functions, let's add them. It automatically put the

26
00:02:50,062 --> 00:02:54,748
formula here, we could've written that ourselves though and not been so lazy.

27
00:02:54,748 --> 00:03:01,612
Actually, let's do some formulas. Let's calculate the average. Equals. Average

28
00:03:01,612 --> 00:03:12,872
A2, because that's where our data starts, all the way to A28. Cool. And then we

29
00:03:12,872 --> 00:03:17,272
can see here, in the formula bar, what we just typed. Let's find the deviation

30
00:03:17,272 --> 00:03:21,816
from the mean. There's no formula for that, you just have to intuitively know

31
00:03:21,816 --> 00:03:27,008
what it is. Deviation, meaning how far something differs. From the mean, how far

32
00:03:27,008 --> 00:03:32,037
each value differs from the mean. How do we find the difference? By subtracting.

33
00:03:32,037 --> 00:03:40,019
And how do we start our formulas? With an equals. A2 minus, and now we always

34
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:47,724
want this value to be constant. So instead of just writing E1, we're going to

35
00:03:47,724 --> 00:03:53,810
put a dollar sign in between the letter and the number. That'll keep it constant

36
00:03:53,810 --> 00:04:00,424
when we copy and paste this for the other cells. So that makes sense, right? 0

37
00:04:00,424 --> 00:04:08,309
minus 584, blah-blah-blah should be negative 584, blah-blah-blah. So now, there

38
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:13,730
are a few things we can do. We can go to this corner here where there's a plus

39
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:20,261
sign, then drag it down, and then we get each deviation from the mean. In fact,

40
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:29,561
if we click on it, we see in the formula bar this is A10 here minus the mean,

41
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:37,608
which is E1. Another thing we could do is click on this cell, push command c,

42
00:04:37,608 --> 00:04:45,544
or, if you're on a PC, Ctrl+C, go to cell A2, push command-down, go to cell B28,

43
00:04:45,544 --> 00:04:53,646
push command-shift-up. And then that area is highlighted. And then push command

44
00:04:53,646 --> 00:05:05,758
v. What's the sum of the deviations? Equals, sum B2:B28, it's like 0. It should

45
00:05:05,758 --> 00:05:12,901
always be about 0. Let's name this column, Deviations. Xi minus x-bar, and x-bar

46
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:21,442
is the mean. Okay, let's do squared deviations. That's pretty self explanatory,

47
00:05:21,442 --> 00:05:29,455
it's just the deviation squared, equals B2 squared. Now again, command c, go to

48
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:39,370
cell B2, command down. Go to cell C28, command shift-up, command v. I'm telling

49
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:44,788
you, if you get used to those keyboard shortcuts, you'll be able to do things

50
00:05:44,788 --> 00:05:50,950
way fast, especially if you have a list of 500 data values. It might be easier

51
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:55,390
for short data sets to just drag this down, but for large data sets, these

52
00:05:55,390 --> 00:06:00,162
keyboard shortcuts will make your life a lot easier. So now we have our squared

53
00:06:00,162 --> 00:06:08,200
deviations. Let's find the sum of squares. Equals, sum, C2;C28. Error, I must

54
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:18,232
have typed something wrong. Let's look and see what I did. Oh, there's a comma

55
00:06:18,232 --> 00:06:27,679
right there, let's delete it. Now we get the sum of squares, or SS. Let's find

56
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:34,964
the variance. That's simply the sum of squares divided by n, equals C30 divided

57
00:06:34,964 --> 00:06:43,574
by, and it looks like there are 27 values. This goes until C28, but there's a

58
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:52,345
header here. So it's not using one of the cells. So there are only 27 values.

59
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:58,358
Cool. So this is the variance. Should probably write this down, just so you

60
00:06:58,358 --> 00:07:03,954
remember. Oh, and look, it says all changes saved in drive. Every change you

61
00:07:03,954 --> 00:07:08,360
make is automatically saved in drive, that is so awesome. I love Google Docs.

62
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,240
Notice that for variance, we divided by n, but if we were treating this as a

63
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:21,147
sample, we would divide by n minus 1. Okay, let's find the standard deviation,

64
00:07:21,147 --> 00:07:28,642
equals square root of C31. So here is the standard deviation. Which remember,

65
00:07:28,642 --> 00:07:33,754
it's represented by that Greek symbol Sigma. What if someone had a lot of

66
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:39,373
Facebook friends? Like 100,000. How would that change our mean standard

67
00:07:39,373 --> 00:07:46,594
deviation and variant? Let's say that instead of having 408 Facebook friends, he

68
00:07:46,594 --> 00:07:54,237
has 100,000. Ready for this? Whoa! Everything changed automatically. The

69
00:07:54,237 --> 00:08:00,573
deviations are huge, because the mean is huge, and the square deviations are

70
00:08:00,573 --> 00:08:06,240
huge, and everything's huge. That's so cool. And then you don't have to do

71
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,872
anything different. What if everybody had zero Facebook friends? Then

72
00:08:10,872 --> 00:08:15,493
everything's just zero. Are spreadsheets totally awesome or what?
