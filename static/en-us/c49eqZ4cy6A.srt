00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,916
Just like with an equation, if we do the same thing to an inequality, we should

2
00:00:03,916 --> 00:00:07,759
be able to find some way to keep the statement true as we move down through our

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,870
manipulation. So let's say, I'm super committed to dividing both sides of this

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,809
by negative 1. What inequality do we need here then, in between the negative 1

5
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:19,100
and the negative 2? Please fill in the proper symbol in this box.
