This course is about me. It's about you. It's about all of us,

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,890
really. It's about how our genomes, or

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,330
our genetic instructions, shape who we are.

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,630
>> So to help, we've asked five people to

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,940
join us and share their life stories throughout this course.

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,790
And hopefully, through them, you'll see how our genome can

7
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,280
manifest different traits that can profoundly shape our lives. Yes.

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,060
>> As we follow their personal journeys, we hope

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,860
you'll begin to connect real stories with real traits.

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,790
>> So let's hear your story. Give us five words. One

11
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,270
in each one of these boxes, to describe who you are.
