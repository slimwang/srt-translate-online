1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,910
Now let's discuss firewall
deployment strategy.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,939
That is, where in the network
do we put a firewall?

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:09,890
Typically, we put an application
level gateway, such as a web proxy,

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:13,610
to a dedicated machine and we call
these machines the bastion hosts.

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,710
These machines are made
to be very secure.

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,050
Here are some measures that we can take
to make this bastion host very secure.

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,600
First, these machines execute a secure
version of the operating system.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,530
In addition, only the services
that the admin consider

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,950
essential are installed on the host.

10
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:35,560
For example, a bastion host may
only allow DNS and web traffic.

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,710
A bastion host can also require that,
even for traffic coming from an internal

12
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,630
host, the user must authenticate
himself to the bastion host.

13
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,750
Each proxy running on
the bastion host is configured

14
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,150
to allow access only to specific host
systems in the internal network.

15
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,930
This is important because we
don't want compromised proxy

16
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,260
lead to attacks to
the entire internal network.

17
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,720
Each proxy module is a very
small software package,

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,930
designed with security in mind.

19
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,950
That is,
we want each proxy to be as small and

20
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:11,000
simple program as possible so
that we can check for security.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,500
For example, a typical Unix
email application may contain

22
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,820
over a couple hundred
thousand lines of code,

23
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:21,710
while an email proxy may contain fewer
than one thousand lines of code.

24
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:25,180
A proxy typically performs
no disk access other than

25
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,590
reading its initial configuration file.

26
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:28,750
This makes it difficult for

27
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:33,770
an attacker to install a Trojan horse on
the bastion host and affect the proxy.

28
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:38,060
Proxies are typically non-privileged and
they're isolated from each other.

29
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:42,320
The security benefit is that if
a proxy is compromised by an attack,

30
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,250
it cannot easily compromise the entire
bastion host or affect other proxies.
