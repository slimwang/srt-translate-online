00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,800
Our first quiz about page tables
looked at the address formats.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,860
And in the second quiz we will
look at page tables again, but

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,918
by looking at the page sizes.

4
00:00:09,918 --> 00:00:13,880
On a 12-bit architecture,
what is the number of

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,770
entries that is required in the page
table, if the page size is 32 bytes?

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,165
Also, think about what is
the answer to this question,

7
00:00:23,165 --> 00:00:25,192
if the page size is 512 bytes.

8
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:29,710
You should assume that the page
table is a single-level page table.

9
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,730
Write your answers in the text boxes.
