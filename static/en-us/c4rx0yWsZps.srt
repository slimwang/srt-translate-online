00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Problem six is the first really foray
into trying to do machine learning on

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,469
the problem. If you're going to embark
into solving a problem using machine

3
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:11,400
learning,

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,419
it's really good idea to start simple
and actually convince yourself that

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,410
machine learning can solve your problem
and that the data is actually fit

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,720
for being treated as a machine learning
problem that you haven't messed up or

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,490
that you don't have, you know, one feature
in your data that is going to allow you

8
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,500
to solve the problem in a trivial way
and that will you will get one hundred

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,309
percent accuracy but that feature
actually is something that you might not

10
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:45,839
be able to have a test time. So let's try
a very simple model and one, for example,

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,230
that you can consider is the logistic
regression that's in sklearn.

12
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:58,190
Sklearn is a package that's very popular,
that's that has a lot of already pre-

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,989
implemented machine learning approaches
you can call the function fits and it

14
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:09,119
will fit a model to its input-output
pairs and that's basically training.

15
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:16,830
you can also call score and that's just
saying give it a test data and test, test

16
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:25,140
labels and it will return the accuracy
of your model on the data. So it's very

17
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,689
simple. Four line of code, five lines of
code and you can basically run a small

18
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:33,600
classifier on your data and convince
yourself that there is actually

19
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,949
something to learn here. Next assignment
will be to actually start using this

20
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:45,600
data and implementing your own logistic
regression and subsequently deep learning

21
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:45,390
models.
