00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,040
These are the correct factors for each part of the fractions. I know factoring

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,592
can be tough, so if you're getting at least half of these right, great work. If

3
00:00:07,592 --> 00:00:11,313
you got stuck on one of these, try to look back at your work and see where you

4
00:00:11,313 --> 00:00:15,305
went wrong to get these factors. If you can't find an error in your work then

5
00:00:15,305 --> 00:00:19,500
stay with me for this solution. For our first numerator we can pull out a 2x

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,190
from each term. So we'll have 2x times x squared minus 6x plus 9. Then we notice

7
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:29,626
that this is a special factoring pattern. It's a perfect square trinomial. So we

8
00:00:29,626 --> 00:00:35,557
have 2x times x minus 3, times x minus 3. This gives us our first numerator. For

9
00:00:35,557 --> 00:00:40,117
this denominator, we want to find the factors of negative 12, that sum to

10
00:00:40,117 --> 00:00:44,063
negative 4. This allows us to rewrite our middle term. And then we'll use

11
00:00:44,063 --> 00:00:48,581
factoring by grouping to get 3x plus 2 times x minus 2. This is our factored

12
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:53,356
form for our first denominator. For this numerator we want to find the factors

13
00:00:53,356 --> 00:00:58,442
of 12 that sum to negative 8. These two factors are negative 6, 6 and negative

14
00:00:58,442 --> 00:01:03,928
2. We'll use factoring by grouping to get 3x minus 2 time x minus 2 for this

15
00:01:03,928 --> 00:01:09,403
numerator. And finally for this last denominator we pull out a 6x from both

16
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:14,363
terms leaving us with 6x times x squared minus 9. Then we can factor this

17
00:01:14,363 --> 00:01:18,771
difference of squares using x plus 3 times x minus 3. This difference of squares

18
00:01:18,771 --> 00:01:22,754
pattern appears in all sorts of math. So it's great that we can recognize it

19
00:01:22,754 --> 00:01:23,360
quickly.
