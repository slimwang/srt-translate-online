00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,990
One way of getting at these relationships is to determine which components have

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,540
responsibilities for handling the two user actions.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,960
The use cases and

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,370
corresponding operations can provide answers to these questions.

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,250
However, each of these events is just the first step in the text

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,680
browser's response.

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,939
For each of these two actions,

8
00:00:17,939 --> 00:00:20,369
determine what subsequent events you would expect to see.

9
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:24,321
So if, so for example, if the user is resizing the window, or

10
00:00:24,321 --> 00:00:29,413
moving the scroll bar, not only do we expect the window size to be different, or

11
00:00:29,413 --> 00:00:31,997
the scoll bar position to vary, but

12
00:00:31,997 --> 00:00:36,035
we want this, the rest of the application to respond somehow.

13
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:40,238
So, can you lay out what other things you would expect to happen?
