1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,180
Beta testing allows you to
assure the equality of your app,

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,600
by having real users actually use it.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,320
As a startup without a quality assurance
team, it's great to build a community of

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,510
beta testers that can give you
the feedback you're looking for.

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,770
Let's hear from Amir Shavat about
what a beta testing community is,

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:17,550
and how to create them.

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,360
Amir's had a chance to start some
developer communities on behalf of

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,630
Google and is also the instructor
of Udacity's product course.

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,230
Beta Testing communities give you
insights you may miss about bugs in your

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,270
app or ways to improve your app
that you haven't thought of.

11
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:35,980
Now choosing your beta testing community
members or audience is really important.

12
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,890
There are a few things
you need to consider.

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,950
They must be representative
of the actual users that'll

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,980
be using your app when it launches.

15
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,680
For aBARKment, we should actually
find people who are dog owners, and

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,100
who are willing to let their
dogs go stay with a sitter.

17
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,080
They also have to be unbiased.

18
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,070
They can't have predetermined notions
about how they feel about the app

19
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,540
before experiencing it.

20
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,870
And of course, they must be willing to
give feedback and share their thoughts.

21
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,830
It'll be of no help to you if the beta
testers don't actually talk about

22
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:02,970
their experience.

23
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,550
The members of this community
should want to be a part of

24
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,900
the experience early on, and really
want to be a part of the creation and

25
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,550
improvement of your app.

26
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:11,480
Through beta testing,

27
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,880
you're going to have the opportunity
to learn a lot of things.

28
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,710
Such as,
does your app even do what should do?

29
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,780
Does your app crash or
does it have bugs?

30
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,110
Is your app too slow?

31
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,460
What do users think about your app?

32
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,590
How does your app look or
work on different types of devices?

33
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:26,940
And so much more.

34
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,660
So you'll need to think about how you
want to interact with your beta testing

35
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,830
community, because it
isn't only important for

36
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:35,920
them to be unbiased about the product,
you also need to be unbiased.

37
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,910
So how should you gather
this information from your

38
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,200
beta testing community.

39
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,320
Let's talk to Amir about that.

40
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,500
>> So first of all I don't think
you need to ask questions.

41
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,700
You need to observe behavior.

42
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,430
One of the key with beta testing is
that you get a lot of the data, and

43
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:56,130
rather than asking the questions,
you see how people behave with the app.

44
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,180
And that's super important.

45
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:02,110
Second, if you must ask questions,
you need to be very,

46
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,820
very sure that these are unbiased.

47
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,555
Like, asking things like,
is this a great app?

48
00:02:07,555 --> 00:02:10,750
Will probably yield,
yes this is a great app.

49
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,360
Although it might not be a great app,
right?

50
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,190
Or, are you using it every day for
sure, will probably be a bad question.

51
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:22,910
So try to not prime the right answer,
your right answer.

52
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,930
So ask a question in
a very unbiased way.

53
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,680
>> So here are a few things you should
remember when interacting with your beta

54
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,960
testing community.

55
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,880
Observe behavior first.

56
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,850
You don't always need to ask questions.

57
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,400
You can just observe the behavior.

58
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,100
But when you do, be unbiased.

59
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,918
Don't ask leading questions to allow the
users to give room for honest response.

60
00:02:42,918 --> 00:02:46,204
For more information on developing
questions for beta testing or

61
00:02:46,204 --> 00:02:50,430
surveys in general, check out
the article in the instructor notes.

62
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:55,150
Another option is to create open beta
rather than a user testing community.

63
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,360
Google has a tool called Open beta.

64
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,590
You don't need to create a community
with this option to run your test.

65
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,460
You'll use Open beta when you want
any user with a link to your app

66
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,450
to be able to join your beta
test with just one click.

67
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,820
One of the major
advantages with open beta,

68
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,390
it allows you to scale
a large number of testers.

69
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,260
However, you can still limit
the maximum number of users you

70
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,840
want to join your beta test.

71
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,565
And finally, don't forget,
you need a collect data somehow.

72
00:03:19,565 --> 00:03:23,510
As Amir said, beta testing without
collecting data is pointless.

73
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,091
You can set up a free Google Analytics
account to attach to your app.

74
00:03:27,091 --> 00:03:31,325
It'll be able to track user behavior,
and provide you with reports on data

75
00:03:31,325 --> 00:03:34,345
you're collecting, so
that you can make data driven decisions.

76
00:03:34,345 --> 00:03:36,820
We'll dive deeper into
Google Analytics later on.
