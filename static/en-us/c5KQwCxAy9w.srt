00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,860
Now that we have these expanded versions of our equations, I'd like you to use

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:09,570
them to find L2 minus L1. Now assuming you simplify this properly, your answer

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,640
should actually just be a number. When you find that number I'd like you to

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,480
round it to the nearest integer. Your answer will be something that's measured

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,050
in decimals.
