1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Consider this spiffy, new finite state machine.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It accepts both 1 or more letters like word--w-o-r-d--and also 1 or more digits--1, 2, 3.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
In fact, there's a sense in which it accepts either [a - z]+ or [0 - 9]+.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Note its 2 accepting states. Such power!

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Can we do the same thing with regular expressions?

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It turns out we can with a new regular expression operator,

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
a nubitive syntax in regular expressions that I'm going to teach you.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
This vertical bar means I match either the thing on the left or the thing on the right.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's formally called 'disjunction' sometimes, but we can just read it as 'or'.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Match [a - z]+ or [0 - 9]+.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
For example, let's say we want to find all matches of lowercase [a - z]+ or [0 - 9]+

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
in "Goethe 1749".

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We'll get both 'oethe' and '1749'.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We don't get the capital G because we asked for lowercase letters over here.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
One of Goethe's most famous works is Faust, in which an old man makes

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
a literal deal with the devil in an incredible surprise move. It does not go particularly well.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And in fact, the phrase Faustian bargain has entered the modern English lexicon

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
meaning a deal that you really don't want to make or where you're giving up too much

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
to get something.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
While we're here, our old friend regular expression [0 - 2] is really just 0/1/2.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,263
So I could write out [a - z] as 26 different choices, but that's not very concise.
