00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Let's assume I'm using Google AdWords and I'm paying $0.50 per pay-per-click.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Now, let's assume my campaign at $0.50 each gets me 10,000 people to come look at my website.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Well, $0.50*10,000, that cost me $5,000, but the goal isn't to just have people visit,

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
the goal is to get them to the end of the funnel and at the end of the funnel,

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I want them to actually have paid for and/or used the product, so the goal is to activate them..

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Now, what's interesting is assume I'm offering a trial

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and assume that maybe just 5% of the people who I've acquired actually now take the trial.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And so I now have 500 people using my freemium product

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
but the goal is not to just have them use the freemium product--.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
the goal is to actually have them pay for it and what's interesting is,

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
assume 10% of those now actually paid.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'd start with 10,000 people who came to my site and I spent $5000 for them,

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:19,000
500 people took a trial of the product and 50--only 50 actually paid for the full version of the product.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So while 10,000 people upgrade for 5 grand because it only cost me $0.50 per person.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
If we now do the math, we can now see it cost me $100 to acquire one paying customer.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That $100 equals my customer acquisition cost.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I used this example for a web/mobile channel but it's similar for physical channel.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You might not be doing pay per click, you might be doing direct math,

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
or you might be doing television or radio math, but the math works the same.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
How much did it cost to acquire a customer? How much did the campaign cost?

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
How much did it cost to get them to consider your product?

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
How much did it cost them to take a test drive of your car or fly your airline?

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And what in the end was your customer acquisition cost?

24
00:02:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That's a key number for any founder thinking about a startup.
