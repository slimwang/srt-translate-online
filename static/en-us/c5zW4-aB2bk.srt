00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,580
I'm Katherine Kwan, 
and I'm a developer advocate at Google.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,310
I started off by working as an engineer 
on the Android apps team.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:13,170
I worked there for three years on 
products like Google Play and Google Keep,

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,906
the note taking app.
I'm continually blown away

5
00:00:16,906 --> 00:00:19,442
by what you can build on this platform,

6
00:00:19,442 --> 00:00:23,048
and I'm particularly inspired 
by those apps that can truly improve

7
00:00:23,048 --> 00:00:24,624
people's lives.

8
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:27,950
When I meet people, they often tell me
about their great app ideas.

9
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,870
But then they feel like they don't have 
the technical skills to actually build it.

10
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,860
And that's why I shifted over 
to developer relations

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,278
so I can help people like you 
really build something great.

12
00:00:39,278 --> 00:00:43,428
Throughout this course, I'll be helping 
you implement your very first app.

13
00:00:48,544 --> 00:00:52,170
My name is Dan Gauthan. 
I've been a developer advocate at Google

14
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,320
for four years and I've worn 
a lot of hats here.

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,440
My goal is to keep us on track 
to make Sunshine, something that

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,930
had some resemblance 
to a production quality app.

17
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,658
I'll introduce Android design 
patterns and principles.

18
00:01:03,658 --> 00:01:06,386
Many of which are often missed 
by new Android developers.

19
00:01:06,386 --> 00:01:10,304
You'll learn to lean on the framework, 
focusing on what makes your app unique

20
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:12,362
instead of reinventing the wheel.

21
00:01:17,092 --> 00:01:21,033
I'm Rado Mya, and I've been a developer 
advocate for Android at Google

22
00:01:21,033 --> 00:01:22,714
for five years.

23
00:01:22,714 --> 00:01:25,526
I started working on Androids 
so long ago that back then

24
00:01:25,526 --> 00:01:27,782
there were no devices.

25
00:01:27,782 --> 00:01:30,940
All we had to work with 
were an emulator, a beater SDK,

26
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,060
and an almost fanatical devotion 
to the platform.

27
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,290
I'll be joining you from here, 
my underground Android developer bunker,

28
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:41,563
and my goal isn't to get you up 
and running as quickly as possible.

29
00:01:41,563 --> 00:01:44,465
It's to teach you the context behind
the choices we'll make.

30
00:01:44,465 --> 00:01:47,840
And the best practices you need, 
to really understand how to create

31
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,675
great experiences specifically 
tailored to mobile devices.

32
00:01:51,675 --> 00:01:55,383
By the time you finished this course 
you'll know more than just how to create

33
00:01:55,383 --> 00:01:56,370
yet another app.

34
00:01:56,373 --> 00:02:00,000
You'll know how to build 
great apps that focus on the user.
