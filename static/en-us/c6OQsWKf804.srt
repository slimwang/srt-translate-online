00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,794
So we all know that we encounter stressful situations throughout the day, week,

2
00:00:03,794 --> 00:00:08,154
and even our lifetime. In fact, throughout one day we may experience different

3
00:00:08,154 --> 00:00:12,502
levels of stress. For example, perhaps you oversleep and you're going to be

4
00:00:12,502 --> 00:00:16,082
late for work. Or you're stuck in traffic and you're going to be late for an

5
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:21,466
exam. Even worrying about a sick pet can cause stress. You might find it

6
00:00:21,466 --> 00:00:24,651
interesting to know however that not all stressful events are threatening or

7
00:00:24,651 --> 00:00:29,392
bad or frightening. In fact some events that are supposed to be pleasurable or

8
00:00:29,392 --> 00:00:34,290
fun can also produce stress. To that end in the 1960s two psychologists

9
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,792
invented a scale called the social readjustment rating scale. And we're going

10
00:00:38,792 --> 00:00:41,690
to go back to Lauren to look a little bit more closely at that scale.
