1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Can you say a little bit about how social networks fit into the history

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
of the use of technology in political protests?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Right. This is a really an interesting topic in that with the dictators,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
what they want is a lot of people to believe that everybody is happy

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
with what's going on.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
They don't want a lot of people to know that people are unhappy.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What happened was during the 1979 Iranian revolution,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
people were passing information through cassettes,

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
for those of us who are old enough to know what cassettes are.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
During the Tiananmen Square uprising, people were passing information through fax

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and with the use of fax machines.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Now, with smart phones and Twitter and Facebook,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
people can pass information very rapidly,

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
so I would know if there was a protest how many of my friends are going to go

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
or how many people will go.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
If I feel like a good mass of people are going to go

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and that we can really damage the government, then I would go.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We have models that show whether the particular movement will spread

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
or whether it will stop and so on and so forth.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's very exciting work.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Network science and social network analysis has come into service here,

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
because if you think about cybersecurity, what is cybersecurity?

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What is cyber? Cyber is just a collection of machines that are networked together.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I send an email from my machine and so on and so forth,

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and that's then an information network.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Underlying it is a physical network of machines that are linked to each other.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You can think of it, well, if I'm a bad guy, and I want to spread a virus through this network,

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
how will I do it?

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's similar to this idea of epidemiology like between people networks

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and how does it spread and whether you are more susceptible to get a virus than not.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If your PC is more prevalent, maybe you're more susceptible

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
to some of the viruses that are out there, because the majority of viruses

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
are for PCs right now and less for Macs.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Or, for example, if I'm a good guy, how would I stop a virus from spreading?

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Which links should I take away or which nodes should I take away?

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Nodes here being computers, right?

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Actually, this also is analogous to people networks.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
If I don't want a piece of information to spread, which person should I take out?

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
For some definition of take out.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I've been watching a lot of murder mysteries.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You have worked for the government.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So, this is how it comes in cybersecurity,

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and in fact if you think about it

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
social networks are built on top of information networks

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and that's built on top of physical networks,

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and so the interdependency between these networks is very interesting to study

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
and see, well, if I take out part of a physical network

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
how will that affect the information network and the social network.

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
In fact, we have seen recently, for example again, with the demonstrations

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
when the governments take down their Internet,

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
because they don't want people to talk to each other,

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
but we're seeing that even though they take down the Internet,

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
because there's a phone network and the Twitter apps and all these other apps,

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
are also through phones and voice that people can communicate information now,

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
which is awesome.
