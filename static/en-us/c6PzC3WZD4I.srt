00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,642
Well we know that 5% is either less than 2 standard deviations below the mean or

2
00:00:06,642 --> 00:00:13,663
greater than 2 standard deviations above the mean. And since the distribution is

3
00:00:13,663 --> 00:00:20,370
symmetrical then that means 2.5% is here and 2.5% is here. So our answer is 2.5%

4
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:25,531
since 262 is the value 2 standard deviations above the mean.
