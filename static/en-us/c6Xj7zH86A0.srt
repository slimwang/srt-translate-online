00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This segment is my explanation of correspondence in stereo vision.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It came a long way. There are a few things that don't work really well.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
For example, we have two cameras over here, and we have a big object over here

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
with a foreground separate object.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Then the order contraint is being opposed and dynamic programming doesn't hold.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
That is, an object over here might appear left of the object over here in the left imager

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
but right of the object over here in the right imager.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
There are other cases where things go wrong.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
For example, suppose you were imaging a circular object with these two imagers here.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Then the occlusion boundary of this object as viewed from the right imager

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
is different from the occlusion boundary of the same object as viewed from the left imager.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
These are not corresponding points. They correspond to different points on the object.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
As a result, your stereo calculation will give you a poor result.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
A final instance where things might go wrong is

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
reflective objects that have specular reflections.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
This ball over here reflects the ceiling lights,

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and obviously, where the ceiling lights are being reflected

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
is a function of where an imager is positioned.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
For these specific features over here,

20
00:01:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
we get a really lousy depth estimate for the object at hand.
