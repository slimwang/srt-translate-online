1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,680
Now that we can draw pretty platforms,
we need to let GigaGal land on them.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,640
We've got a bit of a tricky
decision on our hands though.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,310
What class should be responsible for

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,600
determining when GigaGal
has landed on a platform?

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,200
Should the platform determine when
it's been stomped on by GigaGal?

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,610
Should GigaGal determine
when she has hit a platform?

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,480
Or should the level object orchestrate
the interaction of its minions.
