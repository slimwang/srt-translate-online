1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Well, in our very first quiz we're just going to look it up.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It turns out there was other sold at the same size, and it brought in $104,000.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In the interest of statistics, the answer is $104,000.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This is not the game theory class.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Obviously, you wouldn't want to bid that much,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but in the interest of statistics, that's what you'd expect to pay.
