1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,000
Just like with the z-test, when the t-statistic is far from 0 in either

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,290
direction, in other words, if the sample mean is far from this population mean,

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:14,300
we reject the null. The first thing we're going to do is compare the sample

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,629
mean with the population mean. So in this case, t is the sample mean minus the

5
00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:26,640
population mean, mu naught, divided by the standard error. And instead of being

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,709
stigma divided by root n, we use the sample standard deviation. Since the

7
00:00:30,709 --> 00:00:34,674
t-statistic depends on so many factors, let's takes some quizzes to make sure

8
00:00:34,674 --> 00:00:38,578
we understand how these factors affect the t-statistic, and therefore, our

9
00:00:38,578 --> 00:00:45,920
statistical decision. The larger or smaller the value of x bar, the stronger

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,376
the evidence that the population mean that the sample comes from is greater

11
00:00:49,376 --> 00:00:55,821
than this population mean we're comparing it to. Similarly, the larger or

12
00:00:55,821 --> 00:01:00,436
smaller the value of x bar, the stronger the evidence that the population mean

13
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:07,361
that x bar comes from is less than this certain value we are comparing it to.

14
00:01:07,361 --> 00:01:11,716
And finally, the further the value of x bar from mu naught in either direction,

15
00:01:11,716 --> 00:01:17,513
the stronger or weaker the evidence that mu is not equal to mu naught.
