1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,400
So now I'm talking with
Charles Hewitt who's the Director of

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:08,200
HIE Program Management here at
Rhode Island Quality Institute and

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:08,950
Current Care.

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:09,670
Thank you very much for
taking time to be with us today.

5
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,000
>> You're welcome.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,910
I'm glad to be here.

7
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,480
>> We're mostly going to
talk about direct and

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,230
the direct services you provide, but

9
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,670
before we do that, as the student's
are going to learn in the next lesson,

10
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:25,310
patient privacy is always a concern
when health data is being utilized.

11
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:25,910
>> Absolutely.

12
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,820
>> And can you briefly tell us what
patient privacy model you use?

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,080
Students are going to learn about
the various models later on.

14
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,330
>> Sure.
In Rhode Island, is a so

15
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,180
called opt-in state.

16
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,740
In our case, the opt-in is very strict.

17
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:48,100
As an HIE, we cannot even see your
data until you have given consent for

18
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,220
us to see it, to collect it.

19
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,520
When you do give your consent,
in the Rhode Island model,

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,500
you give consent for all of your data,

21
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:02,230
including sensitive data like substance
abuse treatment, for example.

22
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,780
You know also when you give consent,

23
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,520
you're consenting to
who can see your data.

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,590
And you basically have three choices.

25
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:14,000
The first choice is anyone that's
treating me, providing treatment or

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,650
coordination of care.

27
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:19,440
The second choice is
only in an emergency,

28
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,400
only in an emergency will I
allow anybody to see my data.

29
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,529
And the third choice is just for
these providers.

30
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,070
And you actually list them on the form.

31
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,380
>> Well that's interesting.

32
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,300
Do you know off the top of your head
what percentage of patients fall

33
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,540
into each bucket?

34
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,280
>> Absolutely.

35
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,640
About a little over 95%,
96%, that range,

36
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,136
select the first option,
all of my providers.

37
00:01:44,136 --> 00:01:48,596
About 2% to 3% select emergencies only,
and

38
00:01:48,596 --> 00:01:55,700
about half of 1% select the third
option, just these providers.

39
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,980
>> Just skipping ahead for a second,
what's being avoided here, which we'll

40
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:05,200
discuss a lot in a lesson later on in
the course, is the issue of allowing

41
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,710
patients to select which data they want
to share, which is very hard to do.

42
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:13,440
>> Absolutely, and
in fact it's a very challenging topic,

43
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,410
this so-called segmentation.

44
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:20,130
In Rhode Island,
the law is all of your data.

45
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,900
And that was basically the result of
a compromise between the consumer

46
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,350
advocates that wanted to be
able to hold certain data back.

47
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:33,950
And physicians that said, I need it all
in order to provide effective treatment.

48
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,840
>> Well, data segmentation will be a
topic we look at in some detail, later.

49
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,580
The second thing, and really,
the primary focus, I hope, is for

50
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,850
you to give us more detail.

51
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,990
Laura and
I talked briefly about direct, and

52
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,550
the idea that it's used as a service.

53
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,600
But can you give us more
detail about the sorts of

54
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,180
things you're doing with Direct.

55
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,760
>> Sure,
we're doing two things with Direct.

56
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,570
One is on the inbound side,

57
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,790
where we are collecting data
from data-sharing partners.

58
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:08,440
We use Direct to get feeds of
continuity care documents, CCDs.

59
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,370
>> Students know what those are.

60
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:15,310
>> From the instance of the EHR
that they happen to be using.

61
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:20,740
So if they're using, for example,
Allscripts, we worked with Allscripts so

62
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,780
that Allscripts would
generate a proper CCD,

63
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,780
attach it to a direct message, and send
it to the current care gateway where,

64
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,750
it is checked to see whether that
patient has consented or not, and

65
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,100
if the patient is consented,
it flows on into current care.

66
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,640
Otherwise, it's blocked at the gateway.

67
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,360
>> And I understood from
chatting with Laura that that

68
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,740
process is fairly automated.

69
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,790
The provider doesn't have
to do that every time.

70
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,480
>> Very much so.

71
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,300
In fact, it's automatic.

72
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:54,150
Once it's set up, when the provider
takes a certain action like lockup

73
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,060
their record after an encounter.

74
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:01,470
The system automatically does all
this process of creating a CCD and

75
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,770
sending it off to CurrentCare.

76
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,672
It's all completely
invisible to the practice.

77
00:04:05,672 --> 00:04:09,447
>> I also know from talking to Laura
that you have a fairly large number of

78
00:04:09,447 --> 00:04:12,062
EHR systems implemented
here in Rhode Island.

79
00:04:12,062 --> 00:04:14,980
Were the vendors pretty
amenable to doing this?

80
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,059
>> I would say some were, some weren't.

81
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:20,709
>> [LAUGH]
>> Part of the problem is that

82
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:26,109
the vendors have a lot of priorities
especially meaningful use.

83
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,580
And so implementing this feed for

84
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:35,240
the Rhode Island HIE, in many cases,
has been way down the list.

85
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,128
And we have to basically

86
00:04:39,128 --> 00:04:43,530
encourage the practices

87
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:47,990
that want to send us data to go back
to their EHR vendor and tell them.

88
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,040
I need you to do this for me.

89
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,720
>> So what about some of the services,
go the other way.

90
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,580
You've got the data now.

91
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,580
>> I've got the data now.

92
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,100
Now on the outbound side,

93
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,310
the major service we provide
using Direct are alerts.

94
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,920
There are three kinds of alerts.

95
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,570
One is a so called hospital alert.

96
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:09,610
In that case, we receive ADT
transaction from a hospital.

97
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,170
You've been admitted say, to the ER.

98
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:15,850
And in that transaction

99
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:20,330
has been entered the identification
of your primary care physician.

100
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,150
We look up that primary care physician,
and if they're subscribing to alerts,

101
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:31,670
then we create
a notification message and

102
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:36,790
it's a very simple email type message.

103
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,520
Very little information
in the message itself.

104
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,680
And send that off to the practice.

105
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:48,320
Typically, that message is received
in an inbox that's being monitored

106
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,680
by a nurse case manager, and that person
will decide what to do with the message.

107
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,040
There's a link in the message
to the CurrentCare viewer.

108
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,450
So if they want, they can go in and
review what the ADT was in detail,

109
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,980
along with all the other
information that's in CurrentCare.

110
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,110
>> What is the adoption of these alerts?

111
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,116
>> Right now we have, here in
Rhode Island and we're a small state.

112
00:06:13,116 --> 00:06:16,180
>> Yes.

113
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,870
>> But we have 150 practices
that have subscribed and

114
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:28,970
they represent about 400 to 500
subscriber providers, individual people.

115
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,440
And we generate about between 5 and
6,000 alerts per month to that group.

116
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,531
>> Well, this has been fascinating.

117
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:38,053
Thank you very much for
taking the time to do this.

118
00:06:38,053 --> 00:06:40,840
>> You're welcome, Mark.
Nice to speak with you.
