00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now there is a new market and here, the customers are really unknown.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
All you have is a vision and a set of hypothesis, and what you're hoping is you're going to provide

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
for customers is something transformational--not just incremental improvement

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
but transformational improvement.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And the good news is and bad news is that there are no competitors on day 1--it's pretty lonely.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So for this market to exist, you're going to have to create it through a force of will and a lot of money

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and that's going to require evangelism and education.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
An example--Groupon. Groupon single handedly created the daily deals market.
