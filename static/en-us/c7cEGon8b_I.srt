1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,270
So like David said, given this negative example, we'll specialize this

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,090
most general model. And we'll prune out those specializations that no longer

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:11,650
match the data. Given this, how many specializations are left after the pruning?
