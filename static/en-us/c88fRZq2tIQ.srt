1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,130
A should be here and here. If the variabilities of each sample were smaller,

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,330
then it's more likely that the population means would be significantly

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,480
different. But since the variabilities are large, then it looks like the null

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,735
hypothesis would be true. And in this case, the between-group variability is

5
00:00:19,735 --> 00:00:24,747
small. Which results in a smaller f statistic, in which case we would accept

6
00:00:24,747 --> 00:00:29,922
the null. This one though, thought within group variability is small, and the

7
00:00:29,922 --> 00:00:36,290
between group variability is large relative to that. This is b. And here it

8
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:40,700
looks like the population means from one and two would not be significantly

9
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:45,630
different But 3 would be from both 1 and 2, that's d.
