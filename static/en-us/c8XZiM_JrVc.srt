00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:06,300
So, let's do a quiz on the relative merits of processor performance, power,

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:11,390
weight, and cost. We will have several processor models with

3
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,250
the relative performance, expected battery life, weight

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,784
of the overall computer, and the cost of the processor. The

5
00:00:20,784 --> 00:00:25,890
question for you is, which one of these will be the worst for laptops.

6
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,366
The first model is the CRAWLIUM. There's very

7
00:00:29,366 --> 00:00:33,174
little performance, very long battery life, extremely light,

8
00:00:33,174 --> 00:00:35,770
and dirt cheap. The next model is the

9
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,440
SLOWIUM. It has much more performance, half the

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,820
battery life, however. It's still very light, but

11
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,360
it's four times as heavy as the CRAWLIUM.

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,734
And about three times more expensive. Then we

13
00:00:47,734 --> 00:00:51,024
have our LAPTIUM processor. It has twice the performance

14
00:00:51,024 --> 00:00:55,710
of the SLOWIUM, five hours of battery life. It's twice as heavy as the SLOWIUMN,

15
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,644
costS about $100. Then we have the FASTIUM,

16
00:00:58,644 --> 00:01:02,879
which has more performance, significantly less battery life,

17
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,910
however. It's about one pound in weight, cost

18
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,163
$200 for the processor. Then we have the

19
00:01:09,163 --> 00:01:13,051
HOTIUM at more performance, 15 minute battery life,

20
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:16,534
3 pounds and $500 and the BURNIUM processor,

21
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:19,450
double the performance of the HOTIUM, its

22
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,690
battery lasts 2 minutes, it's 20 pounds in

23
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,295
weight and costs $5,000. So, which one of

24
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:29,530
these would you least want in your laptop.
