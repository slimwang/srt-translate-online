If you got any of these correct, great work. We can use our area model to figure

2
00:00:05,043 --> 00:00:09,971
out the product of these two binomials. We know x time x is x squared, x times

3
00:00:09,971 --> 00:00:14,930
negative 4 is negative 4x. Positive 4 times x is positive 4x, and positive 4

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,919
times negative 4 is negative 16. We use a similar approach to figure out this

00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:22,438
multiplication problem and this one.
