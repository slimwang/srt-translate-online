1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So let's look at just one more example.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We're going to be testing some sort of a graphical application.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So we have a GUI application that's our software under test.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And so we have to ask ourselves what's the domain and range

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
of a graphical user application?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The domain--that is to say, the set of legal inputs--

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
is basically just going to be the set of all possible GUI actions,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
so mouse clicks, keyboard events, swipes, etc.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And the range is going to be possible states of the GUI application.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So now it should go without saying that the size of the domain here--

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
that is to say, the size of the set of all possible GUI inputs--

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
is really pretty gigantic.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
There are a lot of possible combinations of inputs.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And so now I have a quiz question for you.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The question is what constitutes a set of good test inputs for a GUI application?

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Answer a) is just use the application normally.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Answer b) is let a 4-year-old use the application for a while.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Answer c) is use some sort of a tool to inject a stream of fake GUI events--

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
that is to say, a stream of automatically generated keyboard events,

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
mouse clicks, and similar.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And answer d) is reproduce GUI inputs--that is to say, mouse clicks and such--

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
that crashed our previous version of our software.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So go ahead and write all of the answers that apply in the text box here.
