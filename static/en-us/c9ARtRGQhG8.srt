1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,563
Now we really found the inverse function here. But notice that it's labeled as

2
00:00:05,563 --> 00:00:10,350
y. And that could get confusing since I already had a y up here. Which stood

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:16,090
for my original function. Y was the output of this function. So in order to not

4
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:22,799
confuse these two. Let's label this f inverse of x. So instead of having y

5
00:00:22,799 --> 00:00:30,389
equals the quantity x minus 3 divided by 2. We'll have f inverse of x equals x

6
00:00:30,389 --> 00:00:36,502
minus 3 divided by 2. Now, notice that this is actually a line too. If we

7
00:00:36,502 --> 00:00:41,896
divide 2 into each term, we'll have f inverse of x equals 1 half x minus 3

8
00:00:41,896 --> 00:00:49,604
halves. negative 3 halves or negative 1 and a half is our y intercept. And

9
00:00:49,604 --> 00:00:54,426
slope hear would be positive 1 half. And I just want to caution you to be

10
00:00:54,426 --> 00:00:58,777
careful with this negative 1. This isn't an exponent like we normally think

11
00:00:58,777 --> 00:01:04,498
about it. This is just the notation for the inverse of a function. So if we

12
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:11,361
take sum input x and we multiply it by 2 and add 3. To undo these operations we

13
00:01:11,361 --> 00:01:16,900
would have to subtract 3 first and then divide by 2. Now, that should make

14
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,500
sense since we're just undoing the last operation we did to x and working

15
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:26,270
backwards. So we need to undo add by 3, which is minus 3, and then we undo the

16
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:32,632
multiplication of 2, which is divide by 2. Let's look closely at the graph of

17
00:01:32,632 --> 00:01:37,550
this function. And its inverse to see one more unique relationship. It's

18
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:41,756
actually one we've already encountered. Here on this blue graph, I've graphed a

19
00:01:41,756 --> 00:01:47,336
line, y equals 2 x plus 3. We have a y intercept at 3. And a slope of up two

20
00:01:47,336 --> 00:01:53,888
units, right one unit to get our next point of 1, 5. Now, our inverse function

21
00:01:53,888 --> 00:01:59,567
was 1 half x minus 3 halves. Or we could have written the equation like this. X

22
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:05,575
minus 3 all divided by 2. It's the same exact line. Notice that for this line,

23
00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:12,325
our y-intercept is at negative 3 halves, and the slope is positive 1, right 2.

24
00:02:12,325 --> 00:02:18,358
Positive 1, right 2. So again, this was our original function and then this on

25
00:02:18,358 --> 00:02:24,446
was the inverse. Now what I want to show you is this line y equals x. Here's

26
00:02:24,446 --> 00:02:30,880
the black line drawn in. Notice that the function and its inverse are reflected

27
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:36,940
over the line y equals x. In other words if we fold this part over the black

28
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:42,713
line, we would get this inverse function of our graph. And if we fold this part

29
00:02:42,713 --> 00:02:46,867
of the original function over our black line we get this part of the inverse

30
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:52,640
function. If we look more closely at a point like 0.3, which is on our original

31
00:02:52,640 --> 00:03:00,263
function, we can find a corresponding point on the inverse function. This one's

32
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:07,796
3.0. Notice the x and the y coordinates have changed.They switched places. This

33
00:03:07,796 --> 00:03:12,834
is what's so unique about inverse functions. The x and y-coordinates always

34
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:16,415
change. So if we choose another point in the graph, like negative 1.5, 0 for

35
00:03:16,415 --> 00:03:24,761
our function, we can find it on our inverse function. That would be 0, negative

36
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:31,429
1.5. And again, the x and the y-coordinate switch places. Even for a point like

37
00:03:31,429 --> 00:03:37,378
negative 4, comma negative 5, we can find that on our inverse. On our inverse

38
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:44,250
function it will be negative 5, negative 4. That point is right here.
