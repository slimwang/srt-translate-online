1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,670
iOS also has several other
run time security measures.

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,010
Address space layout randomization or

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:12,380
ASLR protects against exploitation
of memory corruption bugs.

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,700
With ASLR, when an app is run,
all memory regions are randomized.

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,650
Randomly arranging the memory addresses
of executable code system libraries,

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,590
stacks, and heaps, and
other related programming contracts,

7
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:30,480
reduces the likelihood of
many sophisticated exploits.

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,060
For example, an attempted Lib C
attack attempts to trick a device

9
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,080
into executing malicious code,

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,260
by manipulating memory addresses
of the stack and system libraries.

11
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,430
By randomizing the addresses of
these system libraries and stacks,

12
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,680
it will be hard for
such an attack to succeed, because

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,020
the addresses of these system libraries
and stacks are very hard to guess.
