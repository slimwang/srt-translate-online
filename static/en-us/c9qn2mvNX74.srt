1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
In fact, it's now infinite.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I can reapply this subject goes to subject rule

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
as many times as I want.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Students and students and students and teachers think.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And if someone were to challenge me and say,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
"Oh, there are only 5 strings in your grammar,"

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I could always make a new one by using this rule

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
one more time, so for any number you might think are produced,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I can always get 1 more, so the number of potential strings I can produce is infinite.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That's a huge amount of scope for creativity.
