00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,640
When a server receives
an HTTP request it returns

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,840
a response message to the client.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,680
This response can contain
the information requested or

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,830
an error message if there was one.

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,240
Similarly to the HTTP request message,

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,020
the response consists of a message
header and optional body.

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,190
The first line of the header
is called the Status Line.

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,540
Followed by optional response headers.

9
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:27,280
The status line contains the HTTP
version, status code, and

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,780
a reason phrase that explains
the status code in English.

11
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,470
Here are some common status codes and
reason phrases.

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,990
The optional response headers take
the form of name value pairs,

13
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,980
similarly to their request
header counterparts.

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,798
the response message body contains
the data that the client requested.

15
00:00:44,798 --> 00:00:46,719
If the client asked for a web page,

16
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,578
a sample response might
look something like this.

17
00:00:52,272 --> 00:00:55,640
When you search the web, your web
browser takes care of creating HTTP

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,110
requests and
rendering responses onto your screen.

19
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,030
But as an API developer, there will
be times when you have to create and

20
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,410
dissect these messages yourself.

21
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,420
You'll learn some ways to
do this in the next video.
