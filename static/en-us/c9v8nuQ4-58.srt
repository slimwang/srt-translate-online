00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,020
It's your turn to try an example.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:06,330
Let's suppose we have a random variable X,

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,340
which has a relationship with random variable Y, and separately with Z.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,120
The relationship between X and Y is described in this joint probability table.

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:22,210
And separately, the relationship between X and Z is described in this table.

6
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,590
The question is, which feature is better, Y or Z,

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,930
for describing random variable acts?
