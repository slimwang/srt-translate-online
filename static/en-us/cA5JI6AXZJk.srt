1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,140
The answer is that the starting blocks are

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,190
the busy blocks that don't have any other

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,700
blocks pointing to them. Right away then, we

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,900
can eliminate the blocks that aren't busy. And then

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,386
I'll just read these next pointers, and eliminate those blocks as well. So this

6
00:00:14,386 --> 00:00:19,784
eliminates 6. This is an ending block, so he's not eliminated. This

7
00:00:19,784 --> 00:00:25,770
eliminates 1. And this eliminates 2. So,

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:33,040
we are left with 3, 5 and 1 as starting blocks. Just for

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,430
good measure, let's go ahead and build the chains as well. We'll start with 3

10
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:43,850
and he then would seem to point to 1 who then points to 6,

11
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:50,105
when he then is done. 5 just sits there all by himself, and 7,

12
00:00:50,105 --> 00:00:56,360
would seem to point to 2, who

13
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:02,610
then is the last one. So there are the 3 files captured by this fact.
