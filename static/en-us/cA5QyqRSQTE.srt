1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,010
In this lesson we will
be reviewing caches.

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,930
You should already know most of this,
but

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:08,840
it is extremely important to
understand the basics of caches

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:14,260
before we move on to virtual memory and
other more advanced caching topics.

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:18,800
So this lesson has much more detail
than your typical review type lesson.
