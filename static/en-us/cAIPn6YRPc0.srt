00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,305
Let's talk through some examples
of predicting numeric and

2
00:00:03,305 --> 00:00:05,030
non-numeric outcomes.

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,310
We'll use these examples
throughout the rest of the lesson.

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:09,755
Let's use three examples,

5
00:00:09,755 --> 00:00:13,280
a tricycle manufacturer,
a marketing organization, and a bank.

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,100
For our first example, imagine that
a manufacturer wants to use historical

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,750
production data to know how many
tricycles they'll need to produce

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,280
over the next six months,
to meet expected demand.

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,980
Since the outcome the manufacturer
wants to predict is a number,

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,509
then the target variable is numeric.

11
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:36,320
Therefore, they would use a numeric, or
regression, model to solve this problem.

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,430
For our second example, Hot and
Fresh Pizza wants to use sales data from

13
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:46,780
their existing stores, and respective
demographic data around those stores,

14
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,850
to predict how many pizzas they'll
sell at their new store location.

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,101
Since the outcome that Hot and
Fresh pizza is trying to predict

16
00:00:54,101 --> 00:00:57,050
is the number of pizzas,
then the target variable is numeric, and

17
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,284
they would use a numeric, or regression,
model to solve this problem.

18
00:01:00,284 --> 00:01:02,538

19
00:01:02,538 --> 00:01:07,010
And for our third example, a bank wants
to use historical data of their clients

20
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:11,413
to predict whether a new customer will
default on a loan, always pay on time,

21
00:01:11,413 --> 00:01:13,410
or sometimes pay.

22
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,500
Since the outcome the bank is trying
to predict is a category that the new

23
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,390
customer will fall into, they would
use non-numeric, or classification,

24
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,860
models to solve this problem.
