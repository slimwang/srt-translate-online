00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,620
Opening up DevTools we very quickly find this error for fail to load resource.

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:12,030
Error name not resolved, yeah, that's how you're supposed to say it.

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,750
Clearly this is not a real URL so we see the name not resolved error.

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,990
Inside the Network tab we see that this GET request is in red,

5
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,510
indicating that it failed.

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:22,770
Well the other one here for

7
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,670
New York times showed up with a code of 200 indicating that it's a-okay.

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,470
If something doesn't look right on your page, going to dev tools and

9
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,820
opening up the network tab is a great place to get started.

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,490
We can also see that error handling worked because we failed to

11
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:37,820
get Wikipedia resources.

12
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,950
This is once again a nice way of letting the users know that, hey,

13
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,970
something didn't quite go right without breaking the entire page.
