1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,250
So what are the steps involved
in these types of projects?

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,689
Before you jump in and
write a fancy algorithm,

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:08,119
you'll want to spend some time
getting familiar with your data.

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,300
The process begins with
a question you want to answer or

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,260
a problem you want to solve.

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,690
This might be something like,

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,290
what are the characteristics of
students who pass their projects?

8
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:23,150
Or how can I better stock my store with
the products people most want to buy?

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,860
The next step of the process
is data wrangling and

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,240
this really has two parts,
data acquisition and data cleaning.

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,990
First, you need to acquire the data
that you need to answer your question or

12
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,790
solve your problem.

13
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,410
Then it's time to begin
investigating the data and

14
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,950
cleaning up any problems that you find.

15
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,830
The third phase is data exploration.

16
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,280
During this phase, you spend some
time getting familiar with your data,

17
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,350
building your intuition about it and
finding patterns.

18
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,080
Once you're familiar with your data,
you'll usually want to draw some

19
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,310
conclusions about it or
maybe make some predictions.

20
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:01,190
From one of our examples previously,
Netflix's movie recommendation systems

21
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,310
needs to predict which
movies its users will like.

22
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,060
Also the Facebook paper we saw concluded
that users are less likely to click

23
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,680
certain articles, specifically one's
written from a different ideological

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,950
perspective than the user has.

25
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:18,120
This phase usually involves statistics
or machine learning that are beyond

26
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,300
the scope of this course, but
there are additional Udacity courses

27
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,810
you can take on these topics,
if you're interested learning more.

28
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,420
And finally, you'll need to communicate
your findings to other people.

29
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,140
Your findings are only as useful as
your ability to communicate them.

30
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,540
Even if your end goal is to
build some sort of system,

31
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:38,150
like a movie recommender or
a news feed ranking algorithm,

32
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:42,060
you'll usually need to share what you've
built and how it works with your team.

33
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,710
There are a variety of formats
this communication can take.

34
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:49,622
You might write a blog post,
a paper, an email,

35
00:01:49,622 --> 00:01:56,420
a PowerPoint presentation, or
just have an in-person conversation.

36
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,900
Data visualization is a common
technique that's almost always useful

37
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,660
when communicating findings about data.

38
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,410
Now, this process doesn't
actually follow a straight line.

39
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,639
Especially the data wrangling phase and
to the data exploration phase

40
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,660
are very intertwined because you can't
really clean any problems with the data

41
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,210
before you take a look to
see what problems there are.

42
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,840
And even when you think you're done
wrangling and you're ready to just

43
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,070
explore, you'll keep finding more
problems and have to go back.

44
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,080
Throughout the process, you may
need to return to your question and

45
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,550
refine it as you become more
familiar with the data set.

46
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:35,040
And sometimes data acquisition actually
comes before you pose a question.

47
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,760
If a new, exciting data set is released,
you might acquire the data first,

48
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,230
take a look and see what's there, and

49
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,930
then think of some questions
you could answer with the data.

50
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,380
That's what we'll be
doing in this lesson.

51
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,900
However, this should give you an idea of
the high level steps that are involved

52
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,300
when you're doing data analysis.
