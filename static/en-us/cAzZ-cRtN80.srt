1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,580
Okay, Michael. You got the answer?

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,580
>> Yeah, I think, well I can work

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,100
through it, I don't actually have the number yet.

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,200
>> Okay, let's do that.

5
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,350
>> So, alright, so in a world where.

6
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:09,570
>> In a world where.

7
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,500
>> Where this is the hypothesis that actually matters. We're saying that X

8
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,320
comes in, the hypothesis spits that same X out. And then this noise process

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,430
causes it to become a multiple. And the probability of a multiple is this

10
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:25,320
one over two to the case. So, the probability that that would happen from

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,580
this hypothesis. for the very first data item. The one to five, would be

12
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:35,200
1 32nd. That's the probability that a one would produce a five by this process.

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,230
>> Okay. How do you, how'd you figure that out?

14
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,180
>> Cause the k that we would need

15
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,490
the multiplier would have to be five. And so

16
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,890
the probability for that multiplier is exactly one over

17
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,100
two to the five which is one 30 second.

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:47,780
>> Okay.

19
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,540
>> And so then I would use that same thought

20
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:55,670
process on the next one which says that it is doubled and the way that

21
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,150
this particular process would have produced a doubling

22
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,285
would be if with, with probability a quarter.

23
00:01:01,285 --> 00:01:02,780
>> Uh-hm.

24
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,980
>> And, the next data element would have

25
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,990
been produced by this process with probability at

26
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,930
half, because it's k will be 1, and 1 over 2 to the k would be half,

27
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:12,830
>> Okay, I like this.

28
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,580
>> Right? The next one will be an 8th, because its

29
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,010
tripled,

30
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,483
>> Uh-hm.

31
00:01:18,483 --> 00:01:21,130
>> And the last one is also a multiplier of 5, just

32
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,855
like the first one, so that will be one thirty second as well,

33
00:01:23,855 --> 00:01:25,361
>> Mm-hm.

34
00:01:25,361 --> 00:01:27,130
>> Alright but now we need to assign a probability

35
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,330
to the whole data set, and because you told me it

36
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,100
was okay to think about these things happening independently, the

37
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,280
probability that all these things would happen is exactly the product.

38
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,870
>> Right.

39
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,945
>> So I'll multiply a 32nd and a quarter and

40
00:01:40,945 --> 00:01:45,940
1/2 and an 8th and a 32nd, so that's like a factor of 5 plus 2

41
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:51,710
is 7 plus 1 is 8. Plus another

42
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:56,738
3 is 11 plus another 5 is 16 and 2^16

43
00:01:56,738 --> 00:02:01,120
is 65,536. So it should be 1 over, oh you already wrote it. 65,536. Yea that.

44
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,970
>> Yes that's absolutely correct Michael. Well done. Okay so,

45
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,008
that's right, but you did it with a bunch of specific numbers. Is

46
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:13,130
there a more generic Is there a general form that we could write down?

47
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,020
>> Yeah, I think so, we're doing something pretty regular

48
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:21,060
once I fell into a pattern. So, I took the D,

49
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,230
and divided by X, so D over X tells me

50
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,950
that the multiplier that was used, so that's like, the K.

51
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,020
>> So. D over x gave you the k.

52
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,330
>> And it was one

53
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,520
over 2 to the that.

54
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,790
>> Okay, so one over 2 to the that.

55
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:39,960
>> And it was then the product of, of that quantity for all of

56
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,910
the data elements, so all the i's. So product over all the i's of that.

57
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,490
>> Okay.

58
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,060
>> But we have to be careful because If it

59
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,470
was the case that for any of our xi's the

60
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,970
d wasn't a multiple of it, that can't happen under

61
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,930
this hypothesis and the whole probability needs to go to zero.

62
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:55,530
>> Right.

63
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,400
>> So they all have to

64
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,610
be divisible otherwise all bets are off.

65
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,490
>> Okay, so in other words if d of i mod x of

66
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,910
i is equal to zero and this formula holds and it's zero otherwise.

67
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,830
>> Exactly.

68
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:10,470
>> Okay. Sounds good. Okay, great Michael. So that's right and that

69
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,230
was exactly the right way of thinking about it. And now, what we're

70
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,960
going to do next, is we're going to take what we've just gone through.

71
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:21,410
This sort of process of thinking about, how to generate data labels. for,

72
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,050
you know, noisy cases and we're going to apply to it what I

73
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:27,417
think you will find will be a pretty cool derivation. Sound good?

74
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:28,368
>> Awesome!

75
00:03:28,368 --> 00:03:29,589
>> Excellent.
