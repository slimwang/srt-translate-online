1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,759
In this first exercise, we will handle
incrementing the number of glasses of

2
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:08,019
water that the user has consumed
when they click on this cup icon.

3
00:00:09,471 --> 00:00:12,309
You have already seen this
PreferenceUtils clause that

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:15,630
handles incrementing the shared
preferences count values.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,990
Now, even though updating a single
integer value in short preference is

6
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:23,679
pretty fast,
we have decided to use intentServices

7
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,350
to manage this increment
process in the background, why?

8
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:31,910
Well, imagine if this increment action
was to update the counter in some remote

9
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,170
database that keeps track of
all your health activities and

10
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,859
synchronizes all your devices together.

11
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:40,869
This could be a time consuming
process that we'd want to perform on

12
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:42,119
a background thread.

13
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:46,179
Also, when we get to sunshine,
we will need to update the weather data

14
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:49,929
in the background separately from
the activities life cycle because server

15
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:54,539
requests could be time consuming and
might outlast the activities lifetime.

16
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,219
So learning how to use
IntenseServices here

17
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:59,899
will help us update sunshine later on.

18
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:02,239
So to help keep our code organized and

19
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,409
modular, we will create a helper
class called ReminderTask.

20
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:10,969
This class defines all the tasks that
will run in the background for this app.

21
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:14,530
We'll start with creating a task
to increment the water count.

22
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,969
This means the activity will
start the IntentService,

23
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:22,739
which will then execute the increment
order count task in the ReminderTask.

24
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:25,319
And then this task will
use the PreferenceUtils to

25
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:27,989
increment the counter in
the SharedPreferences.

26
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:30,299
Okay, so to implement all of that,

27
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,890
you'll need to create a class
that extends from IntentService.

28
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:37,870
Inside, you'll execute
the tasks in onHandelIntent.

29
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,700
And then finally, in main activity,

30
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,570
you'll start this IntentService
using startService.

31
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:46,989
Okay, let's start coding.
