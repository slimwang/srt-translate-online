00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,990
The proportion of students who said they saw broken glass is 29 out of 150,

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:12,470
which is about 19%. There was 50 students in the hit group so we would expect

3
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:18,225
that this proportion of 50 would say yes within that group. This comes out to

4
00:00:18,225 --> 00:00:24,950
9.67 even though it's a decimal and we wouldn't expect 2 3rds of the students

5
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:31,170
to say yes, this is still our expected frequency. We do the same thing here. If

6
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:37,835
we expect 29 out of 150 to say yes, then we would expect how many out of just

7
00:00:37,835 --> 00:00:42,100
50? This is just another way to look at the same thing we did here in the hit

8
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:49,434
group. This is the same as 29 divided by 150 times 50 which is the same thing.

9
00:00:49,434 --> 00:00:57,200
9.67. This will also be 9.67. Note that we could have put different numbers of

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,440
students in each of these groups. We didn't have to divide them evenly. In the

11
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:08,376
problem set you'll get more practice with unequal groups. Now for no, we expect

12
00:01:08,376 --> 00:01:16,460
121 out of 150 to say no. And so out of a group of 50, we would expect 121

13
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:23,940
divided by 150 times 50 to say no. This is 40.33 and this will be the same in

14
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:29,330
all of them since each group has 50 students. To simplify things, we can

15
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:35,010
calculate the expected values by simply doing the column total times the row

16
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:39,990
total divided by the grand total where the grand total is the total number of

17
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:45,080
people involved in this study. However its really important that you understand

18
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:50,490
intuitively how to calculate the expected frequencies. Don't just use a formula

19
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,570
because I give it to you. Its better to understand it than to plug and chug. By

20
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,670
plug and chug, I mean you plug values into the formula and you get something

21
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,520
out, but without really understanding what you're doing. Hopefully I explained

22
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,420
it enough to where you understand it intuitively. But if not, feel free to

23
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:12,120
write in the forums. You can also email me because I email you every week. So

24
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,540
you should have my email address.
