1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,819
There are thousands upon
thousands of jobs out there and

2
00:00:03,819 --> 00:00:06,099
searching through them
can be exhausting.

3
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:09,289
What we'll focus on now is how
to search for jobs effectively

4
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:13,399
to reduce the amount of stress and time
you'll spend on each job application.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,230
While you're searching for jobs, you
should know what you want, research to

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,179
understand what your employer wants,
and be open to opportunity.

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,429
Knowing what you want and only searching
for roles that match these requirements

8
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:28,100
makes it easier for
you to find the right jobs for you.

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,230
It eliminates a lot of
job search fatigue, so

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,719
you don't burn out with applications or
during interviews.

11
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,120
Before you begin a job search,
write down two or

12
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,179
three things you cannot compromise on.

13
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:41,659
For example,
your requirements may be location.

14
00:00:41,659 --> 00:00:42,969
You and
your family may not be able to move.

15
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:45,820
Another is company mission.

16
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,119
You want to do work you're proud of.

17
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:49,719
Another important one is the role.

18
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:53,640
This may seem obvious, but making
a distinction between the jobs you could

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,840
do and the jobs you want to do will
keep you motivated in your job search.

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,350
If you can't think of any requirements,
ask yourself if you'd be happy in any

21
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,010
job, even if its in a location you
don't want to live in, even if its for

22
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,550
a company whose mission
you're not passionate about.

23
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:11,539
Although being open to anything may seem
like a good thing, to the employer it

24
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,970
may seem like you are not committed or
excited about their company.

25
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:18,909
There is a balance between being
flexible and being focused, which is why

26
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:22,890
it's so important to create a targeted
job application and get feedback from

27
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,010
others, so you can see how employers
might perceive your career profile.
