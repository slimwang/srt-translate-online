00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,648
To review, you need to create new
classes, the InstanceIDListener and

2
00:00:04,648 --> 00:00:07,060
the RegistrationIntentService.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,080
And then you need to do the initial
registration in onCreate

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,610
of MainActivity, if the app has
not already been registered.

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:14,810
To see the code we walked through,

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,320
check out the GitHub commit
linked in the instructor notes.

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,950
You'll need to implement these
changes in your app now.
