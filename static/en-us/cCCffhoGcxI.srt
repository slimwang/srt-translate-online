00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,780
For example, let's take a look at a hypothetical set

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,240
of situations. Which of the following scenarios on a computer

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,460
with only Wifi can you detect without trying to make

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,690
a network connection? Can you detect if you have no connection

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,330
to the router at all? Can you detect if the

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,750
router has no internet connection? Or if the router has an

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,660
internet connection but no DNS service? Can you test that

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,550
the router has a connection, but a proxy server is blocking

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,730
a particular site? And can you test whether the

10
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,390
router has a connection but your web server is down?
