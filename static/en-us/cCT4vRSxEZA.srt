1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,260
Well, clearly this is an admissible heuristic, because the distance to the goal

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:09,990
is strictly underestimated. From here, it would take one step, from here, it

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,770
will take one, two steps. So the answer is yes. Now,

4
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:20,760
to understand A star, let me also draw the g

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,614
function for development part of this table. Clearly g is 0

6
00:00:25,614 --> 00:00:30,983
over here. To understand which node to expand, this one or this one, let's

7
00:00:30,983 --> 00:00:37,440
project the g function, which is 1. And we'll see that 3

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,098
plus 1 is smaller than 4 plus 1. Therefore, this is the second

9
00:00:44,098 --> 00:00:50,541
node to expand, which is b1. Now let me, for the next step,

10
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:55,641
expand the g function from this guy here, 2 and 2. So

11
00:00:55,641 --> 00:01:00,880
3 plus 2 plus 2 is 4. Whereas this

12
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,996
3 plus 2 is 5. To expand this node next,

13
00:01:05,996 --> 00:01:11,123
which is c1. And finally, the g function

14
00:01:11,123 --> 00:01:15,617
from here would go 3 and 3. 3 plus 1

15
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:23,625
is better than 3 plus 2, so we will expand d1 next.

16
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:30,274
And notice how in the sum of g and h, this node over here, which has a total

17
00:01:30,274 --> 00:01:35,568
of 4, is better than any other node that is unexpanded.

18
00:01:35,568 --> 00:01:40,752
So in particular, 4 plus 1 is 5, and 3 plus 2 is 5 as well, and 2 plus 3

19
00:01:40,752 --> 00:01:43,880
is 5 as well, so this the next one to expand.
