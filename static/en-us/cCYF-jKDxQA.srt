1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,350
Let's start off with the basics.

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,178
The pinhole camera.

3
00:00:04,178 --> 00:00:07,890
Recall again, a pinhole camera
basically had a opening,

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,460
a small opening in a scene and
of course,

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,750
an image was formed upside down at
the focal length at the image plane.

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,380
An upside down image is formed there.

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,740
In essence, we also kind of
discussed this, that this point here

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,470
basically captured all of the light
in the scene at this point and

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,785
of course, that's what was
then projected at the back.

10
00:00:27,785 --> 00:00:33,240
Now, of course, you can imagine,
that any point on this surface here,

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,145
the gray patch which is basically
where I have the pinhole, any point

12
00:00:37,145 --> 00:00:40,605
in the surface is also actually
kind of capturing all the light.

13
00:00:40,605 --> 00:00:43,965
Of course, since it's no longer a
pinhole, they're not actually coming in.

14
00:00:43,965 --> 00:00:47,465
So, in essence, I could close this hole
and put another hole anywhere else

15
00:00:47,465 --> 00:00:50,405
on this screen, and
that will actually act like a pinhole.

16
00:00:50,405 --> 00:00:55,405
So you could actually put a number of
points, pinholes, in this surface.

17
00:00:55,405 --> 00:01:00,220
And each one of them will basically
then, for this point here, become

18
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,680
the sensor, the light source, that will
actually create an image like this,

19
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,050
of course from a different viewpoint.

20
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:10,950
So you can imagine now anywhere on this
one surface here, a two-dimensional

21
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,960
patch, I can put a pinhole and it will
generate a different image, right?

22
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,930
So in essence that proposes to us
that any point in this whole region

23
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:25,680
has the same capability, not just
on this two-dimensional surface.

24
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,045
So, a point here in space is also
getting what we refer to again when we

25
00:01:31,045 --> 00:01:36,580
looked at earlier stuff as a bundle of
rays of light converging to this point.

26
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:41,260
And that bundle of rays of light here,
basically, is captured here.

27
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:41,942
And of course,

28
00:01:41,942 --> 00:01:45,750
if I was to put a pinhole camera I
would actually capture an image here.

29
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,370
So this is a pencil or
bundle of rays of light at this point.

30
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,990
Of course,
we need not actually just be stuck

31
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,200
to all of the monolith's rays of
light coming from just one direction.

32
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,880
Any point anywhere in
the world basically gets

33
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,360
all of the light converged at this
point from all directions, right?

34
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:09,139
So any point in this scene is basically
capturing a whole lot of rays of

35
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:11,740
light converging to one point.

36
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,220
And it could be any point here, any,

37
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,960
you know, any point in this scene
could actually be doing this.

38
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,860
So just to kind of reiterate that point,
a 3D scene, many points exist in

39
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:28,200
that 3D scene and I'm just pointing out,
you know, a few of them.

40
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,950
So any 3D scene there are lots of these
points around it, each one of them

41
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:38,260
a bundle of rays of light are actually
being collected at it in the 3D scene.

42
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,950
Again this is just pictorially showing
it, look around it at any point in

43
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:46,070
the scene, for example, here, all
rays of light are hitting this point.

44
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,900
Another point here, all rays of
light are collecting on this point.

45
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,080
I could actually create a camera,
pinhole camera, that would capture all

46
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,610
the light and similarly, I could capture
a ray of points of light here to

47
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,250
capture all of the light that
is hitting this point too.

48
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,380
Now, just to simplify this, we can
actually say is that each point here

49
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,720
can be represented as a sphere,
all right?

50
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,280
All of the rays of light are converging
onto this sphere from the world.

51
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,890
So all rays of light
are coming in to each and

52
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:17,450
every one of these spheres from
all three directions, right?

53
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:22,840
So we can basically say that in essence
this world is full of these types of,

54
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,990
you know, specific spheres, and

55
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,180
the point of that center is where
all the light is accumulating.

56
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:33,320
So in essence, any scene is
full of these types of points.

57
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,960
So in essence, again, that basically
says any point in the whole 3D

58
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,675
world is actually capturing pinhole
types of camera information,

59
00:03:42,675 --> 00:03:44,320
except that we are not
just capturing it.

60
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,500
That point is already
capturing that information.

61
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,340
We just haven't put a sensor
there to capture it.
