1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,070
We've helped you focus on you, and

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,850
the message that you convey
into your professional network.

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,730
But what about actually
building a LinkedIn network?

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,240
This is where all of your hard
work comes into fruition.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,470
It's time to get connected with others.

6
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:13,880
Why connect?

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,660
Networking is important.

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,420
Having a connection can actually be
even more powerful than your skills or

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,580
expertise once you have a network, you
might be able to find a connection at

10
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,940
a company you want to work for, and more
people will be aware of your job hunt.

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,760
Who should you connect with?

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,080
Connect with people who like you and
who know how you work.

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,310
Don't connect with someone you've never
met and found via search on LinkedIn and

14
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,930
don't be spamming.

15
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,170
The connections section can also be
a great place for recommendations.

16
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,060
But be selective on who you
asked to recommend you.

17
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,180
Reach out to people who are intimately
aware of the work you've done and

18
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,540
who can speak specifically
about how you contributed.

19
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,830
But don't call for too many.

20
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,860
One recommendation per major
work experience is fine.

21
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,420
If you have five recommendations for

22
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,260
one job, it can look like you
are twisting their arms to write them.
