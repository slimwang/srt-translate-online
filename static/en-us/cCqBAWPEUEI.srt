00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,290
The specific lesson objectives for this lesson are, we will look at the basics

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,390
of what we had started off in our introductory lecture, which basically talks

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,960
about how we're going to go from rays of light in a scene to pixels.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,550
To help us understand this, what I'd like to do is first I'm

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,612
going to introduce a concept of a camera which has no optics.

6
00:00:18,612 --> 00:00:22,200
And, then next thing we will look at is basically add lens and

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,740
our optics into the camera, so

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,320
we can actually start seeing what other foundational elements within a camera.

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,620
And, just to kind of provide us with the mathematical foundations, we're also

10
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,970
going to look at the lens equation on how light goes through a lens and where in

11
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:40,140
an image plane is it formed to create a 3-D scene on a 2-D plane of an image.
