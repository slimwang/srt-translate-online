1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,180
Once your launch page is ready to go,
you'll have a few options for

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,210
where to list your app.

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,880
Like the Google play store, the IOS app
store or even the Chrome web store.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,472
You can develop your app to be
compatible with all the different app

5
00:00:11,472 --> 00:00:14,080
stores out there, but
before you work too hard,

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,990
you may want to start with focusing
on the best app store for your needs.

7
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,450
Now think about your audience and
what they're more likely to use.

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,990
Read the market share research
to validate your assumption.

9
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:28,400
Now if you focus on a specific region,
you can easily find out which operating

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,460
system dominates that market, and
you can develop your app accordingly.

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,070
Our example here will be how to
launch on the Android Play Store

12
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,180
since Android dominates
the global market.

13
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,770
Each stores has its own methods and
requirements to launching.

14
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,050
These things change over time,
so the best thing for

15
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,620
you to do is check out
their documentation.

16
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,910
We've linked to various stores
in the instructor notes.

17
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,310
In the long term, you don't don't need
to choose one app store over another,

18
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,350
if you have an app that fits
many different platforms.

19
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,930
That way you can reach more customers.

20
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,880
But focusing on one first
can help you validate and

21
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,640
perfect your idea before
expanding to another platform.
