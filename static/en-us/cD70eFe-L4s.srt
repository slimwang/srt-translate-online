Correct answer is alpha waves. We see alpha waves when a person is awake, yet

00:00:05,123 --> 00:00:11,165
relaxed or drowsy. These are slower yet higher energy than beta waves. We see

00:00:11,165 --> 00:00:15,270
beta waves also when we're awake, but when we're alert, not relaxed or drowsy.

00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,840
And these are more rapid yet low-energy waves.
