1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,400
So, I'm on the Udacity Facebook page.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,780
It's got some interesting stories, looking down there's Sebastian,

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,610
there's Jessica.

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,220
Oh, there's me.

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,800
But what happens when I scroll down even further?

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,340
We can see that I've got some room to go, and I can keep scrolling down,

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,340
scrolling down, scrolling down.

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,210
And, we can tell that this page isn't infinitely long.

9
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,990
But, what happens if I go all the way down to the bottom?

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,270
All of a sudden, look,

11
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,820
the scroll bar jumps up, and there's stories where there weren't any before.

12
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,390
Let's do it again.

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh, and there we go.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,370
We see that stories keep appearing even though this page isn't reloading.

15
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,720
Facebook accomplishes this through the use of Ajax requests.

16
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,550
Let's go ahead and open up dev tools to see what's going on behind the scenes.
