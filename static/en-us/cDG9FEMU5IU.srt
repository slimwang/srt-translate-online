00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,730
To understand the result we are seeing,

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,210
let's take a closer look at the computation that is happening behind the scenes.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,150
Here are the two images.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,620
The first image is the result of dividing each image by 2 and then adding them.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,650
And the second is the result of adding the two images first and

6
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,350
then dividing by 2.

7
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,150
The first image has better detail and

8
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,510
is also slightly brighter than the second one.

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,850
Now, we know that these images are just collections of intensity values.

10
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:36,040
And values at each corresponding location are being added together.

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:43,277
Let's take two sample values, say, 183 from one image and 152 from the other.

12
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:48,610
Now, in the first case, we divide these numbers by 2 and then add the results.

13
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:52,120
In the second case, we add the two numbers first.

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,710
What do you think is the result in these two cases?
