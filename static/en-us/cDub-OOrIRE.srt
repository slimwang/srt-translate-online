1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let me do this once again.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
There are 2 coins in the bag,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
coin 1 and coin 2.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And as before, taking coin 1 at 0.5 probability.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
But now I'm telling you

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
that coin 1 is loaded, so give you heads with probability of 1.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Think of it as a coin that only has heads.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And coin 2 is also loaded.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It gives you heads with 0.6 probability.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Now work out for me into this experiment,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
what's the probability of seeing tails twice?
