1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:02,703
So let's see how to compute the node that's 2 hops away.

2
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:07,278
We simply look at our node that's 1 hop away and take its node that's 1 hop away,

3
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:12,298
and we'll continue as long as the number of hops away isn't greater than number of nodes.

4
00:00:12,298 --> 00:00:18,487
So let's do an example here; we know that the successor--the node that's 1 hop away from node 0 is node 5,

5
00:00:18,487 --> 00:00:21,533
so if we want to compute the node that's 2 hops away from 0,

6
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:27,331
we'll look to see that the successor to 0 is 5, and the successor to 5 is 2, so we'll fill in a 2 here.

7
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:32,331
The successor to 1 is 6, and the successor to 6 is node 3, so we'll fill in a 3 here.

8
00:00:32,331 --> 00:00:34,921
The successor to node 2 is 7,

9
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:38,819
the successor to node 7 is node 4, so we'll fill in a 4 here.

10
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:41,443
And notice this is a perfectly data parallel operation.

11
00:00:41,443 --> 00:00:46,029
Each one of these vertices can do this computation completely in parallel.
