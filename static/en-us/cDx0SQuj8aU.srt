00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,900
Hopefully you're able to complete lesson two, stage two.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,530
I'll walk through my solution.

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,740
First after creating the sentence count topology, scrolling down to part one of

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,530
two, I asked you to import the random sentence spout,

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,670
which is located in the Spout folder of Storm Udacity.

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:22,150
Therefore, it's simply import udacity.storm.spout.RandomSentenceSpout.

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,690
Once this is imported, I ask you to make sure that your class name and

8
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:30,440
your constructor matches your file name, SentenceCountTopology.

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,420
Therefore public class SentenceCountTopology and

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,440
private SentenceCountTopology constructor.

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,780
Scrolling down to the main method and

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,000
your topology builder, I asked you to remove the word spout.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,610
I simply commented it out.

14
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,430
But here's our word spout.

15
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,888
And attached the new sentence spout to the topology.

16
00:00:49,888 --> 00:00:55,543
Simply that's .setSpout, sentence spout, and our anonymous declaration

17
00:00:55,543 --> 00:01:01,090
instance of a new RandomSentenceSpout with a parallelism of one.

18
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,970
Next I asked you to attach the count bolt to

19
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,050
the sentence spout using a field grouping.

20
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,530
A field grouping was the third question.

21
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,750
Remember that a field grouping creates a hash or

22
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:16,170
a subset of all of the spout or connection into the bolt.

23
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,260
What this means is that each individual sentence, each unique sentence,

24
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:25,130
is going to be sent to the same bolt and therefore we increment the count.

25
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,900
I'll just scroll a bit to the right so we can see the rest of the syntax.

26
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,720
Notice that the fieldsGrouping connects the sentence-spout using the new

27
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,400
field, sentence.

28
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,180
This may have been a bit tricky but

29
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,460
I asked you to look at the declaration in random sentence style.

30
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,620
And scrolling down,

31
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:46,680
we see that the declare output field names the new field sentence.

32
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,826
Therefore, to connect the count-bolt to the RandomSentenceSpout,

33
00:01:50,826 --> 00:01:54,170
we need to connect on the field sentence.

34
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:58,770
One final point is that the count-bolt is already connected to the report-bolt.

35
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:03,510
Using our color scheme once again we see that here is our RandomSentenceSpout.

36
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:07,129
Here is our count-bolt, and finally our report-bolt.

37
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,650
We're making the connection here using a fieldsGrouping.

38
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,880
And we're making this connection using the globalGrouping.

39
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:22,210
So hopefully that's clear on how our syntax translates to our visualization.

40
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:26,290
Finally, to run and build our topology, we go to our command line.

41
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,280
Submit our topology.

42
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,330
Storm space jar target tab udacity tab hyphen tab.

43
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,570
Again, with dependencies udacity.storm.

44
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:39,080
And this is our SentenceCountTopology.

45
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,329
Navigate to your visualization, and as you see Storm running with no errors.

46
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:50,110
We see the words from the random word spout growing with count.

47
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:54,230
You can also hover over one of the sentences to see the current count.

48
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,110
There we see 32.

49
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,140
And if we let it run a bit further, we see we have 49.

50
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,990
Finally, I asked you to go to the RandomSentenceSpout and change the random

51
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,820
sentences to your own personalized version of the RandomSentenceSpout.

52
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,680
Hopefully you were able to do that,

53
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,464
create your visualization, take a screenshot and post it to the forum.

54
00:03:12,464 --> 00:03:15,130
And hopefully comment on two others.

55
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:19,250
Remember, that at the end of stage two, your code will match stage three.

56
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:19,750
Great job.
