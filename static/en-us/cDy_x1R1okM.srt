00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,296
At the end of the last lesson and now with Grant's latest issue as well, we've

2
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:08,974
seen that sometimes parabolas don't have two real roots. Remember that a root is

3
00:00:08,974 --> 00:00:13,646
a value for x that satisfies a quadratic equation. Now, there's a single part of

4
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:18,119
the quadratic formula that we can look at to determine how many real roots of

5
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,414
parabola will have. That expression is called the discriminate. Just to remind

6
00:00:22,414 --> 00:00:26,630
you, here's the general form for a quadratic equation, and the quadratic formula

7
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:31,341
for calculating the roots of that equation. Knowing that the discriminate on

8
00:00:31,341 --> 00:00:36,633
it's own is what determines the number of real roots, which of the following

9
00:00:36,633 --> 00:00:42,776
expressions down here do you think is a discriminate? Is it negative b, negative

10
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:49,304
b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac, b squared negative 4ac,

11
00:00:49,304 --> 00:00:51,647
b squared minus 4ac, or 2a?
