1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,719
In fact, it's been shown that
if you increase the supply of

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:06,520
primary care physicians by just 1 for

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,650
every 10,000 people, there's
a significant increase in quality, and

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:16,090
a significant decrease in the cost
of Medicare, which you may remember,

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:20,150
takes care of older people who are more
likely to have chronic disease.

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:24,480
Conversely, if there's a similar
decrease in the availability of primary

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,190
care physicians, there's an almost
equal decrease in quality.

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,410
And a nearly equal increase
in the cost of Medicare.

9
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,510
You may be asking why?

10
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:40,850
Well, one of the major reasons
is that specialists charge more.

11
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,345
And they do far more tests and
procedures.

12
00:00:43,345 --> 00:00:48,080
Moreover, how do they
coordinate their care?

13
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,140
How does each of these specialists, and

14
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,100
remember Marla may not even see
the same cardiologist every time she

15
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:59,170
visits that office,
know what all of the others are doing.

16
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,140
In particular, how do each of these
specialists know what medications

17
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,660
all of the others have prescribed?

18
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,110
This is important, because the same
research that showed Marla

19
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:16,260
will likely see 14 providers each year,

20
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:21,210
also showed she would likely fill
50 prescriptions that same year.
