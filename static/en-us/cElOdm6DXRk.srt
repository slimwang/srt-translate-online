00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,060
There are historical reasons why our
healthcare system is the way it is and

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,491
why we've been so
slow to adopt health IT.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:13,065
For more on that, and more details
on the US healthcare system,

4
00:00:13,065 --> 00:00:15,417
refer to chapter one in the text.

5
00:00:15,417 --> 00:00:19,606
Now that we have the background to
understand why fixing health care is

6
00:00:19,606 --> 00:00:24,292
a national priority, we'll look at what
the US federal government is doing to

7
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:27,061
foster the adoption of health IT and
create new

8
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:31,330
financial incentives to encourage
more use of patient centered care.
