00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,610
In this question, we're saying in
the following script is used to generate

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:10,200
the query, so the query is going to be,
we want to select account information

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,500
from a table called users, and
we want to do it for those users for

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,290
whom we going to have the login,
a password, and PIN.

5
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,630
These three values going to be red,

6
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,140
all these arguments going to
be red from a form.

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,644
And once we read them,
we going to generate this query that is,

8
00:00:29,644 --> 00:00:33,300
this SQL query that is going to
get submitted to the database,

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,540
what input is necessary for
it to generate the correct query.

10
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,330
So there are three options here.

11
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,200
Mark whichever ones you
think are applicable.

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,710
So it's really understanding this
little script code that we have

13
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,500
here that is used to generate
the query that we going to submit.
