We don't really need any formula for this one. This is 45 degrees and this is

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:09,320
45 degrees, so these angles must be 90 degrees. What that means is that these

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,150
two legs of the triangle must be the same. So half of the height, distance

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,197
equals 10. However, if you use the formula, that's fine too. You'll get the

5
00:00:18,197 --> 00:00:18,850
same answer.
