1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I want to add one last thing here--the initial robot location.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
If we define x0 to be 0, which is the origin of the map,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
then what this means is we add 1 over here and 0 over here.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The reason why is this constraint is that x0 is 0.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Let's take a robot moving around and let's say it sees a landmark

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
from the first pose x0 and from the third pose x2 but not from the second pose.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I want you, in this matrix over here,

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
to check mark all the fields that are being modified by Graph SLAM--

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
it's a binary check--and the same for the vector without putting actual numbers in.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So go into this matrix and ask yourself which fields will be 0, the ones untouched,

11
00:00:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and which ones will not be 0 that are the ones we modified.
