1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,600
While you will not be required to use
the Network Link Conditioner tool for

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,020
on the map, you should at least
install it for future work.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,980
To install the tool,
you need to follow these steps.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:14,010
First in Xcode, go to the Xcode
menu item here at the top, go to

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,360
Open Developer Tool, and then click
on this More Developer Tools option.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,490
From here, you'll be directed
to Apple's website and

7
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,590
it'll ask you to log in if you
haven't already using your Apple ID.

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,830
Then on this Download for
Apple Developers page, search for

9
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,410
the network link conditioner tool.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,460
Once you've searched for it,

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,859
you should see one of these
Hardware IO Tools for Xcode downloads.

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,250
You'll want to download the version of
the hardware tools that's compatible

13
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,480
with your version of Xcode.

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,350
To complete this exercise,
you'll need to download and

15
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,040
install the Network Link Conditioner.

16
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,230
If you get stuck at any point,

17
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,480
you can check out the article I've
linked to in the instructor notes.

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,570
Check this box when you're done.
