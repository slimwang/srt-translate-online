00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,110
A common answer we've heard from our
students when we asked them about

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,790
the word delegate is that it
made him think of a relationship

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,720
between a manager and an employee,
or parent and a child.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,600
Perhaps you've also experienced a
situation where work has been passed on

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,270
or delegated to you.

6
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,010
In iOS delegation works
much the same way.

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,089
But it can be between
any types of objects.

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,580
It really just means getting one
object do the work for the other.

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,120
In the case of AV audio recorder it
does not know anything about our view

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,810
controllers or even your app.

11
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,520
It does know that once it finishes
recording it can inform the other class,

12
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,782
our record view controller
that it's finished.

13
00:00:40,782 --> 00:00:42,570
The delegate,
the record view controller,

14
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,890
could then do the work of whatever needs
to be done with the recorded audio.

15
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,840
In this way you can use AV
audio recorder as a tool

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,040
to just record the audio and
it calls out to its delegates.

17
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,260
The record view controller
to do something with it.
