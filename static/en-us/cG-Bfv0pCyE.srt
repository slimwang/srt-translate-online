00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,282
The first thing we need to do is just distribute this negative sign to both

2
00:00:04,282 --> 00:00:09,002
terms in the numerator of our second fraction. Then since these fractions have

3
00:00:09,002 --> 00:00:13,352
the same denominator, we can write them as a single fraction. If 18 minus x

4
00:00:13,352 --> 00:00:17,607
minus 15x plus 30, then we combine like terms. That gives us a rational

5
00:00:17,607 --> 00:00:22,199
expression of negative 16x plus 48 over 3x minus 6. And of course this is still

6
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,357
set as less than 0, since we haven't done anything to change both sides of the

7
00:00:26,357 --> 00:00:29,470
equation yet, that would affect the sign in the middle.
