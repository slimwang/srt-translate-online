1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,740
One major use of diagrams is that you can use them to convey information to

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,470
others in the group.

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,410
The others might be your teammates, but they also might be

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,210
people on other parts of the project which you don't normally communicate with.

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:18,040
They might even be persons down the line time-wise.

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,010
That is, the maintainers who are going to deal with the system

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,240
five years from now.

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,170
Communication is the first answer.

9
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:29,360
Second, we're talking about, in the case of UML object-oriented development, and

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,920
object oriented development has a particular process often used in

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,330
association with it.

12
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:39,980
That is, the diagramming technique can support a process that you're using.

13
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,830
For example, your process is likely to have some kind of

14
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:47,810
validation step associated with it, maybe a design review, and

15
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:52,690
using a particular design diagram can help you structure that review.

16
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,898
Also, by using a particular kind of diagram, there,

17
00:00:55,898 --> 00:00:59,338
you may be able to find some tool support for that diagram.

18
00:00:59,338 --> 00:01:03,974
The tool support might inform the user when a violation of

19
00:01:03,974 --> 00:01:09,682
the visual syntax occurs, or inform the user that a piece is missing.

20
00:01:09,682 --> 00:01:13,728
As far as the disadvantages are concerned, just like source code, any time that

21
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:17,715
you build a diagram, you have to worry about it getting it out of date, that is,

22
00:01:17,715 --> 00:01:21,254
keeping it up to date with respect to changes in the rest of the system.
