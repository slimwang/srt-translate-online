1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,431
In this new notation, instead of writing
plans as a linear sequence of, say,

2
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:10,722
succ, move right, and succ, I'm going
to write them as a tree structure.

3
00:00:10,721 --> 00:00:15,669
So we start off in this belief state
here, which we'll diagram like this.

4
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:19,013
And then we do a succ action.

5
00:00:19,013 --> 00:00:21,369
And we end up in a new state.

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:25,333
And then we do a right action.

7
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,629
And now we have to observe the world.

8
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:31,791
And if we observe that
we're still in state A,

9
00:00:31,792 --> 00:00:35,114
we loop back to this part of the plan.

10
00:00:35,113 --> 00:00:42,163
And if we observe that we're in B, we
go on and then execute the succ action.

11
00:00:42,164 --> 00:00:44,486
And now we're at the end of the plan.

12
00:00:44,485 --> 00:00:49,640
So we see that there's a choice point
here, which we indicate with this

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,490
sort of tie to say we're following
a straight line, but now we can branch.

14
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:59,227
There's a conditional, and we can
either loop or we can continue on.

15
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:04,081
So we see that this finite
representation represents an infinite

16
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:05,588
sequence of plans.

17
00:01:05,588 --> 00:01:12,896
And we could write it in a more
sort of linear notation as S,

18
00:01:12,897 --> 00:01:18,180
while we observe A do R, and then do S.

19
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,273
Now, what can we say about this plan?

20
00:01:20,272 --> 00:01:21,858
Does this plan achieve the goal?

21
00:01:21,858 --> 00:01:26,793
Well, what we can say is that if
the stochasticity is independent,

22
00:01:26,793 --> 00:01:31,123
that is, if sometimes it works and
sometimes it doesn't,

23
00:01:31,123 --> 00:01:37,209
then with probability 1 in the limit,
this plan will in fact achieve the goal.

24
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:40,879
But we can't state any
bounded number of steps

25
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:44,469
under which it's guaranteed
to achieve the goal.

26
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:46,459
We can only say it's
guaranteed at infinity.
