1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,330
Let's go back to the main project view.

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:05,110
Once you've created the necessary
services and activities,

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:09,070
you need to register them in the Android
Manifest XML so that Android-ware on

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:12,810
the phone and wearable side knows that
you have watch faces to select from.

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,900
Let's have a look at the wearable
Android XML file first.

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,532
Firstly, you need to request
PROVIDE_BACKGROUND and

7
00:00:18,532 --> 00:00:20,110
WAKE_LOCK permissions.

8
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:23,550
You need to do this on the phone side
as well since the phone app must always

9
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,050
request every permission
needed by the wearable.

10
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,800
Let's now look at the service
definitions in the manifest.

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,009
You can see that each watch face
has a unique service entry.

12
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,980
Let's look at the definition
of DIgitalWatchFaceService.

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,880
You'll notice we've
declared our service,

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,440
given it a human readable name And
specify BIND_WALLPAPER for permissions.

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,410
The first item we have inside here
is android.service.wallpaper.

16
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,315
This needs to refer to
a watch_face.xml file.

17
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:51,570
And when we look at the declaration,
it looks like this.

18
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,560
You can see here, there's
a wallpaper element declared here.

19
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,980
Next we have the preview and
preview circular attributes.

20
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,620
These are used to define images
that will be shown as previews on

21
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,300
the companion or
watch when selecting a watch face.

22
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,930
You can see that if we right-click and

23
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,840
go to the declaration,
this is what it looks like.

24
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,240
You can specify a separate image for

25
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,230
round displays if you
have a different layout.

26
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,190
And if you don't provide one,
it'll fall back to the square one.

27
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,930
You can create these images by just
taking a screenshot of your watch face

28
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,790
running on a device or emulator.

29
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,560
We also have
a companionConfigurationAction,

30
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,240
which specifies if we'll be providing
an activity on the phone companion side

31
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,060
to configure the watch face.

32
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,550
This enables the little gear
icon on the phone side.

33
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,940
That we tried earlier.

34
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,870
We create a unique name here
with our own package name and

35
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,420
tag it CONFIG_DIGITAL.

36
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,460
We also have
a wearableConfigurationAction

37
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,520
which specifies we'll be

38
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,590
providing an activity to run on the
wearable to configure the watch face.

39
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,900
This enables the little gear icon on
the wearable side to make changes.

40
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:49,220
We use the same unique name as the phone
companion configuration action earlier.

41
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,280
We also declare an intent filter for

42
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,240
a wallpaper service with
a category of watch face.

43
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,230
Like here to complete
the definition of our service.

44
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:01,200
Finally, we need to declare our
DigitalWatchFaceWearableConfigActivity

45
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,310
which is the activity we'll run if the
user wants to configure this watch face.

46
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,288
We need to add an intent filter that
includes the default and wearable

47
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:11,640
configuration categories for the watch
face picket to see this activity.
