1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,000
Right.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,240
I've checked out the app.

3
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,760
Now, I'm ready to run it.

4
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,670
Once again,
all of the commands I use here will be

5
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,700
detailed in the presenters as notes.

6
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,540
First step CD into the project
folder and run npn install.

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,280
This fetches all the third
party code the app needs, and

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,550
it'll probably take some time,
so be patient.

9
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,460
Also npn does like to scare us
by showing errors and warnings,

10
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,300
but these are optional dependencies and
different operating systems will show

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,830
different warning, so
that's something to enjoy.

12
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:33,880
I love it when text flies by on the
command line like this it makes me feel

13
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,660
really smart like I'm hacking
the metrics or something.

14
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,260
Right.
That's the install done.

15
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,270
You shouldn't need to run that again.

16
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:48,020
To run a project the command
is npm run serve.

17
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,410
When you run that the build script
executes, building all the JavaScript,

18
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:56,020
CSS, etc, and finally it tells
us we have two servers running.

19
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,280
If you ever want to shut these
down it's control and c.

20
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,260
You can also modify the port
numbers of the servers if you want.

21
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,370
Those details are also in
the instructor's notes, but

22
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,670
now we can open a browser and
point at localhost port 8888.

23
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,470
And there we go.

24
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,740
The app is running.

25
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,270
Excellent.

26
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,650
Now it's your turn.

27
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:18,260
Once you have everything set up,
check the boxes to confirm, and

28
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,630
we'll explore the app in more detail.
