This question is about A* search for the heuristic function h,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
which is indicated in the graph over here.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
An action costs 10 per step.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Enter into each node of this graph the order when the node is expanded.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That is the same as removed from the queue in A*.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Start with a "1" in the start state over here at the top

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and enter "0" if the node will never be expanded.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This is a graph where we have a whole number a nodes,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and the heuristic function is indicated over here.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm also asking you is the heuristic h admissible?
