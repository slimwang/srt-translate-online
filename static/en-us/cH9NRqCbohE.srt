00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,760
Here's an overview of the changes
we're going to be making to Sunshine.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,700
We'll continue to refer to this map
as we move these coding exercises.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,260
There are lots of terms in this map
that we haven't discussed before

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:15,720
such as database contract,
content provider, and DB Helper.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,820
Each one of these blocks represents
a section of our modular

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,720
data storage solution.

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,560
We start by defining our data
storage in terms of a contract.

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,850
We then implement
the database using SQLite.

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:32,390
And finally, we layer a fundamental
Android class between our UI and

10
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,160
the data storage called
a content provider.

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,100
Ultimately, building our data storage
in this way allows Sunshine to leverage

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,150
powerful Android frameworks.

13
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:46,270
We'll explain all of this in more
detail as we implement each section.

14
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,010
Let's get started.
