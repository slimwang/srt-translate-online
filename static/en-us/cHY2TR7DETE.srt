00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,150
Now it's time for you to check out the
developers.android.com documentation,

00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,570
on the Android plug in for Gradle.

00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,740
You'll find a link in
the instructor's notes.

00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,950
While you are at it, also go ahead and
download the plugin language reference.

00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,780
Once you've got those resources,
find out which two

00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,240
properties on the Android

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,987

compile options, compile SDK version,
