00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,540
Remember earlier, we implemented
a DetectedActivitiesIntentService, and

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,310
we saw that we sent the array
list of detected activities

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:11,240
back to our main class using
the local broadcast manager.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,930
Well you can receive this in a class
that extends BroadcastReceiver.

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,310
And to make life even easier,

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,920
this class can be embedded in
the main activity as a nested class.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,630
If you're not familiar with nested
classes, you can learn more about them

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,370
in the link that I've put underneath,
in the speaker notes.

9
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,320
So next,
you should create a nested class, and

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,450
you should call it
ActivityDetectionBroadcastReciever.

11
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:38,220
And this should extend
BroadcastReceiver, as we've said, and

12
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,360
it should override a method called
onReceive which takes a Context and

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,520
an Intent.

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,450
When you've done this, check this box.
