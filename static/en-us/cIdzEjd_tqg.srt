00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,810
Time for a quick quiz.

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:04,110
Please contain your enthusiasm.

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,150
Suppose you have a sorting
algorithm that, on an ideal cache,

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,940
does n over L, log n over L divided
by log z over L cache misses.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,500
Here's my question.

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,129
How many transfers would you expect,
asymptotically,

7
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:20,760
on a machine with an LRU cache of
the same size and length size?

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,270
Type your answer symbolically here.
