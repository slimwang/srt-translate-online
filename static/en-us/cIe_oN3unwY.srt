00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,310
All right, welcome back to Computer Vision.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,990
Last time we talked about images as functions.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,020
An image could be thought of as a function of

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,910
two dimensional position like i of xy.

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,550
Or a two dimensional array we'd say f of ij row column.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,050
And sometimes I'll try to distinguish between whether I've got rows and

7
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:20,980
columns and x and y.

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,010
And we talked about how x and y are not the same as rows and columns.

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:32,119
In fact, a row is typically going down so if we go row, column, that's y, x.

10
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,970
The other thing is, and we're going to talk about this in a little bit,

11
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,630
there's going to be this question about whether y gets bigger as you go up

12
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,630
in an image, which is like what you learned in grade school, right?

13
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,920
Y positive goes up.

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,250
Or maybe a lot of you think of rows going down, and so

15
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,220
we'll, we'll have to wrestle with that.

16
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:53,530
And, we also talked about that, even though indexing in a computer world should

17
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,390
start at 0, in MATLAB, indexing of arrays starts at 1, and you're sure to screw

18
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,020
that up somewhere in your code, but eventually, you'll learn to figure it out.
