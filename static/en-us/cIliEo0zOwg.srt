00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay. So we talked about some of the differences;

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
now let's talk about what happens if you don't obey those rules.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I remember, about--this is probably 6 or 7 years ago now,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
when we first starting Reddit--

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
there was a program online called Basecamp,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and it's made by a company called 37 Signals--

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and it's used for organizing To-Do Lists and stuff.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And so the page kind of looked like this.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You had like these To-Do items

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and next to each of these To-Do items

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
was a little link that said: Delete.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And this was just a link--and if you recall,

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
normal links, with the anchor tag that you would see in Click On--

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
those make GET requests.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
To make a POST request you need a form,

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and these were just links.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And so if you were logged in, you could create these To-Do items;

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and if you wanted to delete it, you could just click on Delete.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Well, there was another program out at the time, called

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
"Google Web Accelerator".

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And what that was, was it was a browser plugin

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
that would sit in your browser,

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and while you were browsing--

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
you know--let's say this is the browser you're looking at--

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
let's add a picture here.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
While you were browsing, a bunch of text--

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
you know--there might be some links throughout the document--

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
the Google Web Accelerator would make those requests, behind the scene,

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
so that when you clicked the links, the pages were ready to go.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The problem is, the Google Web Accelerator was hitting these links.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So users would go to their Basecamp page,

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
look at their To-Do lists,

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and find that their items were deleting on their own,

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and that's kind of a big problem.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And that's what happens when you use GET requests to alter the Server state.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Those guys, at the time, just assumed that since we were logged in

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
no bots would ever hit the page; it would only be used as clicking.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
But if your browser's behaving funny

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
or if you've got a plugin running that's clicking on all the links for you,

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
you'd better be certain that those links don't actually change the Server.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So what you should design instead is

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
instead of making links that alter the Server,

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
you can make little forms--and the form

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
can just have a little button in it that says: Delete

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
or it can have a special link that causes it to submit the form--

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
but it should be making a POST request.
