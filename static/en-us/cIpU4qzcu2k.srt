00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,912
This one was kind of tricky, especially with the independent versus dependent

2
00:00:03,912 --> 00:00:08,506
variable. The independent variable is the type of food. The type of food

3
00:00:08,506 --> 00:00:13,081
influences how much cows eat, which is the dependent variable. The null

4
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:17,870
hypothesis is that cows will eat similar amounts of food. Whereas the

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,650
alternative if you remember from the last lesson is at least two groups will

6
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:25,490
significantly differ, in this case that means that cows will eat more or less

7
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:29,360
of at least one food over another.
