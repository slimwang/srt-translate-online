1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
At this point, we have systematically fixed the first bug

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
using the scientific method to systematically come up with a hypothesis and refine it,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
refine it again, possibly come up with alternatives until we end up with a diagnosis.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So if you're an experienced programmer--and I assume you are--

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
you may now wonder, "Why on Earth should I actually go through all these

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,500
explicit steps if I can just jump into my debugger and fix the problem right away?"

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,000
It's actually likely that you have spotted the problem at the very moment you saw the code.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,500
If you're a very experienced programmer, you can probably spot errors like these

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,000
in hundreds and hundreds of lines from a distance of several hundred meters.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,500
You just look at the code and immediately see, "Well, there's something fishy in there."

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,000
And all of this is, of course, right.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,500
There are many problems which you can immediately see

13
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,500
and which you can immediately fix within 5 minutes

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,000
including the one we just discussed

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,500
And it's perfectly okay, if it only takes 5 minutes,

16
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,800
to jump right into your editor and to fix things,

17
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,300
to jump into your interactive debugger and fix things,

18
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,500
as long as it doesn't take more than 5 minutes--

19
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,500
because what happens if it takes more than that?
