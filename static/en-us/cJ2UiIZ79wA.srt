1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,290
So let's look at these
developer tools in more detail.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:04,750
We've already seen the console and

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:08,340
any code that you run here,
will run against the documents.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,415
But it's obvious what
lives outside documents.

5
00:00:10,415 --> 00:00:15,560
So if I log self.registration which
only exists in a service worker,

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,760
we get undefined back.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,477
However, I can change the context of
the console using this drop down here.

8
00:00:22,477 --> 00:00:26,530
I can select different frames,
workers, including the service worker.

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,950
Now if I log self.registration,
it works.

10
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,710
If you're familiar with
JavaScript debugging,

11
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,760
you'll be happy to know that this
works with service workers, too.

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,040
You can go to the sources panel,
open the service worker, and

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,960
debug it like any other
bit of JavaScript.

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,220
Here I'm going to set a break
point in our Fetch event.

15
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,120
Now if I refresh the page,
our script gets paused.

16
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,670
I can inspect the state of
objects just as you'd expect.

17
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,420
If you're new to dev tools,
check out the instructor's notes for

18
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,250
links to guides and tips.

19
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,540
But away from standard
JavaScript F tools,

20
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,160
service worker has its own
panel in the resources tab.

21
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,030
This bin icon lets us
unregister the service worker,

22
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,610
which is useful if you want to refetch
the service worker from scratch.

23
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:13,120
And these tabs give us insight into
the service worker life cycle.

24
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,470
We can see here there's
an active service worker, but

25
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,170
there isn't a new version waiting.

26
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,217
We can tell that because its
waiting tab is grayed out.

27
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,110
It seems like we have an incoming
communication from Mike Wales.

28
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,752
>> Hey, I can't help noticing you've
been talking for quite a while now.

29
00:01:27,752 --> 00:01:31,250
We should probably let the student
become familiar with all this new stuff.

30
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,320
>> That is a very good point.

31
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,200
I have been going on a bit.

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,470
Take it away, Mike.

33
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,940
>> So Jake's been demonstrating
the service worker lifecycle and

34
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,820
developer tools to observe it.

35
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,662
What I want you to do is make
a change to the service worker.

36
00:01:42,662 --> 00:01:45,530
Get it into a waiting state, then allow
that service worker to become active.

37
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,670
If you've been following
the course in order,

38
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,190
the demo app is in
the correct state already.

39
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,413
If not, you can run this,
git reset hard,

40
00:01:52,413 --> 00:01:56,690
git reset hard gets rid of
any local changes you have.

41
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:00,090
And git check out log requests gets
the project into the state worth

42
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,900
registering a service worker and
logging requests.

43
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,210
Now for the challenge.

44
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,110
Make a change to
the service worker script.

45
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,030
It can be anything.

46
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,770
A new console log,
even just a JavaScript comment.

47
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,930
Then refresh the page to pick
up the new service worker.

48
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,320
In the resources tab, you should
see the new service worker waiting.

49
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,860
This is what it should look like, an
active service worker and a waiting one.

50
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,437
Once you've done that,
head over to the settings page and

51
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:29,550
type sw-waiting into the test field and
press enter.

52
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,260
This will let you know
if everything is working
