00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,170
I have more sugar at home than my recipe calls for. My recipe only calls for 2/3

2
00:00:04,447 --> 00:00:08,780
of a cup of sugar. If I had 1 cup of sugar at home, I could use 2/3 to make one

3
00:00:08,792 --> 00:00:13,050
full batch of brownies, and then I'd have 1/3 of a cup left over. So, I know I

4
00:00:13,062 --> 00:00:18,144
can make more than one batch of brownies. If I only had 2/3 of a cup of sugar, I

5
00:00:18,156 --> 00:00:22,534
can make exactly 1 batch of brownies. But I'll have extra leftover, I'll have a

6
00:00:22,546 --> 00:00:26,572
3rd of a cup of sugar that I can still use. If you said more than 1 batch of

7
00:00:26,584 --> 00:00:27,709
brownies, nice work.
