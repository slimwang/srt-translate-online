1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's have some fun.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This gentleman you probably don't know. His name is Monty Hall.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Starting in 1963, for many years Monty Hall ran a game show called Let's Make a Deal.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In the center of the game show was a puzzle

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
that puzzles statisticians to the present day.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
In this unit, which is optional in the statistics class,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'll let you solve the Monty Hall problem, and you'll get a chance to program it

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
to verify that the assertion, which is not obvious, is actually correct.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Here we go.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The essence of the game are three doors.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Behind one of those is a beautiful car, but Monty won't tell you where the car is.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Instead, all the doors are covered by curtains.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The subject of the game is as follows.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You get to place a bet. Say you pick door 2.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If behind the bet you place you'll win the car. Otherwise, you'll win nothing.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So far, so good.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Here's the caveat.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Obviously, between the two remaining doors there'd be one that doesn't contain the car.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Monty is going to be mean. He's going to show you.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
He's going to lift the curtain from one of the other doors, and there is clearly no car.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
After now closing the curtain again, he'll ask you do you want to switch.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That is, do you want to change your vote to the remaining curtain

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
in the hopes of having an increased chance of winning the car.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The reason why this problem is interesting is because when Monty Hall lifted the curtain

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
he really didn't tell you anything.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You knew in advance that one of the two curtains wouldn't contain the car.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The mere fact that he lifted the curtain should give you zero information

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
relative to where between the remaining doors the car is.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
All you know now is that door 3 doesn't contain the car,

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
but why should door 1 now be more likely than door 2.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Here's the question.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What are the probabilities of the car being behind door 1, door 2, and door 3,

33
00:01:48,000 --> 99:59:59,999
provided that your initial pick was door 2 and Monty then lifted door 3 to show you there's no car?
