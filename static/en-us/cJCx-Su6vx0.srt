00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:07,295
Well, you see that no one is around the age of 60. People are either below age

2
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:14,675
60 or above age 60, and there are two bars showing the people that are above 60.

00:00:14,822 --> 00:00:22,675
We see four people are between 62.5 and 67.5, and then one person is between

4
00:00:22,687 --> 00:00:33,430
72.5 and 77.5. So in total, there are five people who are over age 60. 5 out of

5
00:00:33,442 --> 00:00:34,495
50 is .1.
