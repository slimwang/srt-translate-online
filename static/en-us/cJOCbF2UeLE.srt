00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here's a game tree for a stochastic 2-player game.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
There are max nodes, min nodes, and chance nodes.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
What I want you to do is back up all the values, so fill in a value for the value of

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
each of these nodes, and then check off all the nodes that could be pruned away

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
by a procedure that's similar to alpha beta, but updated to handle chance nodes.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So what I mean by that is, a node can be pruned away if evaluating the nodes

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
is not necessary to figure out what the best moves are for max and min.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
For the chance nodes, all the possibilities are equally probably.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So here, there's a 1/3 chance of each of these.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Here there's a 1/2 chance of each of these.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And in this game, the result of every game is either +1, -1, or 0,

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and all the players know that those are the only possible outcomes for the game.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Therefore, the players can take that into account when trying to figure out

14
00:01:04,000 --> 99:59:59,999
which nodes to prune away.
