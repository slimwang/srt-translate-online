1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The answer is this approach is much better because now from the external part

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
everybody else sees exactly the same thing.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
But internally, I can write the calls to the function in a convenient form

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and they still get returned in a way that the rest of the program can deal with,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and I don't have to change the rest of the program.
