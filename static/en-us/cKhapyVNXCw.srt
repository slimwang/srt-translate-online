1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,060
Images of course have been an important part of our society, and

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,470
they play a role in a variety of things that happen around us.

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,380
I always like to show examples that, you know, image,

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:14,250
availability of images like this, from Kennedy Assassination, the Zapruder film,

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,040
was, you know, an important part of the history of America,

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,800
where people were able to see what happened.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,960
This was an interesting thing because Zapruder was by just chance available at

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,960
that moment with his own camera to take this.

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,890
And that's one of the reasons we got a lot of pixels of this sad event.

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,630
But you know similarly if you think about it Rodney King's beatings in L.A.

11
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:40,680
again resulted in a lot of imagery that was seen by people, and again,

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,490
in this instance, there was a film crew at the other side of

13
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,220
the street where something was happening, and when these,

14
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,790
events started unfolding, they just came over their camera and started shooting.

15
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:55,790
But now, of course, when you start thinking about 9/11, 7/7 London bombings and

16
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,510
Virginia Tech, a lot more images of those events were possible.

17
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,440
These were people just there by chance.

18
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,000
But now, more and more, people have access to cameras and

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,710
they can share pictures.

20
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:11,360
In an example here is Michael Richards, where he bent and

21
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,550
started saying foolish things on telev, on, in a, a comedy stage.

22
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,290
Of course, people use their cell phones and

23
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,930
put his video up on YouTube, I believe.

24
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,939
And that resulted in a lot of uproar about what his statements were.

25
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,420
But more importantly,

26
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,660
this is the kind of stuff that we're seeing more and more of now.

27
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,830
In Russian, there was a meteor shower in Russia.

28
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:36,110
And all of a sudden, we've got amazing pictures of this meteor

29
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:40,720
shower not because photographers were waiting to take pictures of it but

30
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,110
people had cameras on their cars for variety of security purposes.

31
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,930
And all of a sudden when they were driving they started seeing these

32
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:48,940
meteors come down.

33
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,460
And all of a sudden the Web was full of images of people

34
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,520
sharing these images on the Internet.

35
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,110
And again, they were not just sitting there taking pictures.

36
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,140
This was just by chance.

37
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,070
And even more in the Boston bombings at the Marathon,

38
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:07,410
at the Boston Marathon bombings, there were lots of photographs taken.

39
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,750
And these photographs collectively were used to actually even to

40
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:16,350
figure out how the scene unfolded and find the people responsible.

41
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,960
So again if you notice just by chance these cameras were there.

42
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,480
And the number of images from these things increases.

43
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,830
So what I claim now is, with the growth of these cameras,

44
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,490
we really are creating a beast with a billion eyes.

45
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:34,720
There is not a point on Earth where we cannot get images from any more, and

46
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,850
that's actually pretty much evident as we grow from

47
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,630
just taking a few pictures to billions and billions of pictures.
