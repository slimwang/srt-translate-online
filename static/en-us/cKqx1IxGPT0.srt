1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,200
And answers that the order of prints is indeterminate. Exactly when

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,180
we switch from one process to another is determined by the

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,500
threads library in the OS. We haven't exercised any control over

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,510
switching here in our program, so we can't make any assumptions about

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,030
the order in which these things will run. It ma be

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,570
that thread 1 will print 5 times and then thread 2 will

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,600
print three. Then thread one will print once again, or thread

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,600
two might print two times, then thread one print fours times, etc.

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,370
We don't know and go programming here means assuming the worst.
