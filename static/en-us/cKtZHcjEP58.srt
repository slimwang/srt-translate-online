1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,580
Okay, so in the context of of
guidelines and planning, and

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,520
maybe overp lanning in a business,
there's a real danger for startups.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,091
I think, or at least it's been my
experience that people who are not maybe

4
00:00:14,091 --> 00:00:18,000
directly involved in the process
of creating the thing that's

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,787
at the core of the business.

6
00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:22,585
Maybe in like a software company,
it's the engineers.

7
00:00:22,585 --> 00:00:26,460
Or a marketing company,
it's the ads, or what have you.

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,567
The people who are making the decisions,
if they're too disconnected from

9
00:00:31,567 --> 00:00:36,831
the actual acts of the company, there is
a real problem where they could create

10
00:00:36,831 --> 00:00:42,054
plans that are just disconnected from
the actual realities of the business.

11
00:00:42,054 --> 00:00:45,902
I mean, I can't provide off the top of
my head any direct examples because I'm

12
00:00:45,902 --> 00:00:47,963
just forgetting all of them right now.

13
00:00:47,963 --> 00:00:51,350
But I've seen companies fail
all the time for misdirection.

14
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,520
Bad planning, not understanding
what business you're actually in.

15
00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:02,220
So, especially in startups where you
are effectively building a business

16
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,980
that has no roadmap, you cannot
build a roadmap in advance of that.

17
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,387
You can only reflect on the things
that others have done before.

18
00:01:10,387 --> 00:01:12,370
And usually you're
going to get that wrong.

19
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:16,799
The whole purpose of
a startup is to carve a new

20
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,770
path in an area where
there are no paths.

21
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:24,999
And trying to calculate in advance
too far where you're trying to go or

22
00:01:24,999 --> 00:01:29,588
what you're trying to do or how you're
going to get there can actually lead you

23
00:01:29,588 --> 00:01:32,330
way off base from where
you're trying to go.
