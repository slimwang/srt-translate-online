1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,760
I'm going to show you two ways to do this.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,260
We know that for each student, we want to write

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,189
that student's total into an array and return it. We

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,280
also know exactly how big we want the array to

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,180
be because we want one for each student. So I

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,060
want numStudents items in my array. Now, for all of

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,070
the student from the 0 student to the last student

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,640
Going up one at a time. I want to fill that student's

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,510
spot in the array of totals with that

10
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,530
student's total. I already have a method that calculates

11
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,500
this. So, I can use totalForStudent. And then,

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,030
when I've done that for all of the students,

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,470
I can return the totals. Looks like I forgot to

14
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,490
call it totals. Let's check that it works. I'll run

15
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,130
the tester, and it looks like it's got what I

16
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:52,630
expecting. Now, we could use nested for loops. I'll still

17
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,150
want all of my totals, and I'll still want to

18
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,980
return them, but let's think about solving this problem for

19
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,500
just one student, for each topic, starting with the first

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,680
one. And we going up to the number of topics,

21
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,010
one at a time. I'll add the score

22
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,360
for that topic to that student's total, let's say

23
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,120
for now I'm thinking about student 1. To

24
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,670
calculate total for student 1, I'll start at 0

25
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,600
and for each topic And want to add

26
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,350
that student's grade, in that topic. Then, once I

27
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,800
have the student total in my larger array

28
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,160
totals, I'll set the total for that student to

29
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,830
be the student total that I just calculated.

30
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,540
So this is what I do for one student.

31
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,300
And now, I want to do that for every single

32
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,230
student. So that all of the spaces in total

33
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,790
gets filled, so I will indent that a little

34
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,250
bit and now for each student starting with the

35
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,410
zeroth one so we don't need this line anymore

36
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,960
I will go up to the number of students

37
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:58,430
one at a time. I will do all of these steps. So

38
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:03,440
now the inter-loop is calculating the student totals and the outer loop is

39
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,699
storing the student totals in totals. So now we're fix up syntax errors. And

40
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,130
this way should work just like the last one. I'll

41
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,310
run it to make sure and it looks like it's

42
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,010
still good. Hopefully the number of values you see here.

43
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,480
Makes it obvious why it would be be nice as

44
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,000
a teacher, have a computer do this for you.
