1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,092
And the answer is the first message is the only

2
00:00:02,092 --> 00:00:05,133
valid message. The message is no good because

3
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:09,176
it’s encrypted using the public key of node 5 and

4
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:11,661
so node 1 won't be able to decrypt it. The rest of

5
00:00:11,661 --> 00:00:13,828
this, all use the public key of node 1. The third

6
00:00:13,828 --> 00:00:16,637
option won't work because there is only one hub.

7
00:00:16,637 --> 00:00:18,610
And because there is only one hub, node 1 can

8
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,527
see that the message came from Alice and is

9
00:00:20,527 --> 00:00:22,381
going to Bob and this is what we don’t want to

10
00:00:22,381 --> 00:00:23,679
know it to be able to learn.

11
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:26,074
The second option won't work because after node

12
00:00:26,074 --> 00:00:29,496
1, message is directed to go to node 3 which is

13
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,758
encrypted using a public key of node 4. And so

14
00:00:31,758 --> 00:00:33,424
node 3 won't be able to decrypt the rest of this

15
00:00:33,424 --> 00:00:37,104
message. The first option works, it’s encrypted

16
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:39,052
using the public key of node 1, so node 1 can

17
00:00:39,052 --> 00:00:42,567
decrypt it. It’s directed to send it to node 2 and it’s

18
00:00:42,567 --> 00:00:44,859
encrypted using the public key of node 2 and so

19
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:47,373
that hub work. Node 2 is then directed to send the

20
00:00:47,373 --> 00:00:49,403
message to Bob which is encrypted with the public

21
00:00:49,403 --> 00:00:52,001
key of Bob, so Bob will be able to decrypt the

22
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:56,000
message and receive Onions Galore.
