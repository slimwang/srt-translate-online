1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,970
I feel that no aspect of MU2
is more interesting, and

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,840
potentially more impactful to
the management of chronic disease,

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:14,120
than the requirement that more than
5% of all unique patients seen

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:19,680
by an eligible provider during
each reporting period either View,

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,870
Download or Transmit to a third party
their digital health information.

6
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:31,360
This is referred to as VDT, and
ONC has related specific guidance,

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,500
as shown here, as to what electronic
patient summaries should be

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,660
made available to patients
under various care scenarios.

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,210
The first one listed here
is Transitions of Care.

10
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,410
This is, for example, when a patient
goes from a hospital to a nursing home

11
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:51,140
or back to their home from
either of those facilities.

12
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,190
Errors often occur at transition
points because information is not

13
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,730
passed on completely and accurately.

14
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,170
In lesson five,
we'll look in detail at the electronic

15
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,990
clinical summary specified
at transitions of care.

16
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,530
But you may wonder why providers
are measuring activities

17
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,040
usually done by their patients.

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,945
Research shows that patients are far
more likely to embrace electronic

19
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:19,830
self-care tools if their provider
encourages them to do it.

20
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,750
And even provide some
help in getting there.

21
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:27,290
As a result of VDT, many more
provider practices will be offering

22
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:32,540
encouragement and even the needed
tools integrated with their EHR.

23
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,100
We'll return to this and
to VDT in lesson seven,

24
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,130
when we discuss these
patient facing tools.

25
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,800
Later, you'll also obtain and

26
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,990
use Marla's clinical
summary in some activities.

27
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:50,040
Which of the following is a key new
goal of Stage 2 of Meaningful Use?
