I mentioned before that it's still a good

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,320
idea to validate your data on the server,

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,990
even with client side validation. Why do you

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,530
think this is? Is it because if javascript

5
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,120
is disabled, client side validation won't work? Or

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,760
because, older browsers might not recognize your new

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,290
input types? Or could it also be because,

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,020
it's fairly easy to circumvent client side validation?
