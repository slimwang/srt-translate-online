1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:06,530
With their records now digital, can we
infer the underlying clinical processes

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:11,530
that patients receive as they traverse
the complex service areas of a hospital?

3
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:16,230
More importantly, can we identify
differences in these processes and

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,210
the impact these have on outcomes and
costs?

5
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,980
This analysis is common
in other industries and

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,040
is referred to as process mining.

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,870
However, these industries typically have
mechanized processes, where automated

8
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:34,580
sensors routinely and accurately
provide digital timestamped data.

9
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:39,118
This is not yet the case in health care,
which is still a largely manual industry

10
00:00:39,118 --> 00:00:43,775
and one where care steps may
be documented digitally but

11
00:00:43,775 --> 00:00:46,800
either incompletely,
inaccurately, or after the fact.

12
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:52,950
Nevertheless there are situations where
process mining appears to be feasible.

13
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,000
This is research from the Netherlands,

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,460
where process mining
originated in the late 1990s.

15
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,870
It examined the care of ischemic stroke
patients, patients with a clot in

16
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,980
the arteries of their brain,
in two hospitals shown here.

17
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:13,190
The results clearly indicate
significant differences,

18
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:19,170
with one hospital on the left here
emphasizing the use of treatments

19
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,610
aimed at protecting brain cells to
limit the damage from the ischemia.

20
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,440
This is the more state
of the art approach.

21
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,020
This is early work, but here at
Georgia Tech we feel that process mining

22
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,335
is a potentially
important technology for

23
00:01:33,335 --> 00:01:36,050
re-engineering a health
care delivery system.

24
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:40,540
To make it safer,
more cost effective, and ultimately,

25
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:45,340
a more valuable and
responsible component of our society.

26
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,510
Which of these are limitations of
the Dutch ischemic stroke study?

27
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,690
Check all that apply.
