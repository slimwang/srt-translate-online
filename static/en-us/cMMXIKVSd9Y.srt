1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,090
Now that you've conducted
some user testing,

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,430
you probably have a nice list
of bugs that you need to fix.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,060
So go ahead and squash them.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,290
Then once you've squashed all
those bugs it's a good idea to do

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,940
another round of user testing, and
then you might find some more bugs and

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,260
then you'll squash those, and maybe
you'll have some more users test and

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,980
the cycle will repeat until
your app isn't crashing and

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,390
you're ready to either submit
it to the App Store, or,

9
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,030
if you're a nano degree student,
to submit it for grading.

10
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,020
So if you'd like to submit to
the App Store, we have instructions for

11
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,040
what you need to know,
what you need to prepare, and

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,110
what you can expect in
the next few reading notes.
