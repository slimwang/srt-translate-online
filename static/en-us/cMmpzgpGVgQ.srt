We've seen things like x squared minus 16 several times before. This is just

2
00:00:04,258 --> 00:00:08,717
taking the difference between two squared numbers. And in cases like that, our

3
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:13,001
two factors are almost the same, except the signs, between the two terms are

4
00:00:13,001 --> 00:00:16,579
switched. So we have x minus 4 times x plus 4 is greater than 0.
