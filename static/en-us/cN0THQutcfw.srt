1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,130
The answer is this here.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,600
We start from state 4, so

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,755
I write that out, as q, followed
by the binary representation of 4.

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,710
We read an x, so I write out
the representation of that symbol,

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,190
and then we go back to state q4.

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,298
So I write that out again here.

7
00:00:19,298 --> 00:00:23,199
And then we want to leave this x alone,
so I write x, or

8
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,865
rather the encoding of x,
as the symbol to write.

9
00:00:27,865 --> 00:00:29,630
Then we want to move to the right.

10
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,530
So I write R as the last
element of the pool.
