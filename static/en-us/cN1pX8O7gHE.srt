1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,000
Both of these middle graphs show loudness decreasing as distance increases.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,270
This one shows loudness as a constant. It doesn't change at all as distance

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:14,198
changes. And this one shows loudness increasing as distance increases. So

4
00:00:14,198 --> 00:00:15,670
neither of those is right.
