1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,660
So, as I said before,

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:05,730
in this class we will specifically
look at displaying ads.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,310
So how can you display ads in an app?

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:13,360
And perhaps the first question of all,
where do ads come from?

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,060
Well, ads normally come from companies
out there that want to advertise.

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,190
We call them the advertisers.

7
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,580
And in addition to the classic ways to
advertise like TV, commercial signs,

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,520
or when you browse the Internet,

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,740
the advertisers want to reach
all the mobile users out there.

10
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:30,970
Now how can they do that?

11
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,090
While mobile users use apps and

12
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:39,340
you as a developer creates
these apps that the users use.

13
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,785
So we have a great story here, we have
the advertisers that wants to display

14
00:00:43,785 --> 00:00:49,370
ads, then we have you the developer
that wants users to use your apps.

15
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,140
But as we saw before, users are
typically not willing to pay a lot of

16
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,390
money for your apps.But what if we could
connect the advertisers with your users,

17
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:03,700
and the advertisers could pay
you to show adds to the users?

18
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:10,010
That would solve everything, but how can
you get in touch with these advertisers?

19
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,230
That's exactly what this
lesson is all about, and

20
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,540
the platform that enables this,
is called AdMob.

21
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,720
AdMob can retrieve ads from
a huge number of advertisers.

22
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,330
So when your app requests
to display an ad,

23
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:27,870
AdMob will select from all of these
advertisers to get an ad to display.

24
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:33,110
And this is a very complex flow, for
example it needs to consider ad bidding,

25
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:38,180
how much did advertisers pay to display
the ad compared to other advertisers.

26
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,930
Ad displaying how many
times has an ad been shown.

27
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,170
And spending caps,

28
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,420
how much is an advertiser willing to
spend on displaying ads this month.

29
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,610
But fortunately, you don't need
to think about any those thing

30
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,310
as an app developer, because AdMob is
hiding all this complexity for you.

31
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,220
AdMob will select the ad that
should be displayed in your app.

32
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,120
You only need to use a simple API
that we 're going to look at, and

33
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,960
then it will do all the magic to
retrieve an ad from the advertisers

34
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,240
that makes sense in your app.
