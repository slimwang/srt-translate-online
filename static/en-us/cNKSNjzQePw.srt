00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,550
So I want you to consider these two
scenarios, two different ways to bet.

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:10,779
In one case, you put all of your
1000 tokens on a single table and

3
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:14,290
0 of your tokens on the other 999.

4
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,125
So that's one way you might bet.

5
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:19,729
And the outcome is going to depend on
only what happens on the coin that's

6
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:21,660
flipped on that single table.

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,720
Another approach is to put 1 token on
each of the 1000 tables, and then all

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,570
the coins are flipped in parallel and
you get your reward or loss that way.

9
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,120
Which one of these is better?

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,370
Or is it the case that both
of these are equivalent?
