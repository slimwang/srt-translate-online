1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,654
The two other points on this parabola are negative 1 and negative 5 and

2
00:00:04,654 --> 00:00:10,420
positive 1 comma 5. Good thinking if you checked those 2. What's so different

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,470
now is that our graph is going to open downward since we have a negative value

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:19,662
in front of the x squared. To find our basic shape, we'll start at 0, 0, the

5
00:00:19,662 --> 00:00:26,502
vertex. Next we'll move one unit left and five units down. This gives us our

6
00:00:26,502 --> 00:00:31,666
first point of negative 1, negative 5. Remember, the a value will always tell

7
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:36,740
us how many units to move up or down when our parabola is in the form y equals.

8
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:41,402
And since our parabola is symmetric about the y-axis, we can also go one unit

9
00:00:41,402 --> 00:00:47,414
to the right, and five units down. This gives us our other point of 1 comma

10
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:52,156
negative 5. One of the key takeaways from this exercise is that a parabola in

11
00:00:52,156 --> 00:00:58,164
the form y equals will always open upward, or it will open downward. If the a

12
00:00:58,164 --> 00:01:02,617
value is positive, like in these three, we know the parabola opens upward. But

13
00:01:02,617 --> 00:01:06,713
if the a value is negative, like in these two graphs, we know the parabola will

14
00:01:06,713 --> 00:01:08,770
open downward.
