Consider a website with 100,000 users.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
A thousand of those are highly active, and you want to take a survey.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Now, to simplify this, let's assume that you draw the users at random

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and that everyone responds.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
If you send out 10 surveys, I'd like you to tell me the probability

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
that the number of highly active users in our sample is greater than or equal to 2.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We have at least two of our highly actives in our sample of 10 surveys.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Now, remember that sometimes it may be easier to compute the probability

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
of something being less than a given number,

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and you can take 1 minus that and that is always going to be equal,

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
since the probabilities always have to add up to 1.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 99:59:59,999
