00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,510
One last important statistic
on a stock that's important

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,090
is called cumulative returns.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:11,220
So let's consider S&P 500,
again, back in 2012.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:16,099
Now in 2012,
the S&P 500 started the year

5
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:21,370
at $125, and it ended the year at $142.

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:26,830
When you listen to the news
you hear things like, for

7
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,860
the year 2012 S&P 500 gained 13.6%.

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,250
That is cumulative return.

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:36,670
You don't hear them say over 2012
S&P 500 went from $125 to $142.

10
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:41,040
So how do you calculate
these cumulative returns?

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,260
It's really easy.

12
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,480
Here's the equation.

13
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,030
The cumulative return for
a particular day,

14
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:51,350
t, is just today's price divided
by the price at the beginning.

15
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:55,450
So price of zero is over here, and

16
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:59,130
the price of any particular day,
say would be here.

17
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,550
And we can calculate
the value like this.

18
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:07,900
Now the cumulative return for the whole
period is where t is this last day.

19
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,220
So let's consider
the example we've got here.

20
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,010
To calculate the cumulative return for
this whole year.

21
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:22,017
It's the price at the end, divided by
the price at the beginning, minus one.

22
00:01:22,017 --> 00:01:30,490
Turns out 142/125 is 1.136- 1 gives
us .136 Which is equal to 13.6%.

23
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,625
So our cumulative return for

24
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:39,830
the ETF SPY was 13.6%.

25
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:45,040
We can calculate and chart cumulative
returns just like we did earlier for

26
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,370
daily returns,
except now the plot is showing us

27
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,880
the cumulative return of course
instead of the data return.

28
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,770
Note that the shape of the chart
is the same as the price chart.

29
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,710
It's just now it's normalized, and

30
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:06,300
in fact this equation is exactly
our normalization equation.

31
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:11,590
So that is how to calculate and
plot cumulative returns.

32
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,250
We're not going to have Dave show you
how to do that, you're on your own

33
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,030
there, now that you know how to do daily
returns, it shouldn't be that tough.

34
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,200
Okay, that's it for this lesson,
we'll see you again soon.
