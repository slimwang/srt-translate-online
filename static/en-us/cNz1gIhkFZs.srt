1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The first environment, the one we start with, is special.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We call it the global environment.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
By default everyone gets a chance to see it.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Whenever we make a function call, we make a new environment

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
that officially has a parent.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This environment knows that it was created in, defined in this global environment.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So when we're interpreting JavaScript, we're going to use

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
this nested, or chained, notion of environments to keep track of

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
the values of variables.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
An environment is just a mapping from variable names to values

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
except environments may also have parent pointers.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Every environment that's not the global one has a parent.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Beyond having a parent pointer, environments just map variables to values.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
B is 555. X is 2.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
To give you another way to think about this notion of chained environments,

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
we're going to reason by an analogy.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Let's say that you're going on vacation.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You leave your home and you go to stay at a hotel by the seashore.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You don't bring everything in your home with you,

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
but you bring a few things.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And then eventually you're going to leave your hotel room and go out on the beach.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Maybe you'll bring your swimming suit, pack a lunch, that sort of thing.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You'll bring a few items with you, but not everything that was in your hotel room

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and certainly not everything that was in your home.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Now let's say that you've forgotten your keys. Oh my gosh!

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Where are they?

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The first place to check might be in your pocket or around with you on the beach.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Did I bring them all the way to the beach?

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
If not, maybe they're back at the hotel.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
If they're not back in the hotel, maybe you left them at home.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And if they're not at home, there isn't a whole lot of recourse.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Maybe you can call a locksmith or do something else sort of generically.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Hopefully you can get new keys.

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But ultimately, there is just nowhere else to check.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So this is analogous of having a global environment--a big marketplace

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
where you could buy new keys.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And then some nested environments on top of it--

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
your home, your hotel, whatever you brought with you to the beach.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So let's test our knowledge of this idyllic tropic scene with a quiz.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Suppose you are currently in the hotel environment.

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We have A is 6 and B is 7.

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
That points back to the home environment, where A is 44 and X is 55.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And that points all the way to the global environment, where A is 1, B is 2, and C is 3.

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You're in the hotel, and you want to evaluate A, B, C, and X.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
What are the values of these variables? Fill in the blanks.
