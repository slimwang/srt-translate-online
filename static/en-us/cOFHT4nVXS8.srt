1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,929
2 to the 6 times 3 is correct. Great work if you got it right. This would be the

2
00:00:05,929 --> 00:00:11,596
factor tree for a 192. Notice each time we're dividing our numbers by two. We

3
00:00:11,596 --> 00:00:16,085
have two to the six and one, three. So two to the six times three would be the

4
00:00:16,085 --> 00:00:17,620
prime factorization.
