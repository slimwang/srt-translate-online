1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,270
This little section here,
this little lateral geniculate,

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,800
is actually part of the thalamus.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,980
If you were to take that thalamus and
take a slice of it,

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,630
which is what they're showing here.

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,290
And then you stained for cell bodies
and, and the neuroanatomists, they

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,150
really have all sorts of clever ways of
applying different kinds of chemicals

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,200
that light up in different colors or
intensities the different types of

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,595
cellular structures that are there, so
you can actually see what's going on.

9
00:00:23,595 --> 00:00:25,360
If you took this slice,

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,430
you would see that the lateral
geniculate has got these layers, right?

11
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,080
You can see this layer 1 right here,
right layer 2,

12
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,070
and it's really remarkable that they
have these, fixed layers, right?

13
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,660
because remember,
these things just grow,

14
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,900
it's not like somebody got there with
a soldering iron and built them.

15
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,090
These things grow to have these
computational structures, right?

16
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,150
So, if you take, you know,
the double EEs or

17
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:51,470
computer scientists among you,
you're used to seeing schematic charts

18
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:55,500
of high end chips that have all
these layered structures in them.

19
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,430
You know, you've got your trans,
your, your transistor arrays here and

20
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,970
different memory things there.

21
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,710
These things just grow like this,
pretty cool.

22
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,450
And the layers are different.

23
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,700
In fact, you can actually tell
a little bit that layers 1 and

24
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,750
2 seem to be a little bit different
from layers 3, 4, 5, and 6.

25
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,116
And in fact they are.

26
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:16,550
Layers 1 or 2 are called
the magnacellular layers and

27
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,760
these are referred to as
the parvocellular layers.

28
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,540
And the, most important difference for
you is that 1 and

29
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,430
2 tend to be the where cells.

30
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,740
And these are referred to
as the what cells, and

31
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,580
that has to do with where
they project going forward.

32
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,310
And we'll talk about that in a minute.

33
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:35,740
The other thing to know is that both
eyes project to the left side for

34
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,420
whatever's looking at the right
half side of the visual field.

35
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,280
And both eyes, project to the right
side from what's looking at

36
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,000
the left hand side of the visual field.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,570
Well, you can see that explicitly
in the lateral geniculate.

38
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:52,859
Layers 1, 4, and
6 come from the same side eye,

39
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:58,830
and layers 2, 3, and 5,
I get that right yet, yep.

40
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,960
Come from the other side of the eye.

41
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,110
So we haven't combined the two eyes yet.

42
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,660
Right?
We still have two separate channels.

43
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,430
Why do we have to combine the two eyes?

44
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,740
Well, how about things like stereo?

45
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,880
Well, that's going to go
on up in the cortex, right?

46
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,200
You have to be able to get
both of the images together.

47
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,950
But at the, at the LGN level, lateral
geniculate, they are still separate.

48
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,460
The what, goes, the where goes
up to the superior colliculus,

49
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,580
which you can see on this
kind of creepy picture here.

50
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,130
so here it is, kind of creepy
right you got your eyeball.

51
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:31,940
Anyway what you're seeing here is this,
coming in at the chiasm,

52
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,070
through the lateral geniculate,

53
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,820
and then projecting up to
the superior colliculus.

54
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,050
And the thing that matters as i said,
i think earlier,

55
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,080
the superior colliculus is
involved in eye movements.

56
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,490
So one of the things that has to happen
very quickly, is if something moves over

57
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,960
here, I have to be able to get my
eyes over there very, very fast.

58
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,520
All right?
So

59
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,420
you have very good sensitivity to motion
in your retina, in the periphery.

60
00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:01,570
And then you've got a circuitry that's
involved in rapidly going, you know,

61
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:05,210
it doesn't go very, it doesn't make
many neural stops along the way, right.

62
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:09,210
We go from your retina which is doing
some chemical stuff right away.

63
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,150
One electrical stop into
the lateral geniculate and

64
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,280
directly to the superior colliculus.

65
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,070
Now, as I said earlier,
this is an overly simplified story.

66
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,110
I encourage you to take
a course on sensation,

67
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,540
perception and neuroanatomy if
you are interested in this.

68
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,080
But it, the story is pretty close.

69
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,890
So anyway, so those layers 1 and 2 go
directly to the superior colliculus.

70
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,860
But where is the really
cool stuff happening?

71
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,570
Well the really cool stuff happening is
when you leave the lateral geniculate

72
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,890
and you get up to the cortex.

73
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,340
So here is a another picture of your
brain just to remind you of where

74
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,420
pieces are.

75
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,650
Again, your nose is over here.

76
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,165
Here's your cerebellum back here,
involved in like balance and

77
00:03:50,165 --> 00:03:51,395
motor controls.

78
00:03:51,395 --> 00:03:55,545
And here are a bunch of the different
corti, cortex, cortical regions.

79
00:03:55,545 --> 00:03:56,905
All right?
There's the sulcus,

80
00:03:56,905 --> 00:04:01,215
which is this sort of gap here,
right behind it, this is somatosensory,

81
00:04:01,215 --> 00:04:05,135
this is where you feel,
your touch senses are.

82
00:04:05,135 --> 00:04:07,005
Right in front of it,
by the way, not drawn in here,

83
00:04:07,005 --> 00:04:10,315
is a bunch of stuff having to do with
motor control, controlling your muscles.

84
00:04:10,315 --> 00:04:12,540
Auditory cortex in here.

85
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,850
And then this massive piece of stuff and
the, it doesn't looks quite so

86
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,790
massive in here, but
it actually folds inside your brain.

87
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,810
We're going to have to unfold
your brain in a minute.

88
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,260
That's all visual cortex and that's all
the processing of visual information
