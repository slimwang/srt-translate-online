Let's take a quick closer look at this. So with this image's axis aligned

2
00:00:03,812 --> 00:00:09,660
bounding box, we only need to take into account 4 different values. The minimum

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,130
X Y position, and the maximum XY position. Or the top left corner and the

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:19,433
bottom right corner. Alright so let's go ahead and code this up. We've got a

5
00:00:19,433 --> 00:00:23,195
function intersect direct here, which you might find somewhat familiar, that

6
00:00:23,195 --> 00:00:26,900
takes 2 rectangle objects, that have a top left bottom right value, and we need

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,789
to test whether they intersect based on those values.
