1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,390
Now, we obviously don't want to play
the fluty sound for all our list items.

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,770
So it's time to update our onClick
listener code to play the correct files.

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,700
As a heads up, there's going to be some
pretty big code changes coming up.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,220
So I'm going to ask you a multiple
choice question to guide you along.

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,480
So in the first quiz of lesson four,
we decided that we needed to

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,630
modify the Word class to store
the corresponding audio resource ID.

7
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:28,140
So for example, R.rawnumber_one,
and remember this is similar

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,880
to how we modify the word class to hold
an image resource ID in the last lesson.

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,290
So assuming that we make
this battle model change.

10
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:39,150
I like you to think about which one of
these four inputs to the on click method

11
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,480
would be useful to determine
which audio file to play.

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,220
So in the documentation
provided below the quiz,

13
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,770
we will point you to this
interface the adapter of you.

14
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,910
And I don't click listener and here you
can learn more about the parameters that

15
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,340
you're responsible for
in the on item click method.

16
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,620
Now make your selection and continue.
