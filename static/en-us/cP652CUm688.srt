1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,500
Since real numbers and imaginary numbers are both subsets of the complex numbers

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,328
then we need to be able to write all the numbers that are in both of those

3
00:00:08,328 --> 00:00:11,097
subsets in the form a plus b i. Something special happens though for these

4
00:00:11,097 --> 00:00:12,987
numbers a and b for the real numbers and something special for the imaginary

5
00:00:12,987 --> 00:00:18,536
numbers. For all the real numbers what needs to be set equal to zero in this

6
00:00:18,536 --> 00:00:24,355
form, and for all imaginary numbers what needs to be set equal to zero?
