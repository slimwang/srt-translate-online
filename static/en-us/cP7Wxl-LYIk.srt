1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,110
Now, Bob, Carol, and Alice who are going to come in later are finally having their meeting.

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,610
Well, I should say something about Carol's algorithm,

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,630
but Carol already has a bit more experience with algorithms than Bob or Alice.

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:18,249
She has already figured out that a simple algorithm that you just try

5
00:00:18,249 --> 00:00:23,690
all the possibilities of selecting certain investment opportunities

6
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,360
into her portfolio is just not going to cut it.

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,900
Carol is really looking forward to meeting Bob and figuring out some new ideas.

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,310
At the beginning of the meeting, Alice is not there yet.

9
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,870
Bob and Carol started explaining their problems to each other.

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,869
Bob is explaining to Carol how among a set of genes some of which are connected.

11
00:00:41,869 --> 00:00:46,640
He is looking for groups where every gene is connected to every other gene

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,899
and Carol, of course, explains her problem

13
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:54,320
where she is looking for potential investments that are not connected to each other.

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,710
such as this one here.

15
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,840
Now, in order to not have to talk about genes and investments anymore,

16
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,250
we should use some common terminology for both of those problems

17
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,079
and if you already have an algorithm's course,

18
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:14,780
you might have come across a structure known as graphs.

19
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,870
and graphs are basically just objects that are connected to each other.

20
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,960
The network up here at would be called a graph

21
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,950
and the network down here would also be called a graph.

22
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:30,100
This here, the object would be called a vertex

23
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:34,940
and of course, this, this, and all of these objects are vertices

24
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:39,920
so this would also be a vertex, here, either the purple or the green ones

25
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,030
and then the connections are called edges.

26
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,870
All of the blue connections or some of those that I've colored green here

27
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,660
every single one of them is an edge.

28
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:54,300
An edge always connects to vertices and the whole structure is called a graph.

29
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,809
And if you used that terminology, you can state the problems

30
00:01:56,809 --> 00:01:59,930
that Bob and Carol are working on using a similar language.

31
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:08,699
Bob's problem is basically taking as input a graph with n vertices

32
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:26,698
and the output that he is looking for is the largest set of vertices all connected to each other.

33
00:02:26,698 --> 00:02:33,010
What Carol is looking for, again the input is a graph with n vertices

34
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,139
and the output is the largest set of vertices not all connected to each other

35
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:39,920
that non-connected to each other.

36
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,970
As you can see, once we use the common terminology, the problem that Bob is working on

37
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,880
is actually very, very similar to the one that Carol is working on.

38
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:53,750
The only difference is Bob is looking for a set of vertices where all are connected to each other

39
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:58,029
and Carol is working on a problem where none of the vertices are connected to each other

40
00:02:58,029 --> 00:03:01,330
but everything else is the same.

41
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,850
You are given a graph with n vertices, you are looking for the largest possible set,

42
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:09,680
and all it's about is the connection that these vertices have to each other.

43
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,620
In the future, to be better able to talk about these problems,

44
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,289
we'll also give them names as we do with most problems

45
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:21,500
Also, so that we don't always have to say this is Bob's problem and this is Carol's problem.

46
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,480
What we will call Bob's problem is a problem named Clique

47
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,770
because all of those vertices are very closely connected to each other

48
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,880
just like in a clique of friends for example

49
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,650
And we'll call Carol's problem independent set.

50
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,970
Carol is basically looking for the opposite of a closely collected clique.

51
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,240
Carol is looking for vertices that are not connected to each other.

52
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,830
If those were friends, they wouldn't know of each other.

53
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,190
Now, after Bob and Carol have explained their problems to each other

54
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,210
and given them the name, they noticed since the only difference

55
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:55,890
between clique and independent set is that in one we're looking for all vertices

56
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,290
to be connected and on the other one we are looking for none of the vertices to be connected

57
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:03,300
That problems are actually very, very closely related,

58
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:09,559
and I will show you the idea that they come up with to figure out how similar these problems are.

59
00:04:09,559 --> 99:59:59,999
also from an algorithmic perspective.
