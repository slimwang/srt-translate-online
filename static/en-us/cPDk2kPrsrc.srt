00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:05,260
Hey Mike, how many times have
you heard somebody say, wow,

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,540
this was a lot harder
than i thought it'd be?

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,460
>> All the time,
I think I heard you say it this morning.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,780
>> I think I say it a few times a week.

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,650
I mean, coding no matter how long you've
been doing it, is always difficult,

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:15,720
problems always come up.

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,970
>> That's true,
in reality the sign of a good developer

8
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,760
isn't someone who's very smart.

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,410
It's someone who's going to solving
problems and can persevere.

10
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:28,430
You're going to run into problems,
you're going to get frustrated.

11
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,030
There will be times you are confused.

12
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,580
And you're going to program yourself
into a corner that seems inescapable.

13
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,460
>> Whenever you run
into these situations,

14
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,040
it's important that you keep going.

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,910
And I don't mean keep going in
the sense that you just bang your

16
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,430
head against the wall, and
get more and more frustrated.

17
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,900
I mean going in the sense that,
day after day, little by little,

18
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,580
you just make some progress.

19
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,870
That's how you can get
through any problem.

20
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,547
To help out here are a few
problem-solving strategies.

21
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:00,250
First off there's sleeping on it,
seriously, it's helpful.

22
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,920
Take a break, come back fresh, and

23
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,800
you'll be surprised to find how
much easier some problems get.

24
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,330
You also have Google and
Stack Overflow to help out.

25
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,060
Most of the time your errors
are going to have messages.

26
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,970
Copy and
paste those messages into Google.

27
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,710
And you'll be surprised to
find out how quickly you

28
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,940
can get answers to your questions.

29
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,440
Stack Overflow is awesome
because people vote on answers.

30
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,530
So you can get a sense of
what strategy the community

31
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,800
thinks will solve a problem.

32
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:35,070
Seriously, this is a great strategy and
will solve lots and lots and

33
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,000
lots of problems for you.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,440
But hey, speaking of community, try
asking the community, you aren't alone.

35
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,780
Remember, you're going to be learning
alongside a lot of other people.

36
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,580
Reach out and ask for help.

37
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,200
If you're lucky enough to know
some web developers in real life,

38
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,460
talk to them too.

39
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,280
They might be able to point
you in the right direction.

40
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,630
And sometimes you might need
to rethink what you're doing.

41
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:02,890
When I'm working on something
complicated, I like to draw a picture.

42
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:07,930
This picture is an actual drawing I made
the other night for an actual project.

43
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,669
It's not very pretty,
it's just pencil on graph paper, but

44
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,370
it really doesn't have to be.

45
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,910
Shapes, words and
arrows are often good enough.

46
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,430
This drawing turned out to
be super helpful for me and

47
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,520
wound up saving me a lot of work later.

48
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,240
So it's often helpful to
get your ideas on paper and

49
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,460
stop juggling them in your head.

50
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,380
You'll be able to make better decisions
if you can see the whole picture.

51
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,350
And lastly,
I want you to look at your mistakes and

52
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,140
missteps as learning opportunities.

53
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,450
Look at it like this,
you're never really wrong,

54
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,820
you just aren't right, yet.

55
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,420
>> That's really solid advice.

56
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,770
I think I've done all of those
things throughout my career.

57
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,008
>> Yeah, I think we all have.

58
00:02:49,008 --> 00:02:52,875
I mean as you well know, the best thing
is at the end of the day, the feeling is

59
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:56,830
just absolutely incredible
when something starts to work.

60
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:00,503
We want you to keep these techniques in
mind as you work on your Nanodegree and

61
00:03:00,503 --> 00:03:01,020
beyond.

62
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,800
>> You'll be evolving as you learn and

63
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,720
get better at pushing through
the problems you face.

64
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,940
>> To help you remember this,
I want you to write a quick

65
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,210
little reflection on how you'll push
through the challenges ahead of you.
