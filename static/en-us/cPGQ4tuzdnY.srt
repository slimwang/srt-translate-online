00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,213
So now, you understand regular expressions. You can interpret this pattern. The

2
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:07,989
one thing I haven't told you about that's important for interpreting this is

3
00:00:07,989 --> 00:00:12,530
this dot here. This doesn't mean just a dot. Depending on the context, it often

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,738
means any character other than a new line. So, this regular expression here will

5
00:00:16,738 --> 00:00:21,730
match a whole bunch of strings. Any string that starts with a slash, followed by

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,430
any sequence of zero or more letters. So, it wouldn't match the slash by itself.

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,422
It would match the slash, followed by any sequence of letters other than a new

8
00:00:31,422 --> 00:00:36,540
line. And when it does the matching, what's contained in the parenthesis will be

9
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,945
the first parameter. And what the application will do is call the get method

10
00:00:40,945 --> 00:00:45,412
from this class, the parameters from the regular expression. In our case, that's

11
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:49,644
the query for our search. This input is a tuple that can contain any number of

12
00:00:49,644 --> 00:00:54,396
pairs, and each pair a regular expression followed by the name of the class that

13
00:00:54,396 --> 00:00:59,105
will handle patterns that match that. And what the application server will do is

14
00:00:59,105 --> 00:01:03,460
go through the patterns in order until it finds one that matches the query that

15
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:03,933
came in.
