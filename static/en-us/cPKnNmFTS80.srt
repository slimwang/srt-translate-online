1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So the answer is we should use the "add<u>page</u>to_index" procedure we just defined,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and we should pass in the index.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We should pass in the page, that's the URL that identifies the location,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and we should pass in the content.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And that's all we need.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So we're done with our web crawler.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
From a seed, we can find a set of pages.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Following that seed, following all the links that we find on the pages that we find starting from that seed,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
for each page, we're going to add the content that we find on that page to an index,

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and we're going to return that index.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And we've already written a code that given the index, can do a lookup.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So for any word we want to look up, we'll find the list of URLs for the pages that contain that word.
