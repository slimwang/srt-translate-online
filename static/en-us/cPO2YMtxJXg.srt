00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,120
Classical conditioning involves our reflexive responses, such as salivation,

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,128
eye blink, and startle responses. Unconditioned stimuli automatically elicit

3
00:00:10,128 --> 00:00:14,720
unconditioned responses. After pairing a neutral stimulus with an unconditioned

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,273
stimulus, classical conditioning occurs. And the neutral stimulus becomes a

5
00:00:19,273 --> 00:00:24,258
conditioned stimulus that elicits a conditioned response. Remember Pavlov and

6
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:28,845
his dogs. Operant conditioning was described by BF Skinner. And he said that we

7
00:00:28,845 --> 00:00:32,037
operate on our environment, and behaviors are selected due to their

8
00:00:32,037 --> 00:00:37,096
consequences. Positive and negative reinforcement produce an increase in a

9
00:00:37,096 --> 00:00:42,074
future frequency of a behavior. Where as positive and negative punishment

10
00:00:42,074 --> 00:00:46,560
produce a decrease in the future frequency of a behavior. Unconditioned

11
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,585
reinforces like food, sex and water, and unconditioned punishers like pain are

12
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:58,192
effective with no prior learning history. However, condition reinforcers like

13
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:03,043
money or grades, and condition punishers, like harsh words, are effective

14
00:01:03,043 --> 00:01:10,246
because of a pairing process. Social learning involves learning by watching the

15
00:01:10,246 --> 00:01:15,456
consequences of somebody else's behavior. If we see somebody being rewarded for

16
00:01:15,456 --> 00:01:20,186
doing something, we be more likely to do that as well if we want to be

17
00:01:20,186 --> 00:01:25,527
rewarded. Also the same is true for consequences that are negative. Remember

18
00:01:25,527 --> 00:01:29,643
the Bobo of our experiments, these are examples of social learning. Our

19
00:01:29,643 --> 00:01:34,598
learning is a function of all these processes. Classical conditioning, operant

20
00:01:34,598 --> 00:01:37,201
conditioning, and social learning
