These are reflections in the y-axis of one another. We can see that if we flip

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:11,450
this one across this line right here, we'd end up with this exact graph. Now we

3
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,778
can why this happens from our equations if we rewrite this one using the other

4
00:00:14,778 --> 00:00:21,188
form we learned. Remember, we can also write this as 2 to the negative x. A few

5
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:26,802
lessons ago, we saw that if you replace x with negative x in a function. You

6
00:00:26,802 --> 00:00:31,836
end up with the reflection of the original function across the y-axis. That's

7
00:00:31,836 --> 00:00:36,310
exactly what's happening here. Turns out this other form could be pretty useful

8
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,195
in certain situations.
