Since you're now an expert on using the
distributive property, see if you can use

2
00:00:04,499 --> 00:00:09,920
it to multiply these two polynomials
together. We have x+2, the whole thing,

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,057
times x+3, the whole thing. I know that
this probably looks a little bit tricky

4
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:18,801
because it looks different from anything
you've done before, but it actually uses

5
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:22,349
the same distributive property concept
that we been talking about. A, here, just

6
00:00:22,361 --> 00:00:26,212
happens to have two terms in it. So, just
give it a try. See if you can use the

7
00:00:26,224 --> 00:00:30,699
distributive property to solve this
problem. Remember, simplify your answer

8
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:31,684
as much as you can.
