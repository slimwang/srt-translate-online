1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,765
Alright, so, you asked unfortunately what happens when the,

2
00:00:05,765 --> 00:00:07,800
the learner is now a part of this. Now

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,800
the learner doesn't have that advantage that the teacher

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,260
had of knowing what the actual answer was and

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,910
therefore being able to show specifically what's irrelevant and

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,550
show what's relevant. So, what could the learner do

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,140
to try to learn about this? So again, remember

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,700
that there are 3 to the k possible hypotheses, and

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,684
if it could use the 20 questions trick, it could do this in log base 2

10
00:00:29,684 --> 00:00:35,500
of 3 to the k, which is the same as K times log base 2 of 3.

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,250
Which is you know, worse than what we had. It's this is, this is larger than

12
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,245
1. But it's still linear, it's still linear

13
00:00:42,245 --> 00:00:44,390
in K. So, but can we actually do that?

14
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,520
>> I'm going to say yes.

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,250
>> I don't think we can, so can you help me figure out how that would go?

16
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,830
>> Oh, I was just going to assert it, then hope you would tell me.

17
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,820
so, how would we do that? Well, we, we, the trick we did before is, we, we

18
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,390
tried to find a specific question we could

19
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,710
ask, such that we would eliminate half the hypotheses.

20
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:06,460
>> Indeed. But it's not clear how you could even ask such a question. Yeah,

21
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:10,070
so, so just to do this as a thought exercise, I have a hypothesis in mind.

22
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,640
>> Okay.

23
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,572
>> And you can ask me anything you want, and I will tell you

24
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:17,230
true or false. But you're going to have a very painful time finding it.

25
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,060
>> Yeah, but that's just because I'm human.

26
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:23,280
Okay, so I need to find a question where,

27
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,070
of all the hypoth, so I have all the possible 3 to the K hypotheses. I want

28
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,330
to try to come up with something that's

29
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,250
going to eliminate a third of them which is

30
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,680
just going to be hard for me to do because I could write the program to do this.

31
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,150
>> I'm not sure you could. I think, at the moment,

32
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:42,430
there's well, because I didn't choose my hypothesis at random. I chose

33
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,920
a specific hypothesis. Though I guess I could have chosen at random

34
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,970
from a subset, and you would have still had a hard time finding

35
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,115
it. But let's, just as an exercise. Throw out, give me a, give

36
00:01:51,115 --> 00:01:54,050
me a x1 to x5, and I'll tell you what the output is.

37
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:58,130
>> Okay, 00001. Or actually, you know what? All zeros.

38
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,780
>> Okay, all zeroes, the output is zero.

39
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,030
>> Oh, that's what I should, that's not what

40
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,900
I should have done. I should have. No, no.

41
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,025
>> That's okay, I won't count that one.

42
00:02:04,025 --> 00:02:07,570
>> [LAUGH] Can I just give you like, maybe 3

43
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,910
to the k of them and you'll not count any of them until I get it right?

44
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,470
>> Well, that's the problem, right? Well, not 3 to the

45
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,330
k, but if you, if you, you know, make 2 to

46
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,070
the k guesses, do, you'll be okay. But you'll also have

47
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,890
looked at all possible inputs. So that's not really that interesting.

48
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,689
But in particular, the example that I'm thinking of, you're going

49
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:25,050
to have to guess almost this many just to get a

50
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,880
positive example. So almost everything that you throw in is giving

51
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,340
almost no information. Because saying no doesn't really tell you very much.

52
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,900
>> Yeah that's what I was thinking. Well, what I was

53
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,990
thinking was I need to find one where the answer is yes.

54
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,320
>> Exactly, and I made it so that it's going to take

55
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,820
you exponential time just to find one. Once you've found that one,

56
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,040
then you're, then you're home free but it's going to take you,

57
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,420
you know, you essentially have to

58
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,340
enumerate all possibilities before you find one.

59
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,322
>> Okay, 0 0 0 0 1, okay? 0 0 0

60
00:02:53,322 --> 00:02:57,790
1 0. And you're going to tell me that 0, 0, 0,

61
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,620
>> There's only

62
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,970
one pattern that gives a one.

63
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,630
>> Right. Exactly. And you're going to, because every single one

64
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,470
of them is relevant. And I'm going to have to look.

65
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,330
>> Two of them are negated. This is the only pattern

66
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,972
that gives you a one. Now once you have found that

67
00:03:11,972 --> 00:03:14,042
and you know that that's the only one, now it's easy.

68
00:03:14,042 --> 00:03:16,933
You can just read off the equation. So, what's the equation?

69
00:03:16,933 --> 00:03:19,354
>> XN not two and X3 and X4 and not X5.

70
00:03:19,354 --> 00:03:21,314
>> And that is the, that's the equation and

71
00:03:21,314 --> 00:03:23,722
you are not, you're not, there's no as a learner

72
00:03:23,722 --> 00:03:26,096
you are not going to be able to find that, right?

73
00:03:26,096 --> 00:03:28,850
Because it's just a needle in a haystack until you hit it.

74
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,300
>> Yeah, so it's, it's going to take me exponential time, but

75
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,540
it, but remember we're not worried

76
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,760
about time. We're worried about sample complexity.

77
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,720
So remember the cheat that we have here. The cheat that we

78
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,070
have here is that I know all the hypotheses and what they say.

79
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,520
>> It doesn't help you.

80
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,720
>> Yeah it does, because the hypothesis, cause every hypoth, well no,

81
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,830
that's not true. I'm thinking the wrong thing. I'm sorry. I'm cheating,

82
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,180
you're right. I'm cheating. I'm, I'm acting as

83
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,640
if we have the example you had before.

84
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,020
>> So this constrained-ness is really, it's very frustrating, right?

85
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,190
Because the question that you really want to be able to

86
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,490
ask, you can't really ask, right? You want to be

87
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,550
able to ask a question that, that takes the hypothesis class

88
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,677
and split it in half and. Well maybe you can,

89
00:04:06,677 --> 00:04:08,846
maybe you can nearly do that. But it's still going to

90
00:04:08,846 --> 00:04:10,710
be, oh no sorry, that would make it linear. I'm

91
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,860
sorry, let me say that again. You'd like to be able

92
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,230
to ask a question that, that splits this

93
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,110
hypothesis class in half, but unfortunately almost all of

94
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,200
your questions give very little information. Just knocks

95
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,580
out a couple of the possible hypotheses, and so

96
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,510
it ends up being 2 to the k kind of time, not time but samples before you

97
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,600
can get a handle on what the hypothesis

98
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,718
is. So, it is harder for the learner too.

99
00:04:33,718 --> 00:04:36,320
>> Right, so when the learner does it you have no reason

100
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,772
to believe one hypothesis over the other. You've got all of them.

101
00:04:38,772 --> 00:04:42,180
And so in order to figure it out, no it kind of

102
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,412
has to be that way because otherwise it is still linear. So,

103
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:49,625
this is bothering me, because if what you said is true, then

104
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:53,430
why does 20 questions work? Why do i ever get log, log 2.

105
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,070
>> Right. So we'd like to be able to ask questions. So I, so

106
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:00,590
here, let's play this game now. You think of a, a formula. And I'm going to.

107
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,940
>> Oh, wait, you. I know the, the answer is, is that the 20 questions

108
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,320
is still the optimal thing to do, given

109
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,820
that you know nothing. So that, that log base

110
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,500
2 is kind of an expected answer. But sometimes

111
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,010
you'll do much worse, and sometimes you'll do better.

112
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:16,870
>> No, in this particular case, if I could ask you more general questions. I

113
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:20,750
can do this in, in with the, you know, linear in K. So the questions that

114
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,395
I'd like to ask you are things like, is X1 in the formula, yes or no?

115
00:05:24,395 --> 00:05:29,120
[LAUGH] Is X1 positive in the formula? Is X1 negative in the formula? I can just

116
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,520
fill in these boxes by asking the right questions.

117
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,600
>> Right.

118
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,056
>> But, but those questions are not

119
00:05:34,056 --> 00:05:36,300
in our constrained set. And it's the constrained

120
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,150
set that matters here. And our constrained set

121
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,930
is, in this particular example just really harsh.

122
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:44,290
>> So, and there's no way to approximate that, right? So

123
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,600
I can't say, okay, so the first question I want to ask

124
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:52,230
is x1 positive, negative, or absent? So, if I looked at all

125
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,280
the hyp, if I looked at all the hypotheses I could do

126
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,340
that by asking, now it's very hard to do, because

127
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,520
there's no direct way to ask that question. The only

128
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,760
way to ask that question is, I have to try.

129
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,215
Well, I have to try all possible exponential cases to know.

130
00:06:04,215 --> 00:06:09,310
>> Yeah, 'because we're constrained to only ask queries that

131
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,560
are data points, right? So give me the label for

132
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,030
this data point. And that's not really the same as

133
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:17,260
is the hypothesis you're thinking of having this particular property.

134
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,570
>> But as soon as I get a one,

135
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:20,200
I know something.

136
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,760
>> Soon as you get a one, you're in a much happier place.

137
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,300
So, in fact, if we didn't, if we had conjunctions of literals without negations

138
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,470
>> Mm-hm.

139
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,300
>> We'd be in a much better situation, because then you could, your first

140
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,708
question can be, you know, one one one one one one. You know the answer

141
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:39,580
has to be one, or the formula's empty. So then you're, you're basically off and

142
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,650
running, but the fact that there can

143
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:44,860
be negation in there means that most queries

144
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,320
really give you useless information.

145
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,140
>> So, so Michael, okay, so you've depressed me.

146
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,310
You've basically said this is really hard to do, to

147
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,460
learn because I think that we've convinced ourselves, at

148
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,610
least you've convinced me that until I get a one,

149
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,590
until I, I, I get a positive result, I

150
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,150
can't really know anything. And eventually I will get one

151
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,080
if I can just do an exponential number of samples,

152
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,150
but then my sample complexity is exponential, and I'm sad.

153
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,656
So what you're basically saying is, I'm sad

154
00:07:12,656 --> 00:07:15,460
sample complexity makes me a bad person, and there's

155
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,700
really nothing I can do to learn anything

156
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,320
or get anything good out of my learning process.

157
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,970
>> That seems like a very sad way of saying it.

158
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,920
>> Yes, is there a happy way of saying it?

159
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,670
>> There isn't a happy way of saying that. But

160
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,680
there is, there are other questions that have happier answers.

161
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,630
>> Okay, like what?
