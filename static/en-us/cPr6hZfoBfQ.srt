1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,410
So, we're going to talk
about a couple of the U.S.

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:08,710
laws related to cyber crime and
illegal online activities.

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,730
The first one is the U.S.
Computer Fraud and

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,440
Abuse Act, that's CFAA,
actually goes back a while.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,250
But the goal of this law or
this act, was to define

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,350
what is criminal, when it comes
to things that you do online.

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,890
So, various types of online abuse.

8
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:32,990
And then define criminal sanctions
against those kind of actions or

9
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:33,760
activities.

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,200
That constitute abuse or fraud.

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,380
So, it really covers unauthorized
access to computers.

12
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,940
So, you're not allowed to be some
place in the physical world,

13
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,700
we have laws like that.

14
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,080
Here we're sort of trespassing
somebody's computer that

15
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,590
is connected to the internet and
we can reach out to it.

16
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:58,490
So computer obviously has things
of value that you are after.

17
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,670
If you happen to the the cyber criminal,

18
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,570
that's who is being
targeted by this law.

19
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,980
So I said it goes back a while,

20
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:10,410
initially it was rather net-over
it was trying to protect.

21
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,785
It's sort of multuation came from
national security, national defense.

22
00:01:13,785 --> 00:01:17,620
So, it's saying if you gain
unauthorized access to a computer

23
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,630
that has data related
to national defense.

24
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,870
That is illegal.

25
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,710
This was then extended
to financial data,

26
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,030
because people do care
about their money.

27
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,510
And criminals,
cyber criminals actually after money.

28
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,820
They want to steal
your online account or

29
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,050
steal credit card information and so on.

30
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,690
If you access either defense related or

31
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:42,170
financial data and
the access is unauthorized.

32
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,110
CFAA says that that's an illegal act.

33
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,930
So, what exactly is unauthorized access?

34
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:52,315
Unauthorized access essentially,
is getting hold of this data,

35
00:01:52,315 --> 00:01:53,940
gaining access to it.

36
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,790
So remember, when it comes to
data we had the confidentiality,

37
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,720
integrity and availability requirements.

38
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,880
That we had the CIA requirements,

39
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,570
that we had to find when you
talk about securing data.

40
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,770
So, gaining access to it,

41
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,820
you're able to see the data that
you shouldn't be able to see.

42
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,040
Use it, for example,

43
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,720
of financial gain modification is
affecting its integrity, corrupting it.

44
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,900
Destroying is exactly that,

45
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,630
disclosure is to anybody who's not
authorized to see it and so on.

46
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:29,430
If all this is done when the system
under consideration happens to be

47
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,660
a government system.

48
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,290
Well that's how CFAA started, so

49
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:37,958
this basically is saying the law
covers access to information.

50
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:41,210
Modification, we're not allowed to do so
and

51
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,640
using that information in any shape and
form.

52
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,270
Destroying it, affecting availability,

53
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,620
that's what you would do with this,
is illegal.

54
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,160
So, this one initially was
something that is operated by or

55
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,640
on behalf, so it could be
a contractor or the US government.

56
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:03,470
But this, as a history this was
broadened to include any computer.

57
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,470
The language is any protected computer,

58
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:10,310
basically a protected computer is any
computer that's connected the Internet.

59
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,200
So, a protected computer,
if you access it without permission, and

60
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,660
gain access to the data, or destroy it.

61
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,650
Or corrupt it while you're
committing an illegal act.

62
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:24,050
It then actually keeps getting more and
more specific.

63
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:29,120
Transmitting code or malware, malicious
software that can damage a computer,

64
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,250
well that's illegal as well.

65
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,009
And finally,

66
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:36,480
it specifically addresses passwords that
I'd use to gain access to computers.

67
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,340
So, if you steal a truckload
of passwords and

68
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,420
want to sell them on the black market,
the underground market.

69
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,750
That's trafficking in
computer passwords and

70
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,240
if you did that,
that would be illegal as well.

71
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,960
So, accessing data that is
not yours in various forms.

72
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,390
Infecting computers with malicious
software, trafficking in passwords that

73
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:00,360
allow others to gain access to
computers that are protected.

74
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,040
All those things are covered
under the Computer Fraud and

75
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,650
Abuse Act that we have
in the United States.
