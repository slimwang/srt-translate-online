1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,551
So let's go back to our dig a hole example.

2
00:00:02,551 --> 00:00:05,120
If we're going to dig a hole, we're really interested in 2 things.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,723
One is how long it's going to take to dig that hole,

4
00:00:07,723 --> 00:00:11,524
and 2, how much work, how many total hours it will take to dig.

5
00:00:11,524 --> 00:00:15,918
If you're the only one digging this hole, these 2 things are the same.

6
00:00:15,918 --> 00:00:20,924
So we have 1 worker, and perhaps it's going to take you 8 hours to finish,

7
00:00:20,924 --> 00:00:24,620
and so that means overall you're going to do 8 hours of work.

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,265
But if you bring all your friends over to dig the hole with you,

9
00:00:27,265 --> 00:00:31,247
the amount of time to finish and the total amount of work might be different.

10
00:00:31,247 --> 00:00:32,913
So now we're going to have 4 workers,

11
00:00:32,913 --> 00:00:38,784
and perhaps they'll work together for 8 hours total and thus be able to finish in 2 hours.

12
00:00:38,784 --> 00:00:41,886
Thus they've finished digging this hole 4 times as fast.

13
00:00:41,886 --> 00:00:46,171
We'd actually call this ideal scaling since adding 4 times as many workers

14
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,640
allowed us to finish 4 times as fast.

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,800
Alternatively, we might have 4 diggers, each of which gets in each other's way,

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,869
so we're not going to be quite as efficient.

17
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:58,969
So, for instance, we might have 4 workers, and together it's going to take them 4 hours to finish,

18
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:02,542
thus meaning that together they've done 16 hours of work.

19
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:04,653
Now you might reasonably ask yourself

20
00:01:04,653 --> 00:01:08,578
why your instructor spends so much time talking about digging holes, and that's a fair point.

21
00:01:08,578 --> 00:01:12,178
But there's a couple of important points of terminology that I want to make here.

22
00:01:12,178 --> 00:01:14,691
The first is the concept of a step.

23
00:01:14,691 --> 00:01:21,493
It's how long it takes to complete a particular computation--Operation Hole Digging.

24
00:01:21,493 --> 00:01:25,563
The second is the total amount of work that it took to perform that computation

25
00:01:25,563 --> 00:01:28,269
over all the active workers.

26
00:01:28,269 --> 00:01:31,708
And so we're going to go into a little more depth in terms of the way that we define these.
