00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,330
So, for this code checkpoint,
since we allowed all the pet values in

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:10,110
the database, we're going to be using
the CONTENT_URI in the PetEntry class.

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,927
And remember, this URI is equivalent to

4
00:00:12,927 --> 00:00:21,420
content://com.example.android.pets/pets/
for the entire pets table.

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,800
So, here's what that change
looks like in the code.

6
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:30,030
Back in the catalog activity in
the display database info method,

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:35,030
I've updated the query method to contact
the content resolver instead, and

8
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,850
here I've added a little
comment to clarify that.

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,290
Here's a line that I ask you to
fill in with the CONTENT_URI, so

10
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,070
if you want to double check where
this is set up, let's Right-Click,

11
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,610
head to Go To, and
then go to Declaration.

12
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,620
Here it jumps us into the pet contract
into the pet entry innerclass, and

13
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,720
we see this is the URI
that we're referring to.
