00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,638
If you picked Homo Neanderthal, you're correct. Neanderthals lived from about

2
00:00:05,638 --> 00:00:10,535
400,000 years ago and died off only about 28,000 years ago. And we have

3
00:00:10,535 --> 00:00:14,630
evidence now that modern humans and Neanderthals interbred for a period of

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:19,580
time. Therefore, Homo Neanderthals are our closest relatives.
