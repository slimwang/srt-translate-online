00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,320
In lesson two we talked a bit about
developer and production environments.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,850
But it's more complicated than that.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,460
Between the developer's workstation and
production, there are lots of nooks and

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,380
crannies that our application
code has to land.

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,660
There are no hard and fast rules on how
many environments you need to maintain,

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,880
and will most likely be
driven by use cases.

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,770
In most cases you'll have
at least six environments.

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:22,710
The starting place for

9
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,880
all code is the local environment, which
is just the developers work station.

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,220
Secondly you'll have
the development environment.

11
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,430
An example of this can be a server where
the developer can deploy their own

12
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,450
branch of the code and play around
without messing up someone else.

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,388
It's often referred to as the sandbox.

14
00:00:38,388 --> 00:00:42,390
After the development environment
an integration environment is needed.

15
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,460
It can be a CI build target or for
developers to test side effects.

16
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,710
This is where the app gets built and
tested and

17
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,985
changes are merged back into
the main working branch.

18
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:55,245
It is possible to have a separate test,
QA environment for

19
00:00:55,245 --> 00:01:00,075
functional, performance testing, quality
assurance and user acceptance testing.

20
00:01:00,075 --> 00:01:01,375
Or, if the team is small,

21
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:05,755
it can be just one environment that gets
deployed right after the CI process.

22
00:01:05,755 --> 00:01:08,115
Up next is moving your code
into the staging area.

23
00:01:08,115 --> 00:01:10,620
The staging area is a mirror production.

24
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,940
It includes databases that usually have
a fairly recent copy of live data.

25
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,280
By now a lot of problems or

26
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,440
issues should have been caught
before moving code into production.

27
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,750
Production serves the end users and
clients and hence can have scale and

28
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,380
size that you might not be able to
test within your other environments.

29
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:30,780
It's also possible to have production
canaries, a subset of production servers

30
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,660
where the new version gets deployed,
the ability to test performance with

31
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:39,110
real workload but limiting the impact of
any negative things that might come up.

32
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:42,320
As the code gets written on
a local developer work station,

33
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,130
how does it transition into production
and how are the environments different?

34
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,070
Clearly there must be some difference
between a development server and

35
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,540
a production server.

36
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,170
For example, databases may have
old versus current data, and

37
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,885
software patches may be out of sync.
