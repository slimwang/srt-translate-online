00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,043
Now thinking back to the soda machine part of our story, can we make a similar

2
00:00:04,043 --> 00:00:08,304
statement about the quantities we wanted to connect in that case? Which one of

3
00:00:08,304 --> 00:00:12,516
these choices do you think makes the most sense? Is it that the number of sodas

4
00:00:12,516 --> 00:00:16,676
the machine spits and the amount of money that Athena puts in are not related at

5
00:00:16,676 --> 00:00:20,070
all? Is it that the number of sodas the machine spits out depends on the amount

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,122
of money that Athena puts in? Or is it that the amount of money Athena puts in

7
00:00:24,122 --> 00:00:28,576
depends on the number of sodas the machine spits out. Think about how cause and

8
00:00:28,576 --> 00:00:32,633
effect, or input and output play a role in this part of the story.
