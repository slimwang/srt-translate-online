00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,892
To code this in BlueJ, I'll first imagine just calculating a total for one

2
00:00:03,892 --> 00:00:08,392
topic. Let's say it's topic two. Now for each student, I want to look at the

3
00:00:08,392 --> 00:00:13,160
grade for that student for the current topic. And add it onto the sum so far.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,333
This'll be the sum for this one topic. I'll initialize sum for topic with zero

5
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:20,993
and then once I've calculated it I want to store it in the correct spot for

6
00:00:20,993 --> 00:00:25,925
it's topic. I'll need to make this array for all of the totals, it contains

7
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:29,915
doubles. And it should have one for each topic, and then at the end, I'll

8
00:00:29,915 --> 00:00:35,820
return all of the totals. But now I need to do this part for all of the topics.

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,010
So, starting from initializing the sum, to saving it, I want to indent

10
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,475
everything, and then add a for loop that goes through all of the topics so now

11
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:45,885
that I am controlling the topic that I am looking at with a for loop we can get

12
00:00:45,885 --> 00:00:49,075
rid of that and now I am ready to try it, since there are less topics than

13
00:00:49,075 --> 00:00:52,540
students it's easier to tell this time that it is right, but there are a lot of

14
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,005
other ways that we could do this, for example I could create my array with one

15
00:00:56,005 --> 00:00:59,470
spot for each topic and I then I could go through each student one student at a

16
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:10,154
time, and add their total. And add their grade to the correct total for the

17
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:19,713
correct topics. And then, for the last line, plus 4 plus 6 plus 5. That might

18
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:22,990
work, too. I think that's a little more confusing to read. But there could be

19
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:27,180
advantages to that way as well. I think the way that I showed was the simplest.

20
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,706
But trying a few different ways is good practice. You could find the one that

21
00:01:30,706 --> 00:01:32,940
you like best. What do you like about it?
