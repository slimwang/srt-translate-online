1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,500
Firewalls also provide
additional features.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,710
Firewalls can lock all
traffic that passes through.

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,700
And the law can be analyzed
later to learn about the traffic

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,250
such as the traffic volume to
a specific part of the network.

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,530
Firewall can also provide
network address translation.

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:22,130
This is useful when multiple machines in
the internal network has to share an IP

7
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,930
address to the external
networks on the Internet.

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,720
The firewall translates the source
IP address of an internal host

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,299
through this shared IPv4 address for
outbound traffic.

10
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:36,450
And for inbound traffic, the firewall
translates the destination IP address

11
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,900
to the IP address of an internal host.

12
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,140
It can also provide encryption services.

13
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,550
For example,
when traffic goes out from one internal

14
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,800
trusted network to another trusted
network across the Internet,

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,890
the firewall can automatically encrypt
the traffic so that the untrusted

16
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,030
networks on the Internet cannot
learn the contents of such traffic.
