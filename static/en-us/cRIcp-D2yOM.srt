00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,170
This lecture covers the theory
of NP completeness.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,630
The idea that there are some
problems in NP, so general, and so

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,520
expressive, that they capture
all the challenges of solving

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,250
any problem in NP in polynomial time.

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:16,370
These problems will provide important
insight into the structure of P and NP,

6
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,080
and from the basis for
the best arguments we have, for

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,920
the attractability of many important,
real world problems.
