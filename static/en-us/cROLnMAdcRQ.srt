00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,696
Now the lowest common denominator might of been tricky here. You want to make

2
00:00:05,696 --> 00:00:10,454
sure that it's n times 6 minus 3n. This is one factor in these denominators and

3
00:00:10,454 --> 00:00:15,800
n is a completely different factor. So we want to multiply those two together to

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:21,230
get our LCD. For the first term we'll have 5 times 6 minus 3 n. And for the

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:26,612
second term we'll have plus 4 times n, or positive 4 n. The right side of our

6
00:00:26,612 --> 00:00:30,608
equation is simply 2 n squared. Since these factors reduce to one. If we

7
00:00:30,608 --> 00:00:35,793
distribute positive 5, and combine our like terms, we'll get 30 minus 11 n

8
00:00:35,793 --> 00:00:40,788
equals 2 n squared. Now that we're at this part we have a quadratic equation,

9
00:00:40,788 --> 00:00:45,581
since we have a 2 N squared. We want to set this equation equal to zero by

10
00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:51,186
moving or rearranging these two terms. If we move these terms to the right side

11
00:00:51,186 --> 00:00:56,286
of the equation we'll get zero is equal to 2 N squared, plus 11 minus 30. This

12
00:00:56,286 --> 00:01:00,365
is something that we can factor and solve. So here is our equation and, to

13
00:01:00,365 --> 00:01:05,361
factor it, we want to find the factors of negative 60 that's sum to positive 11.

14
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:10,424
When we use factoring by grouping, we'll get 2n plus 15 as 1 factor. And n minus

15
00:01:10,424 --> 00:01:15,531
2 as another. Finally, we set each factor equal to zero, and then solve the 2

16
00:01:15,531 --> 00:01:21,603
remaining equations. N could equal negative 15/2, or n could equal positive 2.

17
00:01:21,603 --> 00:01:25,654
And here's where we want to be careful. We need to check for the excluded values

18
00:01:25,654 --> 00:01:30,032
for the original equation. We know n cannot equal zero, since this denominator

19
00:01:30,032 --> 00:01:34,130
would equal zero. And the fraction would be undefined. We also know that n

20
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:39,153
cannot equal 2. If n was equal to 2 both of these denominators would be zero and

21
00:01:39,153 --> 00:01:43,990
these two fractions would be undefined. This means that this solution is not

22
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:49,861
valid. We can only take this as our actual solution. So here's our solution set,

23
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:54,653
negative 15 halves. Fantastic algebraic thinking for getting that one correct.
