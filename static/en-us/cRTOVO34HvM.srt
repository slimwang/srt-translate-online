00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,625
When we rationalize this fraction, we'll get 4 root 35 plus 2 root 15. Great

2
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:09,796
effort if you found it. We start by multiplying the numerator and denominator

3
00:00:09,796 --> 00:00:15,210
by the conjugate of this expression. The conjugate of 2 root 5 minus root 7 is

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:21,398
2 root 5 plus root 7. We multiply 26 to each of these terms to get 52 root 5

5
00:00:21,398 --> 00:00:27,106
plus 26 root 7. For the denominator, we use our difference of squares to do a

6
00:00:27,106 --> 00:00:32,357
squared minus b squared. We can't simplify or combine terms in the numerator,

7
00:00:32,357 --> 00:00:36,984
since this is root 5 and this is root 7. So we just list the numerator here

8
00:00:36,984 --> 00:00:41,561
again, and then we simplify the denominator. 2 squared is 4, and the root of 5

9
00:00:41,561 --> 00:00:46,244
squared is 5. We have our subtraction sign and then we have the square of root

10
00:00:46,244 --> 00:00:50,758
7, which is just 7. We simplify our denominator to get 13, and then divide it

11
00:00:50,758 --> 00:00:56,579
into each of the terms. 15 divided by 13 is 4, and 26 divided by 13 is 2.

12
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,178
Another way to think about it, is we're really factoring a 13 from the 52 root

13
00:01:01,178 --> 00:01:06,861
5, and the 26 root 7. If we factor our 13 out, we'll be left with 4 root 5,

14
00:01:06,861 --> 00:01:11,289
plus 2 root 7. This allows us to simplify the factor of 13 that appears in the

15
00:01:11,289 --> 00:01:16,299
numerator, and denominator. This simplifies to 1. So we're left with this for a

16
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:20,787
fraction, and anything divided by 1, is simply itself. So we can write our

17
00:01:20,787 --> 00:01:22,627
answer like this.
