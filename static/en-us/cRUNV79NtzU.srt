00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,492
The discriminant of a problem is the expression b squared minus 4ac, now have

2
00:00:04,492 --> 00:00:09,042
you got this right, awesome job and if not, seriously don't worry about it all,

3
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:13,742
this required a tone of critical thinking. Now the reason that this expression

4
00:00:13,742 --> 00:00:18,227
determines the number of roots in our problem Is that, first off, we're taking

5
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:22,537
the square root of it. And secondly, we're both adding and subtracting this

6
00:00:22,537 --> 00:00:26,852
number from negative b. Let's continue talking about this, since it's pretty

7
00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:29,078
subtle and seems to be a little complex.
