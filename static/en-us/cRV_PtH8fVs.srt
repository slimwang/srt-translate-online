1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,830
We have looked at several different metrics.

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:08,730
We've looked at the accuracy, the sensitivity and specificity.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,500
And in general looked at a confusion matrix.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,910
Let's swing back to our classification models and calculate their accuracy.

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,540
Let's run the piece of code here.

6
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:26,560
Upon running this code, you will see accuracy for logistic regression,

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,020
for random forest classifier, and a sampled vector classifier printed.

8
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,980
In this case, we have used the score method

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,000
of the model object to calculate these accuracy values.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,530
Let's look at the next block of code.

11
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,320
This block of code prints out the confusion matrix for you.

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,860
Let's run this block of code.

13
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:55,180
Upon running this block of code, you will see the following confusion matrix.

14
00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:00,870
This code should give you a good idea of all the metrics we have talked about so

15
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,840
far, and how to calculate them yourself.

16
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,135
Take some time to go through this block of code yourself.

17
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:14,290
Scikit-learn also comes with a method to print the confusion matrix.

18
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:19,330
In this block of code, we'll use the scikit-learn's confusion matrix printer

19
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,940
to see if we get the same values.

20
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,620
Upon running, we see the following output.

21
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:30,730
We leave it up to you to verify that the numbers are the same as

22
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,790
what we obtained through our own calculations.

23
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:38,460
Refer to the result of the confusion matrix you just obtained.

24
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,500
Now calculate the following for the logistic regression.

25
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,900
The sensitivity and the specificity.

26
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,690
Enter your answers to two decimal places in these boxes.

27
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:56,630
Remember, sensitivity is the number of true positives divided by

28
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,360
all actual positives, and

29
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,750
specificity is the number of true negatives divided by all actual negatives.

30
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,280
It is okay if you look back at your notes for the formula for

31
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,940
sensitivity and specificity.
