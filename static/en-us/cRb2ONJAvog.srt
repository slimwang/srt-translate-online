1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,990
So here's Chris, with more friends than approximately 99% of people, 2.5

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:12,463
standard deviations above the mean. Well if the standard deviation is 36, then

3
00:00:12,463 --> 00:00:19,051
what's 2.5 standard deviations? 2.5 Standard deviations, is just 36 times 2.5.

4
00:00:19,051 --> 00:00:26,384
Which is 90, so Chris has 90 more friends than the mean, and the mean is 190. So

5
00:00:26,384 --> 00:00:33,768
190 plus 90 is 280. So Chris has 280 Facebook friends. Another way to look at it

6
00:00:33,768 --> 00:00:40,516
is to use the equation. You know that the z score, which for Chris is 2.5, is

7
00:00:40,516 --> 00:00:47,289
the original value Minus the mean divide by the standard deviation. So if we

8
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:52,721
plug in the values that we know, 2 point 5 which is z is x, his number of

9
00:00:52,721 --> 00:00:59,150
Facebook friends, minus the mean divided by the standard deviation. And if you

10
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:05,678
solve algebraically by cross multiplying and then adding 190, you get the number

11
00:01:05,678 --> 00:01:11,978
of friends that Chris has, denoted by x. Which is again, 280. So this time,

12
00:01:11,978 --> 00:01:18,550
instead of converting a value to its z score, we converted the z score to the

13
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,225
real world value.
