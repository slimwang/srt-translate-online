1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,580
So what are the students going to be doing when they meet up once a week?

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,450
They're going to be presenting their lessons learned,

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,130
and they're going to be presenting in front of their entire peers.

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:14,650
Now, you'll be sitting in the back of the room, both the facilitators and the mentors,

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,600
and critiquing what they've learned.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,280
And as they present, remember, you've been reading their LaunchPad Central blog posts,

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,630
so you kind of know who they've been talking to.

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,670
So this is almost a summary,

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,880
but you will be giving them comments.

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,120
In the meantime, the students, instead of just sitting there and doing their email,

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,340
who are not presenting, actually have a shared Google Doc

12
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:42,240
and they're doing peer grading of their peers, of their presentations,

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,660
and giving them feedback as well.

14
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:49,870
And what the students are doing outside the classroom are 10 to 15 hours

15
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,780
of customer discovery, and they're spending at least an hour a week

16
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:57,100
blogging what they've learned, and they're using the LaunchPad Central tool to do that.

17
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:02,180
And they're watching the lectures online on the Udacity site.

18
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:07,990
What you're doing as facilitators and coaches is you're answering questions

19
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,890
about the lectures, and you're critiquing team presentations.

20
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:16,400
And what the teaching team is using is, you're using a shared Google Doc,

21
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,670
sitting in the back of the room, grading, while the students

22
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:22,940
are using their peer grading doc, which is very separate from yours.

23
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,120
So they don't get to see your grades, and you get to see theirs later.

24
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,600
But now the teaching team is actually writing down

25
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,600
what you think of each one of the teams.

26
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,930
And again, in between the weeks your job is to review and comment

27
00:01:34,930 --> 99:59:59,999
on the team's customer discovery narrative using the LaunchPad Central tool.
