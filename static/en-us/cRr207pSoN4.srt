00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,290
We wouldn't see similarities in personality between relatives, regardless of

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:09,306
how genetically close they were. We would see strong similarities in people who

3
00:00:09,306 --> 00:00:14,500
are reared together, so this one would apply as well. The similarity would

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,260
increase as the environmental closeness increased.
