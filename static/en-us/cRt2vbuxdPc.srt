1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
So remember the 2 by 2 matrix that we drew a while ago.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,210
We'll now have a closer look at this matrix as promised.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,290
So what we just found out by the way is that this part here

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,280
anything you can do on a non-deterministic RAM in polynomial time

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,060
can also be one on a deterministic RAM in exponential time.

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:24,240
So any problem that is in this part down here would also be in this part up here.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,310
But since we are mainly interested in polynomial time,

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,100
let's focus on the bottom part of this matrix for now.

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,420
You'll come back to the full matrix in later units when we talked about

10
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:37,850
exponential time complexity classes and remember that each of these squares

11
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:43,260
contains all of the problems that can be solved in polynomial time.

12
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:49,350
The left one on a deterministic RAM, and the right one on a non-deterministic RAM,

13
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,080
and now, we'll give these names.

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:56,990
So we'll call this complexity class here P, because those are all problems

15
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:02,340
that are solvable in polynomial time on a deterministic RAM.

16
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:09,260
And we'll call this here NP, because those are all problems solvable in polynomial time

17
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,340
on a non-deterministic RAM.

18
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,860
Of course, it wouldn't have been more consistent to call this one down here DP or something like that,

19
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,920
but this is the way we named it.

20
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:24,920
And now, what we also know is that any problem that can be solved in polynomial time

21
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,330
on a deterministic RAM can also be solved in polynomial time on a non-deterministic RAM.

22
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:35,160
We should probably rather redraw these black lines here like this because any problem

23
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:41,270
that is contained in P is automatically also contained in NP but of course not vice versa.

24
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,190
Otherwise, we would know that there is a polynomial time algorithm

25
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:47,370
for vertex cover and the two other problems.

26
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,640
So P contains all the problems that we know are easy.

27
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,270
So, for example, finding the shortest path between two points in the graph

28
00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:00,310
or looking up an entry in the database multiplying two numbers and thousands of problems more.

29
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:05,200
So basically, any algorithm you'll have come across in an introductory algorithm scores

30
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,310
will fall into this category.

31
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:13,180
And again, there are some theoretical nitty-gritty regarding optimization and decision problems here,

32
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,740
but we can ignore that for the time being.

33
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,950
So let's do a little quiz to summarize what you know by now.

34
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:23,200
So given all you have learned, what can you say about P and NP?

35
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,960
So I would like you to check which of these statements are true.

36
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,340
The first statement is every problem in P is also contained in NP.

37
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:37,060
The second statement is that every problem in NP is also contained in P.

38
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:42,040
The third one is that P and NP are in fact equivalent.

39
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:49,310
The fourth one is that it seems like NP should contain more problems than P or be larger than P,

40
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,630
but we can't really say for sure.

41
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:57,190
The fifth one is that vertex cover, independent set, and clique are contained in P.

42
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,320
And the finally one is that those three problems are contained in NP.

43
00:03:00,320 --> 99:59:59,999
So please check every statement which given what we know by now you should consider to be true.
