Now let's do a quiz on the high
level concepts of block ciphers.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,530
Select all correct answers
to complete this statement.

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:14,360
A block cipher should first use
substitution to achieve confusion.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,600
Second, a block cipher should use
permutation to achieve diffusion.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,440
Third, a block cipher
should use a few rounds,

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,700
each with a combination of
substitution and permutation.

7
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,870
Fourth, a block cipher should
keep the algorithm secret.
