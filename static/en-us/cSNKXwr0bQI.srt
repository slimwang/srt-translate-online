00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:08,495
For f of x equals 2. Our region is x is less than negative 2. The next part of

2
00:00:08,495 --> 00:00:12,330
the graph is our f of x equals x squared, and that is between the region of

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,360
negative 2 and 2. And it's inclusive of that region as you can see by the less

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:24,790
than or equal to signs. The third part is, f of x is equal to x plus 2 for all

5
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:30,003
values greater than 2.
