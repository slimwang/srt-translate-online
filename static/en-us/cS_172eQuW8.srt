00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,530
So the objectives of this specific lesson is that I'm going to

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,580
introduce you to the concept of point processes.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,410
That is, how do you basically use pixel values themselves and

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,090
use them in computations?

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,830
We will use this to do addition and subtraction of images but it can be used to

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,800
doing any other kinds of mathematical operations like multiplication.

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,350
I'm going to use this also concept to introduce the concept of alpha values and

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:25,500
alpha blending.

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,710
And how can we use some different types of simple image processing methods.

10
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,910
And while we have talked about image histograms in the previous lecture,

11
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,180
in this lecture I'm going, I'm going to give you a much better handle on how we

12
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,540
can use image histograms to look at the statistics of images and

13
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,091
how we can use them in different methods of computer vision and image processing
