00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,370
Given what you now know, I want you to
give me a new broadcast algorithm that

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,170
is asymptotically optimal in bandwidth.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,640
That is, I want you to define
the implementation of broadcast.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,020
As a hint, think about combining
bandwidth optimal collectives.
