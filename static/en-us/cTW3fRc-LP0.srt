1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,115
Sales of Grant's packs of 12 nozzles have really taken off. In fact, he's been

2
00:00:05,115 --> 00:00:08,745
doing so well selling these bulk packages, that he's only going to sell nozzles

3
00:00:08,745 --> 00:00:13,749
by the dozen now. That does mean, though, that depending on how many nozzles he

4
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:18,930
has total, he might have some left over. For example, if Grant has 40 nozzles

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:25,267
total, then that will make 3 and 1 3rd packages of 12 nozzles. Since if we take

6
00:00:25,267 --> 00:00:29,398
40 and divide it by 12, we get 3 and a 3rd. And we can see these 3 whole

7
00:00:29,398 --> 00:00:34,900
packages of 12 nozzles, but then there's this 1 3rd of a package left over.

8
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,110
Grant can't sell 1 3rd of a package. So, this 3 and a 3rd packages really only

9
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:43,136
counts as 3 for him. So, it's almost as if we're taking this 3 and a 3rd and

10
00:00:43,136 --> 00:00:47,610
rounding it down to the nearest integer, 3. So, let's say that x equals the

11
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,144
actual number of packs of nozzles we have. So, for example in this case, we

12
00:00:52,144 --> 00:00:56,262
have 3 and 3rd packs of nozzles. And let's say that y equals the number of

13
00:00:56,262 --> 00:01:01,792
packs of nozzles that Grant can actually sell. So, in this case, that was 3. We

14
00:01:01,792 --> 00:01:05,158
can represent this relationship between the actual number of packages we have

15
00:01:05,158 --> 00:01:08,422
and the number Grant can sell by something that's called the Floor Function,

16
00:01:08,422 --> 00:01:13,849
also known as the Greatest Integer Function. The notation for the equation is

17
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:18,137
this, y equals x inside these double square brackets, which basically means

18
00:01:18,137 --> 00:01:22,358
that the y value is equal to the greatest integer that is less than or equal to

19
00:01:22,358 --> 00:01:28,557
the corresponding x value. But what do you think the graph of the 4 function

20
00:01:28,557 --> 00:01:32,838
looks like? Which of these graphs do you think properly represents the floor

21
00:01:32,838 --> 00:01:36,946
function? Remember that we want the y value to round x down to the nearest

22
00:01:36,946 --> 00:01:41,542
integer. I know that from our way it might be hard to tell these graphs apart.

23
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:44,315
So, below them I've shown a blown up version for you of what each of these

24
00:01:44,315 --> 00:01:48,291
steps looks like. Please notice the difference between the 2 in terms of which

25
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:51,339
circles are empty and which circles are colored in.
