1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,350
So the answer here is that the lines are executed 1,048,576 times

2
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:10,500
or just about a million times.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,810
And the way you calculate this is very similar to here above.

4
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:18,430
So instead of 2^5, you now have to take 2^20 because--

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:23,160
for the 20 communication centers--you're trying all separate possibilities

6
00:00:23,160 --> 99:59:59,999
of having them with a monitoring device or not.
