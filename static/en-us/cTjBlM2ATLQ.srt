1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,700
I can do the same for the other orthogonal vector over here.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:09,740
Delta x and delta y in red, it defines the y prime axis.

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,820
So just like before, give me your best guesses for delta x and

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,630
delta y, it's not an ambiguous question.

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,110
But I want to be as simple as over here, describing the vector to the left.
