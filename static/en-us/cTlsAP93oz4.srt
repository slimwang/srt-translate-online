1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,590
So now let's actually
look at translation,

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:04,330
something I had ignored before.

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,440
This is the way, the best way,
I can actually translate an image or

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,600
pixel points on an image.

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,100
Right?
Take any x and y value, and

6
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,220
actually have to give a translation,
tx and ty.

7
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,990
This simple addition would actually give
me newer x and ys, x prime, y prime.

8
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:23,890
Notice that this matrix representation
does not allow me to reconstruct this.

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:24,480
Right?

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,680
Because in this matrix representation,
shown by this, when I do a multi,

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,270
a matrix multiply becomes ax plus by for
x prime.

12
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:38,760
X prime would basically
become ax plus by.

13
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,900
And similarly,
y prime would become cx plus dy.

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,850
Notice almost impossible in this linear
combination formulation that we've

15
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,680
looked at that we can generate
an equation that matches this.

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,910
In essence, these terms are additive.

17
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,340
As opposed,
these are linear combinations.

18
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,380
So then, question to all of you,
how do we resolve this?

19
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:07,180
How do we come up with a way,
in this form of a matrix representation,

20
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,630
that will allow us to encode
things like translation?
