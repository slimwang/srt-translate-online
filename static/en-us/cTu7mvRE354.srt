1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,620
So the trick for doing algorithms like
Value Iteration in infinite state space

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,980
like what you get from the belief MDP is
going to come only by looking really,

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,450
really, really carefully
at the infinite case and

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,950
then showing that we can be
represented in a finite way.

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,310
So what we're going to do now
is actually step through what

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,300
Value Iteration would
look like in POMDPS.

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,430
And then piece by piece,

8
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,220
we're going to convert that to something
that actually can be computed.

9
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,790
So at first, it's going to be math and
then it's going to be an algorithm.

10
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:31,790
So here's Value Iteration written
out and it's in POMDPS but

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,080
sort of doesn't really matter yet.

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,230
We're going to define the value
function at step zero,

13
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,490
as a function of the belief,
to just be zero everywhere.

14
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,450
And then we'll say, for t greater than
zero, the value function for time stamp

15
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,100
t as a function of belief state b,
is going to be the max overall actions,

16
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,000
the reward for taking that action in
the context of that belief state.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,630
Plus the discounted expected
value of where we end up right so

18
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,790
that we're going to observe
is an observation z.

19
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:05,630
And so we're going to let sum over
all the possible observations

20
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:10,610
the probability that we make that
observation times the value function

21
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,910
at the previous time step for
the resulting belief state b prime,

22
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,770
which is the what we get by doing
what we talked about on the previous

23
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,600
slide which we call the state
estimation for b, a, z.

24
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,450
>> All right, that seems reasonable.

25
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,540
I mean other than the fact that
r is not a function of b and

26
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,910
a that just it means
the reward you actually got.

27
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:32,787
Right so let's, what is this, what
is this like, what is the reward for

28
00:01:32,787 --> 00:01:37,390
being being in the belief state b given
that we take action a, how can we

29
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,030
represent that in terms of quantities
that we're more familiar with?

30
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,175
>> By unrolling probabilities or
something the same way we did last time.

31
00:01:43,175 --> 00:01:46,450
Yeah and in particular all we have to
do is say well you know we would get

32
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:50,210
the reward for
state s we were in state s.

33
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,600
So let's just sum overall states the
probability we're actually in that state

34
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,790
the reward that we would
get from that state and

35
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,660
of course this is just the belief
state for for state s.

36
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,220
So this is really just the dot product
of the belief state with kind of

37
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,541
a vector that you could make out
of the rewards for a given action.

38
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:11,920
>> So, it really is just the the average
award you expect given the belief state.

39
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,730
>> Exactly.
>> Okay.

40
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,620
>> And so again now that we've
got that out of the way,

41
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,860
the scary thing here is this function
v this value function is defined over

42
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:25,390
an infinite set of belief states, these
vectors of probabilities over states.

43
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,420
So again we're not going to let
that scare us quite yet, but

44
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,520
it is something we have to keep in mind.

45
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,550
Otherwise, we could just
implement this directly.

46
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,530
All we would need is
a loop that would say for

47
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,950
all belief states do this update.

48
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,560
It's just that there's
an infinite number of them so

49
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,700
that would not terminate
>> Yeah but

50
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,555
you could write it in really
just a few lines of code.

51
00:02:42,555 --> 00:02:46,160
>> [LAUGH] Yes, you could write an
infinite loop in very few lines of code.

52
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,680
>> Beautiful really.

53
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,130
>> This is how we're going to jump from

54
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:53,730
the infinite to the finite is we have,
we're going to make a claim.

55
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:59,430
And the claim goes like this, that for
all t, the value function times steps t,

56
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,140
over all belief states b,
right so this is over

57
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:07,290
the infinite set of possible belief
states, can be written in a finite way.

58
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,040
In particular, the maximum over

59
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,490
some set of vectors gamma sub t that
we're going to have to deal with later.

60
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,630
But the point is that it's
a finite set of vectors.

61
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,760
The maximum of the dot product of

62
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,780
the vectors in that set
with the belief state.

63
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,680
>> Okay.
>> Where

64
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,990
a dot product is really just
the sum over all the states,

65
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:33,420
the weighted probability being
that state times this alpha of s.

66
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,110
So this kind of function is sometimes
called piecewise linear and

67
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:43,120
convex and the reason is, that if we
actually, if we think about belief space

68
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,770
as being well it's just a really
simple one, like the space of

69
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,780
probability distributions over
just the two possible states.

70
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,590
So we have some probability
between zero and one and

71
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,620
if probability one represents we're
totally definitely in state S1

72
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:05,300
otherwise if the probably zero,
were totally definitely in state S0 and

73
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,550
in between where in between there some
probability of S series some probably

74
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:12,280
of S1, In the halfway in
between would be half of each.

75
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:12,940
Okay?
So what

76
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:18,399
functions of this kind have in common
is that each of these alpha times b

77
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,260
is a linear function
of the belief state.

78
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:20,950
All right?
So

79
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:24,520
each of that alphas in
the set capital gamma sub t

80
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,660
is some linear function of the belief
state and what we're going

81
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,260
to do is we have a whole bunch of them
at any given belief state b what we're

82
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,200
doing is we're taking the maximum value
of all these possible linear functions.

83
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,160
So at the end of the day the actual
function that we've represented

84
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,860
is this upper surface of
these linear functions

85
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,650
each of which is defined
in the set capital gamma.

86
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,990
Does that make some sense?

87
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,440
>> Sure, makes me think of something
you did in the last class.

88
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,100
>> What was that?
>> Well,

89
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,680
when we did the game theory stuff.

90
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,360
Remember that?

91
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,080
>> Yes, so right,

92
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,440
so maximums over linear functions
comes up in game theory as well.

93
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,180
Yeah, it's a good point.

94
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,590
>> And there they end up
looking very piecewise linear.

95
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,920
>> Yep, and convex, right?

96
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,140
They open upwards to the top.

97
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,600
And that's because of the max and

98
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,640
the piece has linears because it's
a finite set of linear functions.
