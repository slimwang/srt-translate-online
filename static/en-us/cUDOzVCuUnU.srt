1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So here's how I chose to do it.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I first picked out the first pair,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and if there are 2 pairs, that should be the highest,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
because remember, the ranks are ordered from highest to lowest,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
so if I'm going through the ranks from left to right,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I should hit the highest one first.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And then to find if there's a low pair,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
what I've done is reverse the ranks

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and then look through those, so now I'm going from

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
lowest to highest, and I should find the lowest pair first.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Now if I found a pair, and I found a low pair,

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
which is not equal to the pair, then I want to return the two of them.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Otherwise I just return none.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So congratulations.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We've gone through the whole program.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We've come up with a solution,

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and now when we hit the Run button,

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
it prints out "tests pass," so we've done everything

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
that we promised to do, and it works okay.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But I'm still not confident because

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I know we've done some tests, but we haven't done exhaustive tests yet,

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
so I feel pretty good about it.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You should feel good about what we've done together.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Congratulations on that.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But don't feel like we're done yet.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We've still got to come up with more tests

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
to prove that we've got it right in every case,

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and in fact, I want to share with you a test that somebody pointed out to me

29
00:01:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that I hadn't thought of at all.
