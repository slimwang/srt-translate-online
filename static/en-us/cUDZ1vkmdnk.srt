1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,000
To convert age to age with months, we know we're

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,660
going to need to add some fraction to the age variable. Since

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,810
there are 12 months in a year, we know 12 will

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,680
be the denominator. Now, let's think carefully about age. For a

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,560
given year, someone who was born in March would be

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,480
older than someone born in September. So we need to subtract

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,900
the birth month from 12 to reflect this. This should make

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,370
sense, since someone born in March would be born on the

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,930
third month of the year. So our numerator here would

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,610
be seven. So for the 36 year old born in

11
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,610
March, their age would be 36.75. If the user was

12
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,590
born in September and was also 36, then the user's

13
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,410
age would be 36.25. So let's run this bit of

14
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,670
code and convert our age variable, measured in years, to

15
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,400
age with months. And it looks like I made a

16
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,880
mistake. I forgot to include my data frame for DOB month.

17
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,930
Now we're ready to go.
