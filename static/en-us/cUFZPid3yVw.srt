00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,506
So, now I want to make a key point here and we should have a smiley face. We

2
00:00:03,506 --> 00:00:07,114
haven't solved our problem but we're making progress. And making progress is

3
00:00:07,114 --> 00:00:10,192
really good. We should be happy that we're making progress. And the way to make

4
00:00:10,192 --> 00:00:13,642
progress is not to write lots of code. It's to write small bits of code to test

5
00:00:13,642 --> 00:00:17,214
them and to know what they do. We haven't solved the problem yet. We've got lots

6
00:00:17,214 --> 00:00:21,076
of simplifications and we've only solved one part of it. But because of our

7
00:00:21,076 --> 00:00:25,171
solution, well, once we implement next day correctly, we are a good part of the

8
00:00:25,171 --> 00:00:28,793
way there. So, let's keep that in mind and think about what we should do next.
