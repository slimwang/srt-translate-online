1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,204
To use the rational zero theorem, we first need to find all the factors of

2
00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:10,591
negative 164 and positive 1. Well, 1 is easy. We just have 1 and negative 1.

3
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:16,882
There are a few more for negative 164. We have 1, 2, 4, 41, 82, 164 and the

4
00:00:16,882 --> 00:00:22,279
negative versions of all of those numbers. Now that we have two sets of

5
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:25,503
factors, all we need to do is take one factor from this batch and divide it by

6
00:00:25,503 --> 00:00:30,338
one of the factors from over here. Now, since all the factors on this right,

7
00:00:30,338 --> 00:00:33,614
that we are going to be dividing by, are just 1 and negative 1, the only ratios

8
00:00:33,614 --> 00:00:38,661
you would end up with are all of the numbers over here. So, there we go, we

9
00:00:38,661 --> 00:00:42,682
have the list we were looking for. Even though this is still a lot of numbers,

10
00:00:42,682 --> 00:00:46,322
it's way fewer than the infinite number we were thinking about before, when we

11
00:00:46,322 --> 00:00:49,426
had no idea what the roots were.
