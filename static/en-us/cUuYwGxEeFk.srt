00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,900
Now it's worth noting by
using the JobScheduler API,

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,939
you're being a good Android citizen.

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:07,850
And the more good Android
citizens there are,

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,690
the greater the collective impact
you'll have on battery life.

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,510
Now what we've shown you is just a small
sample of what job scheduler supports.

6
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,900
There are way more options and
configurations that you an tailor for

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,400
your own jobs.

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,690
Now for
more details on how to use this API,

9
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,589
see the Android documentation
in the instructor notes.

10
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:27,130
Also be sure to check out the Google dev
bite on how to use the job scheduler.

11
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,600
You'll find the link in
the instruction notes as well.

12
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,860
All right, now it's time for
a little quiz.

13
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,890
What jobinfo.builder method
would you append to your job

14
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,560
to make sure it runs when
the device is plugged in?

15
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,170
Go ahead and
enter your answer right here.
