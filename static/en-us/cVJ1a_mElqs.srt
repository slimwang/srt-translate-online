00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:06,140
Our new circle, is centered at the point 20,0 here and it has this equation.

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,646
That's amazing thought if you got it correct. We know that for this blue

3
00:00:10,646 --> 00:00:16,090
circle, the radius still needs to be 50 units. This is why we still have 2500

4
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:21,150
on the right-hand side for our constant. The square root of this number is 50,

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,828
our radius. Notice that for this orange circle and for this blue circle, the y

6
00:00:26,828 --> 00:00:33,800
values never changed. We're at the same height for any point along our graph.

7
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,543
In other words, we only shifted the graph to the right. So, the only thing we

8
00:00:39,543 --> 00:00:44,257
really changed or manipulated were the x values. We moved all of our points 20

9
00:00:44,257 --> 00:00:49,994
units to the right. So, the x values all increase by 20. To compensate for this

10
00:00:49,994 --> 00:00:54,530
adjustment, we need to subtract 20 from all our x values to maintain the same

11
00:00:54,530 --> 00:01:01,586
radius. So, for circles if we subtract something from x we really shift it to

12
00:01:01,586 --> 00:01:07,499
the right that many units. So, subtracting 20 moves this circle 20 unit to the

13
00:01:07,499 --> 00:01:14,326
right. So, if we add 20, we'll actually move our circle 20 units to the left. I

14
00:01:14,326 --> 00:01:17,224
really recommend playing around with this equation to see how you can move a

15
00:01:17,224 --> 00:01:23,281
circle around on a graph. Maybe see if you can make it go up or down.
