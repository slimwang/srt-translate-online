00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,160
we can pick an appropriate
application structure.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,940
The main content that your app deals
in should be on the first screen and

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,940
it should offer navigation
to related actions.

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,740
Let's take a look at Simple Note and
reverse engineer what the entities are.

00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,410

of the app are the notes.

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,590
And with a click or two,
you can see the other entity tags.
