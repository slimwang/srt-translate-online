1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,170
So if you're thinking about joining an
accelerator, one of the downsides could

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:08,720
be the amount of equity that you
have to give up in return for

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,622
the money that you're getting.

4
00:00:09,622 --> 00:00:15,660
Most accelerators will take a fairly
significant piece of equity

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,400
in return for all of the mentorship and
the guidance that they provide.

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,390
And what you have to ask yourself is,

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,480
do you already have that network that's
going to provide you all that feedback?

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,130
Or are you interested in
having the accelerator do it?

9
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,870
Because there is a cost
associated with it.

10
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,530
Otherwise, when you look
at an accelerator and

11
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:37,540
you evaluate it, you really need to
evaluate the accelerator based on that

12
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,700
group of people that's going to help
you, and whether you think that they're

13
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,420
going to help you solve the specific
problem you're trying to solve.
