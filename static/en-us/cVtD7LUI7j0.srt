00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,040
Let's take a second to think about the past couple of quizzes you've done. We

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,400
saw that a vertical line, reflected in the line y equals x, becomes a

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,630
horizontal line. Now, just like we have the vertical line test to determine if

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,534
graphs are functions, remember, it says that a given curve is a function if it

5
00:00:16,534 --> 00:00:23,446
only crosses a vertical line at one point for each value of x in the domain. We

6
00:00:23,446 --> 00:00:27,042
can perform another test on the graph to figure out if its reflection in the

7
00:00:27,042 --> 00:00:32,029
line, y equals x would be a function. That would mean that it has an inverse.

8
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:36,159
Which of these statements do you think is true, then? A function has an inverse

9
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:41,011
if no horizontal line passes through its graph at more than one point. A

10
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:44,224
function has an inverse if no vertical line passes through its graph at more

11
00:00:44,224 --> 00:00:48,940
than one point. A function has an inverse if all horizontal lines pass through

12
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:54,665
its graph at more than one point. Or, a function has an inverse if the line, y

13
00:00:54,665 --> 00:00:59,176
equals x, passes through its graph at more than one point. Think back to the

14
00:00:59,176 --> 00:01:03,503
vertical line test, and how functions are related to their inverses.
