1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So now I want to ask you a question.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So given this quality function Q,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and assuming that our utility function

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
is the log function,

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
since we saw that for some values of this state

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
the best action--

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
the action with the highest quality is 'hold'

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and other values is 'gamble,'

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
there must be a point at which there is a crossover--

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
where the two values are approximately equal.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So what I want you to tell me is:

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
to the nearest million, what is that crossover point C?

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That value of state--

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
that value of the amount of money that I currently have

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
to say that I'm indifferent between the 2--

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
that if I have C dollars, then my quality for gambling

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
is the same or approximately the same

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
as my value for holding.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What value of C to the nearest million is that true of?

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And just to make it easier for those who can't divide by e in your head,

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
we'll use the log10 logarithms rather than the natural logarithms

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
so that the log10 logarithm of a million is 6.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Tell me what the crossover point is to the nearest million.
