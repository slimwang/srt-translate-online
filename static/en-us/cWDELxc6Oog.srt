1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,670
For numbers, the answer is
actually going to be total order.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,050
If the two numbers are different,

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,000
then one is definitely going to
be greater than the other.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,860
Or, in this case,

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,790
actually we're talking about definitely
going to be less than the other.

6
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,149
We don't have partial orders when
you just look at real numbers and

7
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:20,060
the relation is less than because
you take any two Numbers.

8
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,710
As I said, if they're different, than
one is definitely less than the other.

9
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,230
So you'll be able to order them.

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,630
When you can order any
pair of these numbers,

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,880
that means you get a total order.
