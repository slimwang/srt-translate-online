00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:01,680
Hi, I'm Julia.

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:02,770
>> And, I'm James.

3
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:06,379
>> We'll be your instructors for
this introductory course on JavaScript.

4
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:09,570
JavaScript is a programming
language created for the web.

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,990
If you're familiar with using HTML and
CSS to create webpages, JavaScript is

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,910
the final piece that you'll need to
really make your websites come to life.

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,149
>> Back in 1995, when Brandan Eich
created a JavaScript, it was created to

8
00:00:22,149 --> 00:00:26,299
make it easier to add interactive and
dynamic elements to websites.

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,050
But today, JavaScript is used for
all sorts of applications.

10
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,960
>> From programming a robot with 
Arduino to writing a game

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,170
script in Unity.

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,490
In fact, even some code editors
were built with JavaScript.

13
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:41,390
The point is, the opportunities
with JavaScript are endless.

14
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:42,160
>> In this course,

15
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,399
you'll learn about the foundations of
the JavaScript programming language.

16
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:46,100
And along the way,

17
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,170
you'll familiarize yourself with the
tools used by JavaScript programmers.

18
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,850
Finally, we want to make sure you get
enough practice with the basics of

19
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:53,441
the language.

20
00:00:53,441 --> 00:00:56,837
So between each section, you'll have
access to the problem sets that

21
00:00:56,837 --> 00:00:59,450
reinforce the topics we just learned.

22
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:00,609
>> Before we get started,

23
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:03,746
let's take a quick detour to talk
a little bit about JavaScript's history.
