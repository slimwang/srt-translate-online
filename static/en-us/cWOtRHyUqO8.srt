1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,526
That was not an easy problem. Correct answer is 2ab times a minus 6b times a

2
00:00:05,526 --> 00:00:11,036
minus 8b. If you got it right, well done. If you didn't get it right, don't

3
00:00:11,036 --> 00:00:15,456
worry. We're going to go through it right now. Remember the first thing that you

4
00:00:15,456 --> 00:00:20,175
always want to do when factoring a trinomial is to look for the GCF. And that is

5
00:00:20,175 --> 00:00:24,900
the most common mistake that students make, is they forget to factor out the

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,498
GCF. If you don't factor out the GCF first, you'll make your life a lot more

7
00:00:29,498 --> 00:00:34,632
difficult. Here, when I look at these 3 terms, first of all I noticed that all 3

8
00:00:34,632 --> 00:00:39,432
of the numbers are even, and 2 is the largest number so 2 is going to part of

9
00:00:39,432 --> 00:00:47,129
our GCF. If I look at the variables I have an a cubed, an a squared, and an a,

10
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:55,004
so the lowest power of a is to the first. I have a b, b squared and b cube to

11
00:00:55,004 --> 00:01:02,299
the lowest power of b is just b. When I factor out the GCF of 2ab from a

12
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:10,143
polynomial, what I am left with? 2ab times a squared is meant 2a cube b. 2ab

13
00:01:10,143 --> 00:01:17,829
times minus 14ab, 2ab times negative 14ab, gives me negative 28 a squared, b

14
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:27,378
squared. And 2 times 48 gives me 96. A, I need a b squared. So after I factor

15
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:34,734
out the GCF of 2ab, I'm left with a squared minus 14ab plus 48b squared. Now I

16
00:01:34,734 --> 00:01:41,151
need to factor this polynomial. For this polynomial, since the coefficient of

17
00:01:41,151 --> 00:01:48,142
the a squared term is 1, I need the factors of 48 that add up to negative 14.

18
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:52,502
Since this is a positive number and this is a negative number, I know that both

19
00:01:52,502 --> 00:01:56,520
of my factors are going to be negative. A negative times a negative is a

20
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,900
positive and a negative plus a negative gives me a negative. When I think of the

21
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,917
number 48, there are several ways to factor the number. The 2 factors of

22
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:12,046
positive 48 that add up negative 14 is negative 6 times negative 8. So I can

23
00:02:12,046 --> 00:02:18,640
rewrite negative 14ab as negative 6ab minus 8ab. Now that I have 4 terms, I can

24
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,132
factor by grouping. Don't forget to carry down your GCF. Now I need to look at

25
00:02:24,132 --> 00:02:29,772
the GCF of a squared and negative 6ab. Which is simply a. When I factor an a

26
00:02:29,772 --> 00:02:35,961
out, I'm left with a minus 6b. Now I need to factor out the GCF of the second

27
00:02:35,961 --> 00:02:39,694
two terms. I know I want my first term to be positive and my second to be

28
00:02:39,694 --> 00:02:45,336
negative. So I know I need to factor out a negative. The GCF of 8ab and 48b

29
00:02:45,336 --> 00:02:51,838
squared is going to be 8b. What do I need to multiply 8b by? What do I need to

30
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:57,338
multiply negative 8b by to get negative 8ab? Just a. And what do I need to

31
00:02:57,338 --> 00:03:04,580
multiply negative 8b by to get positive 48b squared? Negative 6b. Now the last

32
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:10,439
step for factoring by grouping here is to pull out the new GCF which is a minus

33
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:16,281
6b. And what do I have left over? A minus 8b, that's how we got the answer. I

34
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:20,967
know these problems aren't easy, but factoring is a key skill for the whole rest

35
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:25,496
of the course. So it's very important that you're able to factor any polynomial

36
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:30,084
to finish this course. So don't get discouraged, it takes a lot of practice.

37
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:34,387
Keep up the good work. And don't worry, you will master factoring. Factoring is

38
00:03:34,387 --> 00:03:38,664
a key concept for the rest of this course. We will be using factoring to solve

39
00:03:38,664 --> 00:03:42,420
many additional problems throughout the rest of the course. So mastering

40
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:47,359
factoring skill is extremely important. I know it's not easy, but the more you

41
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:50,933
practice, the better you'll get. And you will master factoring.
