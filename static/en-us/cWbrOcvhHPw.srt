We want to find factors of a and c that add up to b, or 1 in this case. 2 times

00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:10,928
negative 15 is negative 30. And our positive 1 goes in the bottom. Here are the

3
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:15,601
factor pairs for negative 30. Let the other side be the first factor negative in

4
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:21,150
each pair. This factor pair adds up to 1, so I write negative 5 and 6. I rewrite

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,570
the positive 1x using negative 5 and 6 as coefficients for x. We use factoring

6
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,230
by grouping to remove an x and a positive 3 from the first group of terms and

7
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:36,032
the second group of terms. This leaves us with our factored form x plus 3 times

8
00:00:36,032 --> 00:00:40,648
2x minus 5. Great job if you found the factor paired and even better if you got

9
00:00:40,648 --> 00:00:41,773
to the factor form.
