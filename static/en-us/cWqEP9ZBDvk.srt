1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,870
To start off I'm calling gulp serve, and
I'm letting that run in the background.

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,360
So here's my promise wrapper inside get.

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,960
Notice that I'm returning the promise,
and

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,100
I'm resolving when
the request status is 200.

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:18,650
I'm passing the response to resolve so
that then gets the response as well.

6
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,280
I'm rejecting on any error whether
that's not a status of 200 or

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,200
something else, and
the rest of it looks good.

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,040
I didn't have to change anything else.

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,160
Down here in the web
components ready listener,

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,830
I am actually doing
something to the page.

11
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,900
Once I get the data, I add the search
header, and if something goes wrong,

12
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,850
I add a search header of unknown and
then console that log error.

13
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,010
Okay, let's see what happens.

14
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,360
So it looks like this query works
because you can see earth-like

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,060
planets on the page.

16
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,110
But let me see what happens
when I mess up that URL.

17
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,590
I'll go ahead and
just delete a character.

18
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,450
Let's see what happens.

19
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,040
Okay, that looks good.

20
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,220
I see unknown as the query and
I see an error here in the console.

21
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,920
I can open it up and see that
something went wrong with the XHR.

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,010
Cool, I want to show you
one more thing though.

23
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:15,080
Inside the addSearchHeader there is
this call to JSON.parse of the response.

24
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,820
If you think about it, parsing a JSON
really has nothing to do with adding

25
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,040
a search header, so in the next quiz
you'll be removing this all together and

26
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,790
putting it inside a different
method where it does belong.
