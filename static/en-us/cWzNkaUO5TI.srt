00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,359
In this lesson,

2
00:00:01,359 --> 00:00:05,250
we're going to discuss the details of
how to build native Android wear apps.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,090
These can do so
much more than just notifications, and

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,260
you have a full Android
implementation to help you out here.

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,520
Having Android underneath means that
most of your Android concepts that

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,110
you're familiar with apply here too.

7
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,500
So you'll be reusing a lot
of your existing knowledge.

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,270
So to build an Android Wear app,

9
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,810
we're going to discuss how these apps
are built, how wearables communicate

10
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,270
with the outside world, how to
create user interfaces for them, and

11
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,750
how to implement useful functionality
with them, such as sensor processing.
