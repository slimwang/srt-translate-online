00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:03,750
Hi, my name is Jimmy,
I'm a data analyst at Udacity.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,030
>> Hi, my name's Charlie.

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:09,180
And I'm a course manager on
the Data Analyst Nanodegree Udacity.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,674
>> So today I'm going to be interviewing
Charlie just going through general

5
00:00:12,674 --> 00:00:16,521
questions that are generally asked in
data science or data analyst interviews.

6
00:00:16,521 --> 00:00:18,120
And, yeah, here we go.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,260
So Charlie, would you tell me about
the project that you are particularly

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,310
proud of that you've
worked on in the past?

9
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:25,250
>> Sure.

10
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:30,530
One of my favorite
projects was the project

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:36,370
that I did as part of the Data Analyst
Nanodegree about the New York Subway.

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:42,560
So we had some New York Subway
data from the MTA in New York,

13
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:48,620
and we had some weather data
collected relating to those places.

14
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:54,250
And I was looking at
the effect of weather and

15
00:00:54,250 --> 00:01:00,110
other factors on the number of
riders on the New York Subway.

16
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,940
It was great to get my hands
on some real world data.

17
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,590
>> So what were some of
the cool things that you found?

18
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:11,210
>> I found, I guess it wasn't
surprising in the end, but

19
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:17,670
I enjoyed investigating that one of the
most important factors was the station.

20
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,690
So you might not think of it at first,
you think, maybe the weather makes

21
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:26,290
the biggest difference, but really it's
whether you're in Central Station or

22
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,570
somewhere else that makes
a really big difference.

23
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:32,888
I found also that some confusing
effects of the weather.

24
00:01:32,888 --> 00:01:37,170
So, you might,
depending on how you did your analysis,

25
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,220
if you did like just a statistical
test on rainy days on not rainy days.

26
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,950
I found that in that case it
looked as though rain was

27
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:51,232
causing a change or
related to a change in the ridership.

28
00:01:51,232 --> 00:01:55,911
But when it came down to it, and
I used regression to predict ridership,

29
00:01:55,911 --> 00:01:59,330
I found that that really
wasn't a big factor.

30
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:03,930
And I thought that was good because I
realized that I was controlling for so

31
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,630
much more when I was
doing the regression,

32
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,580
regression felt like
the right tool to use.

33
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,380
>> What type of regression did you use?

34
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,210
>> It was just a linear regression but

35
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,510
I did some transformations
on some of the variables,

36
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:20,110
I encoded all the stations and
some other stuff as dummy variables.

37
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,320
>> Of course, of course.

38
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,880
I say, how many variables do you have?

39
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,638
>> There's-
>> Approximately.

40
00:02:26,638 --> 00:02:28,370
>> Yeah, there's a few hundred.

41
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,050
>> A few hundred?

42
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,960
>> Because of all the units, so-
>> Okay.

43
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,205
>> With all the stations.

44
00:02:32,205 --> 00:02:32,750
>> Mm-hm.

45
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,520
>> Like there's a few hundred,
300 or so stations.

46
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,220
>> I see.

47
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,470
>> So, but apart from that if

48
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:45,075
you take things as groups they're
only a handful of things I was using.

49
00:02:45,075 --> 00:02:49,985
>> I see, so how do you do with
all the large number of variables?

50
00:02:49,985 --> 00:02:56,295
>> I guess it wasn't too bad with that,
it wasn't too big.

51
00:02:56,295 --> 00:02:58,335
>> Okay.
>> On my case like they were dummy

52
00:02:58,335 --> 00:03:05,870
variables, I had a few hundred
thousand records, not millions.

53
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,870
So everything was kind of manageable.

54
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,580
>> But do you have any
problems with overfitting?

55
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:18,550
>> I think I did when I did certain
things, so I kind of corrected that.

56
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:24,731
One of the things I tried was
to fit things with the station,

57
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:29,315
and the day of the week,
and the time of day.

58
00:03:29,315 --> 00:03:35,579
And if you do all of those and
if you were to kind of create,

59
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:38,780
I've forgotten the word.

60
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,873
Where you, [SOUND] sorry.

61
00:03:42,873 --> 00:03:43,480
>> It's okay.

62
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,840
>> Like features where that includes
all of them at the same time,

63
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,550
I've forgotten the technical word.

64
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,692
And then, that would be really
overfitting because really

65
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:55,160
you're fitting to
a very few data points.

66
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,820
>> Yeah, yeah.

67
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:00,390
>> But yeah, if you kind of consider
them separately, then it's okay.

68
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:05,220
And I actually ended up not using
just the day of the week to check,

69
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,646
but whether it was a weekday, or not.

70
00:04:07,646 --> 00:04:08,463
>> I see, so yeah, so

71
00:04:08,463 --> 00:04:11,800
you took the subset of the features that
you thought were the most important.

72
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,530
>> Yeah.

73
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:13,820
>> Okay, that's excellent.
