1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,600
You've completed these three steps for
your preferences, so

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,860
what about step four?

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,028
And also what exactly is
a preference summary?

4
00:00:08,028 --> 00:00:10,810
There's one annoying thing that
you might have noticed about our

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,775
new shaped color preference.

6
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:15,255
When you change the color
in the settings,

7
00:00:15,255 --> 00:00:18,875
it's a little hard here to see
what the current color is.

8
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:21,195
Now for the check box setting, here,

9
00:00:21,195 --> 00:00:25,734
when we change the check box says we
can actually see what that means.

10
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:29,614
For example, it's checked on so
it's shown, checked off so it's hidden.

11
00:00:29,614 --> 00:00:33,100
This smaller gray text here is
known as the preference summary.

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,880
And it's meant to contain more info
about what the preference is for or

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,640
its current value.

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,980
You can set the preference summary to
some static text, but what I want to do

15
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:45,669
is have the preference summary
show us what our current color is.

16
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,539
To do that,

17
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:50,359
I'll need to have the settings fragment
update the summary programmatically.

18
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:53,030
This is done in a way that's
very similar to how we load

19
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,219
the preferences in visualizer activity.

20
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:57,589
I'm going to head over
the settings fragment now.

21
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,460
I'll start by getting
a reference to sharedPreferences

22
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,109
in the onCreatePreferences function.

23
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:06,069
Here's my reference to sharedPreferences
and notice that I'm using

24
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:09,289
the PreferenceScreen to get my
reference to sharedPreferences.

25
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,605
I also get a reference to
the PreferenceScreen so

26
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:14,885
that I can get a count of
the total number of preferences.

27
00:01:14,885 --> 00:01:18,665
Next, I'm going to iterate through
all of my SharedPreferences.

28
00:01:18,665 --> 00:01:22,315
And I do that by calling getPreference
on the Preference screen and

29
00:01:22,314 --> 00:01:24,015
passing in an index.

30
00:01:24,015 --> 00:01:28,210
I'm going to create a helper method
now called setPreferenceSummary.

31
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:32,069
And this method is going to take in
a Preference and a String value.

32
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:35,779
The purpose of this method is to
set the correct preference summary.

33
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,430
Setting the correct summary for a list
preference is a little bit tricky.

34
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,310
We can't just use the key or
the value string.

35
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,519
Remember, these words right here
are the list preference labels and

36
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:48,099
they're what's shown in the UI.

37
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:52,049
The value and the key are both behind
the scenes and the values are associated

38
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,789
with these labels while the key is
associated with the entire preference.

39
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,609
In the summary,
we want to display the current label.

40
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:00,849
Because if we make a localized
version of the app,

41
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:03,359
the label will be translated but
the value will not.

42
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,938
So the first thing I want to do in my
set perfect summary of that it is check

43
00:02:07,938 --> 00:02:11,444
if the preference is
an instance of ListPreference.

44
00:02:11,444 --> 00:02:12,798
If it is, I'm going to cast it,

45
00:02:12,798 --> 00:02:16,330
then I'm going to find the index of the
current preference which was selected.

46
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,776
And I'm doing that here using
the findIndexOfValue, and

47
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,960
then passing in the value.

48
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,200
I'll then check if the index is valid,
and

49
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:28,250
if it is, I'm going to use this
setSummary method for my listPreference.

50
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,030
And what I'll pass in is,

51
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm taking the listPreference here,
I'm getting all of the labels, and

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,689
I'm indexing into that array using the
listPreference index that I got up here.

53
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:43,780
So this is getting the label that
is associated with this value.

54
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,900
Okay, now going back up here to my for

55
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,280
loop which again,
is in the onCreatePreferences menu.

56
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,390
I'm going to take this preference, and
check if it's a CheckBoxPreference.

57
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:58,232
And if it's not a CheckBoxPreference,
what I'm going to do is I'm going to get

58
00:02:58,233 --> 00:03:02,509
the value by taking my sharedPreferences
object and using getString with the key.

59
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:04,490
And I'm going to pass that value and

60
00:03:04,491 --> 00:03:08,990
those sharedPreferences to my
setPreferenceSummary method.

61
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:12,540
Note that I am intentionally excluding
the CheckBoxPreference here,

62
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:15,929
because I changed the CheckBoxSummary
by using the on summary and

63
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,920
off summary XML attribute.

64
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:21,353
Also, this called a getString would
cause a runtime error, because for

65
00:03:21,354 --> 00:03:24,420
CheckBoxPreferences, the value
type is a Boolean.

66
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:27,417
Okay, so I'm programmatically
setting my preferences on load, so

67
00:03:27,418 --> 00:03:29,370
let's go ahead and run the app.

68
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,740
And I can see here that
it has a summary now.

69
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,790
But if I change this preference,
it's not updating the summary.

70
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:40,159
For that, I'm going to need to use
a OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener.

71
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,939
And this is just like in
my visualizer activity.

72
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:44,683
So going to the top of
my settings fragment,

73
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:47,829
I'm going to implement
OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener.

74
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:51,440
And it is of course unhappy because
I haven't implemented the associated

75
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,349
method which is
OnSharedPreferenceChange, so

76
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:55,469
let's do that.

77
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:58,090
So here's the OnSharedPreferenceChange
method, so

78
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,140
essentially what I'm doing here is I'm
finding the preference by its key, and

79
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:06,269
if that preference isn't null and it's
not an instanceof CheckBoxPreference,

80
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,300
then I'm getting the value and
I'm calling setPreferenceSummary.

81
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,200
Again, that is almost identical
to what I'm doing here.

82
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:14,189
Now that my
OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener is

83
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:17,610
set up, I need to actually register and
unregister it.

84
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:21,939
And I'll do that in the appropriate
place which is onCreate and onDestroy.

85
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:24,139
So I'm going to scroll
down to the bottom, and

86
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,430
I'm going to override onCreate.

87
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,352
And in onCreate,
I'm going to get my PreferenceScreen,

88
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:33,084
getSharedPreferences and
register the PreferenceChangeListener,

89
00:04:33,084 --> 00:04:34,212
which again is this.

90
00:04:34,213 --> 00:04:38,782
Because this up here is the class that
has the onSharedPreferenceChangeListener

91
00:04:38,781 --> 00:04:40,169
implemented.

92
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,530
And I'm going to unregister
it by overriding onDestroy.

93
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,670
And here I'm just unregistering
the listener as well.

94
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,040
Okay, let's run the code to see if
the summaries are being updated.

95
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,260
Now I'm going to try updating
the summary to blue, and

96
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:55,480
I see that the summary is updated.

97
00:04:56,509 --> 00:04:56,800
Yes.
