1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,230
Okay, so for the first one,
this part right here,

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,750
which is the declaration,
looks fine to me.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,260
The initialization is
a little bit funky, why?

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,060
Well, we use quotes, and

5
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,100
if you remember from the lesson, quotes
specifically have to do with strings.

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,090
And it really makes our computer
see this text as a string.

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:17,700
Because of that,

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,860
the computer is going to complain about
there being a mismatch between this

9
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,200
type, integer, and
this value here which is a string.

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,120
Okay so
this one definitely has a problem, so

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,920
i'm going to put a check in it.

12
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,730
Okay let's look at this next one.

13
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,380
The declaration here looks fine.

14
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,490
And ten without any
quotes is an integer, so

15
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,440
this one actually looks perfectly okay.

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,210
One note that I would make is
when we write variables we

17
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,140
tend to use camel case.

18
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,990
You can see that we're using
camel case right here.

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,910
So technically this is okay, but

20
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,730
it doesn't really follow
programming conventions.

21
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,300
To follow programming conventions,
you would change that to a capital E.

22
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,170
But I'm not going to
put a check next to it.

23
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,830
All right so
let's look at the third one.

24
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,140
Now the biggest difference
you'll notice between these two,

25
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,070
is that there's no space here.

26
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,570
Spaces, it turns out,
are critically important.

27
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,310
Without the space, the computer can't
know that you're actually trying to

28
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,830
declare a variable here.

29
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,340
In fact, what the computer will
interpret this as is that you have

30
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:12,730
a variable called intunreadEmails which
you haven't given any sort of data type.

31
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,350
Okay, so
this one definitely has an error.

32
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,550
All right, and that's it.

33
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:19,220
Go ahead and try practicing these
skills with the next few problems.
