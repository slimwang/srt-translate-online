1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,836
Do you remember what you were wearing the day you got your driver's license? Do

2
00:00:03,836 --> 00:00:08,610
you remember the first place you drove to or who was in the car with you? Do

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:14,810
you remember the price of gas or was it a warm day, a cold day, sunny, rainy?

4
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,536
All of these things that you can remember are about the day you got your

5
00:00:17,536 --> 00:00:22,818
driver's license constitute what we call episodic memory. Now, episodic memory

6
00:00:22,818 --> 00:00:27,340
is memory for autobiograhical events. Here, we're looking at information

7
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:33,036
remember that is both temporal as well as contextual. Meaning when and where

8
00:00:33,036 --> 00:00:37,561
the even occurred. Another type of memory that was related to but different

9
00:00:37,561 --> 00:00:42,618
from episodic memories are semantic memories. Semantic are memories about

10
00:00:42,618 --> 00:00:47,517
general fact or general knowledge. So, for example, an episodic memory might be

11
00:00:47,517 --> 00:00:51,309
remembering your sixteenth birthday party. The people who were there and your

12
00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:55,368
favorite song that was playing on the radio. Semantic memories can be things

13
00:00:55,368 --> 00:00:58,997
such as general knowledge, like things you've learned in school. Such as E

14
00:00:58,997 --> 00:01:02,776
equals MC squared. But we're also going to talk about a different type of

15
00:01:02,776 --> 00:01:06,000
memory and that's declarative memory. And we're going to go back to Lauren for

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,720
that.
