1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,355
Okay.

2
00:00:00,357 --> 00:00:04,344
This is a great review of fractions. But what else can we do with fractions?

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,772
With the counting numbers, we can add, subtract, multiply and divide. We can do

4
00:00:08,784 --> 00:00:12,898
the same operations with fractions. You might be asking yourself, what's an

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,176
operation. An operation is just something that takes input values and produces

6
00:00:17,188 --> 00:00:21,774
an output value. Like addition, we could have 2 plus 3. 2 and 3 are the inputs,

7
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:26,318
and I get 5 as the output. Or, I could have 4 times 7. 4 and 7 are my inputs,

8
00:00:26,423 --> 00:00:30,941
and I get 28 as the output. An operation just produces a new value. For now,

9
00:00:31,046 --> 00:00:35,862
we're going to continue working with fractions and look at multiplication. But

10
00:00:35,874 --> 00:00:39,324
we're going to return to our chocolate bars. Here's my one chocolate bar. This

11
00:00:39,336 --> 00:00:42,566
time, I'm going to split up my chocolate bar into pieces. I'm going to find a

12
00:00:42,578 --> 00:00:46,373
fraction of a fraction. So what is 1 3rd of one half of the chocolate bar? Let's

13
00:00:46,385 --> 00:00:49,984
find out. Here's a drawing of a chocolate bar. And now first, I'm going to split

14
00:00:49,996 --> 00:00:55,102
it in half. So I started with 1 bar and now I have half a bar. I want to find 1

15
00:00:54,858 --> 00:00:59,710
3rd of that oine half. So, I need to take this half of a chocolate bar and split

16
00:00:59,722 --> 00:01:04,524
it up into thirds, or three equal pieces. I've split my half into thirds now.

17
00:01:04,638 --> 00:01:09,671
And now I just need 1 3rd of the one half. So this piece right here represents 1

18
00:01:09,427 --> 00:01:14,728
3rd of my one-half. So, I found 1 3rd of one half. It's this shape piece. But,

19
00:01:14,832 --> 00:01:19,709
I'm wondering, what fraction is this piece compared to the original candy bar? I

20
00:01:19,721 --> 00:01:24,355
can split up my original candy bar into the same size pieces as this one. That

21
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:28,825
will let me see what fraction is this of my candy bar. So visually I can see

22
00:01:28,837 --> 00:01:33,548
that this piece is 1 6ths of my. My candy bar. So let's pair this with some

23
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,284
math. 1 3rd of one half has to be equal to 1 6th but I need to figure out what

24
00:01:37,296 --> 00:01:41,330
did I do to these two fractions. How did I combine them to get 1 6ths? Let's

25
00:01:41,342 --> 00:01:43,154
answer this question with a quiz.
