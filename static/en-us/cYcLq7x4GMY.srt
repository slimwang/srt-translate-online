00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,300
Suppose you wrote an application called chocolate

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,070
chooser, that implements the chocolate back in

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,620
API using endpoints. The app ID for

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,490
chocolate chooser is choc-appID, the client ID

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,149
is 123choc. Now let's suppose someone else

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,910
writes an application called, let's say, devastating

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,170
desserts that uses JavaScript to access the

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,791
chocolate API. The app ID is dev-desserts, and

9
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:32,140
the client ID is 123devdes. And this devastating

10
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,580
desserts application is all about the UI, so

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,150
it doesn't have any back end API. So

12
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,700
now let's think about the API definition for

13
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,890
chocolate API in the chocolate chooser application. So

14
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,770
here we've got the API definition. The name

15
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,480
is chocolate API version V1. The scopes is

16
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,990
email. This basically mean, that we're going to be

17
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:56,000
using the user's email. It's up to you to tell us what would

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,200
the client ID be here. And go ahead and just enter a specific value.
