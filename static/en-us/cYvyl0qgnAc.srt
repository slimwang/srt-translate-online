Great. Now that we've got our data loaded, we're at the point where we can

2
00:00:03,244 --> 00:00:08,321
start playing some sounds. [SOUND]. Let's take a look at our skeleton code for

3
00:00:08,321 --> 00:00:12,845
this. We have a play sound method, that takes a path to the sound effect that

4
00:00:12,845 --> 00:00:23,038
you want to play. As well as an object containing all the settings. For our

5
00:00:23,038 --> 00:00:27,322
purposes, lets say that the setting's dictionary contains a bullion looping for

6
00:00:27,322 --> 00:00:31,354
checking whether we want to loop an effect, and volume to set our initial gain

7
00:00:31,354 --> 00:00:38,016
at. What we want you to do, is to create a source to play this sound. Connect

8
00:00:38,016 --> 00:00:42,830
it to our main node, and then start playing it. Now there will be a bunch of

9
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:46,240
little things that you're going to have to keep track of here. Is the sound

10
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,920
manager enabled? Is the sound loaded? Or are we trying to play a null sound?

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,235
Don't worry, we're going to be giving you feedback as you submit your code, and

12
00:00:55,235 --> 00:00:58,920
which possibilities you haven't taken into account yet.
