1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,188
Now let's see if this works.

2
00:00:02,188 --> 00:00:05,200
Instead of building a server I've
created a simple web page we can

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,020
use to send the post request.

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,580
You'll just need two things
I mentioned along the way.

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,340
Your server API key which you
generated in the API console,

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,890
this is your authorization key and
it is how Google servers know that

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,030
you are who you claim to be, and that it
is okay to send a message to your app.

8
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,620
And to the registration ID or

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,620
token that you logged in
registration intend service.

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:30,100
Now, copy both of these values into the
web page linked below, click Send, and

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,560
see the magic.

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,530
If you followed all instructions
correctly you should receive a weather

13
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,610
alert on your device at this point.

14
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,440
Copy that alert message here to
let us know you've succeeded.
