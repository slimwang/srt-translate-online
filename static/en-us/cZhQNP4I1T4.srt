00:00:00,295 --> 00:00:06,220
So this exercise that we've gone through with the clock radio, really is a,

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:11,160
an example of a process which you could use to do say chart modeling. And

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,770
here are the step that we went through. We prepared a use cases to start with of

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,590
typical uses of the clock radio. We determined the external percepts, that is,

5
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,490
what the user can see or hear or feel, with respect to the device.

6
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,120
We modeled those percepts with states, which may be corresponding to

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,630
currently executing state machines. We determined the external controls and

8
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:40,490
the stimuli or actions or user actions that could occur. In doing so,

9
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:46,100
we might model with additional states and, or add in additional transitions or

10
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,960
events. Then we began to consider the responses that the system have and

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,780
we did this with a table in which we listed. The various events and

12
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,520
the responses of the systems to those events. We added in some external

13
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:06,110
internal states or state machines to handle the timing situation.

14
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:13,040
We provided coordination mechanisms including the guarded transitions and

15
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,628
new internal events. And added any additional actions and

16
00:01:17,628 --> 00:01:23,354
activities that the clock radio is required to do in order to implement, or,

17
00:01:23,354 --> 00:01:27,285
or implement these particular responses, and

18
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:30,890
then we, we validated the resultant a state chart
