00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,950
By this point in your web dev education,

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:06,830
you already know aboutt HTTP
verbs like get and post.

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,860
And sending requests to web servers.

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,410
If not, check out the link
in the instructor notes.

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,090
Likely you've done that
from your own code and

6
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:16,180
you've run web services that accept and
handle these requests.

7
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,890
And you also know about port numbers
which let servers on the internet

8
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,440
distinguish one service like HTTP and
port 80.

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,230
From another one like SSH and port 22.

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:33,480
So what happens if on your Linux
machine you run this command,

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:40,376
printf HEAD / HTTP/1.1\r\n Host:
en.wikipedia.org \r\n\r\n.

12
00:00:40,376 --> 00:00:46,020
Pipe to nc en.wikipedia.org port 80.

13
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,680
Describe the output of this
command in your own words.

14
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,060
What do you think is happening?

15
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,050
By the way, don't retype this,
copy it from the instructor notes.
