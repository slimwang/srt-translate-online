00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,130
We can use this same approach to simplify radicals that contain variables.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,611
We'll want to simplify these numbers first and pull anything out, or any

3
00:00:07,611 --> 00:00:11,848
factors out that we can. Remember since we have square roots here, we can only

4
00:00:11,848 --> 00:00:16,100
pull out factors that appear twice. Once we have like radicals, we can add them

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,953
together. So what do you think for this one, what would be the answer?
