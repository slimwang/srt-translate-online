1
00:00:00,298 --> 00:00:02,718
Remember how I said loops could
be used to count to a million?

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,519
Well, we're not going to do that.

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:10,301
We're going to count to 10,000 instead,
starting with x equals 1.

4
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:13,679
Hey look, we're already done,
1 mississippi!

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,589
We're on our way to 10,000 already.

6
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:19,980
Just so you know,
counting to 10,000 is a tough task, and

7
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:24,150
like many tough tasks,
it's good to work on them incrementally.

8
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,354
Let's increase the value of x by 1.

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,460
This is awesome.

10
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,219
See, we're making progress.

11
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:34,359
In no time,
we'll be all the way to 10,000.

12
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:37,509
Yay, look how far you've gotten.

13
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:38,519
Okay, let's keep going.

14
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,490
Hey, wait a minute!

15
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:45,140
This is all the same code.

16
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,010
So repeating the same code over and
over and

17
00:00:48,011 --> 00:00:52,231
over again is definitely not going
to be the best option for us,

18
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:56,799
if we want to print out all
the numbers between 1 and 10,000.

19
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:59,229
There has to be a better way.

20
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:00,619
And you know what?

21
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:03,942
There is a better way, loops.

22
00:01:03,942 --> 00:01:06,611
Using a loop will let you
iterate over values and

23
00:01:06,611 --> 00:01:09,119
repeatedly run a block of code.

24
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,189
In this case,
the block of code you want to repeat, is

25
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:16,555
incrementing the value of x and using
console.log to print out the message.

26
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:22,430
The only piece you really need to
start your loop is right here but

27
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,460
we'll need to tweak it a bit.

28
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,069
Now, this code shows x
starting at the value of 1,

29
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:33,000
and then it prints out the value of
x and finally, x is incremented.

30
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,353
And because we want to do these two
steps all the way until we reach 10,000,

31
00:01:39,352 --> 00:01:41,059
we'll wrap that code in a loop.

32
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:46,700
This particular type of loop
is called a while loop.

33
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,282
As long as this condition is true,

34
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:54,371
the loop will print out the number and
increment the value of x by 1.

35
00:01:54,371 --> 00:01:57,370
And then it will restart if
the condition at the top of the loop is

36
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,629
still true.

37
00:01:58,629 --> 00:02:04,469
So congratulations, in just five lines
of code you can count to 10,000 and

38
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:06,349
pretty much any number
you'd like to count to.
