1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
All right, this is where it actually gets really interesting and a little bit whacky.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We just showed that if you a had a solution to SAT, you could use it to solve 3 colorability

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and maybe that's not so weird because 3 colorability is about finding

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
some kind of a satisfying coloring and so we have the satisfying formula--not so weird.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Now, what we're going to do is the other direction to show that 3 colorability is NP hard.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We know it's an NP, but is it NP hard. If it's NP hard, it must be NP complete because it's an NP.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But to show that it's NP hard that means we have to take some NP hard problem

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and solve it by way of 3 colorability.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That means we have to be able to take a satisfiability formula, somehow express it as a

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
graph coloring problem, and if we can do that, that means a solution to the graph coloring problem

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
resolves satisfiability and therefore, anything in NP.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I went and took a little bit of a short cut just so we can get to the punchline fast,

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and we're only going to deal not with the full satisfiability problem which gives

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
any kind of boolean formula, but specifically 3-SAT.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
3-SAT or just the satisfiability formulas have the form like so where the whole formula

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
is a bunch of ends of clauses, so it's clause end, clause end, clause end, clause end and so on

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
until all the clauses have been expressed.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Each clause itself is the or of three literals and the literal itself is either

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
a variable or a delegation of a variable and ???.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So you could have something that looks like X or not Y or z

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and w or X or not z and that's a 3-SAT problem.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's not a very hard 3-SAT problem, but it's a 3-SAT problem.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And with clauses, each clause has 3-literals, each literal has either

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
the name of a variable or not the name of a variable.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Now, just so happens that this problem is also NP hard, it's an NP complete,

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
just like satisfiability but it's a lot easier to work with.

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So somebody walks up to us and says, "Well, I have a general satisfiability question."

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It might be easier if they walked up to us and said, "I have a 3-SAT question."

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Now, this is not easier in the computational complexity sense, it's just easier just working with it

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and writing an algorithm sense, but the algorithm--the problem itself is equally hard.
