00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:08,119
Start with decision tables. This is a common way for, getting a,

2
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:12,700
getting your head wrapped around a situation where there are various different,

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:18,820
states that can affect ultimate behavior of the system. If you,

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:25,070
if you think about decision tables in terms of input conditions and and, and,

5
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:31,760
and responses to those inputs. That is combinations of inputs yielding results.

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:39,330
That's where the term netwire comes from. The table will have columns.

7
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:44,080
Some of which correspond to the inputs and the remainder will correspond to

8
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,090
the outputs. And then each of the rows is going to correspond to a different

9
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,760
combination of input values. Let's imagine that we have a workshop and

10
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,380
there are three switches, okay. Each of the switches can have on and

11
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:04,480
off as possible values, okay? So we're going to have three columns and

12
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:10,170
eight rows. Where did the eight come from? Well, if we have three switches,

13
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,329
two possible values for each switch, that's two to the third or

14
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:19,690
eight. Let's assume that the three switches control two output devices.

15
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:24,670
Maybe an overhead light and maybe a, a power drill.

16
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:29,030
The third switch is a master switch which controls all the electricity in

17
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:33,460
the workshop. Well here's the, here's the decision table for this situation.

18
00:01:34,647 --> 00:01:39,790
Partitioned the columns into three input columns for

19
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:46,000
the three different switches and two Output columns for

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,100
the lights and the motor on the power drill. Each of

21
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:56,280
the rows correspond to one of the possible combinations of the values for

22
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,320
the input switches. Due to the third,

23
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,490
eight different rows there. For each of the combinations of the inputs

24
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:11,800
there'll be a resulting situation as far as the outputs are concerned. So

25
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,630
for example, if the master control switch is off then it doesn't matter

26
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:22,010
the positions of the other switches, both the lights and the motor will be off.
