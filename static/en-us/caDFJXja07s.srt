1
00:00:00,242 --> 00:00:04,022
So the last processor to arrive at the root

2
00:00:04,022 --> 00:00:08,061
of the tree, in this case P5. He's the guy

3
00:00:08,061 --> 00:00:10,474
who is going to start the waking up process for

4
00:00:10,474 --> 00:00:13,288
everyone, and the way the wake up process works is

5
00:00:13,288 --> 00:00:16,102
that P5, having realized that he has reached the

6
00:00:16,102 --> 00:00:18,916
root of the tree and having realized that he's the

7
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:21,730
last one to arrive, because count is already zero

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,350
after you decremented it, he's going to flip this locksense flag.

9
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,512
So, when he flips this locksense flag, what's going to

10
00:00:28,512 --> 00:00:32,600
happen? Two things, one is this guy, P3, he's

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,760
waiting on this locksense flipping. So he's going to be

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,850
released from the spin he's on. Of course, P5 has

13
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,550
reset the count back up to n to prepare

14
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,110
for the next barrier and it has flipped the locksense.

15
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,420
So freeing up P3 and it is now ready to go down the tree as well to tell his

16
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,830
buddies that the barrier is done and wake

17
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,960
up everyone along the way. So the wakeup starts

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,870
from the root. And, so in this case P5

19
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,459
and P3 having been released from the root, they

20
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:06,810
go, come down to the next level. And they're

21
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,150
going to wake up their buddies that are waiting at

22
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,954
this level of the tree. Remember I told you

23
00:01:11,954 --> 00:01:16,640
that this can be a kauri tree. K happens

24
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,280
to be two in this case. But for any

25
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,960
general K, basically at every level of the tree, there's

26
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,235
going to be on K minus 1 buddies waiting here,

27
00:01:24,235 --> 00:01:28,820
K minus 1 buddies waiting here. So what we're going to

28
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,821
do is we're going to release that many number of

29
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:37,060
prisoners from every level of the tree. So this is

30
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,380
the zeroth level of the tree. There's the first level

31
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,630
of the tree. There's the second level of the tree.

32
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,750
And at the zeroth level, there is k minus

33
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,190
1 buddies. At the first level, there is k times

34
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,660
k minus 1 buddies waiting. And similarly as you

35
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,560
go down the different levels of the tree, there're more

36
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,620
and more buddies waiting to be released. So for

37
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,970
this simple example, with the K equal to two, so

38
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,960
when he comes up here, comes down to this

39
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,570
level, P3 is going to release P0 and P5 is going to

40
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:13,100
release P6. And so now we have more helpers, to go down the tree and wake up

41
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:19,230
more people. So at this level only P5 was there to wake up P3, and at this level

42
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,410
both P3 and P, P5 are there to wake

43
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,215
up the respective buddies, P0 in this case, and

44
00:02:25,215 --> 00:02:31,740
P6 in this case. So once P0 and P6 have been woken up, there are four of them

45
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,360
now available that can go down to the next level

46
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,220
of the tree. And they can go down to the next

47
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,300
level of the tree. P0 can wake up, his buddies

48
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,020
at this level of the tree, P3 his buddies at this

49
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,520
level, P5, and P6. And so now all the others,

50
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,050
so P1 in this case P2 in this case, P4 in

51
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:54,230
this case, and P7 in this case, were all been waiting

52
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,140
at this level of the tree, they will all get awakened

53
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,700
because of these guys marching down from the root. And

54
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,360
basically what each of these guys are doing on the

55
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,860
way down is to flip this locksense flag. So the

56
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,410
first thing that P5 did was to flip the locksense flag

57
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,600
over here. That released this guy. And when, when P3

58
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,190
and P5 come to this level of the tree, each

59
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,730
of them respectively flip the locksense flag that is associated

60
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:22,720
with this data structure and when they do that, P5 release

61
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:30,710
P6, P3 release P0 and now both P0, P3, P5 and P6 on this side.

62
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:36,100
They all can go down to the next level. And P0 can flip locksense over here, P3

63
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,230
can flip locksense over here, P5 over here,

64
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,310
P6 over here. That is going to release the

65
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,400
rest of the buddies, P1, P2, P4, and

66
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,560
P7. And everybody has now been released from the

67
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,450
barrier, and that signals that the spin is done for all the

68
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,860
ba, the processes that I've been

69
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,500
waiting, and, the barrier completion is complete.
