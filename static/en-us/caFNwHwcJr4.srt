1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,140
So in this lesson we've discussed some very important ideas about motivation

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,915
and emotion. So in motivation we've seen how needs states lead to drive and

3
00:00:08,915 --> 00:00:15,100
then those drives lead to motivated behaviors. We've also discussed how these

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,565
could be arranged in hierarchy from the most basic, like physiological and

5
00:00:18,565 --> 00:00:24,030
safety needs. All the way up to higher level needs of self-esteem and

6
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:29,241
self-actuaization. We've also talked about incentives, and how incentives are

7
00:00:29,241 --> 00:00:36,225
important rewards for doing things well. We've talked about two basic needs.

8
00:00:36,225 --> 00:00:41,166
Sex, and hunger. And sex is about survival of the species, hunger is about

9
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:46,410
survival of the individual. And with sex we've seen, for instance, the brain

10
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,052
system that regulates it is the hypothalamus. And the hormones involved in

11
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:56,732
regulating sexual behavior are mostly testosterone. Likewise, with hunger we've

12
00:00:56,732 --> 00:01:01,331
seen how the brain, again the hypothalamus, regulates hunger as well as the

13
00:01:01,331 --> 00:01:07,823
blood, glucose levels and then finally, again, hormones. But this time, leptin,

14
00:01:07,823 --> 00:01:12,934
ghrelin, and insulin, for example. And then we've also seen how culture very

15
00:01:12,934 --> 00:01:17,230
much shapes what we eat. And we call that cuisine. So we've also talked about

16
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,858
emotion. And emotions are experienced when we think of something as both

17
00:01:20,858 --> 00:01:25,859
meaningful and harmful or beneficial to our well being. In another words, how

18
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:30,835
we praise events shape the emotions we experience. So for instance, if we think

19
00:01:30,835 --> 00:01:35,377
something has been lost we might experience the emotion of sadness. If we think

20
00:01:35,377 --> 00:01:38,769
something is a threat to us, we might experience the emotion of either fear or

21
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:43,594
anger. Emotions are accompanied by changes in our physiology, in our

22
00:01:43,594 --> 00:01:48,849
expression. And in our feeling states. Now emotions and moods, are not the

23
00:01:48,849 --> 00:01:53,635
same. Emotions are a result from specific events, and they tend to be very

24
00:01:53,635 --> 00:01:58,768
short, in duration. Moods, on the other hand are often come about from

25
00:01:58,768 --> 00:02:05,104
something very vague, and they're much more longer lasting. And then affective

26
00:02:05,104 --> 00:02:10,443
traits are personality dispositions. So some people are more likely to

27
00:02:10,443 --> 00:02:16,771
experience anger, and sadness, or anxiety, for instance. And then, lastly we've

28
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:20,547
talked about how the stereotypes of men and women being different in emotion

29
00:02:20,547 --> 00:02:25,577
are not really all that true. A lot of the time, men and women in fact express

30
00:02:25,577 --> 00:02:30,760
emotion very much the same way. We did see however, that women are better at

31
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,785
talking about emotion precisely and also reading emotion on people's faces and

32
00:02:35,785 --> 00:02:38,610
in their voices.
