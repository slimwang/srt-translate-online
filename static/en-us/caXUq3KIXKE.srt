1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,512
Now we can even think about adding together these two use cases.

2
00:00:05,512 --> 00:00:09,549
The notation we'll use is to say that messages labeled with

3
00:00:09,549 --> 00:00:12,614
the letter A correspond to use case number one and

4
00:00:12,614 --> 00:00:16,901
messages labeled with the letter B are a part of use case number two.

5
00:00:16,901 --> 00:00:19,993
And the steps are still numbered one, two, three, and so on.

6
00:00:19,993 --> 00:00:24,121
And so we see that we have now a diagram in which both of

7
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:26,452
the use cases are listed there.

8
00:00:26,452 --> 00:00:29,992
And it could also have been the case that the second use case might have,

9
00:00:29,992 --> 00:00:33,550
might have used a different class that wasn't used in the first case.

10
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,390
In which case, adding it in means that we now have you know,

11
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,180
four classes in our, in our diagram.
