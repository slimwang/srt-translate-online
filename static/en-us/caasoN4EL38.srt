00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,160
Welcome back, everybody.

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,705
Today we have Allan with us here.

3
00:00:02,705 --> 00:00:05,700
Allan, describe some problems when
you're first working with a framework.

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,570
What did you experience?

5
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,690
>> When you're first learning a
framework there's a lot of overhead that

6
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,034
you need to learn that's
specific to the framework.

7
00:00:13,034 --> 00:00:14,990
I mean,
it's not just like learning a language.

8
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,150
Take for example AngularJS.

9
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,770
Even if you are an expert in JavaScript,

10
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,160
you can't start off right off
the bat developing AngularJS.

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,350
There's some nuances or a caveats or

12
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,240
things that are done differently
within those different frameworks.

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,642
Like for example, AngularJS has
different modules, factories.

14
00:00:31,642 --> 00:00:36,201
It's interesting, for some frameworks,
in order to print, hello world,

15
00:00:36,201 --> 00:00:39,646
to display on a web page,
you need multiple lines of code.

16
00:00:39,646 --> 00:00:43,319
Whereas like if you're just dealing
with straight HTML, CSS and

17
00:00:43,319 --> 00:00:45,536
JavaScript it's pretty simple to do.

18
00:00:45,536 --> 00:00:47,756
>> So for students that are just
starting out into the world of

19
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,615
frameworks and
trying to learn their first one,

20
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:51,320
what would be some
advice you'd give them?

21
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,220
>> I would say,

22
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,649
first and foremost, you need to be
very comfortable with the language.

23
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,560
Each framework kind of ships,
or usually ships,

24
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,510
with their own DSL or
domain specific language.

25
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,760
But if you don't understand the base
language, you're incurring a lot

26
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,580
of technical debt,
professionally as well as personally.

27
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,827
As far as advice to extend
generally to any framework and

28
00:01:11,827 --> 00:01:16,458
students jumping into it, another thing
I would recommend is definitely do not

29
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:18,960
be afraid to jump into
the documentation.

30
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,670
It's supposed to be your mainstream or
largely-supported frameworks.

31
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:26,900
The documentation is excellent.

32
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,260
Take for example,
AngularJS or Ruby on Rails.

33
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,461
You should have that bookmarked and
always, always visit it.

34
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:36,679
I mean, if the documentation's
good then most of your

35
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:39,436
questions will be answered there.

36
00:01:39,436 --> 00:01:41,920
>> So you've worked with
a couple of frameworks.

37
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,270
From learning your first one, what was
it like transitioning to a new one?

38
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,910
>> A good question, so when you're
transitioning frameworks, you don't

39
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,960
lose all the knowledge that you gained
from learning that initial framework.

40
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,310
And part of the value of learning
frameworks is that a lot of the best

41
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,281
practices are kind of built in,
if not forced

42
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:06,100
on you with configuration,
or with convention, rather.

43
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,940
And so you're able to translate
a lot of those best practices

44
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,788
to other frameworks.

45
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:15,180
Or even if you don't have a framework,
you can build your application

46
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,840
with some of those best practices that
you learned from previous frameworks.

47
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,930
Okay, so learning your first framework
might be a little tough, but

48
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,600
then the slide is a lot easier for
learning a new one.

49
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,540
>> Yeah, there's a lot of
design patterns that are common

50
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,040
throughout frameworks.

51
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,280
For example, MVC, model-view-controller,
that's something that

52
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,680
exists across most of our front-end
frameworks or our full-side frameworks.

53
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,015
>> Okay, so learning your first
one might be a big push, but

54
00:02:41,015 --> 00:02:43,641
then after that, then it's a lot
easier to switch to a new one and

55
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:45,262
learn a different style of framework.

56
00:02:45,262 --> 00:02:47,120
>> For sure,
every framework's different.

57
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,660
They all have their different nuances
and caveats, but the general themes and

58
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,220
best practices are pretty
consistent across all of them.
