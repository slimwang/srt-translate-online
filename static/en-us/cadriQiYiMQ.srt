1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,797
The lowest common denominator for each of these fractions is k times r, or kr.

2
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:10,945
Keep in mind that K is some unknown number and so is R. So the only factor that

3
00:00:10,945 --> 00:00:19,072
we're certain that they share is 1. So k times 1 is k and 1 x r is r. This means

4
00:00:19,072 --> 00:00:20,668
that the product of these factors must be the LCD.
