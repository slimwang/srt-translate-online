00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,620
This lesson will get you familiar with

app building and some of the basic functionality

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,550

00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,380
Andy will introduce you to the problem we'll

00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,410
be focusing on in the class. As you listen to their discussion, pay attention to

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,720
the questions they ask each other. How would

00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,810
the questions they're considering generalize to other problems?
