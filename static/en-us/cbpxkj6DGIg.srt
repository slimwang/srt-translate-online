1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
select * from art order by created descending.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So remember our table is called Art.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I hope I didn't confuse you by adding the s here.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I think we will accept both, but our class name is Art,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
so that's the name of our table.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So select * from art, and remember all GQL queries

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
have to say select *, so you have no choice there.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Then order by--that's how you sort something--created.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is our property that represents when

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
this particular piece of art was submitted.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And since we want most recent first,

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
we add DESC, for descending, at the end of this query.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Okay, let's go ahead and add the store program.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So I've written the SQL select * from art order by created descending.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I used multiple lines here.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That makes it a little bit easier to read.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That's going to store the results from this query,

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
which is actually going to be a cursor.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The cursor is just a pointer to the results in this variable called Arts.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Let's go ahead and pass in arts to our template.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Let's go to our template and make use of it.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So below our form--this is going to get a little fancy--

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
we're going to display all the artwork we've received submitted.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So I'm going to start with an HR, which just draws a line across the page,

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and then I can use a loop in this template.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This is going to be actually--it's going to be Python code embedded in our html.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You don't have to understand it, but that's what I'm doing.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
For art in arts,

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
this little curly percent syntax is used by Jinja,

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
the template language, to separate html from Python.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We're going to create a div. We're going to call it art.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Remember this class doesn't do anything until we add the styles,

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
and we haven't added any styles yet.

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So it basically just creates a new line.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Div class equals art title--

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
again, another div doesn't do anything yet.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We're just going to put the art title in here.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This is how we include a variable.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Remember the double curlies.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So for art in arts,

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm going to take that art here

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and access its title.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And this object art here

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
is actually an instance of this class art here,

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and it has a title.

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So it can access the title using the period syntax.

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Then we close those curlies, we close our div,

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and then we're going to add the art body.

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm going to use the pre tag.

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The pre tag is a handy little tag

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
that basically preserves the white space that is inside it.

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So remember how we talked about html,

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
how it converts all spaces to a single space

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and all new lines to a single new line?

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's why we can indent our html,

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
because there's actually all these spaces between all these tags

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and things to print as you'd expect them to.

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The pretag basically says

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
any white space between this pretag is preformatted

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and it's going to stay that way.

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So we're going to include our art.art.

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Now remember, this art here--

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
this is a little confusing, I realize--

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
this art here refers to this instance of our art class,

66
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and our art class actually has a property called art,

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
which is actually the text of the art itself.

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So that's what we're going to include there,

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and then we're going to close our div,

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and we're going to end our loop.

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And that's the end of our html file.

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Let's review what we just added.

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
For every art in arts, render this html.

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Remember arts comes from

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
this query that we run here--this GQL query--

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
to select all of the art.

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We're going to store that in a variable called Arts,

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and we're going to pass it into our template.

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So let's go to our browser.

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Here we've got our page.

81
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And now, when I reload this page, I should see all of our artwork.

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Aha! And here is the camel we submitted.

83
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
There's the title, and there is the camel.

84
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Let's submit a new piece of art.
