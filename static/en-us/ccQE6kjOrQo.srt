00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,626
The complex conjugate of 2 minus 3i is just two plus 3i. Once again, we just

2
00:00:04,626 --> 00:00:08,918
look at the sign of the coefficient b over here, the coefficient of the

3
00:00:08,918 --> 00:00:13,390
imaginary part of the number and we flip it. It was negative and now it's

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:17,965
positive. Let's look then at the graphical relationship between complex

5
00:00:17,965 --> 00:00:23,352
conjugates. The two orange points here are one pair of conjugates, 3 plus 4i and

6
00:00:23,352 --> 00:00:28,774
3 minus 4i. And the teal points are another pair, 2 plus 3i and 2 minus 3i. What

7
00:00:28,774 --> 00:00:33,844
we notice is that the horizontal coordinate of either point in each pair is the

8
00:00:33,844 --> 00:00:38,561
same. But the vertical coordinate is just flipped so each point is just a

9
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:43,479
reflection of the point it matches with across the real axis. If we have the

10
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:48,393
number negative 8 minus 4i, then its conjugate must be the point that has the

11
00:00:48,393 --> 00:00:53,619
same horizontal coordinate and the opposite vertical coordinate, so it will be

12
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:57,185
this negative 8 plus 4i which does seem to be correct.
