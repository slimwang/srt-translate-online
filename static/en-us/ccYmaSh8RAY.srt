1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,860
For this quiz, let's recall the consumer code from the previous example for

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,300
condition variables.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,580
Instead of while, why didn't we simply use if?

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,610
Is it because, while can support multiple consumer threads?

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,450
We cannot guarantee access to m once the condition is signaled?

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:22,180
The list can change before the consumer gets access again?

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,000
Or, all of the above?
