1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,600
All right.
Hopefully this wasn't too tricky.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,660
This is actually a very similar
situation to the udacicolaVotes.

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,330
pepcityVotes was also
made a local variable.

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,950
And similarly, its scope is limited
to just the votePepcity method,

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,940
meaning that it gets created here,
and then,

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,010
in this next line, after adding
1 to its value, it gets trashed.

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,100
That's something you might have
noticed is how pepcityVotes

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,300
doesn't have the initialization
to 0 that udacicolaVotes does.

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,400
This is actually a pretty big error, and
will cause your code to not be able to

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,320
compile, meaning it won't be
able to run on the phone.

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,200
Local variables must be initialized,
meaning that they must be given some

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,470
sort of initial value like we're
doing here with the udacicolaVotes.

13
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,250
Then we have the same problems
that we had Udacicola.

14
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,860
Between button clicks it's not actually
really counting up how many votes that

15
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,840
Pepcity has, and when we do the
showMeVotes method, because the scope

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,100
ends here you actually won't be able
to use the variable value down here.

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,720
So if you said that this has the same
problems as the udacicolaVotes does

18
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,790
you'd be correct.

19
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,030
Okay, let's look at another problem.
