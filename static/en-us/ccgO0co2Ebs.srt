In general, we would expect our asset manager to have the following features.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,646
First off, loaded assets should be cached so that multiple requests won't

3
00:00:06,646 --> 00:00:11,818
trigger reloads of content, but instead use the in-memory version. We should

4
00:00:11,818 --> 00:00:14,624
also be able to receive asynchronous notification when an asset has been

5
00:00:14,624 --> 00:00:18,158
loaded. This allows us to go ahead and load the asset while also rendering the

6
00:00:18,158 --> 00:00:21,955
game scene at the same time. In addition, we should allow batches of assets to

7
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:25,936
be loaded in a single call. This is very critical for when we do map loading or

8
00:00:25,936 --> 00:00:29,688
other heterogeneous file computation where we need to pass images, JSON files,

9
00:00:29,688 --> 00:00:34,730
and sounds into the system to allow them to load in a single call.
