1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
To apply stimulation in real life and to apply optimization in real life,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
we have to have an idea about the sources and the amounts of errors that we are introducing.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The model as such may not be good enough.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
For instance, we may be missing some vital effects in that model.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The values that we are using for the model's parameters may be wrong.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We may be using the wrong growth rate or we may be using the growth rate that's too big

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
or we may be using a maximum carrying capacity that's too large.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The initial data may be off. Do we really know the amount of fish we're starting with?

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And we may have numerical issues, maybe due to round off errors

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
or maybe, which is more probable, due to finite step sizes.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We look at numerics in Units 2 and 3.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'll discuss the problems with this model at the end of these units.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What I want to consider now is how to study errors concerning the parameters and initial data.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The nice thing about these is that we can check them in the model.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We can use a computer to get an idea about the effects

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
at least of errors we are introducing here,

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and the computer can help us to find out which of these parameters and initial data

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
is the most critical concerning its range of uncertainty.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If we try to get more certain data, which of these would we try to improve?

20
00:01:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That's one of the major objectives of sensitivity analysis.
