1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's now look at the combined data set of height and weight.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It turns out both lists have the same elements, and the very first element

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
in the height list is the same person as the weight in this list over here.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The same is true for the second--so these data pair up conveniently to plot the height

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
of a specific person and his or her weight.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I now want you to run a scatter plot. Remember how a scatter plot looked like.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Particularly, I want you to graph the height versus the weight,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and the command to use is called scatterplot and accepts these two variables as input.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I'd like you to try these out for the data I've given you.
