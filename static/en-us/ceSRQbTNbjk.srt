1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Aren't we suspicious of this number?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Most of the homes here are in the $100K range.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
There is one of $325K and one of $2.4 million.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The mean doesn't really reflect this.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It makes you feel that the average home in the neighborhood is $492,000.00.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But that's not a good description of what's happening.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Instead, we have a situation where we can graph the price and the frequency,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and we have a peak around $130K.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But then there is a really, really long tail that gets us all the way to $2.4 million.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And the sad part is rather than finding the peak over here,

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
we find ourselves somewhere in the middle.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And the reason is this one number of $2.4 million

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
drags us to the right side and really has a strong impact on the mean,

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
which ends up to be just below $500K.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This is exactly where we get the second M, the so-called median.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The median is a different statistic that seeks to find

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
the typical house price in this list--the one in the middle.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Put differently, if you sorted those, the median picks the one in the middle.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sure you can do this in your head,

20
00:01:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
so please enter the median house price over here.
