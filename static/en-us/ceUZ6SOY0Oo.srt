00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Actually, by the book this equation for gravity--this equation for the force of gravity--

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
is only true for point masses.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We would have to concentrate all of our earth in one single spot.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So do we cheat when we don't do so?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The nice thing about gravity is that this equation still holds

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
for a rotationally symmetric distributed mass.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This is called Newton's Shell Theorem,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and you are going to see in the upcoming quiz why this is called "shell" theorem.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
To see why Newton's Shell Theorem holds,

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
it's best to introduce an analogy to water.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This looks outrageous, but please bear with me.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
If we leave our first mass where it is and move the second mass around,

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
we can determine a force vector at every point in space.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We get a force field.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Imagine that this wasn't the solar system but a pool of water,

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and the water has velocities,

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and the velocity of the water is described by our force field.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Water flows downward here at a high speed.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It flows to the right at a low speed at this point.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It flows to the left at a somewhat higher speed at this point, and so on.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We interpret the force field a velocity field in our pool of water.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Of course, we're ignoring the units of measurement right now.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Of course when setting force equal to velocity we're ignoring

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
units of measurement for a moment.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
To make that work, there has to be a huge drain in the center.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The first mass acts like a cosmic drain.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Why can we do so? Why does water behave in the same way as this force field does?

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
To understand that consider two imaginary spheres in our pool,

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
both centered at the drain.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And the radius of the outer sphere should be twice the radius of the inner sphere,

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
which means that the surface area of the outer sphere is 4 times the surface area

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
of the inner sphere.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
All lengths are being multiplied by 2.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
These are square meters.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
They are multiplied by 2 squared.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Now the important quantity to consider is the flow of water through these spheres.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
How many cubic meters per second flow through these surfaces?

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This number has to be the same for the outer and for the inner sphere.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We are not losing water or gaining water in between,

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
but as the outer sphere has a surface area of 4 times that of the inner sphere

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
the velocity has to go up to transport the same amount of water per second

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
through each of these spheres the velocity at the inner sphere has to quadruple

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
as compared to this velocity at the outer sphere.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
This is precisely what we saw before with gravity.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
As we double the distance the force shrinks to 1/4 of the original.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Of course, this doesn't only work for a factor of 2.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This works for all ratios.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Hence, we can indeed identify the force field of gravity with the velocity field of water.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Once this analogy between gravity and water is in place,

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
it's easy to see that the flow through each of these surfaces

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
has to be the same.

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Let's assume that we have three masses at the center of this sphere.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And this same masses are at the center of that smaller sphere.

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And the same three masses are somewhere inside this weird closed surface.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Then the flow through each of these surfaces has to be the same.

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
If we replace the force field of gravity by the velocity field of water,

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
we have to seem the same number of cubic meters per second

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
for each of these surfaces.

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Because we're draining water in three spots at the same rate.

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Somehow that amount of water has to enter from the outside.

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And it has to be this same amount of water,

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
because we're draining the same amount of water in each of them.
