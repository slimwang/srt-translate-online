>> It looks like two numbers convey a lot of information. In algebra we use a

2
00:00:04,202 --> 00:00:08,791
similar system to identify locations. This is system is called the coordinate

3
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:13,320
plane or the Cartesian plane. The system uses two lines known as the x axis and

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,129
the y axis. The x axis is the horizontal line and the y axis is the vertical

5
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:22,937
line that runs through plane. By drawing this graph we can create an infinite

6
00:00:22,937 --> 00:00:27,467
world of numbers and intersections. Where the x axis and y axis intersect is

7
00:00:27,467 --> 00:00:32,351
called the origin, the center. Just like we labelled streets and avenues on our

8
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:36,847
maps, we can label our axes with numbers, 0, 1, 2, and so on. We can do this in

9
00:00:36,847 --> 00:00:41,676
the horizontal direction and in the vertical direction. To indicate a point on

10
00:00:41,676 --> 00:00:45,738
this Cartesian system, how many numbers would we need to specify? This can be

11
00:00:45,738 --> 00:00:49,710
tricky, so think back to our map. How many numbers would we need to specify a

12
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,647
point like this? I'm not asking you for the location, I'm asking you for the

13
00:00:53,647 --> 00:00:56,113
number of points. Put your answer in this box.
