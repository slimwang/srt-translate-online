00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,710
Welcome to the iOS nanodegree program.

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:06,070
Hi, My name's Jason, and
I'm Udacity's iOS curriculum manager.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,720
>> And, I'm Miriam.
Your nanodegree community manager.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,640
We want to take a few minutes
to talk about this program,

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,220
and help you think through the nature
of the effort you'll be undertaking.

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,460
>> We're really excited
about this program.

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,640
iOS is the original
smartphone environment, and

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,400
the App Store is the most lucrative
of the mobile app markets.

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,410
It's a lot of fun to be able
to join in and create apps.

10
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,380
>> Our goal is to help you develop the
skills you'll need to make those apps

11
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:30,560
and to prepare you for
a job as an iOS developer.

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,220
>> We think that you'll find that it's
also a profound learning experience to

13
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,880
learn the iOS libraries.

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,640
Taking the time to wrestle with
the architectures that Apple has written

15
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,360
is a valuable way to expand
your programming experience.

16
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:40,920
Our next code,

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,100
the development environment,
is an exceptional tool as well.

18
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,740
>> The core of this nanodegree program

19
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,250
is a portfolio of apps
you'll be writing.

20
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,640
Each of these apps will help
you learn key iOS skills and

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,760
will give you great technical
talking points in future interviews.

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,790
You'll make progress by
completing these apps, and

23
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,380
submitting them to be reviewed
by professional iOS developers.

24
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,492
In addition to helping you build
the technical skills you need,

25
00:01:01,492 --> 00:01:04,519
we offer career involvement activities
to make sure you know how to market

26
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,820
yourself as an iOS developer.

27
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,820
>> To make sure that you're
prepared to build these apps,

28
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,280
we've created courses to
help you get started.

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,770
If you have a lot of
experience writing for

30
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,760
iOS, you might want to jump right
into the projects, but in general,

31
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,460
we think most people want to
go through the courses.
