Grant doesn't have time to work with us anymore, because he's so busy selling

2
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:08,234
tons of glasses wipers and nozzles. And plus, he already learned a ton from us

3
00:00:08,234 --> 00:00:12,350
about algebra. So, he's referred me to someone else who he thinks is going to

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:16,238
help put a new spin on ways that algebra shows up in the real world. Our new

00:00:16,238 --> 00:00:21,010
friend is his cousin, Athena. She says hello, and she is super excited to start

6
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,069
working with us. Now, just to give you some basic info about Athena. She is a

7
00:00:25,069 --> 00:00:29,397
college student living in UdaCity. In school, she is majoring in architecture,

8
00:00:29,397 --> 00:00:33,179
but she's still taking classes in some other subjects, including college

9
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:37,214
algebra. Athena loves hanging out with her friends and her family and she has a

10
00:00:37,214 --> 00:00:41,060
really cute dog and a really cute cat. So, all in all, Athena leads a pretty

11
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:41,713
happy life.
