1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,090
Let's go over an example
of packet filtering.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:08,170
This is a simplified example of
a rule set for SMTP traffic.

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:12,040
The goal is to allow inbound and
outbound e-mail traffic, but

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,325
to block all other traffic.

5
00:00:14,325 --> 00:00:18,405
The rules apply top to bottom for
each packet.

6
00:00:18,405 --> 00:00:21,855
That is, for each packet,
the firewall is screened up high,

7
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:26,255
each rule, one by one, from top to
bottom, until there is a match.

8
00:00:26,255 --> 00:00:29,300
So let's explain
the intent of each rule.

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:34,500
As we can see, each rule here has a rule
number, has a direction of the traffic,

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,628
has a source, and a destination
IP addresses of the packet.

11
00:00:37,628 --> 00:00:39,940
The protocol,

12
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,815
the destination port, and the decision,
whether it's permit or deny.

13
00:00:44,815 --> 00:00:50,225
The first rule is to allow inbound
email traffic from an external host,

14
00:00:50,225 --> 00:00:54,225
therefore it says the direction is in,
meaning inbound.

15
00:00:54,225 --> 00:00:57,175
The source IP address is
an external IP address,

16
00:00:57,175 --> 00:01:00,055
because we are talking
about inbound traffic.

17
00:01:00,055 --> 00:01:03,780
The destination IP address
is an internal IP address.

18
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:10,070
The protocol is TCP, the destination
port is 25, which is for SMTP.

19
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,652
Again, this permits inbound email
traffic from an external source.

20
00:01:14,652 --> 00:01:20,660
Second rule, it's intended to allow a
response to an inbound SMTP connection.

21
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:24,460
Because here, in the first rule,
we allow inbound email traffic, so

22
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,140
we should allow outbound
response to the email traffic.

23
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,120
The third rule allows outbound
email to an external source.

24
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,480
That is, we allow outbound
traffic to external email server,

25
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:42,040
SMTP server, port 25 on an external
destination IP address.

26
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,300
And since we allowed outbound
email to an external email server,

27
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,000
rule number four allows
the inbound response.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,230
That is rule number four is intended
to allow an inbound email response.

29
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,190
Rule number five,

30
00:01:55,190 --> 00:02:00,230
this is an explicit statement of
the default policy, which is denied.

31
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,900
This means that if a packet does not
match any of the previous rules,

32
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,680
then the packet will be discarded.
