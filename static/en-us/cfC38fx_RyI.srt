00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,980
Welcome back to computer vision.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,370
Today we're going to talk about, stereo correspondence.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,410
Up until now we've defined the epipolar geometry that talks about how

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,980
the two views relate, and how if you have a point in the left image,

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,340
then if you know the camera's relation, it's a one dimensional search.

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,640
And in general, the epipolar lines can be,

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,580
well, arbitrary, not arbitrary, but skewed in a variety of ways and located.

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,644
But today, in order to make life easier, we're going to assume a bunch of,

9
00:00:28,644 --> 00:00:29,950
simplifying assumptions.

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,010
For example, we're going to assume, basically the geometry that we

11
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:39,500
drew out last time, of parallel, or coplanar actually, image planes.

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,290
We're going to assume the same focal lengths of the two cameras.

13
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,280
We're going to assume that they're,

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,480
the cameras are horizontally aligned at the same height.

15
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,840
So we're, and that the images are pulled out such that the epipolar lines,

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:57,030
are horizontal, and, that they are, in fact lined up, so a xy location

17
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,380
in one image is at a different x but the same y location in the other image.

18
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,620
So look, that's a lot of assuming, and for real stereo, you wouldn't be

19
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,390
able to do that, you'd have to do a rectification of the image first.

20
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,590
We'll talk about that, couple lectures from now.

21
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,950
But for now, we'll make the assumptions which will allow us to

22
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,510
attack the correspondence problem more easily, and in fact,

23
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,930
it's the way you're going to be doing correspondence on the problems sets.
