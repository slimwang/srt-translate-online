00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Here's an example of tracking the Predict Update Cycle;

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and this is in a world in which the actions are guaranteed to work, as advertised--

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
that is, if you start to clean up the current location,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and if you move right or left, the wheels actually turn; and you do move.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But we can call this the kindergarten world because there are little toddlers

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
walking around who can deposit Dirt in any location, at any time.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So if we start off in this state, and execute the Suck action,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
we can predict that we'll end up in one of these 2 states.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Then, if we have an observation--well, we know what that observation's going to be

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
because we know the Suck action always works, and we know we were in A;

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
so the only observation we can get is that we're in A--and that it's Clean--

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
so we end up in that same belief state.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And then, if we execute the Right action--

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
well, then lots of things could happen;

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
because we move Right, and somebody might have dropped Dirt in the Right location,

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and somebody might have dropped Dirt in the Left location--or maybe not.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So we end up with 4 possibilities,

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and then we can update again when we get the next observation--

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
say, if we observed that we're in B and it's Dirty, then we end up in this belief state.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And we can keep on going--specifying new belief states--

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
as a result of success of predicts and updates.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Now, this Predict Update Cycle gives us a kind of calculus of belief states

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
that can tell us, really, everything we need to know.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
But there is one weakness with this approach--

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
that, as you can see here, some of the belief states start to get large;

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and this is a tiny little world.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Already, we have a belief state with 4 world states in it.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We could have one with 8, 16, 10, 24--or whatever.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And it seems that there may be more succinct representations of a belief state,

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
rather than to just list all the world states.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
For example, take this one here:

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
If we had divided the world up--not into individual world states,

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
but into variables describing that state,

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
then this whole belief state could be represented just by: Vacuum is on the Right.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So the whole world could be represented by 3 states--or 3 variables:

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
One, where is the Vacuum--is it on the Right, or not?

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Secondly, is there Dirt in the Left location?

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And third, is there Dirt in the Right location?

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And we could have some formula, over those variables, to describe states.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And with that type of formulation,

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
some very large states--in terms of enumerating the world states--

42
00:02:51,000 --> 99:59:59,999
can be made small, in terms of the description.
