Take this hypothetical example of twins raised in different environments, their

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:08,845
nature is the exact same, meaning their genetics are the same. But this one had

3
00:00:08,845 --> 00:00:16,200
access to music guitars and music lessons, this one didn't. So this one became

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,415
a rock star, this one not so much. That's the difference between nature and

5
00:00:21,415 --> 00:00:22,080
nurture.
