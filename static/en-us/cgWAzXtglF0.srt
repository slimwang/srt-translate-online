1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,325
While this one is called a histogram, this one is called a bar graph. The spaces

2
00:00:05,337 --> 00:00:10,400
in between the columns here mean that each of these is one distinct category.

3
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:15,975
Europe is completely distinct from North America, completely distinct from Asia

4
00:00:15,987 --> 00:00:21,410
and we can't mix them. But with age, we can choose any interval or bin size. And

5
00:00:21,524 --> 00:00:27,071
so, that's the next really important difference. You can change the bin size for

6
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:32,165
age data but not for the country data. We could make our bins from 0 to 80, in

7
00:00:32,177 --> 00:00:37,614
which case, all the students would be in that one bin. But we can't do the same

8
00:00:37,626 --> 00:00:43,432
for this unless we make it world, or something different, we could divide it

9
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:49,372
into hemispheres but we're still more restricted with this type of data then

10
00:00:49,384 --> 00:00:54,968
with the age data. And finally, the order of the continents doesn't really

11
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:01,320
matter. However, age is just in one order, from least to greatest. With the bar

12
00:01:01,332 --> 00:01:05,870
graph, we might choose to put it into a particular order depending on what

13
00:01:05,882 --> 00:01:10,890
question we're trying to answer. Such as where are most students from? Then, we

14
00:01:10,902 --> 00:01:15,620
might put it in a order from least to greatest or greatest to least. Or, we

15
00:01:15,632 --> 00:01:21,263
might choose to alphabetize it so that viewers can easily find what continent or

16
00:01:21,275 --> 00:01:26,902
country or whatever they're looking for on the x-axis. And finally, the shape of

17
00:01:26,914 --> 00:01:32,254
a histogram is very important. Whereas, the shape of a bar graph is arbitrary,

18
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:37,995
depending on how you choose to order the categories on the x-axis. One thing to

19
00:01:38,007 --> 00:01:44,219
remember is that with a histogram, the variable on the x-axis is numerical and

20
00:01:44,231 --> 00:01:50,261
quantitative. Whereas with a bar graph, the variable on the x-axis is often

21
00:01:50,273 --> 00:01:52,702
cateogoriacal or qualitative.
