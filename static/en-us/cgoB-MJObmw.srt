1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,990
This is why for
most classification tasks

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:08,119
people tend to hold back more than
30,000 examples for validation.

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:12,750
This makes accuracy figures significant
to the first decimal place and

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,370
gives you enough resolution
to see small improvements.

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,360
If your classes are not well balanced,
for example,

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,300
if some important classes are very rare,
his heuristic is no longer good.

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,710
Bad news, you're only going
to need much more data.

8
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,300
Now, holding back even 30,000 examples
can be a lot of data if you have

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,244
a small training set.

10
00:00:32,244 --> 00:00:35,280
Cross-validation, which
I've mentioned before,

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,670
is one possible way to
mitigate the issue.

12
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,810
But cross-validation
can be a slow process,

13
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,370
so getting more data is
often the right solution.
