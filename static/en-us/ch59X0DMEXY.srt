[Thrun] The last example I want to talk about in this lecture

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
is related to general purpose path planning

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
where we don't have a road network.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Here is an example of where this occurs.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This is an example of where a blockage occurs.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
None of the preplanned paths are drivable by our robot,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
so it has to, after a certain time out here--20 seconds--

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
find itself a path anywhere in the environment.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
In fact, our Urban Challenge car did just this.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We don't do this today in traffic. It's a little bit dangerous.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But for the Urban Challenge it was perfectly doable, and it was safe.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So this car found a route that was outside any pre-given corridor.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Here is an even more challenging example

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
where our robot Junior approaches a complete road blockage,

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
but its target location is behind the road blockage.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You can see that none of the paths can possibly make it there

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and the only correct action is to turn around and pick a different road

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
to finally approach the goal location from the opposite side.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You can see an attempted lane shift to the opposite lane doesn't function either,

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and there is time models supposed to be with all of those.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Eventually, using a general purpose planner

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
of the type that Peter talked about in his class

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
to find what ends up to be a really complicated multi-turn turnaround

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
where the car backs into a driveway a little bit, as you can see over here,

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and it is all planned completely dynamically without any preconception

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
how such a multi-point U-turn would look like.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Then it goes forward, then it goes backward, and does so multiple times

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
until it finally has turned around.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's not particularly efficient or elegant, but it's very, very safe.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This vehicle will eventually be able to drive in a different direction

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and reach the goal point behind the blockage.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
That was one of the tasks DARPA gave us.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So you can see it do its job until it finally breaks free

34
00:02:05,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and is able to navigate around this blockage onto a different street, as shown over here.
