00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,770
Let's talk about how to infer denial

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:07,380
of service activity using a technique called backscatter.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,890
The idea behind backscatter is that when

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:13,400
an attacker spoofs a source IP address, say

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:19,530
on a TCP SYN flood attack, that the replies to that initial TCP SYN from the

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:25,930
victim will go to the location of the source IP address. This replies to

7
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,750
forged attack messages are called" backscatter". Now

8
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,500
the interesting thing about backscatter is that if

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,140
we can assume that the source IP addresses

10
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,540
are selected by the attacker at random, and

11
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,660
we could set up a portion of the network where we could monitor this back

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,600
scatter traffic, coming back as SYN-ACK replies to

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,500
forged source IP addresses. If we assume that

14
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,550
these source IP addresses are picked uniformly at random, then the amount of

15
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,560
traffic that we see as back scatter. Represents exactly a fraction that's

16
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:06,300
proportional to the size of the overall attack. So for example, if we monitor N

17
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:11,650
IP addresses and we see M attack packets, then we expect

18
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:16,590
to see here N over two to the 32 of the total

19
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,770
back scatter packets and hence of the total attack rate. If we want to compute

20
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:26,770
the total attack rate, we simply invert this fraction. So for

21
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:31,890
example, in this case, if our telescope were a slash eight, or two

22
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:37,130
to the 24th IP addresses, we would simply multiply our observed

23
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:41,950
attack rate x by two to the 32 divided

24
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,523
by two to the 24 or 255.
