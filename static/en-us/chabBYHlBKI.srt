00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,380
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:04,880
So far, we've been concentrating on
looking at how we are going to merge

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,350
a few images together by doing
blending and cuts and all such things.

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,790
Now let's actually focus
on some of the basics.

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,930
In this lecture, I'm going to introduce
to you the concept of doing feature

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,860
detection and matching.

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,620
We're going to talk about
how we're going to look for

8
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,570
things like corners in an image, and

9
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,120
use that to extract information that
will allow us to find the same corner

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,680
in two different images, to allow us to
do things like matching and alignment.
