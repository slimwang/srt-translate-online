1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,900
So now let's look at
another simple lens system.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,760
Here I'm going to actually just
complicate things a little bit, and

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,890
add an eccentric aperture.

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:15,180
What that basically means is,
I'm going to cover a part of the lens,

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:20,440
so no light is going through,
so only part of the lens

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,490
is open, and it's eccentric,
it's no longer symmetric.

7
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,920
I'm going to cover just the,
this part of it, so this lens is open.

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,560
What happens to rays of
light in this instance?

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,780
So this light source,
of course, will go through, and

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,945
create a point where we expect it to,
right?

11
00:00:36,945 --> 00:00:38,780
So amount of light is reduced, but

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,880
we will still get something
at the point we want.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,130
So of course, that basically means an in
focus object still forms a point image

14
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,500
where we expect it to.

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,600
When we move the object closer,
what happens this time?

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,410
Remember, again, from what we looked
at in the last instance, in this case,

17
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,270
forms near object is blurred, but

18
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:05,140
it's only appearing to the right
of the optical center, right here.

19
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,860
Right?
In the old case, of course,

20
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,260
when we didn't have an eccentric,
we had,

21
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,110
of course, a blurred region everywhere.

22
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,911
But in this, by,
by covering this part of it,

23
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:14,860
we're only getting it on this side,
and it's blurred.

24
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:15,930
No rocket science needed.

25
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,850
If I move the object far away,
same experiment, and this time around,

26
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:27,280
the object is still blurred, but is
blurred to the left of the center line.

27
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,150
So just by creating a simple,

28
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:33,230
eccentric thing, we're now actually
capturing a lot more information.

29
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,870
Yes, we're losing in
the quantity of light, but we're

30
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:40,550
capturing more information, even about
the distance of the object itself, too.

31
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,370
Again, something we looked at when
we looked at things like depth, and

32
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,515
all that kind of stuff, earlier.
