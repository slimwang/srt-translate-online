1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Norvig] And the simplest way to do that is just ask if the absolute value of the difference

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
rather than the positive or negative value is equal to 1.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
But an alternative way to say it if you wanted to break it down in terms of the other primitive,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
you could say that nextto (h1, h2) is defined as immediate right of h1, h2

5
00:00:19,000 --> 99:59:59,999
or immediate right of h2, h1.
