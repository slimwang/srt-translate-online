1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,300
For our product line review
we've had tons of features or

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,530
lot's of people who are building
really amazing products.

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,070
Everything about my language is
talking about like how do I make it so

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,330
the user feels like they're kicking ass.

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,330
because a lot of people like
who are great building stuff,

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,510
they're like they talk about features
like look what we have, look what

7
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,740
we're doing, look why this is awesome,
this is going to be really cool.

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,380
And it needs to be complete opposite,

9
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,050
where it needs to be like look we use
this, this is what's going to kick ass.

10
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,400
And so it's all about the language and
the features.

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,222
Like I can say you get 1,000 entries,
unlimited forms,

12
00:00:29,222 --> 00:00:30,770
you get payment integration.

13
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,340
But that's just listing the features.

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,440
What I need to say is look, you don't
have to worry about data collection

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,380
anymore, everyone in your department is
going to have this installed on there.

16
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,318
You get to make money off of this.

17
00:00:40,318 --> 00:00:44,265
Monetize like a couple of seconds,
instead of having to wait for paying

18
00:00:44,265 --> 00:00:47,100
like thousands of dollars for someone to
build a custom Ecommerce site for you.

19
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,010
Beta test certain issues.

20
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,576
User management like all that stuff has
to be turned around when you're talking

21
00:00:51,576 --> 00:00:52,275
about this feature.

22
00:00:52,275 --> 00:00:56,740
So that took us a while to understand
like okay, the motivations on why people

23
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,395
want to be on certain plans and
making sure it got communicated.

24
00:01:00,395 --> 00:01:03,563
You being on here, the reason
you're on here is because of this,

25
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,899
because it's all for you.

26
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:08,971
And that took a real sort of empathy
in terms of describing and sort

27
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:13,430
of a knack for copy that's a flipside
of how people think about things.

28
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,570
Because like entrepreneurs are really
good about talking about sells and

29
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,420
pitching their company and
all that stuff, but

30
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,180
a lot of times they don't realize like
the pitch you need to give is the pitch

31
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,750
that allows people to talk
about you to someone else.

32
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,610
It's like I use this and it's my secret
weapon, I'm sharing it with you now.

33
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,440
And I'm now, like your most interesting
person at the dinner able or

34
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,480
you gave this tip that makes you
look like the really awesome guy.

35
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,510
And so a lot of people just don't
even craft copy in a way that

36
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,680
can be disseminated that easily.

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,770
A lot of times they'll just use
weird slogans and taglines,

38
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:43,870
short phrases and stuff.

39
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,094
And I was like I can't
repeat that to someone and

40
00:01:46,094 --> 00:01:49,220
have it make any coherent sense on
why you should use this service.
