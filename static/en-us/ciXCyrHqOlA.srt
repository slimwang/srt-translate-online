1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,760
To identify which stores have
more than 300 customers,

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,850
we need to count the customers
by store number.

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:11,630
To do this, we add the Summarize
tool after bringing in the file.

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:15,600
Next we click on the Store Number,
click on Add and

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,720
then Group By, and then again on Count.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,410
When we run the workflow,
a count has been added to each store.

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,420
Next, we connect the filter tool and

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,960
set the expression to
count greater than 300.

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,640
Five records come out of the true side,
so

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,547
five stores have more
than 300 customers.
