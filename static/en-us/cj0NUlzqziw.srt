Think about being in a room at night with a lamp on your desk. You drop your

2
00:00:03,323 --> 00:00:06,550
pencil under the desk. The only reason you can see the pencil is that light

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:10,516
from your desk lamp bounces off the walls, ceilings, and other surfaces. Some

4
00:00:10,516 --> 00:00:14,093
of this light makes it to beneath your desk and then gets to your eye. One

5
00:00:14,093 --> 00:00:16,676
reason we don't use lights that drop off at the square of the distance is that

6
00:00:16,676 --> 00:00:19,300
light doesn't bounce around in our scenes, but only effects what it directly

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,759
hits. Since there's no light bouncing around it dies off very quickly within

8
00:00:23,759 --> 00:00:28,382
our simplified system. We compensate for this lack of reflected light, called

9
00:00:28,382 --> 00:00:32,975
indirect illumination, by adding a fudge factor called ambient lighting. In 3JS

10
00:00:32,975 --> 00:00:36,730
we set this light by giving it a color. The light color is multiplied by the

11
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,767
material's ambient color to give a solid amount of fill color. Remember that

12
00:00:40,767 --> 00:00:45,180
the ambient color on the material is actually a separate color in 3JS. If you

13
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,742
don't set it, the color is white and the ambient light will simply add some

14
00:00:47,742 --> 00:00:51,836
grey to the object as a whole. Grey's okay but it's better if you set the

15
00:00:51,836 --> 00:00:55,520
ambient color to match the diffuse color. You can then use the ambient light's

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,519
intensity to change the feel of the scene as a whole.
