00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,400
There are two major types of malware.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,130
The first kind of malware needs
host program, meaning that

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:10,440
they have to be embedded in the host
program in order to run and spread.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,570
The second type of malware is
independent, meaning that they themself

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,980
are independent programs
that can run by themself.

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,630
We will study some of
them in this lecture and

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,246
cover the rest in the next lecture.

8
00:00:23,246 --> 00:00:25,820
When we say a malware
needs a host program,

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,190
we mean that the malware is
embedded in the existing program so

10
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,300
that you can enter program, runs on
the system and then spread from there.

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,010
There are several ways for
malware to imbed itself into a program.

12
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:46,401
For example, trap doors,
logic bombs, trojan horses,

13
00:00:46,401 --> 00:00:53,090
viruses, and malicious browser plugins
and extensions and scripts and so on.

14
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,400
And the independent malware
does not need a host program,

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,240
because this malware are complete
programs by themself.

16
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:06,091
Examples of these malware include worms,
botnets,

17
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:10,200
and advanced persistent threats,
or APTs.

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,790
We will discuss botnets and
APTs in a later lesson.
