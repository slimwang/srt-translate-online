1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,770
Now back in the Chrome browser we
have this full featured JavaScript

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,020
interpreter.

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:10,400
We can execute any arbitrary JavaScript
code like 5 + 7, which returns 12.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,360
We can also even create functions.

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,350
Here's the Start of a function that has
no parameters and is called, say_hello.

6
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,140
I start by defining the function
with the keyword function,

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,448
I give it a name and
then any parameters, I'd like.

8
00:00:23,448 --> 00:00:28,000
I'll hit Shift+Enter at the end of this
line to go down into the console and

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,950
then I'll hit Shift+Enter again
to close off my function.

10
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,070
For the body of the function, I'll
simply return the string Hello, World!

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,560
Great, notice that when I hit Return,

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,540
I get undefined returned
to me in the console.

13
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,700
Now, that doesn't mean my
function is undefined,

14
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,030
because if I start typing in the name of
the function even the first two letters,

15
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,750
I see that the JavaScript console
recognizes the function and

16
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:54,940
tries to auto complete it for me,
I can hit Tab to auto complete.

17
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,290
Now, if I leave the parenthesis
off of this function,

18
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,269
the console will simply return the
function definition that I just defined.

19
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,000
See, there's the same function.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,790
Now, this is small but
very important point.

21
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,390
The definition of a function or
what code you get executed when calling

22
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,560
the function is separate from
actually running the function.

23
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,840
If instead I add the parenthesis
at the end of the function and

24
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,720
run it, then I see I get
the string returned Hello, World!.

25
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,570
Now if your console starts to get
cluttered with a lot of output or

26
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,510
statements, you can type
clear into the console

27
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:32,010
followed by two parens
to clear the console.

28
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,150
And finally, if you hit up or
down on the arrow keys,

29
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,410
you can get a list of all the commands
that you've run through on the console.

30
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,500
So this is a quick way to
jump back to other commands

31
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,260
that you've already entered.
