1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,730
You can add a new empty table to your
database with the create table command.

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:09,900
When you create a table, you'll give
the name of the table, and the names and

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,870
the types of each column.

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:16,650
You can also set constraints on each
column and on the row as a whole.

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,320
We'll talk about constraints shortly,
but for now, let's focus on types.

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,200
Here's the simplest form of the create
table command that doesn't have any

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,330
constraints, only columns with their
types, and gives the table a name.

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,640
Now, we've dealt with text and integer
types previously, and back in lesson

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,380
two, I gave you a big, long list of lots
and lots of types that SQL supports.

10
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:40,690
The exact set of types that you can use
will vary from system to system though.

11
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:43,870
If you're working with a database system
that doesn't natively support the type

12
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:47,070
you need,
there's usually a way to work around it.

13
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,980
For instance,
PostgreSQL has a specific type for

14
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,380
IP addresses, but MySQL does not.

15
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:58,645
MySQL programmers usually use an integer
or a text string to store IP addresses.

16
00:00:58,645 --> 00:01:02,475
Of the databases we've used in this
course, PostgreSQL has a proper type for

17
00:01:02,475 --> 00:01:07,615
dates and times, but SQLite actually
just stores dates as strings.

18
00:01:07,615 --> 00:01:10,885
Database systems will often give you
shortcuts to declare a particular

19
00:01:10,885 --> 00:01:12,255
kind of column.

20
00:01:12,255 --> 00:01:16,145
For instance, in PostgreSQL, you can
have a column that stores the time and

21
00:01:16,145 --> 00:01:17,730
date along with the time zone so

22
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,670
you can do comparisons of data recorded
in different places around the world.

23
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:26,363
The full SQL standard name for that
column type is timestamp with time zone,

24
00:01:26,363 --> 00:01:32,710
but PostgreSQL lets us
abbreviate it as timestamptz.

25
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:36,250
Normally, if you're creating
a database for a new application,

26
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:40,260
you'll set up the database upfront as
part of the installation procedure.

27
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,010
It's technically possible to send create
table commands from your app code, but

28
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:47,350
it's usually a bad idea to do
that outside of initial setup.

29
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,720
Your database design is really
a part of your app's code.

30
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,030
It's just a part written in
SQL instead of in Python.

31
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,250
So, creating tables isn't like creating
values in your program's variables.

32
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,000
It's more like having your
app rewrite its own code.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,470
That's not something that's very common.
