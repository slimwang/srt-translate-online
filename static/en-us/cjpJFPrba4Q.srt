00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,730
Welcome to
the Beginning Ruby Nanodegree Program.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:03,490
I'm Walter.

3
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:04,210
>> I'm Colt.

4
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:05,067
>> And I'm Julia.

5
00:00:05,067 --> 00:00:07,100
>> And we'll be your instructors.

6
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:07,880
Nah, I'm just kidding.

7
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,690
But we are going back to
the basics in this lesson.

8
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,470
It's time to start putting what
you've learned into context.

9
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,720
We'll take a second pass at many of the
concepts you're already familiar with,

10
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,350
but this time with a bit more detail.

11
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,060
There's a big difference
between understanding

12
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,770
the fundamentals of programming
with Ruby, and being a Rubyist.

13
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,750
Each programming language
has its own philosophies and

14
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,900
ways of thinking about problems,
and Ruby's no different.

15
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,070
Let's all be Rubyists.
