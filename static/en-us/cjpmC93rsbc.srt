00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,840
For ant questions, it was fine to convert our numbers from scientific notation

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,912
to being normal decimal numbers, and then multiply them together. But what if

3
00:00:08,912 --> 00:00:12,797
the exponents were much bigger? We'd probably get lost in all the zeroes we'd

4
00:00:12,797 --> 00:00:17,602
have to write, or at least I would. I think we need a better strategy. When

5
00:00:17,602 --> 00:00:20,626
we're multiplying two numbers in scientific notation together, we can use

6
00:00:20,626 --> 00:00:25,008
something we learned about very early on in this course. It's the commutative

7
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:29,960
property of multiplication. Let's see how this works. Let's say that we want to

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,250
multiply 2 times 10 to the negative 4th, by 3 times 10 to the 3rd again. Well,

9
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,378
the commutative property of multiplication says that we can rearrange the order

10
00:00:38,378 --> 00:00:42,520
of any of these things we're multiplying together. What we actually have over

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,095
here, even though we have some grouping by parentheses right now, Is just four

12
00:00:46,095 --> 00:00:51,638
numbers multiplied. Either ignore the parentheses and just say 2 times 3 and

13
00:00:51,638 --> 00:00:57,350
then multiply that by the 10s but they're exponents. We can rearrange this so

14
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,842
that instead we multiply the 2 and the 3 together. And then we multiply the two

15
00:01:01,842 --> 00:01:06,610
factors with the bases of 10. Now what is this equal to in scientific notation?

16
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,278
Think back to the start of the course again, when we talked about how to

17
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:12,069
combine exponents, when the base is the same.
