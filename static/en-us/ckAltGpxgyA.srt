00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,690
All right.
Welcome back to Computer Vision.

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:07,430
If I'm a little less energetic than
usual I just flew back from Taiwan and

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,280
boy are my arms tired.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,190
That's like a really,

5
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:13,255
really, really, really old joke but
I really did just fly back from Taiwan.

6
00:00:13,255 --> 00:00:15,570
After spending just four days there and
back.

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,750
So if I start talking,
if I start talking quietly,

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,780
Megan'll remind me to wake up a little.

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,770
All right, today and for
the next little bit,

10
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,790
we're going to be talking
about segmentation.

11
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:29,030
And it's going to follow our
color conversation because

12
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:33,590
it's important to think about spaces in
which you're describing your pixels and

13
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:34,230
doing that and

14
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,210
the fact that you guys now know about
color spaces will make this easier.
