1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,700
Now, the switch statement here is
testing whether the spice level

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,790
integer variable is equal to
a list of possible values.

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,862
If the spice level is 0, let's go
ahead and step through the code,

4
00:00:11,862 --> 00:00:16,340
which means it doesn't equal 1,
it doesn't equal 2 or 3 or 4.

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,073
So we can skip these cases and

6
00:00:18,073 --> 00:00:21,187
that means it's going to
fall into the default case.

7
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:24,660
So we set the flavor to be not spicy.

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,200
Now what happens when
the spice level is 2?

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,360
That means it doesn't evaluate
in the first case for 1, so

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,035
we skip that case but it does equal 2.

11
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:38,685
So it falls into the second case which
sets the flavor string to be medium,

12
00:00:38,685 --> 00:00:39,860
all right.

13
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,331
Now this case is interesting.

14
00:00:41,331 --> 00:00:44,180
What happens when the spice level is 3?

15
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:50,738
Now, looking into our code, we fall into
case 3 and we set the flavor to be hot.

16
00:00:50,738 --> 00:00:51,962
But there's no break statement.

17
00:00:51,962 --> 00:00:54,553
So we're actually going to
fall into the 4th case,

18
00:00:54,553 --> 00:00:57,710
which sets the flavor
string to very hot.

19
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:02,340
Now that just means we just overrode
the flavor variable with a new value.

20
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,550
Then we hit a break statement,
which will execute our switch statement.

21
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,100
So the latest value of the flavor string
when we exit the switch statement

22
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,230
is actually very hot.

23
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,610
The last few cases
are fairly straightforward.

24
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:17,580
For a spiceLevel of 1,
the flavor is going to be mild.

25
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,630
For a spiceLevel of 4,
the flavor is also going to be very hot.

26
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,200
And then lastly, for a spiceLevel of 10,
there is no explicit case.

27
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,290
So we fall into the default case again,
and that flavor is not spicy.

28
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,210
Great work.

29
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,350
Hope you got some good practice in,

30
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,290
and feel more comfortable
with switch statements.
