Professor Mitchell, what do you think? >>You throw away the extremes, the mean is 20.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Okay, so you throw away the extremes, you arranged all points as before

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:21,000
minus 99, 13, 17, 33, 1489, we find that these are the lower quartile and upper quartile,

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
this happens to be the median--these are the numbers that are average--13, 17 and 33.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You have one more chance Tom to revise your estimate.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Okay. I'll go with 21. >>21! You did it.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Professor Mitchell from Carnegie Mellon University with us today

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
computed the quartile of this data sequence.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Thanks so much! >>Thank you. Thank you.
