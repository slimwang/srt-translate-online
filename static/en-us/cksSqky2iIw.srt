1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,070
It turns out that interval II is false and interval III is true. Let's see why.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,077
I think for the second interval, the easiest number to check would be x equals

3
00:00:08,077 --> 00:00:11,976
0. If we let x equals 0, then we know that we'll have negative 12 is greater

4
00:00:11,976 --> 00:00:17,663
than 0. We know this is a false statement. So, this means that none of the

5
00:00:17,663 --> 00:00:24,510
values between negative 3 and positive 4 would satisfy our original inequality.

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,906
We would exclude these values from our solution set. For interval III, I'm

7
00:00:28,906 --> 00:00:33,704
going to choose the number x equals 5. Now, you could have chosen any number,

8
00:00:33,704 --> 00:00:37,870
like six, eight, ten, even 14. You just want to choose one number to test in

9
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:42,629
this interval to see if it makes our inequality statement true. So plug in x

10
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:47,606
equal 5. I get the statement 8 is greater than 0. I know this is true, which

11
00:00:47,606 --> 00:00:52,828
means that all of these numbers satisfy our original condition. Great work if

12
00:00:52,828 --> 00:00:56,260
you found this to be false and this interval to be true.
