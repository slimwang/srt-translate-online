1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,050
Okay, so we talked about information
that we think is private,

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,890
also something we thought
perhaps is not private.

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,240
And then we talked about threats,

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,150
how that information can potentially
be abused while letting out privacy.

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,540
So one thing that companies do,
companies that we interact with

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,870
in the online world,
is that they have privacy policies.

7
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:28,810
So they say, if you're going to track
what you do, or we're going to keep it

8
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:34,100
from collecting information that
we think you might see as private.

9
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,473
Well, how exactly what we can do
with that, we're going to define,

10
00:00:37,473 --> 00:00:38,810
that in a privacy policy.

11
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,990
Most websites have
these privacy policies.

12
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,080
How many of us actually
looked at them carefully?

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,310
That's a different question.

14
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,570
So we going to look at one example.

15
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:52,350
Who else to go but
Google that knows a lot about you.

16
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,140
Has collects that information,
builds a profile for you.

17
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,780
So let's sort of look into what is
collected, why is it collected,

18
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,170
how can be shared.

19
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,890
This is all captured in this
policy that Google has.

20
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,230
So let's see some
details of that policy.

21
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,950
So let's start with what information
is collected about us by Google.

22
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,690
Well, all kind of personal information.

23
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,840
We agreed to give it to Google,
actually.

24
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,865
Name, email address,
credit card number, telephone number,

25
00:01:18,865 --> 00:01:23,245
G-mail now does stronger authentication,
using your telephone number.

26
00:01:23,245 --> 00:01:27,257
This is information that we provide
to Google when we set up an account,

27
00:01:27,257 --> 00:01:29,445
when we create an account.

28
00:01:29,445 --> 00:01:32,495
This is our personal information
we're giving it to Google.

29
00:01:32,495 --> 00:01:36,960
Essentially it's private information,
so what can be done with it?

30
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,790
Of course we want to address that.

31
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,400
With visit certain websites or
use Google services,

32
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,030
of course, Google will know about it,
and they can track and record it.

33
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,960
And Google's business model is
that they use it for advertising.

34
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,650
So, we know why they're doing that.

35
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:56,990
They actually have information
about your device,

36
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,890
from where are you're coming, to Google.

37
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,230
So what kind of hardware it is,
what operating system it's running,

38
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,490
its IP address,
network information, and so on.

39
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,410
So they would have that.

40
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,665
Interestingly, in the case of Google,
they would also know your

41
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:14,977
search queries, what kind of things
you look for on the internet,

42
00:02:14,977 --> 00:02:17,480
what kind of information
you're interested in.

43
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,720
If you use Google Voice, they would
know who you call, how long you talk.

44
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,520
And cookies are sort of more
general mechanism by which websites

45
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,930
keep track of various
types of information,

46
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:34,370
in particular when we register
them before and things like that.

47
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,685
So cookies,
at some state they keep on our machine,

48
00:02:38,685 --> 00:02:44,095
about what we have done with respect
to these websites in the past.

49
00:02:44,095 --> 00:02:46,665
Google actually does set cookies

50
00:02:46,665 --> 00:02:50,390
that they're going to use to track
your activities that you do.

51
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,850
They also collect your
location information,

52
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,890
what kind of applications you use.

53
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,710
All this is what is collected, okay.

54
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:02,770
So privacy policy should say this is
the information we collect about you.

55
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,600
Well this is an example of
what Google collects about you
