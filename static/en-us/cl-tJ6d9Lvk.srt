1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,460
Benchmarks are very important to computer manufacturers. So usually there

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,600
are standard organizations that put together benchmarks suites for use in

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:13,040
comparing performance between machines. So usually there is a benchmarking

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,490
organization that takes input from manufacturers assistants, from user groups,

5
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:24,150
from experts in academia, and so on, and produces a standard benchmark suite,

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,550
along with instructions on how to produce representative measurements. So

7
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:34,200
this is how we got TPC benchmarks, which are used for databases, web servers,

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,850
data mining, and other transaction processing, so called EEMBC benchmarks, which

9
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,485
are used in embedded processing, such as cars, video players, printers, phones,

10
00:00:44,485 --> 00:00:49,560
etc. So if we're testing a processor for, for example, potential use in a car,

11
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,820
we would use the EEMBC benchmarks, not the TPC. And the SPEC benchmarks,

12
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,130
which are typically used to evaluate engineering workstations and

13
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:02,195
also raw processors because these benchmarks, unlike the other two, are not very

14
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:07,630
IO-intensive. They're mostly processor oriented. So the SPEC benchmark suite

15
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:13,590
includes a number of applications, such as GCC, which represents software

16
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,700
development workloads like the compiler, several applications like BWAVES and

17
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,873
LBM that are representative fluid dynamics workloads,

18
00:01:22,873 --> 00:01:27,540
PERL which is representative of string processing applications, CACTUS ADM,

19
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,700
this is a physics simulation related to relativity. This is a parser for XML.

20
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,780
Several solvers of differential equations. BZIP, a compression application. To

21
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,320
game ai applications, and so on. As you can see the spec bench are really trying

22
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,100
to cover a variety of potential users for processors in high performance systems
