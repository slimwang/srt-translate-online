00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,391
If a is negative in the equation of this form, then the parabola opens downward.

2
00:00:04,391 --> 00:00:08,225
We saw before that the equation for the green curve was y plus 13 equals

3
00:00:08,225 --> 00:00:12,305
positive 3 times, times x plus 1 squared. And we can see that this is opening

4
00:00:12,305 --> 00:00:16,642
upward. The only thing that changed when we switched this to a negative was that

5
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:20,832
the parabola now opens downward which is graph D. Except for playing the

6
00:00:20,832 --> 00:00:25,933
opposite direction Graph D is exactly the same as graph C. It has the same shape

7
00:00:25,933 --> 00:00:28,181
and it even has the same vertex.
