1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,475
For our first problem, we'll have 24x squared and for our second problem we'll

2
00:00:04,475 --> 00:00:09,770
have 9 plus 3 times the square root of 6. Nice thinking for getting those two

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:13,800
correct. For the first problem, we just want to multiply the radicands

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,972
together. So we'll have 4 times 16, which equals 64, and x squared times x

5
00:00:17,972 --> 00:00:22,638
squared, which equals x to the 4th. The square root of 64 is 8 and the square

6
00:00:22,638 --> 00:00:28,800
root of x to the 4th is x squared. We want to make sure that we multiply these

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,456
factors that come out by 3. So we'll have 24x squared for our final result. For

8
00:00:33,456 --> 00:00:38,640
the second problem we distribute or multiply 3 root 3 times each of each these

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,940
terms. Here we'll multiply root 3 times root 3 to get 3. We still have a 3 in

10
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,606
front of these two radicals, so we'll have 3 times 3, which equals 9. Then for

11
00:00:49,606 --> 00:00:54,314
the second term, we'll have 3 root 3, times root 2. We just multiply these two

12
00:00:54,314 --> 00:00:58,556
radicals together to get 3 root 6. There's a 1 in front of the square root of

13
00:00:58,556 --> 00:01:03,536
2, which is what we multiplied the 3 by. 3 times 1 equals 3 and 3 times 2 is

14
00:01:03,536 --> 00:01:09,395
equal to 6. This one's underneath the root. We can't combine the 9 and the 3

15
00:01:09,395 --> 00:01:14,452
root 6, since 9 doesn't have a square root of 6 on the end. These aren't like

16
00:01:14,452 --> 00:01:17,483
terms. So this is our final result.
