1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,770
So let's see now if we can design a better search tree for Bob and Carol as well

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,830
so that they also can look happy.

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:13,250
As you'll remember, Bob was working on the clique problem,

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:18,460
finding a set of vertices in a graph that all were connected as much as possible,

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:23,680
so a set something like this. All vertices are connected to all other vertices.

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,720
And Carol was looking for the opposite thing, so a number of vertices

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,680
that were not connected to each other at all in a network.

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,650
So I'm going to draw this dashed line here to show that there's no connection.

9
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,070
We're actually going just to look at independent set

10
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,060
because as you'll remember, clique and independent set are so closely connected

11
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,360
that it's actually once you have an algorithm for independent set,

12
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,380
it's not that difficult to design a very similar algorithm for clique.

13
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,750
You can basically use the same techniques.

14
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,460
So in order to design a good search tree for Carol, how do we design this?

15
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,630
Actually, it's quite similar to vertex cover.

16
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,150
Remember how we defined an independent set.

17
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,450
In an independent set, no 2 vertices can be connected to each other.

18
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:10,800
We can actually play the same game that we played for vertex cover in a search tree.

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,630
So let's say you have 2 vertices, and we're going to call this one here v and this one u,

20
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,820
and the 2 vertices are connected by an edge,

21
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,830
and we're now trying to assign values of 0 and 1 to those vertices.

22
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:27,530
So 1 and 0 here, 1 and 0 here, same as for vertex cover,

23
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:32,580
only this time we are looking at assignments that would be valid for independent set

24
00:01:32,580 --> 99:59:59,999
as opposed to vertex cover.
