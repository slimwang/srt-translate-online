1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,690
So now let me tell you a little bit about the overview of this class and

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,212
how we have structured it for you.

3
00:00:06,212 --> 00:00:09,346
We're going to have these video lectures where I'm going to introduce to

4
00:00:09,346 --> 00:00:12,024
you variety of technical concepts associated with the field of

5
00:00:12,024 --> 00:00:13,350
computational photography.

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,740
Within these lectures there'll be once in a while a few quizzes, and

7
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,410
each one of them is aimed to get you more engaged with the material, and learn

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:26,280
more about different aspects of this specific discipline we're talking about.

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,630
In addition to the lectures, we've also created a variety of assignments.

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,790
There will be one assignment due almost every week throughout the whole term,

11
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,120
and in these assignments we're going to play,

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,790
have you interact with material in different ways.

13
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,640
Sometimes we'll actually have you do coding to be able to

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,310
generate computational photography artifacts.

15
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:49,110
But also how we produce artifacts that can engage with each other,

16
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,010
in a peer feedback, peer review manner.

17
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,810
There will be an exam, somewhat near the end of the term, which will cover and

18
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,258
review the concepts throughout the whole term of what we've looked in in

19
00:01:00,258 --> 00:01:01,740
computational photography.

20
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,900
Then, we will actually allow you to do a final project in an area of your

21
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,970
own choosing.

22
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,290
I will provide you with variety of different ideas on what you can do, but

23
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,159
again this is something in my many years of experience in

24
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:16,740
computational photography and teaching these concepts is the students enjoy

25
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,390
finding something free form that they can do on their own.

26
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:25,280
We have a great team of people working with me on supporting this class.

27
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,660
There will be head TA who will be interacting with you,

28
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,630
as will I, on the different types of fora made available to this class.

29
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,750
And we look forward to interacting with you throughout the whole term,

30
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,510
engaging with you in different variety of ways.

31
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:41,420
I'm excited about this class, I'm excited bringing this whole concept to you.

32
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,920
I hope you're excited in learning about it,

33
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,790
and hopefully you'll engage with me throughout the term.

34
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:49,490
The tagline I always tell everybody about computational photography,

35
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,300
have fun computing with photographs.
