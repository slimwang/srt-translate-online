00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,790
So in this lesson we've learned about two of the most commonly used methods in

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,975
psychological science, cor-relational and experimental designs. In

3
00:00:06,975 --> 00:00:10,820
correlational studies, two variables are studied such as the amount of

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,660
housework and the number of sexual encounters. As it turns out these two things

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,570
were related but remember that correlations tell us only about the strength and

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,080
direction of the relationship. Not whether one causes the other. And

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,300
experimental studies, if done correctly, can shed light on whether one variable

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:31,340
causes another. But true experiments have to have two conditions met, first,

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,830
random assignment of participants to either a control or an experimental

10
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:39,640
condition. And if these two conditions are treated exactly the same. Except the

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,730
experimental group gets the treatment, or the predicted cause, whereas the

12
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:48,460
control group, does not, and serves as a baseline comparison. By giving two

13
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,770
groups different amounts of something, we're manipulating a variable. And this

14
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:55,400
leads to the second condition of an experiment. So the second condition of an

15
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,220
experiment is manipulation of an independent variable. And an independent

16
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,050
variable, we'll remember, is something that the investigator manipulates. So

17
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:06,950
for instance, the amount of caffeine given. The experiment also has a dependent

18
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:11,230
variable, or an outcome variable, in this case, it could be reaction time. So

19
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,700
if the amount of caffeine really does have an effect, we can say that our

20
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,220
independent variable, or caffeine, is the cause. And the dependent variable, or

21
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:24,220
reaction time, is the effect. And it depends upon the independent variable. So,

22
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,980
psychological scientists use these and many other kinds of research methods.

23
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,950
But the key is that psychology makes use of the scientific method to answer

24
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,720
questions about human nature, human thought, and human behavior. So,

25
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,270
psychological scientists can't do whatever they want in their research. They

26
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:44,530
have to do what's ethical and their proposals always have to be approved By an

27
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,946
ethics board or an IRB.
