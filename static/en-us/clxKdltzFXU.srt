00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,380
The words virtual and virtualization are

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:05,190
popular these days. From virtual worlds and

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,838
virtual reality to applications level virtual machines

4
00:00:08,838 --> 00:00:12,360
like Dalvik or Java's virtual machine. What

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,130
we are concerned with here are virtual platforms. And by platform we mean an

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:24,840
operating system running on top of some hardware. Let's say Alice has her own

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,980
company, Alice Inc. And she has some cool applications to run for productivity.

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,490
And let's say that they're running on a Windows

9
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:39,770
machine, on some server that the company maintains. Now,

10
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,780
if cost were not an issue, then this will be the ideal situation for Alice

11
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:49,930
Inc. The hope of virtualization is that we will

12
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:54,590
be able to give a company perhaps not as well

13
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:59,470
endured as Alice Inc., lets's say Bala Inc., almost the

14
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:04,819
same experience that Alice Inc., gets at a fraction of the

15
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:10,150
cost. So, instead of a real platform that Alice Inc., has,

16
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:15,240
Bala Inc., gets a virtual platform. Now, in this diagram,

17
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,700
what I've shown you is a black box

18
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,660
to represent the virtual platform. Because, so far as

19
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:24,210
Bala Inc., is concerned, they don't really care what

20
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,230
goes on inside this black box? All they want

21
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:32,500
is to make sure that the apps that they want to run can run on top of this

22
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,770
virtual platform. in other words, as long as the

23
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:41,030
platform affords the same capabilities and the same abstractions

24
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,960
for running the applications that Bala Inc., wants he is happy. Now,

25
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,840
we however as aspiring operating system designers are

26
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,670
very much interested in what goes on inside this black

27
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,830
box. We want to know how we can give Bala Inc., the

28
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:06,750
illusion of having his own platform without actually giving him one.

29
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,690
And including all of the cost, the implementation

30
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:16,530
and maintenance associated with implementing such a virtual platform.
