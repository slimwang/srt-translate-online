1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,896
The internet supports heterogeneity through the

2
00:00:02,896 --> 00:00:07,490
TCP/IP protocol stack. TCP/IP was designed as

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,880
a monolithic transport, where TCP provided flow

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,260
control and reliable delivery, and IP provided

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,810
universal forwarding. Now it became clear

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,380
that not every application needed reliable in

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,670
order delivery. For example, streaming voice and

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,540
video. Often perform well, even if not

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,880
every packet is delivered. And the domain

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,620
name system, which converts domain names to

11
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,210
IP addresses, often also doesn't need completely

12
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,860
reliable in order delivery. Fortunately, the narrow

13
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,450
waste of IP allowed the proliferation of

14
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,190
many different transport protocols, not just TCP.

15
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,630
The second way that the internet's design

16
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,570
accomodates Hetergeneity is through a best-effort service

17
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:55,230
model, whereby the network can lose packets, deliver them out of order, and

18
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,330
doesn't really provide any quality guarantees.

19
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,380
It also doesn't provide information about failures,

20
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,760
performance, et cetera. On the plus side, this makes for a simple design,

21
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,500
but it also makes certain kinds

22
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,150
of debugging and network management more difficult.
