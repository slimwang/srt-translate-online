1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,859
So, that was the last step!

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:03,260
>> Woo hoo, congratulations!

3
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:04,650
You're done with the course!

4
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:05,730
>> For sure a great work.

5
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,900
>> Those were some really
advanced concepts, and

6
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,210
you got through all of them.

7
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,470
>> Yeah, and quite a lot, I might add,
in a short amount of time.

8
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,740
You learned how to make a network
request to a web server

9
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,320
using a background thread and then you
learned how to parse the JSON response.

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,630
And then last and probably most
important is you've learned to surface

11
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,461
that data to the user in a pleasing way?

12
00:00:23,461 --> 00:00:27,407
>> We really hope that you'll continue
building on what you've learned in this

13
00:00:27,407 --> 00:00:30,269
course by creating other apps
that connect to web APIs.

14
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:33,183
>> All right that's a wrap.

15
00:00:33,183 --> 00:00:35,970
>> Wait, what?

16
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,659
>> Hey is someone going to let us out?

17
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:40,365
>> I'm hungry.

18
00:00:40,365 --> 00:00:42,451
>> Me too.
