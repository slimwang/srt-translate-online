1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,730
In order to get continuous updates,
the first thing you need to do

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,050
is ensure that your activity
is a LocationListener.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,290
So you'll have to
implement this interface.

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,708
You can find it in
com.google.android.gms.location.Locatio-

5
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:14,665
nListener.

6
00:00:14,665 --> 00:00:16,675
If you don't want all of this
in your class declaration,

7
00:00:16,675 --> 00:00:18,865
of course you can just
import the name space and

8
00:00:18,865 --> 00:00:21,795
then extend LocationListener,
and that should work well.

9
00:00:21,795 --> 00:00:26,055
You'll also need a module level
variable for the location request.

10
00:00:26,055 --> 00:00:29,455
So be sure to add it at the top of
your code along with all the others.

11
00:00:29,455 --> 00:00:33,240
It should look something like this,
protected LocationRequest and

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,430
you give it a variable name.

13
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,040
In my case,
I've called mLocationRequest.

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,430
Once you have that in your on connected,
instead of just getting the last

15
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:44,500
location, you would setup a location
request class with an interval for

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,690
polling the location services.

17
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:50,060
You'd then request location updates,
calling back to this activity.
