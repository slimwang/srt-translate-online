00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,880
Jake did you get this working?

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,830
>> Yeah.
It's one of the ones that takes a little

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,770
bit more thinking than actual typing.

4
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,910
First I'm going to bring the server
online, then refresh the page.

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,050
This is our current 404 page that
we want to display a gif instead.

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,820
Over in the code, now if you
return a promise within a promise,

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,010
it passes the eventual
value to the outer promise.

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:26,720
Now I know that sounds kind of like
a proverb Mr Miyagi would say but

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,310
here's what I mean.

10
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,130
Rather than return a response
I'm going to return a fetch for

11
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,610
the gif''s URL and that's it.

12
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,390
Over in the browser if I refresh
the 404 page I get the gif.

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,535
But if I load a non-404 page,
everything works fine.

14
00:00:42,535 --> 00:00:45,770
Okay, it's been fun
playing with the stuff.

15
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,900
But it's time to start putting it into
practice and do something useful.

16
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,255
In the next chapter,

17
00:00:50,255 --> 00:00:54,180
we'll start doing the real work
to make Wittr offline first.
