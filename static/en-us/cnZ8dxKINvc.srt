Here's a quiz.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:08,000
How can I tell wether a point p, is on a line, L, in the image, okay?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,700
So I gave you a line and I gave you a point, how can I tell?

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,390
Well, that's easy, I can just a, take the cross product and see if that's zero.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,150
Okay. B, no, no,

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,740
no, no, no, you want to take the dot product and see if that's zero.

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,660
C, check they're both three vectors, right, so

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,295
I can add them, and check them if the magnitude of the sum is greater than 1.
