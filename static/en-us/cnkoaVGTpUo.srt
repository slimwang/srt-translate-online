00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,500
Awesome.
Look at how much sunshine I can have on

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,770
my home screen now.

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,750
Wonderful, wonderful sunshine.

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:08,950
No, no.

5
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,880
Not rain, no, no, no.

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,600
Well, at least now I know.

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,110
This widget is already paying off.

8
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,590
Now, not every user is as
sunshine obsessed as I am.

9
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,810
The important part is now we've created
an outlet for our biggest fans and

10
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,185
made their life more amazing.

11
00:00:25,185 --> 00:00:29,650
It may be a single feature you build out
that causes those users to rave about

12
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:33,570
your app to all their friends and
grow the next group of happy customers.
