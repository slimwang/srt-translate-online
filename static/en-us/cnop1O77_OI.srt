00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,609
Here's my answer.

2
00:00:01,609 --> 00:00:04,460
The first thing I did,
was to fill in the diagonals.

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,310
These should all be 0 unless
there's a negative cycle.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,490
Thankfully, there's only one
negative path found so far, and

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,550
I can easily check that it
doesn't create a negative cycle.

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,260
When we use 4 as an intermediate vertex,

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:22,080
I could go from 3 to 4,
that would cost -3.

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,007
But going back from 4 to 3 would cost 6,
and so

9
00:00:25,007 --> 00:00:29,030
then the overall cost would
be 3 which is greater than 0.

10
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,350
0 is better.

11
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:35,418
Next, I filled in the values where 4
was either a source or a destination,

12
00:00:35,418 --> 00:00:41,580
since vertex 4 can't help as an
intermediate vertex in those situations.

13
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,670
Now for the remaining entries.

14
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,481
The choices for going from 1 to 3
are either to use the old path,

15
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:51,347
which costs 4, or to go from 1 to 4.

16
00:00:51,347 --> 00:00:54,990
And then from 4 to 3, that costs 7.

17
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,410
So, the old path is better.

18
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,360
How about going 2 to 1?

19
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,860
Well, there is no old path.

20
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,470
But there is a path through 4.

21
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,790
I could go from 2 to 4,
that would cost 1.

22
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:12,540
And then from 4 to 1, which would
cost 2 more, for a total of 3.

23
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,140
That's good.

24
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:18,921
Going from 2 to 3 was impossible before,
but

25
00:01:18,921 --> 00:01:23,955
using vertex 4,
I can go 2 to 4 for a cost of 1.

26
00:01:23,955 --> 00:01:28,600
And then 4 to 2 for
a cost of 6 more for a total of 7.

27
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,460
3 to 1 is another path that's
impossible without going through 4.

28
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,623
But if I do go through 4,
then going 3 to 4 costs -3.

29
00:01:37,623 --> 00:01:41,750
And going 4 to 1 costs 2,
for a total of -1.

30
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,574
Lastly, we have that going from
3 to 2 used to cost 2, but

31
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:51,794
we can improve on that,
by going to 4 first, which costs -3.

32
00:01:51,794 --> 00:01:56,856
And then going form 4 to 2,
which costs 1, for a total of -2.

33
00:01:56,856 --> 00:01:58,300
And that completes the answer.
