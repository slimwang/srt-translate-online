00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,750
Having covered how machines communicate across a local area

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,600
network, we now turn our attention to how they communicate

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,140
across the internet and the network layer of our

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,020
hierarchy. Whereas other layers use a variety of technologies and

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:16,219
protocols, the network layer really only uses IP, which

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,140
is short for internet protocol. Every machine on the internet

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,530
proper gets a unique 32 bit address. Which is usually

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,830
written out as four decimal numbers between 0 and 255.

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,930
So, for example, 72.14.248.239 is currently the

10
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,350
IP address for Udacity's home page. Ranges of

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,380
addresses are allocated by regional internet registries. All

12
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,910
of which, are under control by IANA, the

13
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:44,360
International Assign Numbers Authority. The range of themselves

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,280
are commonly specified by a 32 bit IP

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,320
followed by a slash, and then the number

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,750
of bits understood to specify the network ID.

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,610
This is referred to as CIDR notation. The first, number of bits of

18
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,830
the 32, specify the range and then the rightmost bits specify

19
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:06,878
the particular host. For example, MIT was allocated long ago the

20
00:01:06,878 --> 00:01:11,880
range, 18.0.0.0 slash 8. Meaning

21
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,760
that any IP starting with 18 belongs to MIT. There are

22
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,510
about 2 to the 24th of them.

23
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,460
Georgia Tech has the range 130.207.0.0/16 meaning that

24
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:30,890
any IP starting with 130.207 belongs to Georgia Tech. There are about 2 to the

25
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:35,980
16th of those because there are 16 unspecified bits in this range. At the time

26
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,510
of this recording a New Jersey company called

27
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:45,160
Linode has been allocated the address range 50.116.48.0/20.

28
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:51,496
So this gives them 12 bits of host, and the range 50.116.48.0

29
00:01:51,496 --> 00:01:56,026
to 50.116.63.255. Again about two to

30
00:01:56,026 --> 00:02:00,357
the 12th IPs. IPs have become a precious commodity these days, as most all

31
00:02:00,357 --> 00:02:02,750
of them have been allocated. And not very

32
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,039
efficiently. For instance, tech savvy as they are,

33
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:11,050
MIT is probably not using all 2 to the 24th, or 16 million of it's addresses.

34
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,930
One solution to this problem is simply to

35
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,720
expanded the address space to use more bits. The

36
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,750
new internet protocol, called IPv6, the old one

37
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,210
is call IPv4, uses 128 bit addresses. The problem

38
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,910
is that IPV4 is so universal, and so

39
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,350
many other systems depend on it, that adoption of

40
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,940
the new protocol has been slow. And I encourage

41
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,460
you to read more about this on your own.
