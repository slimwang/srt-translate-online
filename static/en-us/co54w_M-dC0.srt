1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:09,160
So fundamental to our notion of imaging is our projection operation.

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,120
And today we're going to talk about modelling projection.

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,340
So first we're going to talk a little bit about the coordinate system.

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,110
What we'll see here is the coordinate system we're using for

5
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,370
our pinhole a, approximation.

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,910
The first thing is that we're going to put the optical center of projection at

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,200
the origin.

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,100
So here's our little COP, center of projection.

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:32,689
And that's also going to be the origin of our camera coordinate system.

10
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:35,470
Also with our center of projection at the origin, we're going to

11
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:39,420
use a standard x y coordinate system for the stuff we're going to show here.

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,590
So now we're back in the land of mathematics.

13
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:46,260
So x and y are like regular xyz, so x will go to the right and

14
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,460
y is going to go up.

15
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,320
Later when you convert this to images you're going to have to

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,340
worry about making that flip.

17
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,890
Now, here's something a little strange.

18
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,710
We're going to, as we were talking about before in cameras,

19
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,840
normally a light comes in,

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,040
goes through the focal point of the lens and then hits the image plane.

21
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,360
But in our mathematics here, what we're going to do is we're going to put

22
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,940
the image plane here, in front of the coordinate system.

23
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,670
As if the light sort of magically knows how to pass through the image and

24
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,590
hit the coordinate system in just the right place.

25
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,120
So why do we do this?

26
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,629
Well, because it's mathematically convenient,

27
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:27,583
because this way our images don't get inverted, y stays up, all right?

28
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:30,499
Before we had to worry about things being switched left and right and

29
00:01:30,499 --> 00:01:31,380
up and down.

30
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,820
Well now, x stays to the right, y stays up.

31
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,440
And we don't really build a camera with the image plane in the front.

32
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,510
We put the cam, the image plane behind, and

33
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,770
then we have to rotate things back to get y up and x to the right.

34
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,140
So for the math here, we're going to put the image plane on the right.

35
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,288
Now, one of the implications of this x y coordinate system, in order for

36
00:01:51,288 --> 00:01:54,416
this to remain a right-handed coordinate system, so

37
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:56,667
you remember x, y, that this way is z.

38
00:01:56,667 --> 00:02:01,229
What it means is that z is now pointing in from the camera,

39
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:03,590
not out to the world.

40
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,760
So, here, here's z pointing this way, all right?

41
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,758
Sometimes this matters, sometimes this doesn't.

42
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,270
You see here we wrote down that the world's position of some point was x,

43
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,010
y, and z.

44
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,450
And we didn't say negative z.

45
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,600
Well that's because it's a z value, which could be negative 20.

46
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,410
And we can go back and forth on this.

47
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:24,020
But basically, in order to keep a right-handed coordinate system and everything

48
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,170
sort of not have to worry too much about how we do the matrix multiplication and

49
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,000
stuff like that.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,900
We have that z goes negative the further away that you get.

51
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,620
So what's going on here?

52
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,670
So what we have here, we have our world point here.

53
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,700
All right, so here's our point in the world, and

54
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,630
the ray projects down, to the center of projection.

55
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,711
Normally our image plane would be back here, but we're going to say.

56
00:02:45,711 --> 00:02:49,662
So, the idea is that, that ray intersects the image plane at this point,

57
00:02:49,662 --> 00:02:52,430
which we're going to call x prime, y prime.

58
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,640
And it's written as minus d because the idea is that the distance,

59
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,760
like the focal length distance,

60
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,450
the distance d from the origin to the image plane, that's a positive distance.

61
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,580
So what that means is that the location of this point is going to be x prime,

62
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,960
y prime, minus d.
