00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,392
So we just spent a lot of time talking about domain, range, and all sorts of

2
00:00:04,392 --> 00:00:08,996
functions. I'd like to do a sort of review quiz over what a function really is

3
00:00:08,996 --> 00:00:14,475
conceptually. We've talked about this in a lot of different contexts. Solving

4
00:00:14,475 --> 00:00:18,105
this would be a good way to bridge the many different things that you're learned

5
00:00:18,105 --> 00:00:22,626
about functions. So which of these choices correctly describe functions? You can

6
00:00:22,626 --> 00:00:26,590
check off as many as you like. Does a function map each element of the domain to

7
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:30,676
at least one element of the range? Does it map each element of the domain to

8
00:00:30,676 --> 00:00:35,460
exactly one element of the range? Does it relate a set of inputs to a set of

9
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,159
outputs? Does it have to have a defined value for any real number that we want

10
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,856
to use as input? And is a function the same as any equation with two variables?
