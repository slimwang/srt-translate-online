1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,044
Remember that our degrees of freedom will be the sum of the two sample sizes, 6

2
00:00:05,044 --> 00:00:09,528
plus 5, and then minus 2, because we subtract for this sample and one for this

3
00:00:09,528 --> 00:00:17,642
sample. We get our degrees of freedom is 9. Now, when we look at the t table,

4
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:23,285
we see that our t critical value should be positive or negative 2.262.
