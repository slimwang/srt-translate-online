00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,461
Before I can write the code, I need to figure out exactly what each of these

2
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:05,880
corners is, so that I can think about the end points of each of the lines I

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:14,146
need to draw are. This line's pretty easy, it goes from 20, 30 to 50, 10. This

4
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:18,486
one's a little bit trickier, this point is at the same height as that one, so

5
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:24,340
it's at 10. And it's 100 to the right from 50. That means that its x value is

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:29,994
matching up with this one, so that looks good. This point is 100 over from this

7
00:00:29,994 --> 00:00:39,220
one. So, 100 plus 20. And this point, gives us 120, 30. And this point is 40,

8
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:46,642
down from this one. So 120, and 70. So we got that first line. Now the second

9
00:00:46,642 --> 00:00:58,669
one. Is from 50, 10 to 150, 10. This line is 120, 30 to 150, 10. This line is

10
00:00:58,669 --> 00:01:12,658
150, 10 to 150, 50. And this line. 120, 70 to 150, 50. The rectangle has its

11
00:01:12,658 --> 00:01:19,217
top length here, and it gives us the width and the height. So we know how to

12
00:01:19,217 --> 00:01:22,444
specify that one. Here's how I wrote the code to draw the crate. There's a

13
00:01:22,444 --> 00:01:29,370
rectangle, which is that front face. Top left 20, 30, width 100, height 40.

14
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:33,670
Then there's that leftmost line. 20, 30 to match the point that it starts at

15
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:39,920
and 50,10 to match the point that it ends at. Then I did the same thing with

16
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:47,028
the top line, middle line, the rightmost line, and the bottom one. Then I had

17
00:01:47,028 --> 00:01:50,798
to remember to draw each of these lines. And if I run this program, it draws

18
00:01:50,798 --> 00:01:55,671
the three dimensional crate that I wanted. Good work if you got that. That was

19
00:01:55,671 --> 00:01:59,552
a lot of getting all of the right coordinates in place. But if you did that,

20
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,019
you should be pretty familiar with drawing lines now.
