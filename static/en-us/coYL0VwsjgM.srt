00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here's the scenario I have in mind. We have three mixers.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
At each stage, we validate 1/5 of the votes, and we have to audit the last one.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We don't have another mixer here.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We need some designated output auditor that receives these outputs

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
as well as these and audits the last one.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That's our three-step mix net. At the end of this, some votes are revealed.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The question is if an eavesdropper, who can observe messages along all these channels

8
00:00:28,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and observe all of them, can determine which voter cast this vote.
