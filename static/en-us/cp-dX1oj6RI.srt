1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,400
So what the union bound gives us,
then, is this idea that if each of

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:08,490
the arms individually has a certainty
of one minus delta over k,

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,820
then all k of them together have
a certainty of at least one minus delta.

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,380
So that was what we wanted.

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,780
And now the last thing that we want
is to know that the arm that we pick

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,110
is within epsilon of optimal.

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:20,791
So what gives us that?

8
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:26,063
Well, I mean, the idea is that whatever
true the optimal is in this case,

9
00:00:26,063 --> 00:00:30,158
it might be at the bottom of
a bar's range, for example.

10
00:00:30,158 --> 00:00:32,850
>> Whatever's optimal cannot be
at the bottom of a bar's range.

11
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,050
>> Yes good point.

12
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,090
But it could be at
the top of the wrong bar.

13
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:37,910
>> Right.
>> Not the bar

14
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,090
that we think is the highest.

15
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,395
So here we think that this bar here,
this third bar, is the highest, but

16
00:00:42,395 --> 00:00:46,470
its true value might actually be
all the way down at its bottom.

17
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,730
Whereas, some other bar that looks lower
than it's true value might be, actually,

18
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:51,700
much closer to the top.

19
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,340
So the worst case is what happens is
we have one bar that is infinitesimally

20
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,350
above another bar, we just pick it.

21
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,820
Because it's slightly better.

22
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,460
But in fact,
its actual value is down at the bottom.

23
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,980
Whereas we failed to pick this other
arm that has the optimal in it, and

24
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,910
that optimal's at the top of its range.

25
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,700
So the most we can be off,
you know we picked this arm,

26
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,935
the most that that arm can be off is the
height of the bar, which is is epsilon.

27
00:01:13,935 --> 00:01:14,690
>> Right.

28
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:15,650
So that makes sense,

29
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:19,500
although I don't think it has
to be infinitesimally lower.

30
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,180
>> You're saying if it's just a dead
tie and we picked arbitrarily.

31
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,090
>> because you gotta pick one of them.

32
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,830
>> That's true, and
we could pick the wrong one.

33
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,380
>> Right, and the wrong one could have
been as far off as possible, and the one

34
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,492
that we didn't pick could've been as far
off as possible in the right direction.

35
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:33,660
>> Cool. Okay. >> And then still,

36
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,040
you'd be epsilon away,
as opposed to epsilon minus epsilon.

37
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,430
>> Epsilon minus epsilon,
which I feel like is small.

38
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,180
Okay.

39
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:39,940
All right, excellent.

40
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,620
So that gives us both pieces here.

41
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,810
That means that if we can just figure
out how many times to sample an arm, so

42
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,310
that the guarantee that we
have is that the value that we

43
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:54,020
predict is within epsilon over two,
with confidence one minus delta over k.

44
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,970
Then putting all those estimates
together is going to get

45
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:01,220
us an arm that is epsilon optimal,
with probability one minus delta.

46
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,700
>> That's perfect.
And we know how many to sample.

47
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,480
>> We do.
We're just going to do

48
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,680
a little bit of algebra and we're there.

49
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,180
>> Okay, cool.
