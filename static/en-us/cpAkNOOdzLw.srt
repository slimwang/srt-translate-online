1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,480
So the question is, why does this not

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:04,620
work? Why does multiplying empty list times n buckets

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,310
not produce what we need for the empty hash

4
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,280
table? And the possible answers are, because it's too

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,720
easy, and we like doing things the hard way.

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,560
Because each element in the output refers to the

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,790
same empty list, or because the store operator means

8
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,800
something different for lists than it does for strings.
