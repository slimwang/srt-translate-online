1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,365
Okay, if we take our t value and square it and put that in the numerator, that

2
00:00:04,365 --> 00:00:10,922
is 4. If we take t and square it again, that is a 4 again. And we add our

3
00:00:10,922 --> 00:00:17,080
degrees of freedom we should get 4 over 4 plus 20. That gives us 4 over 24. And

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,350
if we divide 24 into 4 and round to two decimal places, that gives us 0.17 or

5
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:31,723
17%. Let's try another couple of examples. 4 squared is 16. That goes in the

6
00:00:31,723 --> 00:00:34,791
numerator. Put 16 again into the denominator, and we're going to add 10 to

7
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:37,604
that. That gives us 16 over 26. And if we divide 16 by 26 and round it two

8
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:47,135
decimals, that gives us 0.62 or 62%. Third example, well, 1 squared is 1. That

9
00:00:47,135 --> 00:00:55,556
goes in the numerator. Put that again in the denominator. We're to add 9 to

10
00:00:55,556 --> 00:01:04,806
that. That gives us 1 over 10, which is .10, which is 10%. So, in each of these

11
00:01:04,806 --> 00:01:10,379
examples, we see how to get r squared. And I convert it from a proportion to a

12
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:14,372
percentage and now let's now interpret that. For number one, we'd say that we

13
00:01:14,372 --> 00:01:17,544
can explain 17% of the variation in our deep ended variable by knowing our

14
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:24,096
other variable. Here we can explain 62%. Here we can explain 10%. Obviously

15
00:01:24,096 --> 00:01:27,819
we're explaining more variation in this example than the other two.
