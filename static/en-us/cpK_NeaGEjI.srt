00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,410
Great job.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,930
Let's review what we've
done in this lesson.

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,510
First, we made an interactive
prototype using InVision.

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,950
Second, we changed it in reaction
to our first round of feedback.

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:16,020
Next, we shared it with subject
matter experts and users.

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,620
Finally, we got feedback using
our interactive prototype.

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,260
>> In the next lesson, we'll talk
about how to bring your prototype to

8
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,720
an engineer to think
about getting it built.

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,150
We'll also talk about how to continue to
iterate your prototype through the rest

10
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,620
of the process.

11
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,350
Finally, we'll talk about
using your app prototype

12
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,660
to talk about your app with investors or
other people interested.

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,780
See you in Lesson Three.
