00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,540
To help me make the point about what a digital image is,

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:07,860
here I've taken a sample image of the Georgia Tech mascot Buzz,

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,930
in of course his wonderful, colorful glory here.

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,960
What we interested in now actually start looking at and easing apart

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,100
various aspect of an image, for example, a square image like this one.

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,160
Just to help us along, I've actually converted this image into a grayscale

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,800
image, which basically means that the whole image is now represented not in

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,710
color, but just the different aspects of the gray values of an image,

9
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:36,772
the basically, the range from a white pixel or white color, to a black color.

10
00:00:36,772 --> 00:00:41,220
And this basically now is showing a black and white or a gray-scale image.

11
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,350
Now, mostly we will be looking at these images and

12
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,700
trying to represent them in a coordinate space here.

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,970
I'm referring to the x and

14
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:52,690
y coordinate space, which basically allows us to be able to traverse this image

15
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:57,470
in this axis which is x, and in this axis which is y.

16
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,534
And the interest in doing this is because now I'll be able to kind of

17
00:01:00,534 --> 00:01:02,950
count down in some instances.

18
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,620
If you start thinking of this as basically different columns and

19
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,720
different rows of the image.

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,950
So I'd go down each and every column, until I come here, wrap around and

21
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:17,170
I would actually start looking for other columns going down row by row.

22
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,780
So this is one of the representations we want to start looking at, and

23
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:27,250
how do we best kind of represent and image in a form that allows us to,

24
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:32,630
in a raster scan format, traverse each and every element of that image.

25
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,650
So now that we know the axes of this image,

26
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,760
let's look at the dimensions of this image.

27
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,320
So here, I show you the whole box that represents this image.

28
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,300
And of course the easiest way to reference this box would be through width and

29
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,840
the height of the image.

30
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,160
Width represents the number of columns that would exist in this image,

31
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,530
and the height represents the number of rows that represent this image.

32
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:05,320
This is a square image, a classic image, and each of the basic width of this im,

33
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,169
image is 512 pixels and the height is 512 pixels.

34
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:15,110
And if you just do the simple math of trying to take 512 width and 500 high,

35
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,970
512 pixels height you basically get an image that has about 262,000 pixels.

36
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,910
And this converts it into a 0.26 megapixel image.

37
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:30,420
And this is an approximate number of pixels, megapixels this image has.

38
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,500
So, this is basically one of the ways of,

39
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,490
the simplest ways of representing an image where we need to know the width and

40
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,410
the height and how we'd be traversing it.
