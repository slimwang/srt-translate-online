00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,730
Now the first thing to notice about open is

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,670
that we did not import anything in our code

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,690
to this function. In contrast, when we had to

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:12,840
use a function like rename. We said, import OS,

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,780
but not with this function. This is because functions

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,820
like open are so commonly used in Python that

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,620
they are always available. Don't take my word for

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,970
it. Let's look for it in the Python documentation.
