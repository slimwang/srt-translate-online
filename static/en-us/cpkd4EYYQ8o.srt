00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,990
Let's first briefly
review how the web works.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,370
The web browser and

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,200
the web server communicate using
the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,860
The browser requests
documents through a URL.

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:22,160
The server responds with document in
hypertext markup language, or HTML.

6
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,782
Roots can include, not just the text,
but also graphics,

7
00:00:27,782 --> 00:00:31,585
video, audio, Postscript,
JavaScript, etc.

8
00:00:31,585 --> 00:00:36,940
The browser displays HTML documents and
embedded graphics.

9
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,030
It can run JavaScript and
other helper applications.
