1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,260
We can create a new user by
using the adduser command.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:07,400
This is an administrator feature,
so we'll have to use sudo as well.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,280
Let's go ahead and
create a new user named student.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,140
We'll then be asked to enter
a password for the student.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,490
I just used the word student,
but as you can see,

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,290
in these password fields,
you don't see what you're typing.

7
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,580
We're then asked the number of
additional questions about the user.

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,910
All of these are optional,
so you can ignore them.

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,004
But I'm going to go ahead, and

10
00:00:28,004 --> 00:00:30,656
add a bit more additional information
here in the Full Name section.

11
00:00:35,718 --> 00:00:37,430
And that's all there is to it.

12
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,110
We can confirm this user was created
by using the finger command.
