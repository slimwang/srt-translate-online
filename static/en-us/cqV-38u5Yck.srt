00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In this final question, I'm going to quiz you about our approximate motion model

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
for this robot, which I restate.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'd like you to apply this exact motion model over here even though you might be suspicious

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
of its accuracy.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Suppose a time, t = 0, coordinates are 0, 0, and 0 for all 3 variables.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Delta t = 4. I'll admit the units over here.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
v = 10 and omega = pi/8, which is 22.5 degrees in degrees.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Assuming you run one these simulations exactly every 4 time steps,

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I would like to know what the mobile state is after 4 of those updates,

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
or put differently, total time of 16.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So please tell me, what x will be, y, and theta.
