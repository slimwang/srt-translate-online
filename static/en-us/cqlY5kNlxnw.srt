1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,673
So now, I want you to place the following activities in the appropriate boxes

2
00:00:03,673 --> 00:00:08,701
on the consciousness chart. Deep sleep, coma, practicing the piano, lucid

3
00:00:08,701 --> 00:00:14,400
dreaming, which means knowing that you are dreaming, and vegetative state.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,152
Place the appropriate number in the appropriate box on this chart of awareness

5
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:24,296
and wakefulness. Remember, farther up means you're really aware, farther down

6
00:00:24,296 --> 00:00:29,057
means you're not aware. Farther to the right means you're really awake, farther

7
00:00:29,057 --> 00:00:31,829
to the left means you're not awake.
