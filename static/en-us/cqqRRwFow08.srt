00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
For a given amount of money put in there is at most one possibility for the

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,380
amount of candy that machine will dispense. This makes a lot of sense if you

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,325
think about real life and how machines like this would work. If you put a dollar

4
00:00:11,325 --> 00:00:15,178
in the machine, a certain amount candy will come out. And the next time you put

5
00:00:15,178 --> 00:00:18,958
a dollar in, that same amount of candy will come out again since the price for

6
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:22,712
the candy is set. If this first choice with the case, then any given amount of

7
00:00:22,712 --> 00:00:26,523
money could spit out a ton of different amounts of candy. It wouldn't be a very

8
00:00:26,523 --> 00:00:29,990
fair machine. And people would probably get really frustrated and not buy candy

9
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:30,713
from it anymore.
