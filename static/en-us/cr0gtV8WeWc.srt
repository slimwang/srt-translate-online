00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,320
So in this lecture, we will now actually try to make concrete sum of

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,939
the frameworks we've looked at previously.

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:11,980
Remembering again, that using light and using that light to create images.

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,520
In this one what I'm going to do is showcase a specific example,

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,050
the example we will look at is referred to as dual photography.

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,570
Whereby using computer control of a light source and

7
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:27,090
a computer control of a camera, we will be able to extract a newer form of

8
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,500
imagery that was not available to us using traditional photography as a medium.
