1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
[Male narrator] The answer is that we add 1 more path, the path to Bucharest.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We don't add the path going back because it's in the explored list,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
but we don't terminate it yet.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
True, we have added a path that ends in Bucharest,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
but the goal test isn't applied when we add a path to the frontier.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Rather, it's applied when we remove that path from the frontier,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and we haven't done that yet.
