1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,520
So what answers did you come up with,
David?

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,900
>> So we knew that because the boat
is traveling from the right back to

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,010
the left, that the boat is going to be
on the left in each of the next states,

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:08,970
so we didn't even ask for that.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,600
In the top state, the only things we
could do are move both people back,

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,500
just the guard back, or
just the prisoner back.

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,620
Moving both back would just take
us back to our original state, so

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,050
while it's legal, it's not productive.

9
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,980
Moving just our prisoner back would have
more prisoners on the left than guards,

10
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,710
so that wouldn't be a legal move.

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,150
So our only move is to move
our guard back to the left.

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,690
Similarly on the bottom, we could either
move both prisoners back to the left, or

13
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:36,860
just one.

14
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,290
Moving both would take us back to our
original state which isn't productive.

15
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,129
Moving just one, then,
is our only legal next state.

16
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:44,670
>> That was a good answer, David.

17
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,000
Thank you.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,800
Note David, that these two
states that he came up with,

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,030
the one at the top here and one at
the bottom here, are in fact identical.

20
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:57,550
And because they're identical, therefore
we can collapse them into one state.

21
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,000
So, now we get the representation
shown in this figure,

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,540
the two states have been
collapsed into one.

23
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,340
>> So in this semantic network, we don't
really care how we got into a state,

24
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,850
just as long as we know
what state we're in.

25
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,770
And that makes sense in this
problem solving process.

26
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,710
Once we're in this state, we don't
care if we got to it this way, or

27
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,330
this way, all we care about is
the current state of the problem.
