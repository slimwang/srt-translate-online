1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now let's add the landmark.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's say the landmark is being seen at all time steps.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Let's say in the very first time the difference between position and landmark is 10.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Obviously this is a 1-dimensional example

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and not 2-dimensional as the picture suggests over here.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Then it's 5, and then it's 2.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Now, what's the landmark position?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You can work this out in your head. It's a single number.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
