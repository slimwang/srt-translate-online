1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And the answer is 97.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It's easy to see that the action east

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
is the value maximizing action.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Let's plug in east over here. Gamma equals 1.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is a single successor state of 100,

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
so if we have 100 over here minus the 3

7
00:00:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that it costs us to get there, we get 97.
