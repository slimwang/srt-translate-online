1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,900
Let's start with Medium.

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:05,980
As the page gets larger,
we can see that the text reflows.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,330
That's good, but
that's not a breakpoint.

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,370
But, once the viewport is wide enough,

5
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,100
we see that the images got larger and,
so did the text.

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,850
That's a breakpoint.

7
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,380
Once the viewport is this wide,

8
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,680
we can see that there's now
a margin on this side of the page.

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,780
That is another break point, so
in the medium.com example I noticed two

10
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:29,160
break points in the min with max
width example we start off and

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,390
the page says no,
then it gets a little bit larger and

12
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:37,940
the page says yes, but
if we get to big it goes back to no.

13
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,040
So, this means that the course
example also has two break points.
