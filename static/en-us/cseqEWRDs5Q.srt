00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,620
From this previous lessons and

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,790
courses what you really learned is
the big picture of machine learning.

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,450
You learned that machine
learning always starts with data.

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,580
It's not like a traditional program
where you build the decision making

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,500
directly into the code.

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,990
But with machine learning we always
start with a big amount of incoming data

7
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,640
and then it produces some decisions,
some ideas,

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,690
some summaries about that data.

9
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,930
So in this nano degree program,
we also need to start with the data.

10
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,880
In this first unit on model building and
validation,

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,410
we're going to talk about how it can
take in a big quantity of incoming data,

12
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,110
process it and
read some conclusions about it.
