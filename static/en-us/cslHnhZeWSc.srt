00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,480
Do physicians actually prefer EMRs
with innovative approaches to data

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,010
collection?

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,790
This 2009 survey from
the American Academy of Family Practice

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,460
suggests the answer is yes.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,770
Here physician choices are analyzed
based on practice size.

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,790
The lighter colors are small practices.

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,690
The darker colors are larger practices.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,890
It's important to recognize
that smaller practices

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,220
tend to independently
make these decisions,

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,970
while larger practices tend to have
employed physicians and/or to be

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:37,710
aligned with a health system that often
makes an enterprise EHR choice for them.

12
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:43,470
Grouped by practice size, as you can
see, the choices are quite different.

13
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,060
While I don’t want to generalize based
on my own direct observations of

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:52,110
the systems at the top, the physicians
that chose EMRs on their own do,

15
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,200
in fact, pick more innovative or
well-designed solutions for

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,850
data collection like those
we’ve been discussing.
