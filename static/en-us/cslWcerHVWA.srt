00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,290
It's a bit ironic that although theoretical computer science

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,600
is very precise, there are sometimes very confusing naming conventions,

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,660
and since many students,

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,200
at least those I have had have been confused by this,

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,780
I just quickly wanted to clear one thing up.

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,030
You will sometimes read that the Halting Problem

7
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,030
is semi-decidable

8
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,560
and we have to say that it's un-decidable,

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,420
so which one of these 2 is it?

10
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,500
Is it undecidable or is it half-way decidable?

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,580
And paradoxically,

12
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,800
it's both, and let me explain why.

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,200
So assume that we have a program, P,

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,570
and we want to determine if it halts,

15
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,130
so we want to know, does the program stop at a certain point in time,

16
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,220
and the answer to that, as you know,

17
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,570
can either be yes or no.

18
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,870
Now let's think about the 2 cases that are possible.

19
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,510
So the first one of those 2 cases is that

20
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,550
P stops, and my question for you is,

21
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,220
if P does stop,

22
00:00:54,220 --> 99:59:59,999
can we a yes after a finite amount of time?
