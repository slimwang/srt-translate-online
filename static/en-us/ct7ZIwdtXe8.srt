1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:06,360
This led to the natural development where there was a goal of trying to unify

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:12,230
these various techniques together, which led to the Unified Modeling Language,

3
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:18,260
UML. There's a, an industry group called the Object Management Group,

4
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:23,940
called OMG. That is the home for this standardization effort.

5
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,420
It's where you can find the specification documents,

6
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,560
which I referred to you refer you to during the term.

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:38,360
UML has also been championed by IBM. They acquired a company called Rational,

8
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,670
which had developed a development environment called Rational Rose,

9
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:47,630
which supported directly UML. There's lots of such case tools now.

10
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,350
Aside from Rational Rose, one that we've used is Enterprise Architect.

11
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,980
These are commercial tools. There are also all kinds of drawing tools out there,

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:59,920
which you can get for free. UML, itself, had three main architects.

13
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,855
One was Rumbaugh, one was Grady Booch, and the other was Ivar Jacobson. Okay.

14
00:01:04,855 --> 00:01:09,735
They're sometimes called the three amigos. They produced, in addition to

15
00:01:09,735 --> 00:01:14,970
a unified modeling language itself, three books, a reference manual,

16
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,840
a user's guide and so on. That had its main author as each one of the three, and

17
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,550
then together. Conveyed the overall approach to UML. It's

18
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:31,580
important to note at this state the UML diagrams can be used both for design but

19
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,610
also for analysis. I'll try to distinguish as we go forward whether we're

20
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:41,200
talking about an analysis diagram or a design diagram. The main distinction is,

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,390
analysis is concerned with the problem being solved and design is concerned with

22
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,390
the solution to that problem. I've taken some of these diagrams you're

23
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,840
about to see from the UML reference manual and from the UML users guide.
