1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,440
Working on code with other
developers is something you will do

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,720
all the time in the professional world.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,960
So it's really important to practice
working with remote repositories

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,790
whenever you can, starting now.

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:14,030
Do you have any existing projects?

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,560
Add them to GitHub if
you haven't already.

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,720
Plan on starting any new projects?

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,990
Make sure to add those too.

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,050
Even if you're not working with other
developers yet, sharing your projects on

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,630
GitHub will allow other developers
to at least view your work.

11
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,130
And why wouldn't you want to
share your projects?

12
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,330
You put so much hard work into them.

13
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,600
Show them off.

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,110
You deserve it.
