1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,040
This gets done sometimes,
in medical imaging.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,490
So here is a, an old scan.

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,610
Probably a, I'm going to guess CT.

4
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:09,870
And the image on the left
is the grayscale,

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,540
and then they've thresholded
the image on the right.

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,080
And what you'd like to do is,
you'd like to say, you know,

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,030
there's this chunk here, and
there's this chunk there, and

8
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,790
maybe this chunk, and this chunk,
and some things there, and that.

9
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,600
And maybe I'm going to ignore
some of that other stuff.

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,630
The first thing that we're going to
look at is what's referred to as

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,800
a connected component analysis,
all right?

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,840
So some of these
are a little hard to see.

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,330
But we'll just focus on
this one right here.

14
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:43,820
The idea is I'd like to pull out this
thing as being distinct say from this

15
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,400
thing, okay?

16
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,145
These are not connected so, I would
like to label this maybe as a 2 and

17
00:00:49,145 --> 00:00:53,230
this as a 3, all right because I want to
find all of the connected components.

18
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,460
Or connected set of pixels.

19
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,780
The connected components algorithm or
operation takes a binary image and

20
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,900
it generates what's referred
to as labelled image.

21
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,350
So every pixel now it used to be a 0 1,
it's now giving it a label

22
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,880
that is the number of
the object to which it belongs.

23
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,951
So right, if there is just one object,
everything will be a 0 or 1 and

24
00:01:12,951 --> 00:01:13,922
the 1, right?

25
00:01:13,922 --> 00:01:16,752
But if there are two objects,
there'll be 0s, 1s and 2s.

26
00:01:16,752 --> 00:01:19,940
All right, by the way, one of the things
that we're not going to talk about is

27
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:23,020
when we talk about a pixel being
connected to another pixel,

28
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,816
there's what's known as 4-way
connected and 8-way connected.

29
00:01:25,816 --> 00:01:29,110
4-way means that you're connected
to north, south, east, and west.

30
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,100
Did I get those right?

31
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,765
Well, it depends upon
which way you're looking.

32
00:01:31,765 --> 00:01:35,167
8-way connected, says I'm connected
to the north, south, east, west, and

33
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:38,665
I'm connected to northeast, northwest,
southeast, southwest, all right?

34
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:42,933
For what I'm going to show you here,
we're going to assume a 4-way connected

35
00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:45,722
the, the algorithm is pretty
much the same if it's 8-way.
