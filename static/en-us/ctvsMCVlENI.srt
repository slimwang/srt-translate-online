1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,210
Step one is about picking
the views that you want to use.

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,290
First I should explain what
exactly a view an Android is.

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,400
Simply put, a view is a rectangle on
the screen that shows some content.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,610
It can be an image,
a piece of text or a button or

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,170
anything else that the app can display.

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:22,780
Now these individual views make up
what we call the layout of the screen.

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,690
Everything about what you see and

8
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:29,120
interact with in your app is called
the user interface, or UI for short.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,910
There are different types of
views with different names.

10
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,620
A view that shows some
text is called a TextView.

11
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,490
Here are some examples.

12
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:41,540
A view that shows an image is called an
ImageView, and these are some examples.

13
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,070
A view that shows a button is called,
well, a Button.

14
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,620
These are some examples.

15
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,910
Now, there are many other types of views
in Android which are really helpful to

16
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,020
use, but we're going to
focus on these three first.

17
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,770
Earlier I mentioned that every
view is a rectangle on the screen,

18
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,890
but where are all the rectangles?

19
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,290
Well, technically they're invisible,
but I will draw them for you so

20
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,390
you can see where the bounds
of each rectangle is.

21
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,730
As you can see,

22
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:10,250
every app can be broken down into
the individual view that make it up.

23
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,690
In other words, a view is the basic
building block that you use

24
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,150
to build up the layout for your app.

25
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:20,080
To help you understand the idea of
views being rectangles on a screen,

26
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,840
here's a situation you may
be more familiar with.

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,110
If you ever use an application
like paint or Google drawings

28
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:31,130
then you may have added a text box to
the canvas, then you type in your text.

29
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,710
If you click outside of it though,

30
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:36,280
you don't see the bounds of
the rectangle but they are there.

31
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,090
And bounds actually do start
to matter when you start to

32
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,260
do things like adding
a background color or

33
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:45,380
adding a border around it then it
does matter how big the rectangle is.

34
00:01:46,598 --> 00:01:51,100
I also want to point out that the format
of these view names is in camel case.

35
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,140
Camel case means that there are no
spaces in-between words, and

36
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,860
the beginning of each
word is capitalized.

37
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,000
The reason why it's called
camel case is because

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,540
the outline of the word goes up and
down like the humps of a camel's back.

39
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,299
You're going to be seeing camel
case more throughout this course.

40
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,420
Okay, let's practice what you learned.

41
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,660
This is a screen shot of the new
email app from Google, called Inbox.

42
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,380
Can you identify the different
types of views here?

43
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,430
To help you,
I've highlighted the individual views.

44
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,270
For example for A,

45
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,880
can you tell me if it's a TextView,
an ImageView, or a Button.

46
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,350
Do the same for B,
as well as the rest of the views.
