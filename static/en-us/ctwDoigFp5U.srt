For this blue graph, I know the y intercept is at 1. So my y intercept, or my b

2
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:09,401
is positive 1. To find the slope, we just move from this point to another point

3
00:00:09,401 --> 00:00:13,884
in the line. I'm going to move to this point. So I move up 4, and then right 3.

4
00:00:13,884 --> 00:00:18,459
These are both positive directions. So I have 4 3rd. For the red line, I start

5
00:00:18,459 --> 00:00:23,074
at the y intercept, which is at negative 3. To find the slope, I can go to

6
00:00:23,074 --> 00:00:28,436
another point. I see another point there. So I travel down 3 units, and write 4

7
00:00:28,436 --> 00:00:33,857
units. Here, this direction is down. So it's negative 3, and the 4 is positive,

8
00:00:33,857 --> 00:00:38,810
since I moved to the right. So, negative 3 4th. Congrats if you got both of

9
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:39,727
those right.
