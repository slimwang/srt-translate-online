00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,674
Now it's time for a tricky question. What are the mean and standard deviation of

2
00:00:04,674 --> 00:00:10,345
this sampling distribution? As a hint, remember what the population was. So in

3
00:00:10,345 --> 00:00:15,955
other words, if we take all possible samples of size 2 from this population, and

4
00:00:15,955 --> 00:00:21,480
then plotted the mean of each sample, which is this distributionm what will be

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,363
the standard deviation?
