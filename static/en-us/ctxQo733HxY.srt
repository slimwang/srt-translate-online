Since we are on the topic of graphs, let's just look at a bunch of different

2
00:00:03,351 --> 00:00:08,501
graphs of log functions. Here we have f of x equals log based 2 of x, f of x

3
00:00:08,501 --> 00:00:13,315
equals log based 4 of x, f of x equals log based 10 of x, and finally, f of x

4
00:00:13,315 --> 00:00:20,734
equals log based e of x. Here, the base is that special number e that we

5
00:00:20,734 --> 00:00:24,666
mentioned before. What I would like to know right now is what point all of

6
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:26,819
these paths go through?
