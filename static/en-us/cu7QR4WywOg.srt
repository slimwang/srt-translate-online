1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now it's time to see the single corner model of a car in action.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The program test different strengths of braking

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
so that we can learn about the equilibria that we've analyzed before.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The mass of 1/4 of the car and the effective mass of the wheel are provided

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
20 kg for that effective mass of the wheel is a little on the high side,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
but helps to make the simulation more stable.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Your first task is to fill in the initial values.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You want to start with the car speed of 120 km/h and no slip, perfect rolling.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The other task for you is to implement the forward Euler method.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We make sure that the wheel slip never decreases below zero.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This helps to make things more stable.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Your task is to compute x which is the position, V which is the velocity of the car,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and W which is the velocity of the rim of the wheel and then we're cleaning up a little

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
to make sure that the velocity of the rim of the wheel is never negative.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Again, we measure to make things more stable.
