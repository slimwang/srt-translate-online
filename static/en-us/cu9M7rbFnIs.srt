1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,730
You are blazing through these steps.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:03,542
So at this point,

3
00:00:03,542 --> 00:00:06,750
we've done step number one where
we've selected the correct views.

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,092
We also went ahead and
did step number two and

5
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:12,210
we roughly positioned the views
correctly on the screen.

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,892
So now it's time to move on to step
number three, styling the views, and to

7
00:00:15,892 --> 00:00:19,910
do that, we're going to have to figure
out what attributes we need to change.

8
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:24,430
All right, so what I want you to do is
take a look at where we are right now.

9
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,840
And take a look at where we want
to be at the end of the app.

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,470
Try to figure out what the difference
is between these two states are and

11
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,820
then write those differences
down in a list in this text box.

12
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,940
This will help us choose what attributes
we're ultimately going to change.
