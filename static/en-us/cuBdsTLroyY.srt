1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,830
We've been considering sensorless
planning in a deterministic world.

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,379
Now, I want to turn our attention to
partially observable planning, but

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,279
still in a deterministic world.

4
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:11,536
Suppose we have what's
called local sensing.

5
00:00:11,537 --> 00:00:14,868
That is our vacuum can see
what location it is in, and

6
00:00:14,868 --> 00:00:18,201
it can see what's going on
in the current location,

7
00:00:18,201 --> 00:00:22,719
that is whether there's dirt in
the current location or not.

8
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,718
But it can't anything about whether
there's dirt in any other location.

9
00:00:26,718 --> 00:00:31,917
So here's a partial diagram of the part
of the belief state from that world,

10
00:00:31,917 --> 00:00:37,649
and I wanted to show how the belief
state unfolds as two things happen.

11
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:39,589
First, as we take action.

12
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:44,940
So we start in this state, and
we take the action of going right.

13
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:47,169
And in this case,

14
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:52,689
we still go from two world states in
our belief state to two new ones.

15
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:56,669
But then, after we do an action,
we do an observation.

16
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,420
We have the act-percept cycle, and

17
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,899
now once we get the observation,
we can split that world.

18
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:07,828
We can split our belief state to say if
we observe that we're in location B and

19
00:01:07,828 --> 00:01:11,755
it's dirty, then we know we're
in this belief state here,

20
00:01:11,754 --> 00:01:15,161
which happens to have exactly
one world state in it.

21
00:01:15,162 --> 00:01:19,192
And if we observe that we're clean then
we know whether we're in this state,

22
00:01:19,191 --> 00:01:20,931
which also has exactly one in it.

23
00:01:20,932 --> 00:01:26,004
Now, what is the act-observe cycle do
to the sizes of the belief states?

24
00:01:26,004 --> 00:01:30,540
Well, in a deterministic world, each
of the individual world states within

25
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,729
a belief state maps into
exactly one other one.

26
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,689
That's what we mean by deterministic.

27
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:40,349
And so that means the size of the belief
state will either stay the same, or

28
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:43,049
it might decrease if two
of the actions sort of

29
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:45,679
accidentally end up bringing
you to the same place.

30
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,810
On the other hand the observation
works in kind of the opposite way.

31
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,810
When we observe the world, what we're
doing is we're taking the current

32
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,750
belief state and
partitioning it up into pieces.

33
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,590
Observations alone can't introduce a new
world state into the belief state.

34
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:07,698
All that can do is say some of them
go here and some of them go here.

35
00:02:07,698 --> 00:02:13,310
Now, maybe, that for some observation,
all the belief states go into one bin.

36
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,270
And so we make an observation and
we don't learn anything new.

37
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:20,352
But at least the observation can't make
us more confused than we were before

38
00:02:20,352 --> 00:02:21,385
the observation.

39
00:02:21,385 --> 00:02:30,008
