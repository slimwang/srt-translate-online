00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,230
Here i'm basically showing you, the, sale of, camera units,

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,720
for simple film like this kind of stuff since, since mid 1950s.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,730
If you noticed there's a growth around in the mid 1990s, and

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,660
then of course there's a fade away coming in in recent times.

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,230
Of course, this could easily be explained,

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,489
with what happens when you replace film with digital cameras.

7
00:00:24,218 --> 00:00:28,270
So, digital cameras started coming into the market in you know,

8
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:33,250
late 1990s early 2000, and that has been a, rapid growth.

9
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,470
Again, these, plots are not entirely to scale, but

10
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:41,910
this shows this is continuously growing as we hit further years down here.

11
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,570
This is just showing 2006, and we have reached, really a huge magnitude.

12
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,900
So of course when we grow this to 2016,

13
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,680
we notice there is a dip, but at the same time there is an up but

14
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,830
there's a really strong dip coming down at about 2012.

15
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,540
Well this could be explained if you think about it,

16
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,860
because this where basically.

17
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:06,140
Cameras like this were getting replaced by, smart phone cameras.

18
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:11,200
So again, just by projecting this further, we can see that basically you know,

19
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,780
less and less of these cameras wouldl probably be sold.

20
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,850
Only people who are serious about photography would consider cameras like this.

21
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,550
Here you notice the big trend that's coming in.

22
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,080
The smart phone cameras are coming into the market.

23
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,990
And this is what I was making, basically suggesting, that as

24
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,860
camera phones are becoming the most widely used electronic device out there.

25
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,700
Because of the dual purpose nature, communication device and

26
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,030
capture content device, they're becoming really pervasive.

27
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,820
And, you know,

28
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:42,260
there are quite a few of these in several billions of these devices out there.
