1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,295
Keep in mind that for responsive images, like adaptive

2
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:06,230
layout that we learned about in the last few lessons,

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,720
we frequently will want to adapt the size of the

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,770
image, the layout size of the image, depending on how

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,350
much space we have. Sometimes we do that with

6
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,110
simple scaling, for example, here, on our conference app, we're

7
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,400
currently rescaling the speaker images depending on the layout size.

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,950
Sometimes though, we may actually want to switch between subjectively

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,220
different images too. For example, you might want to crop your subject

10
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:34,090
more closely when you don't have as much space to render the image.

11
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,890
Using images differently in terms of

12
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:39,000
art direction in different scenarios is part

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,360
of what makes these responsive images

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,600
rather then just scalable pixel ratio images.
