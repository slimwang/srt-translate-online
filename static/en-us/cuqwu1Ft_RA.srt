00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,763
Jake, did you figure this one out?

2
00:00:01,763 --> 00:00:03,343
>> I absolutely did.

3
00:00:03,343 --> 00:00:04,747
Here goes.

4
00:00:04,747 --> 00:00:05,930
We can see the problem here.

5
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,162
I've had Wizard running for
a while now, and

6
00:00:08,162 --> 00:00:10,997
I've got almost four hundred
messages in the database.

7
00:00:10,997 --> 00:00:14,591
The code for dealing with this
is a little bit tricky so,

8
00:00:14,591 --> 00:00:16,131
well done if you did it.

9
00:00:16,131 --> 00:00:20,229
Over in on socket message, after adding
that into the database, I'm going to

10
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:24,161
continue using the same transaction and
the same object store from above.

11
00:00:24,161 --> 00:00:26,182
I'm going to get the by-date index,

12
00:00:26,182 --> 00:00:30,160
because I want to remove the oldest
posts, and I'm going to open a cursor,

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,841
but pass a null and prev, so
the cursor goes backwards for the index.

14
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:35,385
Starting with the newest post.

15
00:00:35,385 --> 00:00:39,769
I don't care about the first 30 posts,
those are the newest ones,

16
00:00:39,769 --> 00:00:40,758
they can stay.

17
00:00:40,758 --> 00:00:42,441
I'm going to advance past them.

18
00:00:45,136 --> 00:00:51,211
With the posts after that, well if
the cursor is undefined, we're done.

19
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:55,231
Overwise I'm going to delete the entry,
then continue the cursor

20
00:00:55,231 --> 00:00:59,630
Calling the same function again to
loop through the remaining entries.

21
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:03,020
This keeps the news 30 post,
but deletes the rest.

22
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,616
Now i can reload the page
using force reload.

23
00:01:07,616 --> 00:01:13,299
And in the resources panel, I've got
the latest 30 posts, but no more.

24
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:16,328
This is something we want to ship, so

25
00:01:16,328 --> 00:01:20,140
I bump the static cache
of the service worker,

26
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:25,839
disable force update, refresh the page,
and there's our update.

27
00:01:25,839 --> 00:01:26,918
Things are looking great.

28
00:01:26,918 --> 00:01:30,882
We've absolutely covered continual
update of pages and this is huge.

29
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,262
Once again,
this is something we could launch.

30
00:01:33,262 --> 00:01:34,491
Here's what we've achieved.

31
00:01:34,491 --> 00:01:37,968
Things haven't changed much when
the connections perfect, but yeah,

32
00:01:37,968 --> 00:01:39,569
perfect doesn't really exist.

33
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:43,600
On a slow connection we get to
render content, much quicker,

34
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,002
way quicker in fact.

35
00:01:45,002 --> 00:01:48,802
Life our users get content rather
than an infinite white screen.

36
00:01:48,802 --> 00:01:52,174
Even offline users get content.

37
00:01:52,174 --> 00:01:55,749
Although, as I'm sure you've noticed,
things are still a little slow, or

38
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:57,239
broken when it comes to images.

39
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:59,898
That's all we've got left to fix,
then we're done.

40
00:01:59,898 --> 00:02:02,792
You're on the home straight now,
just those images, and

41
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:04,870
we have a full offline first experience.
