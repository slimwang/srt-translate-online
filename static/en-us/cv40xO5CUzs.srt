What's so great about factoring is that we can check our solution. If I multiply

2
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:09,236
these 2 binomials together, we would do this process in reverse and end up with

3
00:00:09,236 --> 00:00:14,678
our original problem. If you want to get faster at factoring trinomials, you

4
00:00:14,678 --> 00:00:19,884
want to find the factors of 2 times 6 or 12 that add up to 13. You always want

5
00:00:19,884 --> 00:00:25,250
to find factors of a times c that sum to b. Finding these 2 factors allows us to

6
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:30,033
rewrite the middle term. And then allows us to use factoring by grouping.
