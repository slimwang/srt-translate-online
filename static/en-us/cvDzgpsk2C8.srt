We've seen a lot of different parabolas in this lesson so far. So I've written

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,457
down the equations for a few of them here, and then also the corresponding

3
00:00:08,457 --> 00:00:12,845
vertex for each one. Thinking about the relationship between a vertex of each

4
00:00:12,845 --> 00:00:17,267
equation, and the equation itself, could you write an equation in the same form

5
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:21,808
as these over here? For a parabola whose vertex is at the general coordinates h

6
00:00:21,808 --> 00:00:26,798
comma k? One more note, for simplicity's sake, assume that this parabola is just

7
00:00:26,798 --> 00:00:31,653
a shifted version of y equals x squared. The only thing that's different about

8
00:00:31,653 --> 00:00:35,807
it from this original graph is that the vertex has moved to h comma k.
