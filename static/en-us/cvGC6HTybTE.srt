00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,300
Since our shaded area of values for y ends in an arrow pointing to the left, the

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,735
lower limit of this interval is negative infinity. There is no lower limit, in

3
00:00:08,735 --> 00:00:13,212
other words. We can see that the interval ends at 30, with a square bracket, so

4
00:00:13,212 --> 00:00:17,563
30 is included in our interval. We know that this is the same as y is less than

5
00:00:17,563 --> 00:00:21,565
or equal to 30, which means that y can have any value that's either 30 or

6
00:00:21,565 --> 00:00:25,976
something lower than 30. And remember, we have to use this round parentheses

7
00:00:25,976 --> 00:00:28,665
next to our infinity, even it's a negative one.
