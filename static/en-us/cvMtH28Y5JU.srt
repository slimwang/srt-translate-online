1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,670
So here we are back in models.py
in our applications source code.

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:08,480
So far, you've created the profile
entity class in your application, but

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,990
you haven't actually used if for
saving data in the datastore.

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,360
The next step is to add
code to do just that.

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,666
So you've already worked with
the getProfileFromUser function in

6
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:17,620
conference.py.

7
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,770
So far, it creates and
returns a profile object,

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,260
but it doesn't actually save
the profile in datastore.

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,580
Let's add the code to do that.

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,170
Before you can save the profile entity,

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,480
you need a unique key
to identify the user.

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,610
There are a bunch of choices
we could use for this.

13
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:34,570
For now, we've provided a function in
the utils module, utils.getUserId,

14
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,660
which takes a logged in user record and
returns a unique ID.

15
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,410
Utils is provided in
the additions folder,

16
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,860
since it's a new addition
to the code base.

17
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:46,070
And then once you have the user ID,
you can use nbd.Key to make a key.

18
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,900
The first argument is the kind of key
you want to make, in this case, profile,

19
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,810
and the second is the string
you want to make the key from.

20
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,930
And then you'll be able to
save the profile entity.

21
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,460
Doing that is actually super easy
since you've all ready created it.

22
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,750
You just have to use the put method
on the entity you want to save.

23
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,110
So in this case, it will be profile.put
and that's TODO 2 for this exercise.

24
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:08,192
I've shown you these two, but there are
some other steps you have to do around

25
00:01:08,192 --> 00:01:09,963
them which are described
in the TODO steps.

26
00:01:09,963 --> 00:01:13,779
Once we deploy and use the save
profile method in the API Explorer,

27
00:01:13,779 --> 00:01:15,907
the profile will actually be saved.

28
00:01:15,907 --> 00:01:19,524
One thing you'll have to do in
the API Explorer is to turn on OAuth for

29
00:01:19,524 --> 00:01:20,295
this method.

30
00:01:20,295 --> 00:01:23,430
This will authorize this
method to access your account.

31
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,360
Once you've executed this method,
you should be able to see the results in

32
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,990
the datastore,
under Storage > Cloud Datastore > Query.

33
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,490
And there I am.

34
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,340
So now mark these steps as you complete
them doing the TODOs including

35
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,418
the several steps of TODO 1 and
number 2.

36
00:01:37,418 --> 00:01:41,090
Testing on localhost and
finding the profile in the datastore,

37
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,420
which properties do you see in
the admin tool for your profile entity?

38
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,670
User_id, mainEmail,
displayName or teeShirtSize.
