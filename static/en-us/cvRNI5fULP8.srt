1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Thrun] And the answer is 13.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
One over here, 2 over here, and 4 over here.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Simplifiably speaking, any variable that has K inputs requires 2 to the K such variables.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So in total we have 1, 9, 13.
