1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's now go and make this a full capture replay tool,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
which comes in to mode either replay or record.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This is set by the mode variable.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
If we are in recording mode, then we want to

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
store the commands in variable save commands.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We are in replay mode, however.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Then we assume we already do have some stored commands in here.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Now for another programming exercise.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Go and extend input command, such that if it is in replay mode,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
the commands are being read from the saved commands variable.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Over to you.
