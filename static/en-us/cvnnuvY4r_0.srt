00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,240
So what do we have so far? We have three abstract classes without abstract

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,820
methods in them. We've defined three classes for the Mark IV. But we still have

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,910
to fill in the details of those particular operations. We want to do this in

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:18,580
a way that we don't compromise our abstraction. What Martin says about this is

5
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,700
that none of the three classes we have created must never know anything about

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,590
the Mark IV. That is, none of the three abstract classes. This is the depen,

7
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:30,700
Dependency Inversion Principle. We are not going to allow the high-level coffee

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,900
making policy of this system to depend upon the low-level implementation.
