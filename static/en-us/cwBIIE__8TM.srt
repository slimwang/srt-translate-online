00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,326
Let's see if you can put this together. Try and answer this question. What are

2
00:00:04,326 --> 00:00:08,574
the bases and exponents of these expressions in simplified form? Write your

3
00:00:08,574 --> 00:00:12,939
bases and exponents in each of the boxes. And remember, this 3 has an exponent

4
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:17,286
of 1, when the exponent isn't listed, we assume it to be 1, the same is true for

5
00:00:17,286 --> 00:00:21,763
the c. Also for these numbers, don't worry about multiplying them out. For

6
00:00:21,763 --> 00:00:25,850
example, if you have the base of 7 in your answer, leave it as a base of 7 with

7
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:30,023
some exponent as the number. As always, try your best and feel free to play

8
00:00:30,023 --> 00:00:33,292
around with these exponents, it's okay to make a mistake.
