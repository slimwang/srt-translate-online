Alright, now let's try creating our own XML HTTP request. What we'd like to do is

2
00:00:05,337 --> 00:00:10,425
requestWeapon.JSON which is the previous JSON code that we parsed.

3
00:00:10,537 --> 00:00:15,850
Then, once the response kicks in, we'd like the onLoad function specified

4
00:00:15,862 --> 00:00:21,250
to parse it, like we did before, If you're a little confused, more detailed instructions

00:00:21,262 --> 00:00:22,850
are provided in the comments here.
