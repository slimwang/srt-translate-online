00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:04,650
Now let us see how partial order planning, sometimes also called nonlinear

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,030
planning, may work for our ladder and ceiling problem. So here is a goal state,

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,030
painted ladder. There is the initial state. We can now use the goal knowledge as

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:18,560
control knowledge to select between different operators available in this world.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,970
The only operator whose post conditions match the goal condition of

6
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:27,475
painted ladder. And whose preconditions are compatible with the initial status,

7
00:00:27,475 --> 00:00:29,950
paint-ladder. So we'll select that operator.

8
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:34,770
When we think of applying the operator paint-ladder to the initial state,

9
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,450
we get this as a successor state. Painted ladder and not dry ladder are coming

10
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,520
from the post conditions of paint-ladder. Robot and floor, and ceiling, dry,

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,910
have been propagated from the initial state. We changed dry ladder to not dry

12
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,880
ladder because that was the post condition of paint-ladder. We did not change

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,665
the on robot floor and dry ceiling because pain ladder was silent about them.
