1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,810
Now that we have the project one
files opened up inside of Unity,

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,460
why don't we have a little fun and
customize it up a bit?

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,093
We'll go over everything we're doing in
a lot more detail in future courses, but

4
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:12,621
we thought it would be cool to
show you how to customize and

5
00:00:12,621 --> 00:00:15,329
build your own app so that you
can show it off to your friends.

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,370
To get started,
navigate to the Projects window and

7
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:25,190
click on Udosity VR &gt; Scenes
&gt; Modified Google Demo Scene.

8
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,120
As you can probably guess from the name,
we've modified the Google demo scene

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,370
that comes with Google VR so
that it's a bit easier to customize.

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,829
For starters, let's center the scene
view around the Hello World text.

11
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,500
Just as a reminder,
hold down the right mouse button and

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,110
use the WASD keys to move around.

13
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,800
Pause the video here until you're ready.

14
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,030
Next, let's click on
the Hello World text.

15
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,210
In the Inspector window,
we should now see a bunch of options for

16
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,450
styling our text as well as
the text we want to display.

17
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,860
Let's go ahead and
change the text to include our name.

18
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,400
Awesome, now if we rotate
down in the scene view

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,590
we should see a menu
that has five buttons.

20
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,820
The Reset and Recenter buttons
were provided by Google.

21
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:23,060
The first button resets the scene
to its original state and

22
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,210
the second will re-center
where you're looking.

23
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,830
In Cardboard,
those are both valuable options to have.

24
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,440
So let's leave them there.

25
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,340
The bottom three buttons
should all say Switch Shape.

26
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,220
If we run the app using the play
button at the top here,

27
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,740
we will then switch into the game view.

28
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,638
With Google VR's SDK if we press Alt and
then move our mouse,

29
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:49,470
we'll be able to rotate where
we're looking in the scene.

30
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:54,000
Use it to rotate and look at one
of the Switch Shape buttons and

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,400
click anywhere on the screen.

32
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:00,840
Now, if we look up we'll see that
our cube has switched into a sphere.

33
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,060
If we go ahead and

34
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,020
click that button again,
we'll notice that it switches back.

35
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,570
For this project we've written
a script called Udacity Fun Effects,

36
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,960
which contains five different
effects that we can have happen.

37
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,840
To use it,
we'll need to stop playing our scene and

38
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,270
then click on one of these
Switch Shape buttons.

39
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:24,790
Now if we look at the Inspector,
we'll see a section called on click.

40
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,090
Here we can see that the button has
already been assigned to toggle shape.

41
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,180
But we can easily change
that using the drop down.

42
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,966
For some fun, let's change it to
spawn some random cubes by going to

43
00:02:35,966 --> 00:02:39,460
Udacity Fun Effects &gt;
Spawn Random Cubes.

44
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,490
For clarity, we should also
change the text of the button.

45
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,380
In the hierarchy,

46
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,200
you'll notice a triangle next to the
Switch Shape button we have selected.

47
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,910
If we click it, it will reveal
a text component that we can

48
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,930
use to change the text of our button.

49
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,620
Let's change it to
Drop Cubes From the Sky.

50
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:05,800
Now if we hit Play and
rotate down to click the button,

51
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,839
we'll see that we have ten cubes
falling at us from the sky.

52
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,980
In addition to having
cubes fall from the sky,

53
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:17,030
we can also play around with
changing the particle colors,

54
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,950
toggling the flashlight, or
toggling a day night cycle.

55
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,160
For your first project, your task is
to play around with these different

56
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,630
effects in Unity, and get it onto your
phone, which is what we'll do next.

57
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:33,310
But most importantly, just have some fun
playing around with the Unity editor.
