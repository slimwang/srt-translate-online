1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,630
Lets explore the API a little bit.

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:06,470
Now, we saw earlier that we could set
the location of the panorama by calling

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:11,000
setPosition on the Street View Panorama
object and give it latitude and

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,580
longitude.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,470
In addition to that,
we could also get the location, and

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:19,430
this will return
a StreetViewPanoramaLocation Object.

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,610
This object itself will have
a latitude and longitude on it.

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:27,060
So you can use this if the user has
moved around the map to understand

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,160
where the user is presently, and then
you can plot that location on a map.

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,290
So, for example, if the user was
hiking down the Grand Canyon,

11
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,750
you could have a map beside
the StreetViewPanoramaView, and

12
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,750
as the user moves down the Grand Canyon,

13
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,590
or the user moves along in Street View,
you can have a pin on the map update to

14
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,730
show the user's location based
on what they're looking at.

15
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,170
You can also getPanoramaCamera
on the StreetViewPanorama.

16
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,780
Now you might remember the camera
from earlier in this course, and

17
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,450
the concepts are the same.

18
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,420
This will return
a StreetViewPanoramaCamera

19
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,570
as you saw when we
were creating the app.

20
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,930
And this will allow you to read or
edit things such as the zoom, the tilt,

21
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,550
the bearing, etc.

22
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:09,840
Let's take a look at the code now and
look at the panorama camera again and

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,940
see how we had set it up.

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,150
So, if you remember back to the code,
I've changed the camera view

25
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:20,460
to be one where it points south
by setting the bearing to be 180.

26
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,640
I created a StreetViewPanoramaCamera,

27
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,540
and I tell the panorama to animate
to that camera at this bearing.

28
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,220
I could have done similar
things with tilt or

29
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,660
zoom, just like I would with
the mapping application.

30
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,510
So, if you're not familiar with this,
check back to the sections where we

31
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,530
explored using the camera on a map
view earlier in this course.
