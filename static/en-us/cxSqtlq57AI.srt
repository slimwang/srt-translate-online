00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,887
We begin by finding the real roots or the real zeros, and sketching the graph

2
00:00:03,887 --> 00:00:09,850
of polynomial functions. So let's start by looking at this first function.

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,968
Please take some time to find the roots of the function g of x equals the

4
00:00:13,968 --> 00:00:20,395
quantity x plus 2 times the quantity x Squared plus 1. Remember that the word

5
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:25,120
root and the word zero mean the same thing, values of x that make the function

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,416
0. Please separate your answers by commas.
