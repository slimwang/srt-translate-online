1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,620
We discussed access control
in the last lesson.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,990
But that was only one kind
of access control called

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,710
discretionary access control, or DAC.

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,830
That allows you to decide

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:18,180
who you want to share a resource with
when you create the resource and own it.

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,850
If you work for a company, or
a defense or intelligence organization,

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,750
you don't get to decide how information
that you access can be shared.

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,820
The company or the agency will mandate

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,008
how various types of information
is accessed by different users.

10
00:00:36,008 --> 00:00:40,470
For this, we're going to develop
a number of mandatory access control,

11
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,800
also called MAC, models.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,900
Once we're done with,
this we're going to revisit the idea of

13
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,400
a trusted computing base, or
a TCB, and explore how we can

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,680
evaluate the level of assurance
that is provided by such a TCB.
