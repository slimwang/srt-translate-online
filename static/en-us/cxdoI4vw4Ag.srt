00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,251
Before we dig into
the camera perspective,

2
00:00:02,251 --> 00:00:06,487
viewport awesomeness that is the rest of
this lesson, let's learn one more shape.

3
00:00:06,487 --> 00:00:08,344
The shape renderer can make for us.

4
00:00:08,344 --> 00:00:09,590
Circles.

5
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,800
Also partial circle or arcs.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,697
We're going to explore more
code in the course repository.

7
00:00:14,697 --> 00:00:17,670
You can load up this project
yourself and follow along.

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,700
To dig in, let's check out the TODOs.

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,299
Here's the most basic circle you can
draw, specifying the x position of

10
00:00:24,299 --> 00:00:27,901
the center, the y position of the
center, and the radius of the circle.

11
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:30,320
And there we go, it's beautiful, right?

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,555
We can also draw a partial circle or an
arc, by specifying the number of degrees

13
00:00:35,555 --> 00:00:39,800
counter-clockwise from the positive
x-axis that the arc should start And

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,160
how many more degrees it should
keep going from that point.

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,535
So this line is 45 degrees
from the positive x-axis in

16
00:00:46,535 --> 00:00:48,666
the counter clockwise direction.

17
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:51,424
And then 270 degrees is three
quarters of a circle, so

18
00:00:51,424 --> 00:00:53,440
we get this Pac-Man shape.

19
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,850
Circles have a dirty
little secret though.

20
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,547
They're not really circles, they're
a fan of triangles where all their

21
00:00:59,547 --> 00:01:02,419
triangles have their points
at the center of the circle.

22
00:01:02,419 --> 00:01:05,489
ShapeRenderer will pick how
many triangles to use so

23
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,033
the circle looks smooth.

24
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:11,123
But if you make super small circles,
it might choose to use too few.

25
00:01:11,123 --> 00:01:14,406
This optional last parameter sets
the number of segments to use.

26
00:01:14,406 --> 00:01:17,600
Let's see what happens when we
set the segment count too low.

27
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,260
If we set the segment count too low,

28
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,040
we end up with a circle that
looks like a stop sign.

29
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,540
This can also happen if you're
drawing very small circles but

30
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,450
you're zoomed way in on them.

31
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:30,926
Circles can be drawn using either
ShapeType filled or ShapeType line.

32
00:01:30,926 --> 00:01:33,481
The ladder draws just
the outline of the circle.

33
00:01:33,481 --> 00:01:35,874
If we want to draw
both solid circles and

34
00:01:35,874 --> 00:01:39,138
the outlines of circles in
the same render callback,

35
00:01:39,138 --> 00:01:43,434
we first need to end our filled batch
and begin a new batch in line mode.

36
00:01:43,434 --> 00:01:44,280
Lets give this a try.

37
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,850
There we go, a circle drawn in line
mode is just the outline of the circle.

38
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,993
Lets try something crazy and
draw some target rings.

39
00:01:52,993 --> 00:01:54,270
Bam, there we go.

40
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,616
We can also draw just the outline
of an arc just like so.

41
00:01:59,616 --> 00:02:04,215
And if we draw the outlines of a bunch
of arcs stacked up on top of each other,

42
00:02:04,215 --> 00:02:07,073
we can draw some funky
snail shell like thing.

43
00:02:07,073 --> 00:02:10,773
Remember, if any of this seemed
too complicated or went too fast,

44
00:02:10,773 --> 00:02:12,567
don't just take my word for it.

45
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:15,457
You've got all this code sitting on
your computer so check it out and

46
00:02:15,457 --> 00:02:16,480
play with it yourself.
