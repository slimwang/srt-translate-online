00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,719
GCD provides us with
two types of queues.

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:09,230
Serial, or synchronous queues, and
concurrent, or asynchronous queues.

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,070
Serial queues behave
as explained earlier.

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:16,470
Every closure gets to run when
it reaches the end of the queue.

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,630
On the other hand, concurrent or
asynchronous queues have several threads

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,650
that pickup closures at any
point of the queue for running.

7
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,905
These are harder to control and
we won't be using them.

8
00:00:27,905 --> 00:00:31,790
An app can have several queues, but
not all queues are created equal.

9
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,010
There is a very special
one called the main queue.

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,510
This is the queue that handles
the UI of your app, as well as

11
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,210
any of your code that doesn't explicitly
ask to run in background queue.

12
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,580
It is vital that you never run
code that blocks on this queue.

13
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,180
What does it meant to block?

14
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:54,800
Blocking is when your code takes a human
perceivable amount of time to execute,

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,140
and prevents your app from
continuing until it's done.

16
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,020
You can do this either by doing
something computationally expensive,

17
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,780
such as applying a filter to a video,
or a big image.

18
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:11,140
However, the most common way of
blocking is by using the network.

19
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,740
Say you wrote some code to make
a network request on the main queue,

20
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:19,860
then none of your UI could update
until the network request finishes.

21
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,180
We cannot allow this to happen.

22
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,600
If you do block the main queue,
your UI will be sluggish, and

23
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,230
your app will provide
a terrible user experience and

24
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,820
will likely be rejected
from the app store.

25
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,050
We won't have any of that.
