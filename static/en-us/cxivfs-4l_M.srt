1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Astonishingly, the mass of the spacecraft is not important at all.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Imagine that you have 2 spacecrafts going along the same trajectory.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You could join these to form a spacecraft of twice the mass,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and that would still follow the same trajectory.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So the mass is of no importance--

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
the mass of the spacecraft, that is.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The size of the moon.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Well, we should not be hitting the moon,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
but otherwise the size of the moon is not of importance.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The motion of the moon, however, is of vital importance.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We have to take care that the rocket is fired into empty space

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and the moon eventually appears in the right place.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The size of the earth is of vital importance

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
to get close to the surface as we return.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The motion of the earth around the sun isn't that vital.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And should we be treating this as a 3-dimensional problem?

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Imagine the earth as a sphere and the moon as a sphere,

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and the trajectory takes us around earth,

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
around the moon and back.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This looks very 3 dimensional

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
should we be dealing with xyz coordinates.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Actually, however, this trajectory is mostly in a plane.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
If you look at that motion from above,

24
00:01:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
we see planar motion, and it's almost okay to treat this trajectory in a 2D fashion.
