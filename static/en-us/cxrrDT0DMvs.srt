1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,310
I was just at Yosemite, and now I've
decided to create a soon to be world

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:08,530
famous website that aggregates important
information if you want to go hiking.

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,310
But I can't seem to get
the routing figured out.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,070
Going to the site's home page
should activate the home function.

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,800
I also want to let people
look up specific mountains.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,480
So when the route is mountain/ some ID,
I need the mountain function called.

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,460
And then people should be
able to download brochures.

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,158
This right here should be
able to be anything, and

9
00:00:29,158 --> 00:00:33,540
then download/whatever should
load the download function.

10
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:39,230
I need to turn these URLs into
routes that Backbone can understand.

11
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:43,210
Can you help me finish the mountain
router by adding in the correct routes?

12
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,340
What is the route to
call the home function?

13
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,560
What about the route to handle
the mountain and its ID?

14
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,980
Enter the route here that will
call the download function.

15
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,080
For help with figuring out the ID and
the brochure,

16
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,100
it might be helpful to review Backbone's
documentation on route parameters,

17
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,000
specifically params and splats.
