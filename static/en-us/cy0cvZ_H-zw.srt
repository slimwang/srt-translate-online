1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,142
It turns out that i to the 5th equals i, i to the 6th equals negative 1, i to

2
00:00:04,142 --> 00:00:10,315
the 7th equals negative i, and i to the 8th equals positive 1. Fantastic

3
00:00:10,315 --> 00:00:14,453
pattern solving, if you found those. Now, I know these are pretty tough. So,

4
00:00:14,453 --> 00:00:18,378
it's okay if you stumbled. Let's see how to do it. For the first one, we have i

5
00:00:18,378 --> 00:00:23,610
to the 4th times i. We know i to the 4th already. That equals 1. So, we can

6
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:29,530
replace i to the 4th with 1. This leaves us with 1 times i, which equals i. For

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,898
i to the 6th, we can rewrite it as i to the 4th times i squared. We know i to

8
00:00:33,898 --> 00:00:38,533
the 4th equals positive 1 from before. And we know that i squared really equals

9
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:43,260
negative 1. So, we can replace that here. We multiply these numbers together to

10
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,520
give us negative 1. For i to the 7th, we break it down into i to the 4th times

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,262
i cubed. i to the 4th equals 1, and we know i cubed is really equal to negative

12
00:00:52,262 --> 00:00:57,602
i. So, that's how we simplify i to the 7th to be negative i. And finally, for i

13
00:00:57,602 --> 00:01:03,386
to the 8th, we'll have i to the 4th times i to the 4th. Both of these equal 1.

14
00:01:03,386 --> 00:01:06,303
So, we'll have 1 times 1, which equals 1.
