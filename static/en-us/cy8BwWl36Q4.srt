00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,197
>> I'm going to show you the answer to this, by doing it in a spreadsheet. You

2
00:00:04,197 --> 00:00:08,949
could do all of these calculations, without any technology. And if you did that,

3
00:00:08,949 --> 00:00:13,362
that's really great. It's always really good practice to calculate things

4
00:00:13,362 --> 00:00:17,709
without using any technology, but just for the purposes of figuring out the

5
00:00:17,709 --> 00:00:22,873
standard deviation, technology can really speed along this process. So I'm not

6
00:00:22,873 --> 00:00:29,985
going to use any shortcuts here. We're going to do it exactly as we would if we

7
00:00:29,985 --> 00:00:38,639
didn't have technology. So first we need to take the avearage of all of these,

8
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:47,458
we're going to sum them up. So we're taking the sume of all of these. I could

9
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:55,191
also just write equals a1 plus a2 plus a3 all the way to a10. And we'd get the

10
00:00:55,191 --> 00:01:02,922
same thing. But why would we do that if we can simply write this. Now to take

11
00:01:02,922 --> 00:01:10,884
the average all we do is divide by the number of values which is 10. So that's

12
00:01:10,884 --> 00:01:18,654
just going to be 51,511.1. Alternatively, the nice thing about technology is we

13
00:01:18,654 --> 00:01:27,070
can just do this. Take the sum, and divide by the total number. Do it all in 1

14
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:34,563
step. So now we have the average. Now we're going to subtract the average from

15
00:01:34,563 --> 00:01:40,776
each 1 of these values. Not the opposite, where we subtract each of these values

16
00:01:40,776 --> 00:01:46,216
from the mean. That's an important distinction. In this case, it doesn't matter

17
00:01:46,216 --> 00:01:51,481
as much but in other statistical concepts that's an important distinction to

18
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:58,227
make. So we'll write equals A1 minus. The mean. So I'm subtracting the mean from

19
00:01:58,227 --> 00:02:05,630
each of these values. Now I could just do the same thing here and write equals

20
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:13,044
a2 minus the mean but that would be tedious. We can just drag this down. When

21
00:02:13,044 --> 00:02:19,621
you do that, remember that there has to be a little plus sign there. That means

22
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:25,734
you're successfully dragging it down. If you went like this, it won't do

23
00:02:25,734 --> 00:02:32,486
anything. It'll just highlight the boxes. So here, we have the deviations from

24
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:39,383
the mean. Here, in the next column We're going to square each deviation. Equals

25
00:02:39,383 --> 00:02:45,394
b1 squared. And again, we're going to drag it down. So we have the squared

26
00:02:45,394 --> 00:02:51,742
deviations for each of these values. Now remember that the variance is the

27
00:02:51,742 --> 00:02:58,709
average squared deviation. So we could just write. Average of c1 to c10. But I

28
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:05,996
want to make sure we go through all the other steps in between. So let's again

29
00:03:05,996 --> 00:03:13,670
practice calculating the average just for clarity's sake. So the variants then

30
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:19,829
would be the sum of c1 to c10. Remember that's how you start out taking the

31
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:25,637
average, and then divide by 10. So here's the variance, and then the standard

32
00:03:25,637 --> 00:03:31,793
deviation is simply the square root of the variance. So we'll write equals SQRT.

33
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:37,695
That's the shortcut for square root. And then we can just say C13. So we know

34
00:03:37,695 --> 00:03:43,730
that the standard deviation is 6557.16 approximately. Now I want to point out

35
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:49,998
something really important before we finish this solution video. Here I simply

36
00:03:49,998 --> 00:03:56,953
said equals square root of this cell C13. Whereas here, I wrote out the

37
00:03:56,953 --> 00:04:05,325
whole average. The reason for that is because say I had but this all here, A13.

38
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:12,849
Then, when we drag it down, we don't get the right deviations. And we can double

39
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:19,432
click on it, and see what it did. Here, it took A4 minus A16, whereas here it

40
00:04:19,432 --> 00:04:26,126
took A1 minus A13, which is what we wanted. But we want it to always stay A13,

41
00:04:26,126 --> 00:04:32,564
which is why we have to make sure this is a constant. And the way to make sure

42
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:38,507
it's a constant is by just writing it. Notice also that all of these values

43
00:04:38,507 --> 00:04:44,267
changed when these values changed because all these values are dependent of

44
00:04:44,267 --> 00:04:50,507
these values So when we change it back we should again get the correct standard

45
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:51,530
deviation.
