00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,819
Hey, welcome to our first quiz.

2
00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:03,700
You'll have to excuse my handwriting.

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,160
A big part of this course will be
quizzes and programming exercises.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,120
This approach to teaching is
called formative assessment,

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,040
that means we're not asking you
questions to give you a grade, but

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,010
to challenge you and
keep you interested.

7
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,090
Don't worry if you need to
submit a quiz multiple times or

8
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,010
even skip ahead to the answer video.

9
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,330
The questions are here to help you,
not to examine you.

10
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,830
With that in mind,
let's do our first quiz.

11
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:29,200
Which of the following are advantages
of using a build tool, portability,

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,090
automation, deliciousness,
repeatability, or delectability?
