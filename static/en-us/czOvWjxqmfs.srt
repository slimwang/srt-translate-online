1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,260
This brings us to the end of the course.

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,890
There are many more topics
that we could talk about, and

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,020
we encourage you to look at
the additional readings for the course.

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,990
As we said at the beginning,
we have had a lot of fun

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,010
putting this course together,
and we have learned a lot, too.

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,360
We hope you have enjoyed
the course as well.

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,250
>> We're also really eager
to get your feedback.

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,710
What did you enjoy about this course?

9
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,240
And what could have been improved?

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,650
What surprised you about this course,
either in the content or

11
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,510
in the way that it was administered?

12
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,470
Are there things that you've seen other
courses do that you wish we'd done, or

13
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,910
are things that we did that you'd
like to see other courses do?

14
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,630
>> We are very interested in your
answers to these questions, so

15
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,840
please feel free to contact either
one of us with your answers, and

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,210
fill out the course survey as well.

17
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,770
>> We'd also like to
thank several people for

18
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,410
helping make this course possible.

19
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,150
First, our video editor, Aaron,
who's done a phenomenal job making these

20
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,380
videos look so good and
frankly making us look presentable.

21
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,900
We'd also like to thank the rest of
you at Assety, especially Jenny Kim,

22
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,210
Jason Barrows, and Katie Reicult for
providing a great infrastructure for

23
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,370
course development.

24
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,000
>> We'd also like thank our
colleagues here at Georgia Tech,

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,010
including David White at
the college of computing.

26
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,340
And Mark Weston and

27
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,360
his staff at the Georgia
Professional Education Department.

28
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,240
It's been a real fun journey for us.

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,950
We expect to hear from you.

30
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,720
We hope it's the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.
