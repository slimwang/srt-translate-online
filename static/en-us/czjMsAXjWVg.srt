00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,400
So let's think of a really simple way we might solve this problem. And what I'm

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,939
going to suggest is a little like how we started. We're going to start on the

3
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:11,360
day of the first date, and we're going to just count the days, we're going to go

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,435
one day at a time. We're not going to do anything special when we go through

5
00:00:14,435 --> 00:00:18,120
months, we're just going to keep counting days, keep adding as we go. And we're

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,664
going to keep doing this until we get to our target date, and I got 156. So

7
00:00:22,664 --> 00:00:26,450
here's our pseudo code for, a really simple, brain dead way of doing it. We

8
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:30,770
initialize days to 0. We have a loop that keeps going as long as date 1 is

9
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:35,589
before date 2 and each step we advance, date 1 to the next day, and we add 1 to

10
00:00:35,589 --> 00:00:36,903
the number of days.
