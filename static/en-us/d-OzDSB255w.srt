1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:04,130
The irradiance, sometimes called energy E,

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,515
that's the energy actually arriving at the surface.

3
00:00:07,515 --> 00:00:10,435
Okay, so now we're going to talk about the energy at the surface.

4
00:00:10,435 --> 00:00:12,040
Okay, so now I've gone back to and

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,410
I'm going to leave both this perpendicular part.

6
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,800
And this little, this is the area on my surface, okay.

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,490
Now, it's because I'm actually looking at my surface I'm just going to measure

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:28,120
that as the power per unit area so that's just watts per meters squared, okay.

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,870
So clearly, there's this relationship between the amount of energy hitting that

10
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:38,180
perpendicular part, and then this skewed, the, the, the area on the surface.

11
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,585
And, the, the easiest way to think about that is to think about this

12
00:00:41,585 --> 00:00:44,250
as a foreshortening effect, all right.

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,260
So, here we have a, a light source, and the idea is that this is the direction

14
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,160
of light, and this area, this card here is meant to be perpendicular, right.

15
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,110
So there'll be a certain amount of light falling on that, on that card, right.

16
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:03,190
But if the card was not perpendicular right, if the card was tilted away,

17
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:10,120
then the same amount of light now gets spread over a larger area.

18
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,740
And so it's foreshortened.

19
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,890
So in other words, we get less light per little unit

20
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,180
area from that light source.

21
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,830
And we can write that down in the following way.

22
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,380
Sort of for the surface receiving some radiance and

23
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,350
from some direction, coming from this we'll say, fixed little patch,

24
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,780
the omega, the corresponding irradiance, the light landing on the surface,

25
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,670
is just the radiance modulated by this angle.

26
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,450
Right? So is that angle gets closer and closer and closer to, to power of 290

27
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,820
degrees, the amount of ra, irradiance goes down to zero, which is right because

28
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,140
you're essentially spreading the same amount of light over a much bigger area.
