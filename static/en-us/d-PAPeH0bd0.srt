1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,830
And the answer is, because n is a str but we're

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,950
treating it like an int. Let's look at our code again. So

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,050
on our code here, we're getting from the request and we're

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,814
just storing on th, in the variable n here. Now the problem

5
00:00:12,814 --> 00:00:15,800
is, when things come out of the requests there're always strings.

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,590
So if we want a, if we want to be an integer,

7
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,830
we need to make it an integer. Let's go ahead and do

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,420
that. So basically, if n was specified, convert it into an integer.

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,630
Now let's see if it works in our browser.

10
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,860
Okay, here we are, N equals 1. I'm going

11
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:36,000
to hit Enter, and N indeed equals 1. And if we set it to something else, N does

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,500
not equal 1. And if I set it to

13
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,080
a string, we don't get anything. And actually what

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,620
really happened, is we got an error because we

15
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:51,140
tried to convert the string Steve into an integer and

16
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,920
Python did not like that. We're not going to go ahead and fix that,

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,160
but what I wanted to show you, was that when you expect an

18
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,880
integer as a parameter from user, you need to actually convert it. because

19
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,750
the web application, or the browsers, or the HTTP has no idea what's an

20
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,680
integer and what's a string, so you have to actually do that check

21
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,190
yourself. And if we want to make that previous example work, we would have to

22
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,520
check to see is the string all digits first, and then, only then

23
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,240
convert it to an integer. So, it's a common mistake, I actually, I made

24
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,563
it when I was doing this lesson in the first place,

25
00:01:18,563 --> 00:01:20,990
and so I thought I would let you see it as well.
