1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,420
The single biggest contributor to
student success to the Nanodegree

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,980
is time commitment.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,400
The first graduate of any
Nanodegree at Udacity

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,280
didn't have any prior experience.

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,120
He simply worked hard, and
put in time consistently

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,480
making his Nanodegree part of
his daily and weekly schedule.

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,600
Now, as I mentioned before,
the timeline you're operating on

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,810
assumes that you'll work on your
Nanodegree for ten hours a week.

9
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,380
Since many students have a lot of
other things going on in their lives,

10
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,340
like jobs, families, or other big
commitments, it's really important to

11
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,980
block out time on your calendar
every week for your Nanodegree.

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,290
While binge learning works well for

13
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,880
some people, the most successful Udacity
students work on their courses and

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,160
projects multiple times a week,
not just in one big chunk.

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,220
And really,
a ten hour chunk would be exhausting.

16
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,040
This helps the learning you're doing
stick better since you're thinking

17
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:46,830
it more frequently.

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,600
On top of that, having a regular
weekly routine that you stick to

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,430
is really helpful for
keeping up your dedication.

20
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,620
Working at about the same time slots
each week can be really helpful.

21
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,770
After you do it for a few weeks,
it'll just feel like second nature.

22
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,560
So go into your calendar right now and

23
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,739
mark out which times you'll work on
the Nanodegree this week and next week.
