00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,632
>> Now you saw that it's pretty complicated to calculate the standard deviation,

2
00:00:04,632 --> 00:00:08,975
but what's so great about it? Why don't we just find the average absolute

3
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:13,705
deviation? Why do we have to square each deviation, find the average square, and

4
00:00:13,705 --> 00:00:18,090
then take the square root? Doesn't it seem like a lot of extra complicated

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:23,174
steps? Well actually, the standard deviation is really cool, and it helps us a

6
00:00:23,174 --> 00:00:27,745
lot when we do statistical analysis. It turns out that with a normal

7
00:00:27,745 --> 00:00:32,974
distribution, and if you remember, that's where the mean equals the median

8
00:00:32,974 --> 00:00:38,535
equals the mode, right in the center of the distribution, which is symmetrical,

9
00:00:38,535 --> 00:00:44,078
the standard deviation has great properties. Approximately 68 percent of the

10
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:49,287
data falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean. So here's 1 standard

11
00:00:49,287 --> 00:00:55,317
deviation on each side, and I'm using the lower case sigma to represent standard

12
00:00:55,317 --> 00:01:01,572
deviation. So 68 percent of the data falls between this value, which is x bar

13
00:01:01,572 --> 00:01:07,672
minus 1 standard deviation, and this value, which is x bar plus 1 standard

14
00:01:07,672 --> 00:01:14,017
deviation. And 95 percent of the data falls within 2 standard deviations. So

15
00:01:14,017 --> 00:01:20,737
this value here is x bar, the mean, plus 2 standard deviations, and this value

16
00:01:20,737 --> 00:01:26,957
is x bar minus 2 standard deviations. So 95 percent of the data will be between

17
00:01:26,957 --> 00:01:32,398
this value and this value. In fact, we can approximate how much data will lie in

18
00:01:32,398 --> 00:01:37,856
between any number of standard deviations from the mean. We know this because

19
00:01:37,856 --> 00:01:43,400
some poor mathematician calculated this for us and put it all into a really nice

20
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,031
table. We're going to use this table a lot in the course, but not yet.
