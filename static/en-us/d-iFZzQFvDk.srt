00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
[Narrator] The answer is 300, which you'll need to do to share the key among 4 people.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Alice will need to compute 3 keys of 100 bits long,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and one way to do this is to give 1 person the secret XOR'd with all of the keys,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and to give each person one of the keys.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
There's no way to do this with perfect secrecy using fewer than 300 key bits

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
because that would mean either we're not fully sharing the secret.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That some party has no part of some part of the secret

8
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
or that we're reusing key bits.
