1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,990
Three of these are not polynomials, but
the rest of them are. We learned that a

2
00:00:04,002 --> 00:00:08,681
polynomial is an expression that only uses
addition, subtraction, and multiplication

3
00:00:08,693 --> 00:00:13,329
to combine constants variables. But this
first trace right here has a big division

4
00:00:13,341 --> 00:00:17,505
sign in it, dividing one expression by
another expression. Now if we had either

5
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:21,740
the numerator or the denominator of this
fraction on its own, then both of them

6
00:00:21,752 --> 00:00:26,202
would be polynomials. But because they're
divided, this is not a polynomial, so

7
00:00:26,298 --> 00:00:30,555
we'll check that one off. We'll talk more
about expressions that look like this

8
00:00:30,567 --> 00:00:34,790
later on the course. One of our other
important rules is that a polynomial must

9
00:00:34,802 --> 00:00:39,202
have exponents in it that are only non
negative integers. Right here we have x to the 1/2

10
00:00:39,214 --> 00:00:43,537
and 1/2 may be positive, but it's not an
integer, so that means that this is not a

11
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:48,998
polynomial. We can think about that rule
again when we look at this answer choice

12
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:54,122
right here, -6x^5+x^-3-11x+9.
All of these terms in here are fine for

13
00:00:54,134 --> 00:01:00,238
being part of polynomials, except for this
one x^-3, because -3 is a negative integer

14
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:05,892
exponent, not a non-negative integer
exponent. So that means this expression is

15
00:01:05,904 --> 00:01:10,907
not a polynomial. It may seem a little bit
funny that 6 counts as a polynomial. We

16
00:01:10,919 --> 00:01:15,225
don't often talk about numbers or
variables on their own as polynomials, but

17
00:01:15,237 --> 00:01:19,419
they technically do qualify since they do
fit our definition. We said that

18
00:01:19,431 --> 00:01:23,787
polynomials could have just variables,
just constants, or both. So 6 and all

19
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:27,879
other constant terms are technically
polynomials. We're going to talk about

20
00:01:27,891 --> 00:01:31,867
polynomials throughout the entire rest of
the course, so it's great to get a handle

21
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:32,008
on how to find them.
