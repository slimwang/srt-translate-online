00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,370
So now that we've played Avatar's movie trailer, here's your

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,190
challenge. I want you to comment out this line, the

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,470
line that shows the trailer for Avatar. Then, I want

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,490
you to create a new object, but this time of your

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,170
favorite movie, and I want you to play its trailer

6
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:19,510
instead. Here are the instructions one more time. Much like Toy

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,120
Story and Avatar, we want you to create a new

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,610
instance or object of the class Movie. Once you've done that,

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,110
we want you to play a trailer of that

10
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,610
movie using the new instance or object. And finally,

11
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,610
we want you to share a screenshot of your

12
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,390
program's output on the discussion forum. Now, in case you

13
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,250
have a way to video record your computer screen,

14
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,490
perhaps using a smartphone, you can also share a Youtube

15
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,000
video of your output with us. Make sure to

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,590
check this box after submitting your response on the forum.
