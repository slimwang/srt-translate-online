1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,150
So if your website has users log in
that's one way to tell the traffic apart

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:10,240
from each other even if your site has
some users who are logged in and some

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,640
users who aren't logged in as in the
case of sites like Wikipedia or Google.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,310
You can still get a pretty
good estimate this way.

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,840
Now you can't tell much from the speed
of the users network connection.

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,880
And multiple users coming in from
the same net are probably going to have

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,670
the same speed anyway.

8
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,840
Apps can assign the session cookie
to a particular browser instance

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,240
even if there's no logged
in users identity.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,640
So that can work to distinguish
different users that are behind

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,120
the same net.

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,210
Now a remote user's ethernet MAC address
is not something that a web server can

13
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,980
see so that won't work.

14
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,940
And geolocation involves looking up
the user's IP address in a table or

15
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,400
service to find out where
on the planet they are.

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,630
But that relies on
the public IP address,

17
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:54,290
it's going to return the same answer
from multiple users behind the knot.

18
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,870
And because these two will work,

19
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,410
it's not the case that
none of these will work.

20
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,400
There are ways you can find out
how many users your site has,

21
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,310
even if some of those users are behind
the same public IP address.
