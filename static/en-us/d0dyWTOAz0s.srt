00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,982
We've just reviewed a bit of new material on the shape of a function and how

2
00:00:03,982 --> 00:00:07,454
that's affected by its degree, and also how changing the sign of the

3
00:00:07,454 --> 00:00:13,816
coefficient flips the graph over the x axis. Now, I've drawn four different

4
00:00:13,816 --> 00:00:18,680
graphs here, and labeled them a, b, c, and d. They represent 4 types of

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,904
functions which I've listed right here. One of them shows a polynomial with an

6
00:00:22,904 --> 00:00:27,565
even degree and a positive leading coefficient. One shows a polynomial with an

7
00:00:27,565 --> 00:00:31,481
even degree and a negative leading coefficient. Another shows a polynomial with

8
00:00:31,481 --> 00:00:35,537
an odd degree and positive leading coefficient. And the last one shows a

9
00:00:35,537 --> 00:00:39,868
polynomial with odd degree and a negative leading coefficient. I'd like you to

10
00:00:39,868 --> 00:00:44,546
tell me which one of these graphs matches each of these categories. Please put

11
00:00:44,546 --> 00:00:48,753
the letter of each graph next to the description over here that it matches.
