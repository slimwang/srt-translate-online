1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,950
We're going to create two relationships.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,260
One that goes from notebook to note and

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,400
another one which goes
from note to notebook.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,160
In order for

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,160
Core Data to work its magic, it's vital
that we always set both relationships.

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,560
One way and then back.

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,640
There's a big difference
between both relationships.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,130
Notebook, which we will
create here is one-to-one,

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:30,970
which means that one note
can only be in one notebook.

10
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:36,460
Notes is one-to-many, which means that
one notebook can have several notes.

11
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:42,360
Let's stop for a moment and think how
these relationships will be mapped

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,500
once the entity is turned into a class.

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,140
A one-to-one relationship,

14
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,390
such as a notebook,
will become a property of type notebook.

15
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,460
So far so good.

16
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,710
What will happen to notes?

17
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,311
It will become a property of type set.

18
00:00:58,311 --> 00:01:02,060
A set similar to an array but
it with a few limitations.

19
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,459
There's no order and
no object can be repeated.

20
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,100
Now that we have both
relationships created,

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,160
let's make sure that we have both,
the direct relationship and the inverse.

22
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,811
This is a very important step.

23
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:22,536

24
00:01:22,536 --> 00:01:23,710
And back to notebook.

25
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:34,109
[BLANK_AUDIO]

26
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:37,469
We need to make sure that the
relationship goes from note to notebook.

27
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:39,858
[BLANK_AUDIO]

28
00:01:39,858 --> 00:01:40,577
And now

29
00:01:40,577 --> 00:01:44,449
[BLANK_AUDIO]

30
00:01:44,449 --> 00:01:46,570
We have the two relationships correct.

31
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,891
Now, move on to the next video once
you've added the relationships to your

32
00:01:50,891 --> 00:01:51,437
data model.
