00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:02,910
To figure out what was happening in the last question, let's just look at one

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:07,459
of those numbers as an example to explore more. How about that first one? 3.1

3
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:11,746
times 10 to the 4th. We can keep 3.1 as is, but we know that 10 to the 4th can

4
00:00:11,746 --> 00:00:18,606
be written differently. This is just 10,000. So, 3.1 times 10 to the 4th is

5
00:00:18,606 --> 00:00:24,170
equal to 3.1 times 10,000. What do we do now? Well, you may remember that to

6
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:28,734
multiply a number by 10, you add a 0. But in reality, what you're actually

7
00:00:28,734 --> 00:00:32,637
doing is moving the decimal point of the number one place to the right when you

8
00:00:32,637 --> 00:00:38,990
multiply by 10. And in some cases, this requires the addition of a 0. For

9
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:42,040
example, if we look at the number 31 and we want to multiply it by 10, we need

10
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,870
to note that the decimal point is invisible, but it's technically right here.

11
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:51,160
We need to move it from being right after the 1, the one place to the right.

12
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,393
And since there's nothing here right now, we need to add a 0 in, then we put a

13
00:00:54,393 --> 00:00:59,550
decimal point after that 0. In this case though, we're dealing with 10 to the

14
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,936
4th power, so what do we do in that situation? Well, for each 10 that's here,

15
00:01:03,936 --> 00:01:07,275
this number is going to get ten times bigger, so the decimal needs to move one

16
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:12,843
step to the right in each of those factors of 10. The first time we move it, we

17
00:01:12,843 --> 00:01:16,700
end up with 31. The next time we move it, the decimal point would be out here,

18
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,482
and here we have one of those invisible spaces. We know we're going to need to

19
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:25,756
put a 0 there, but let's not derail ourselves at this point. We've already

20
00:01:25,756 --> 00:01:30,386
moved over two times, so that takes care of two of our four factors of 10. We

21
00:01:30,386 --> 00:01:35,298
need two more. There's our third and there is our fourth. So our decimal point

22
00:01:35,298 --> 00:01:39,580
started out right here. And in the end, it's all the way out here to the right.

23
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:46,492
We went from having 3.1, to having 31, to having 310, to 3,100, and finally, to

24
00:01:46,492 --> 00:01:52,054
31,000. This is where our decimal point would belong if we decided to write it

25
00:01:52,054 --> 00:01:55,966
in. We know it's generally invisible though, for numbers that don't have

26
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:59,817
decimals written outside of them. To give you a chance to try out what we've

27
00:01:59,817 --> 00:02:02,589
been talking about, see if you can write out that number that we had at the end

28
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:08,503
of the last question. 3.1 times 10 to the 21. How would you write this using

29
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,459
our normal number notation, not scientific?
