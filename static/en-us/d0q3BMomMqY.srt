00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,857
Last in our series of the three main types of selectors,

2
00:00:03,857 --> 00:00:06,860
you can also select elements by ID.

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:12,620
Unlike tags or classes, IDs are specific to single elements, so

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,700
we should expect to see a jQuery collection with only one DOM element returned.

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,630
Selecting by ID is easy.

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:24,440
Simply put a hashtag or pound sign or whatever you want to call it in front of

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:29,220
the ID name inside quotes so you've got a string and you'll be selecting by ID.

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,880
For this quiz, set the nav variable equal to

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,740
the jQuery collection of the DOM element with ID of nav.
