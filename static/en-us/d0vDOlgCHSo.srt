1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,968
Now, let's look at that other half of the graph, the part of the graph that's to

2
00:00:03,968 --> 00:00:07,990
the left of this line of symmetry, the axis of the problem. In this interval,

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:12,020
which goes from negative infinity to negative 0.75, not including either

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:16,172
endpoint. What can you say about the behavior of f of x? Again, we're going to

5
00:00:16,172 --> 00:00:20,560
read the graph from left to right. So, I'm asking you, as x values increase,

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,560
what happens to the value of f of x? Does it increase, does it decrease or does

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,479
it stay constant?
