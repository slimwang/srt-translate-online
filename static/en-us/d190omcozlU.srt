00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,393
>> Let's try this with some practice. >> What do you think the solution set is

2
00:00:04,393 --> 00:00:09,163
to this compound inequality? This last answer might look unfamiliar. >> We have

3
00:00:09,163 --> 00:00:13,618
two separate regions on the number line. >> When we want both regions, we use

4
00:00:13,618 --> 00:00:17,890
the simple union, because we could have these answers or these answers. >> So,

5
00:00:17,891 --> 00:00:22,664
what values of x make this inequality true and this inequality true? Try your

6
00:00:22,664 --> 00:00:22,955
best.
