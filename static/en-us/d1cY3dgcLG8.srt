00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Of course, exponential growth is highly unrealistic. Let's have a look at this diagram.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Now the horizontal axis is not the time, it's the amount of fish,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and the vertical axis is the growth rate.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
With exponential growth, the growth rate does not depend on the amount of fish.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Even if the ocean were full of fish, we would still have

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
the same growth rate, which cannot be true.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
There should be some sort of carrying capacity at which the growth rate becomes zero.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The easiest way to include this effect is to use the growth rate.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
that depends on the amount of fish in the linear fashion.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This is called logistic growth.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
If the amount of fish is very small, we start with the high growth rate

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and as the amount of fish increases, the growth rate drops

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and if the amount of fish reaches the carrying capacity of the environment,

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
there won't be any growth anymore.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
How do we turn this effect plus constant harvesting into an equation.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Here are three options for you to choose from.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Should the rate of change of the amount of fish be of 0.5/1 year times

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
the amount minus 10⁶ tons minus 10⁵ tons per year or should it be

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
0.5 per year times 1 minus the amount over 10⁶ tons times the amount minus 10⁵ tons per year

20
00:01:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
or should it be 0.5 per year times the amount minus 10⁶ tons times the amount minus 10⁵ tons per year.
