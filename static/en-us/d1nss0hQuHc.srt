>> I'm mixing a punch mix that has 65% water with a punch mix that has 80%

2
00:00:04,436 --> 00:00:09,206
water. So 80% as a decimal is 0.80. I don't know how much of it I'm using, so

3
00:00:09,206 --> 00:00:14,138
that volume is x. Multiplying the terms together I get 0.8 times x. For this

4
00:00:14,138 --> 00:00:19,143
third percentage, we know that our punch mix needs to wind up being 75% water so

5
00:00:19,143 --> 00:00:24,010
I want to write this as a decimal. Keep in mind that we have 65% of a punch mix

6
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:28,737
that's water, and five gallons of that punch mix. When I multiply these numbers

7
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:32,967
together, I get gallons of water. So I have gallons of water with gallons of

8
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:37,240
water should equal my total gallons of water. We'll check this in the end to

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,465
make sure it's true.
