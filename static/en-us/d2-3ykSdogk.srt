00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,095
This parabola's vertex is centered at 5 comma negative 2. Great work if you've

2
00:00:06,095 --> 00:00:11,528
found this as the vertex. We start with the basic graph y equals x squared. And

3
00:00:11,528 --> 00:00:16,915
we can shift all the points down by subtracting 2 from that equation. Think

4
00:00:16,915 --> 00:00:21,300
about the values of y and how they change. If you know that y equals x squared

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,100
is, then subtracting 2 from x squared will give you a y value that is decreased

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:32,473
by 2. Next, we shift the graph to the right by 5 units, by subtracting 5 from

7
00:00:32,473 --> 00:00:38,586
the x term in the binomial. When finding the x coordinate when y equals

8
00:00:38,586 --> 00:00:42,942
negative 2, we know that this part of the equation, our binomial squared, would

9
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:48,802
have to equal 0. We know if x minus 5 squared equals 0, then we would have 0

10
00:00:48,802 --> 00:00:54,825
minus 2. So y would just equal negative 2. That's the y coordinate of our

11
00:00:54,825 --> 00:00:59,122
vertex. So this means that we set our binomial equal to 0 to get an x

12
00:00:59,122 --> 00:01:05,430
coordinate of our vertex, have x equals positive 5. Notice again that the sign

13
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,895
is different for the x coordinate of our vertex than the sign in the binomial

14
00:01:08,895 --> 00:01:15,725
here. Our vertex has an x coordinate of positive 5, but the binomial has the

15
00:01:15,725 --> 00:01:21,620
number negative 5. But the sign of the y coordinate is the same. The y

16
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,975
coordinate the vertex is negative 2, and we see negative 2 at the end of our

17
00:01:24,975 --> 00:01:26,469
equation.
