1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,460
So by the way, here's a question for you. We can make it a quiz but I'm

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:07,755
not going to make it a quiz. What is the value of the game at p equals 0.4?

3
00:00:07,755 --> 00:00:12,105
>> So I just plug it into those equations, and so negative 10 times

4
00:00:12,105 --> 00:00:17,150
0.4 is like, negative 4 plus 5, is 1. So I'm going to say 1.

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,840
>> Mm-hm. So the value here is in fact $0.01. And if you put it

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,870
in the other equation you get the

7
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,970
same thing. Yes, right, because they're equal there.

8
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:25,690
>> That's

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,520
actually the answer to the entire kit and kaboodle. If.

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,800
>> Sorry, where were the kittens?

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,150
>> If A chooses a mixed strategy, where with probability 0.4 he

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,580
chooses to be a holder. Notice that it doesn't matter whether B

13
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:43,140
is a resigner or B is a seer. You will end up

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,790
here and there will be a value of plus 1 penny to A.

15
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,020
>> On average.

16
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,933
>> The expected value is.

17
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:51,220
>> Yeah.

18
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:51,960
>> plus 1.

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,220
>> Neat!

20
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,360
>> Now you might ask yourself, well what if B

21
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,530
decides to be a smarty pants and also do a mixed

22
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,600
strategy? What do you think would happen in that case? So

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,730
of course it changes something, but it doesn't change the value

24
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,440
of the game, because B, if B is a resigner, A

25
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,310
is getting one on average. If B is a seer then

26
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,620
A is getting one on average, and an, any average, any

27
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,870
convex average of one and one is going to give us one.

28
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:15,960
>> That's exactly right.

29
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,850
So in fact if you think about it, if B tries to

30
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,800
do a mixed strategy between these two lines. It's going to have to

31
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,060
be for every single point between the two lines, somewhere the average

32
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,080
is going to have to be somewhere in between there. No matter how you

33
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,980
weight that average. So it's like a bow tie is this space

34
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,360
of possible payoffs. Right and since for any let's if I just,

35
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,210
If B decided to pick some, you know, some values such that

36
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,900
it's in this region of the space. And it's going to end up somewhere,

37
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,750
say between

38
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,720
here that's fine, or here that's fine, or here that's fine,

39
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,740
or here that's fine, or here that's fine. More importantly, right here

40
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,260
it's going to have to be between the two lines. Where those

41
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:00,800
two lines cross. So, no matter what mixed strategy B chooses. On

42
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,510
average we will end up here, so the value of this

43
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:07,290
game is the expected value of this game and it is, plus

44
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,460
1 for A. Okay so hang on why is that not

45
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,120
there are other values that can be obtained. There is a minus

46
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,585
5 a plus 5, true. Why is it plus 1? Well its plus

47
00:02:17,585 --> 00:02:22,160
1 here on average, the expected value of this game. Is plus 1.

48
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,520
>> So you say that the strategy for A is to choose .4.

49
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,084
>> Mm-hm.

50
00:02:27,084 --> 00:02:29,860
>> But why? Like, why is that, of all the

51
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,710
different values. What [INAUDIBLE], just because the lines intersect. I

52
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,120
don't understand what makes that a good idea for A.

53
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,280
Like, it's not like it gets any additional payoff for having

54
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,550
things intersect. Well, if a is going to choose a mixed

55
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,560
strategy, and b is going to choose a mixed strategy. This is

56
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,840
the mixed strategy for a, that guarantees an expected value of

57
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,620
plus 1. Meanwhile, let's imagine this is the way you're going to set

58
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,880
it up. So we've been kind of talking in general that

59
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,250
a's going to choose the strategy; b's going to choose a strategy, and they're

60
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,540
going to go. And that, because we know everyone's rational, you already

61
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,460
know what strategy b's going to pick, and b already knows what strategy

62
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,630
a's going to pick Right, because we made this assumption about everyone

63
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:11,470
is trying to maximize their own utility, there own reward. So in

64
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,010
a mixed strategy, if you know you're going to go for a

65
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:17,080
mixed strategy, you have exactly the same situation. B can figure out

66
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,560
well what is it that A should choose and A can

67
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,110
figure out what is it that B should choose. So notice that

68
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,840
in this particular version of the game, the way it's setup. Even

69
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,660
if A announced beforehand to B. Listen I am going to choose

70
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:33,520
to be a holder with probability 0.4. It doesn't matter

71
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,620
what B chooses the expected value is this +1. Right?

72
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,420
>> Yeah.

73
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,520
>> But imagine if A said I am going to pick, I'm going to choose to be

74
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,140
a holder with probability 1. Well then, what

75
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,360
should b do? B should choose to seer.

76
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,040
>> Right.

77
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,215
>> It's exactly the situation we were in before.

78
00:03:49,215 --> 00:03:51,800
>> Okay, but here's the thing I'm having trouble wrapping

79
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,000
my head around. So, it's not special that it's an intersection,

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,535
what's special maybe, is it that, you know, if b is always.

81
00:03:59,535 --> 00:04:03,150
Okay; taking what you said before, that a is going to announce a

82
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,780
strategy. So for anything that A can announce B is going to

83
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,890
presumably do what's best for B which is to just minimize right?

84
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:12,500
>> Mm-hm.

85
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,470
>> So if you look at that triangle at the bottom.

86
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,031
>> Mm-hm.

87
00:04:18,031 --> 00:04:21,055
>> If you think about that as those lines that V, upside down

88
00:04:21,055 --> 00:04:23,587
V shape. Yeah exactly that thing. If you

89
00:04:23,587 --> 00:04:26,539
think about that as being the payoffs, the

90
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:29,245
payoff function for A, as a function of

91
00:04:29,245 --> 00:04:32,253
the probability P that it chooses to hold.

92
00:04:32,253 --> 00:04:32,740
>> Mm-hm.

93
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,380
>> Then we've chosen the maximum.

94
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,150
>> Right.

95
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,520
>> Right, we're trying to find the, the probability for which A gets

96
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,846
the highest expected value. And it's at that, it's at that peak there.

97
00:04:42,846 --> 00:04:46,470
>> Hm-hm. But notice something, Michael. For any case

98
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,370
where the two lines cross, you're going to have a function of this form.

99
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,940
>> Well, let's be sure of that, because that's,

100
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,010
I wasn't seeing, I was thinking that that was not

101
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,590
true. because basically in this case, we have a, a

102
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,800
line of positive slope and a line of negative slope.

103
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,785
>> Mm-hm.

104
00:05:00,785 --> 00:05:03,340
>> Right? So, what if we, we can have

105
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,000
an intersection between two lines of negative slope. huh. So

106
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,210
again, by doing the same exercise you were doing before,

107
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,700
where you draw the, you sort of take the minimum

108
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,960
of the two lines at all points.

109
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,530
>> Yeah.

110
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,820
>> You'll end up with this. Where do you pick it then?

111
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,030
>> The far left, p equals 0.

112
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:18,360
>> Yeah.

113
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,630
>> But not the intersection in particular.

114
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,690
>> No, that's true.

115
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,050
>> Okay, alright, I just, wasn't quite

116
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,630
getting that. But so, the intersection is special,

117
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,320
Because in some cases that is where the max is. It can only I guess

118
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,360
the max can only be in those three places, right, it could be far left

119
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,310
far right or the intersection. There' s no other way to have a maximum of lines.

120
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,150
>> Right. And

121
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,980
b by the way there's another case like this where

122
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,480
they never actually cross.

123
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:43,504
>> Mm.

124
00:05:43,504 --> 00:05:45,100
>> Or like this where they never actually cross. Got it.

125
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,460
>> Right, but in either case, right, it's always going to

126
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,190
be those three points. It's going to be the extreme or

127
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,350
where they cross. If they happen to never cross, then

128
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,560
that point goes away and you just pick the maximum. So

129
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,100
what you could, so, in fact, if you wanted to

130
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,830
think of an algorithm to choose the right thing to

131
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:03,450
do for A, you basically plot the lines. You take

132
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,900
the min at every point and you find the maximum point.

133
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,850
>> Oh I see, so you could just kind

134
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:08,950
of discretized it almost.

135
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,150
>> Yeah, and you're done. Seem reasonable?

136
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,370
>> Well discretized seems problematic but like I get

137
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,190
that we're trying to find the probability so that

138
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:19,670
we maximize. Oh wait we maximize the minimum of

139
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,000
the two other things. So it's like maximin again. Yeah.

140
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,210
>> Except here, so, in fact, it is exactly min

141
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,560
and max or max and min, except, oh, I guess, if

142
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,470
you're thinking from A's point of view. It's min and max

143
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,070
or max and min but in this case, there's this other

144
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,780
parameter, which is the probability. Which is how

145
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,190
you determine how you're doing the min and max.

146
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,530
>> Got it, right. In this bigger space, it's min

147
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,360
and max. I see, yeah, yeah, yeah, that makes sense. What

148
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,850
about so, why is A the one who needs to be

149
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,460
random? Why isn't B the one who needs to be random?

150
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,260
>> It's, you end up with the same, you end up in

151
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,880
the same place. Because again, remember,

152
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,500
you're, you're doing this kind of optimal

153
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,710
notion, where underneath all of that is this belief that both people are

154
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,250
going to be rational. So the only reason to do this, to take

155
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,370
the, you know, maximum minimum, is if you believe

156
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:01,950
that B is always going to try to minimize what

157
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:05,160
you do. But B's in exactly the same situation.

158
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,210
Right, from B's point of view, That's what's happening.

159
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,040
>> Huh. It's the same equations?

160
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,260
>> Yeah, it just it gets turned around. That's

161
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,390
actually an interesting exercise. Maybe that's the next homework assignment.

162
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,030
>> Okay.

163
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,580
>> So, did that all make sense to you?

164
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,860
>> [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] It looks a little

165
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,600
green and scribbley, but yeah. Sure. That's cool.

166
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,370
>> That's how you know

167
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,340
when you're done, Michael. When it's all green and scribbley.

>> [LAUGH] Does this generalize to more than two

169
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,720
options? It seems like it's going to get messy fast.

170
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,200
>> Yes, it does. It generalizes to more than two options. Effectively

171
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,070
now, you're just doing a max over n things, instead of two things.

172
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,780
>> And you have to search for,

173
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,150
there's possibly way more intersections to worry about.

174
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,350
>> Yeah, but all you care about is the minimum.

175
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,470
Think of it as you're always drawing the minimum function.
