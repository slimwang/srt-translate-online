1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,520
Now let me introduce to you
an additional concept on how we can

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,810
actually do this warping that
actually tries to avoid some of

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,810
these granularity and aliasing and
minification, magnification problems.

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,450
And that is using a mesh on an image and

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,620
deforming that mesh to
generate the warps.

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,750
To demonstrate this let
me use these two images.

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,660
We will refer to this as a source and
this as a target.

8
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,370
Some of you may recognize this person,

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,100
actually these are images from my
PhD thesis from many many years ago.

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,439
And the big difference between these
two images is one neutral expression,

11
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,660
the other one is a smile expression.

12
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,600
Now we are interested in basically
computing the warp between these.

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,600
Now, one way to compute a warp would be
basically finding out a corresponding

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,930
set of points that are common
in between these two.

15
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,100
To achieve this, many different methods
could be used, I'll talk about one in

16
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,890
a second, and basically, once we find
these corresponding set of points,

17
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,646
we can interpolate between them
using a displacement field.

18
00:00:56,646 --> 00:01:01,780
So first, we want to do is take this
image and basically this or actually

19
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:07,690
represent this as a mesh, which each
element is basically a set of triangles.

20
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,840
So here I'm basically showing that
I can actually now take this,

21
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,800
put it on top of this.

22
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,490
And this would be rectangles but
what we're interested in is triangles,

23
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:19,900
each of every one of these squares
would actually be two triangles.

24
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,550
And you, you basically see what I mean
by this, and now basically, I have

25
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,430
regional pixel the values intensities,
and stuff like that, of an image.

26
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,920
Put on each every one
of these triangles.

27
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,130
But we can then do is
basically use an affine model

28
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:38,170
to transform each triangle
from one to the other.

29
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,810
Of course, we will also want to
generate a similar triangle mesh with

30
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,540
the deformations that
kind of show all of this.

31
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,190
This is my displacement field here,

32
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,540
if you notice that there is
a little bit of, asymmetry.

33
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,960
The eyes get a little smaller, and, this
basically showing most of the motion

34
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,380
is here, and most of the motion is here,
you see a lot of deformation.

35
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,290
Again, deformation is 3D, but

36
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,060
in 2D you can start noticing
this is where the changes are.

37
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:06,650
So using this now, actually we can
come up with a model of how we would

38
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:11,300
transform our region points from
here to here to get to this.

39
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,300
And of course, to achieve this, one will
be able you affine model for each and

40
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,940
every one of the triangles then
we'll basically use inverse mapping.

41
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,893
To be able to go from there to here, and

42
00:02:19,893 --> 00:02:22,042
being able to then
generate a warp field.

43
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:27,572
So now you notice basically
the interpolation resulted in going

44
00:02:27,572 --> 00:02:30,560
from a neutral expression,
to a small expression.

45
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,600
And basically what we did, was we
created a warp from one to the other,

46
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,520
and in this case of course I showed you
all of the in between frames to kind of

47
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,080
make it look like a person
went from neutral to a smile.

48
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,460
Again remember,
we did not have any of those frames,

49
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,050
they were generated
because of the warp field.

50
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,040
Let's look at it one more time
