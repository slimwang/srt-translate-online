1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,630
Great editing environments,
safety nets in place?

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:04,350
>> Check and check.

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,960
What else could we need?

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,890
>> Well, we've optimized your
development workflow but

5
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,320
that's about it.

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,940
Now think about all
the things that you do or

7
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,470
should do after you finishing coding and
planning a release.

8
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,710
Things like unifying and

9
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,950
concatenating your source files and
optimizing your images.

10
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,110
In today's mobile world, you see
hundreds of different device, browser,

11
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,200
and screen combinations
that use your app or site.

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,113
In some cases, it's simply
impossible to optimize by hand.

13
00:00:28,113 --> 00:00:30,530
>> This is where your
build process steps in.

14
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,350
We'll use it to optimize things
that you can't fix by hand, or

15
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,910
simply take too long.

16
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,320
And doing so
will make your build more powerful,

17
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,050
so that it takes a raw source code and
polishes it for production.
