1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,460
I want you to consider each
of these optimizations and

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,960
answer which of those will
get us to the $1 million.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,870
In other words, if the robot is trying
to maximize the sum over these horizons,

4
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:20,080
which ones will lead it to a policy
that causes it to reach that $1 million?
