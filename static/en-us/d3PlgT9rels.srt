1
00:00:00,027 --> 00:00:01,862
The answer to this question is yes.

2
00:00:01,862 --> 00:00:06,086
Although P2 and P3 observe these
operations in arbitrary way,

3
00:00:06,086 --> 00:00:09,772
neither one of them synchronized and
forced the memory,

4
00:00:09,772 --> 00:00:12,692
the underlying
distributed shared memory,

5
00:00:12,692 --> 00:00:17,326
to make any kind of guarantees
regarding the updates that it observes.

6
00:00:17,326 --> 00:00:21,486
Weak consistency will not make any
guarantees regarding the ordering unless

7
00:00:21,486 --> 00:00:24,180
explicit synchronization
operations are used.
