1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,770
What does this have to do with images?

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,480
Well, let me tell you.

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,308
I'm going to introduce this using the
notion of face images 'because frankly

4
00:00:07,308 --> 00:00:10,904
it was this eigenvector approach to
doing face recognition that really,

5
00:00:10,904 --> 00:00:12,753
I think, got people's attention.

6
00:00:12,753 --> 00:00:17,125
Think of an image now,
not as a two dimensional thing, but

7
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:20,620
as just one great big long vector.

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,180
Okay?

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,490
So it's just got a whole
bunch of values in it.

10
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,208
So for example, suppose I had
a vector that was 100 by 100 long.

11
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:29,292
How many pixels is that, Megan?

12
00:00:29,292 --> 00:00:30,625
100 by 100.

13
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:31,667
>> 10,000.

14
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:32,167
>> 10,000.

15
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:32,833
You got it right.

16
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,580
100 times 100 is 10,000.

17
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,390
So, that's just a 10,000 long vector.

18
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,500
If I don't worry about the fact that
they're pixels located in a particular

19
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,790
position, which, by the way, is going to
be an interesting problem later,

20
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:50,733
if I just think of them as values,
that's a 10,000 dimensional space.

21
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:53,405
Right.
There's 10,000 dimensions,

22
00:00:53,405 --> 00:00:54,755
each dimension has a value.

23
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:56,055
What's the value?

24
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:59,855
It's the value of the pixel that
corresponds to that location.

25
00:00:59,855 --> 00:01:01,555
This location is another pixel.

26
00:01:01,555 --> 00:01:04,004
It's value 18, fine,
that's it's value here.

27
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:08,730
So the idea is that an image is
just a 10,000 dimensional vector.

28
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,290
Question.

29
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:14,550
How many of those 10,000
dimensional vectors,

30
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:19,510
how many 100 by 100 pictures,
are actually pictures of faces?

31
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,450
I mean, just of a face?

32
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,680
Answer.

33
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,460
Not a whole lot, okay?

34
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,870
In fact, most values, all right,
if I just randomly put numbers in tho,

35
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,080
that vector.

36
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:30,790
Right.

37
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,905
I get out,
you know random pixels everywhere.

38
00:01:32,905 --> 00:01:33,760
Right?

39
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:39,820
The idea is, that,
faces are a very special set of vectors.

40
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,350
They're not all possible vectors, and

41
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:45,482
they're not distributed
everywhere in this image space.

42
00:01:45,482 --> 00:01:47,320
They are on some particular,

43
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,630
what's referred to as a subspace,
sometimes a manifold, okay.

44
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,480
They're in a subspace of all images.

45
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,300
Okay?
By the way,

46
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,360
we sometimes call that subspace,
face space.

47
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,530
What's face space?

48
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,390
Is the subspace in the space of images
that are the pictures of faces.

49
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,190
All right.

50
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,640
So here's what we want to do.

51
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,860
We and this is color coded so
we want to build a low dimensional,

52
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,630
because we're going to try to get a nice
dimensionality reduction going on here,

53
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:21,470
linear, we'll talk about the use of
linearity to be able to just do dot

54
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:27,680
products together coefficient, subspace,
so it's going to be some reduced space,

55
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,190
that explains most of
the variation seen in face images.

56
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,400
And that's just drawn out here,
this looks just like what we had before.

57
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,710
Where we had blue dots and,
and orange dots.

58
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,450
Now I'm telling you well actually,

59
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,450
even though this is drawn as
just a two dimensional space,

60
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,257
'because I can only draw two,
it's a 10,000 dimensional space.

61
00:02:47,257 --> 00:02:47,880
10,000.

62
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,420
You like that.

63
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,550
Okay, fine.
10,000 pixels and

64
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:55,350
the idea is let me find the direction or

65
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:59,800
directions in that image along
which most of the face images lie.

66
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,865
And that's what it shows here,

67
00:03:00,865 --> 00:03:04,950
that the cyan color is sort of, ideas
that the face images are there, and

68
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,790
then we've got all these other
images that are not images of faces.

69
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,180
They're cats, well they're all sorts of
things, okay, whatever the internet has

70
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,060
pictures of and
all other possible things, all right.
