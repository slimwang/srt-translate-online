00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,270
Let's try to summarize what we've done so far.

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,010
We started with the initial question,

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,460
how popular were the different brands of candy?

4
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,400
We then thought about,

5
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,760
what sort of quantities should we use to make this question quantitative.

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,380
Interselection time, total number of selections.

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,970
And we ended up going with interselection time.

8
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,520
With a way to quantify the problem in hand,

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,950
we then had to cast the question as a rigorous statistical inference problem,

10
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,640
such as confidence sets or classification.

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,870
We ended up going with point estimation.

12
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,299
Specifically, we chose to create a regression estimator in which,

13
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:35,430
given the candy and the particular choice number,

14
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,750
what is the interselection time of that candy?

15
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:42,520
Specifically, how long has it been since someone chose that particular candy.

16
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,840
Previously, we took a look at some plots of interselection time for

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,270
individual candies.

18
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,840
Let's examine multiple plots on the same graph at once.

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,670
Here is depicted the interselection times of Rolo and

20
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,530
Reese's, with Reese's in blue and Rolo in green.

21
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:01,400
As you can see, the average interselection time of Reese's starts out lower, but

22
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,930
jumps a bit at the end.

23
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,450
And vice-versa for Rolo.

24
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:08,170
Recall that lower interselection time corresponds to higher demand.

25
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:12,260
And conversely, higher interselection time corresponds to lower demand.

26
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,730
Thus Reese's starts out in high demand, but

27
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,900
then gradually gets selected less and less often.

28
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,510
Conversely, Rolo starts out in low demand, and

29
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,840
gradually becomes selected more often.

30
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,090
This plot lends some support to the notion that, in fact,

31
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:29,880
there is some interaction between different brands of candy in the candy bowl.

32
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,380
If true, this should not be very surprising.

33
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,710
The brands of candy do not sit in the candy bowl in isolation.

34
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:39,570
A person's choice of a particular candy is influenced by the presence of

35
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,880
other candies in the bowl.

36
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,970
If, in fact, people preferred one brand of candy overall to another,

37
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,060
then you'd expect the time between selections for

38
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,960
one brand to be low at the same time the other was high.

39
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,110
As the first one starts to be depleted, the interselection time for

40
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,790
the second type starts to go down.
