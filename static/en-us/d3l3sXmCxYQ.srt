1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,250
When thinking about growth for
your app one of the most important

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:07,040
things is the key flows that you know
your users are going to go through.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,570
Most people who download your app
are not going to come back later.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,220
So you really need to get them to
the wow moment at the beginning

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,210
as soon as possible with your product.

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,170
So make them see what the value is so
that they will come back again.

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,250
One of the most important things in
A/B testing is also the creative side.

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,110
So whilst the process
itself is scientific,

9
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:31,330
and you want to use math and
data to get to the right decision,

10
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,570
knowing what you can do to move
the metrics that you want to do

11
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,950
is very much the creative part
that goes at the beginning.

12
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,360
And without that, then you can't do all
of the testing that comes afterwards.

13
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,523
If your user is waiting just
few hundred milliseconds more,

14
00:00:43,523 --> 00:00:45,020
they will use your app less.

15
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,760
It's really important to be creative.

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,391
For instance, if your app aBARKment, you
wanted more people to be able to post

17
00:00:51,391 --> 00:00:54,540
an ad, there are an infinite number
of ways that you can go about it.

18
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,612
For instance, you might want a permanent
entry point on at the same point in

19
00:00:58,612 --> 00:01:02,687
every single screen in the app to make
sure that people always knew that they

20
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:06,393
could post an ad and they always knew
where they wanted to go to do it.

21
00:01:06,393 --> 00:01:10,454
One of the most important things that
any marketer needs to think about with

22
00:01:10,454 --> 00:01:12,950
their Apple product is retention.

23
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:16,640
So, it's hard to get people to try
out your app for the first time.

24
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,960
And if you're losing
users from your app,

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,390
that can make all of your
work that much harder.

26
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,190
It's like having a bucket
with holes in it.

27
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,920
If you're pouring water into the top,

28
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,920
your bucket's not going to get
full if you have that many holes.

29
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,820
So you concentrate on filling those
holes, increasing user retention, and

30
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,530
then you can get more users in.

31
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,350
When you're trying to measure retention,

32
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,050
if you're storing your own data, you
need to make sure that you store when

33
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,930
was the first time
that you saw this user.

34
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,520
So what was the date when
they first turned up?

35
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,010
Then you can do what's
called cohort analysis.

36
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:48,540
And this is just a way of saying for
everyone who installed on a single day,

37
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,870
after that, what was the likelihood that
they came back on any other given day?

38
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,860
Another thing that app marketers
should really care about

39
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,740
is the number of people who
are actively using your product.

40
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,880
Too many marketers focus on
just the top of the funnel and

41
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,250
getting the number of downloads up and
the number of new users in, but if

42
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,330
they're not actively using the product,
then they're not doing you any good.

43
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,160
So one that Facebook uses is monthly
active users and that's just the number

44
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,030
of people who have opened and
used your app in the last 30 days.

45
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,500
When you're looking at new user
acquisition, one of the most important

46
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,810
things is the different sources that
are providing you with new users.

47
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,580
So, for instance,

48
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,530
there's organic downloads where people
are coming direct from the App Store.

49
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,490
Maybe they're searching for
a specific term.

50
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,597
Maybe they're just browsing.

51
00:02:31,597 --> 00:02:34,092
Other ones include pay channels.

52
00:02:34,092 --> 00:02:38,550
Facebook, for instance,
does mobile app install ads.

53
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,490
If you go with paid media,

54
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,990
you'll usually get a lot of stats
from the actual tool itself.

55
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,130
So inside of Facebook,
if you pay for ads,

56
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,170
we'll give you really important
key of metrics, like the reach and

57
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,290
number of impressions that your ads
are delivering, as well as the number of

58
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:56,340
installs that you're getting that's
attributed to that campaign, and

59
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,790
really key metrics like the cost
that you're paying for each install.

60
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,540
For user engagement, there's lots of
different ways that you can look at it.

61
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,490
The specifics will depend
on what your app is and

62
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,110
which market segment you're in.

63
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,950
The number of times that a user
comes back inside of a month.

64
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,390
The daily active to monthly active
ratio is a good measure of engagement.

65
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,840
And also the number of things
that they do inside of the app.

66
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,410
If you're looking at a shopping app, for

67
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:22,810
instance, the number of items that
they view might be a good metric for

68
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,430
engagement, the specifics all
the way down to the app itself.

69
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,850
One of the most important things
that you can do for growth

70
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:32,820
is get people through the new user
experience as quickly as possible and

71
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,910
into the real wow
moment of your product.

72
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,920
So what is it that really is going to
capture the user's attention?

73
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,030
What is it about your product
that makes it successful?

74
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,490
If you have a long sign up flow, you're
going to reduce the number of people

75
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,350
getting through, and
that's not what you want.

76
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:50,350
Facebook puts a lot of effort into
its new user registration flow.

77
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,510
So when you go to sign up for
Facebook, we ask you for

78
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,300
as few pieces of information as we can
so that we can get you to the real point

79
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,679
of the product and that's seeing all
of the status updates and photos and

80
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:03,410
things that your friends
are posting in your news feed.

81
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,260
>> The most high level metrics for

82
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,615
paid social are going to be CPC,
which is cost per click.

83
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:13,960
That's the usual term that ad industry
uses for engagement on your ads.

84
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,880
And what that means is every
click is going to cost

85
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,350
you a specific amount of money.

86
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,149
It's also important to take into
consideration when you're thinking

87
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:23,710
about cost per click and
how much you're going to spend for

88
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,740
a click potentially to your product or
website, but

89
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,710
think about the lifetime value or
LTV of that particular customer.

90
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,800
So how much will they
potentially spend long term

91
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,840
if you're able to acquire
them with one simple ad?

92
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,340
Certain platforms like Twitter use
CPE which is cost per engagement.

93
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:44,010
That could be anything that a user
engages with in one of your paid ads.

94
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,150
That could be a favorite,

95
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,040
a retweet, or a direct click
through to your product or website.

96
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,730
Also, just for good measure,
it's good to do some basic research on

97
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:57,080
industry standards and industry
baselines for how well ads perform.

98
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,400
So, for example,
if you are developing a fitness app,

99
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,330
do some research on how fitness
industry ads perform on Twitter.

100
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:08,610
And if you're getting a return or
an engagement of, let's say, 1% on your

101
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:12,970
ads, you know that you can compare that
to whatever the industry average is.

102
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,980
There's no perfect way to
find industry averages or

103
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:21,130
how well relative industries perform
on specific social platforms.

104
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,630
I'll just say do some Googling,
do some searching, do some research.

105
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:28,400
You're going to find really helpful
free resources out there and you can at

106
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,490
least find some baselines to go up and
measure your performance against.

107
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,790
Thinking about a small brand or
a small startup,

108
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,420
it's really important to
embrace grassroots tactics.

109
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,130
Think constant engagement,
think things like giveaways and

110
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,200
contests, anything that can move
the needle in the right direction and

111
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,760
help build your social
media follower base.

112
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,640
It's also important to consider
things like user generated content.

113
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,950
Getting great content from your users,
quotes, anything tactical like that can

114
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,640
really pay off and
help engage with your customer base.
