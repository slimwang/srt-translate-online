00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,480
The end of this string is at the point 40, 30, and the link to this string is

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:11,235
50 centimeter. Great work if you found these two answers. Now, for the end of

3
00:00:11,235 --> 00:00:15,389
the string we just want to have a coordinate pair. The x distance is 40 units

4
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:21,024
or 40 centimeter, and the y, or vertical distance is 30, 30 centimeter. The

5
00:00:21,024 --> 00:00:27,992
length of this string is actually the hypotenuse of this right triangle. So we

6
00:00:27,992 --> 00:00:32,930
can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve for the length of the string. We'll

7
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:37,890
have a squared, which is 30, plus b squared, which is 40, equal to c squared,

8
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:47,050
our hypotenuse. When we square these two numbers we'll get 900 plus 1600. Then

9
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:53,426
when we sum these numbers we will get 2500 equal to c squared. Now we just want

10
00:00:53,426 --> 00:00:58,360
to take the square root of both side of our equation to solve for c. Taking the

11
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,960
square root of both sides, will only keep the positive root, since we're

12
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:07,562
dealing with a distance, so c equals 50 centimeter. Now the much faster

13
00:01:07,562 --> 00:01:11,468
approach, to solving this, would be to understand that we have a 3, 4, 5 right

14
00:01:11,468 --> 00:01:18,440
triangle. The ratio has just been multiplied by 10. So, this side is 30, this

15
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:25,949
side is 40. And this length of our string, is 50 centimeters. If you solved it

16
00:01:25,949 --> 00:01:28,710
using that 3, 4, 5 ratio, amazing work.
