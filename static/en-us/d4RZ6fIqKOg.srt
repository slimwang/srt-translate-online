Thank you for sharing your answer. Now that

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,670
we've used classes for the very first time,

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,790
I want to highlight something that took me

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,920
a really long time to understand when I

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,560
was in college. When we wanted to use

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:18,320
functions previously, we wrote code like webbrowser.open. But

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,430
when we wanted to create instances of this

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,755
class, class turtle, we wrote code that said,

9
00:00:23,755 --> 00:00:27,280
turtle.Turtle. Now, look at both of these

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,070
statements. They look rather similar. It seems

11
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:35,750
like we're calling a function in both of these cases. But something different is

12
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,685
happening behind the scene. When we call

13
00:00:38,685 --> 00:00:41,810
webbrowser.open, all we are doing is calling

14
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,660
a function. No big deal. But when

15
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,830
we call turtle.Turtle, the init function defined

16
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,540
inside class Turtle, that's the function that gets

17
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,100
called. And it creates or initializes space inside

18
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,490
memory for a new instance which we called

19
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,450
brad. Even though it seems like we called

20
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,450
functions in both cases, we called open in

21
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,100
the first case and the function init, in

22
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,430
the second case. Not all functions are created

23
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:14,210
equal. When we called webbrowser.open, all we did was

24
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:18,870
call a function, but when we called turtle.Turtle, it in turned

25
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,530
called the init function which created or initialized space in memory

26
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:28,030
that did not exist before. So, that concludes our first example

27
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,190
of how to use classes. Let's look at a few more examples.
