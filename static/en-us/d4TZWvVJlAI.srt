1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,455
The function we see over here on the left, is a line that is a slope of

2
00:00:03,455 --> 00:00:08,529
negative one half. And its y intercept is negative 4. So, it's equation is

3
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:13,968
negative 1 half x minus 4. We can see that it starts here at x equals negative

4
00:00:13,968 --> 00:00:19,690
5, and it goes all the way over to the Y axis or the f of x axis. The next part

5
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:23,824
of the graph isn't a straight line however, it's a Parabola. That's pretty

6
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:27,480
neat. And note that in order to use the notation we've been using for piecewise

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,756
functions, we have to rearrange the equation of each part of the function so

8
00:00:30,756 --> 00:00:36,088
that f of x is by itself on the left hand side. If we do that for this

9
00:00:36,088 --> 00:00:42,010
parabola, it's actually not too bad. It's just negative the quantity x minus 2

10
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:47,984
squared, since the vertex is at 2 comma 0. The graph is obeying this function

11
00:00:47,984 --> 00:00:53,006
from 0 to 3. The last line we have has a slip of 1, and it's equation is just f

12
00:00:53,006 --> 00:00:57,780
of x equals x minus 4. It's on the graph from 3 to 8.
