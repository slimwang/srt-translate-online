00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,890
In your opinion, what can be roadblocks

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,760
to the Active Network's Vision? And I'm going to

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:11,520
give you multiple choices. And you can pick more than one choice if you think it

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,800
fits the answer to this question. The

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,710
first choice is that the active network's vision

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,630
needs buy-in from the router vendors. Router vendors

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,300
are vendors like Cisco. Who make the routing

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,030
fabric and the first choice is saying it

9
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,836
need, you, you need buy in from the router

10
00:00:29,836 --> 00:00:33,650
vendors, the second choice is saying that because

11
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,640
the routing was active network is happening in software,

12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,320
the software routing speed cannot match the throughput

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,910
needed in the internet core. That's the second choice,

14
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,880
the third choice says that. It makes the internet

15
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,350
more vulnerable, and the fourth choice says that it

16
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,420
makes the router more susceptible to code spoofing.
