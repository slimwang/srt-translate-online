1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,490
It would take 60 hours or about two and a half days for the pool to fill. Great

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:09,220
work if you found this. This is the equation that we'll use to help us solve.

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:14,864
We can fill the pool in 10 hours, and we can drain one pool in 12 hours. We

4
00:00:14,864 --> 00:00:18,770
know that when you subtract the 1 12th here since it takes longer to drain the

5
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:24,538
pool than it does to fill it. In other words this rate is it slower than this

6
00:00:24,538 --> 00:00:29,960
rate? And this should make sense, since we know 1 12th is smaller than 1 10th.

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,780
So, the pool will fill up ever so slightly, and we can figure out the total

8
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:38,122
time that it takes to fill the pool, this is x. We start solving this equation

9
00:00:38,122 --> 00:00:44,970
by multiplying through by the LCD 60x. The common factors of 10 and 12 are 2.

10
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:50,095
The other factor of 10 is 5, and the other factor of 12 is 6. We multiply these

11
00:00:50,095 --> 00:00:53,755
factors together, which give us 60, and then we have to multiply by x, the

12
00:00:53,755 --> 00:00:59,212
other factor in our denominators. We multiply by x since x is not a common

13
00:00:59,212 --> 00:01:06,336
factor of 10 or 12. So 60x will be our LCD. This first term will reduce to 6x,

14
00:01:06,336 --> 00:01:11,820
since 60 divided by 10 equals 6. The second term will reduce to 5x, since 60

15
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:17,110
divided by 12 equals 5. This leaves us with the right hand side of just 60.

16
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,892
Combining our like terms on the left, we'll have 1 x equals 60, so x equals 60

17
00:01:20,892 --> 00:01:25,620
hours. The time it takes to fill the pool with the drain open.
