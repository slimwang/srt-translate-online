1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,200
Well we're with Laura Adams the CEO
of Rhode Island Quality Institute,

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,650
which operates the state of Rhode
Island's Health Information Exchange,

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,400
called Current Care.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,420
Laura, I really appreciate your
taking the time to be with us today.

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,110
The Current Care has a very
interesting history,

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,830
dating all the way back to 2001.

7
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,190
If you could just explain that to us and

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:27,330
maybe the role that you played in
getting SureScripts launched briefly and

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,860
walk us through today,
that would be great.

10
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,630
>> Certainly.
We started in 2001 as a public private

11
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:33,360
partnership.

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,470
We're a 501, not for profit free
standing entity, not a state agency,

13
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,340
but deeply engaged with our state
as a partner in all of this.

14
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,140
Our goal was to dramatically
improve quality, safety and value.

15
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,973
We started out as a consortium
of leaders basically,

16
00:00:48,973 --> 00:00:52,820
people with our hands on the levers
of Rhode Island's healthcare system.

17
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,240
And our first question was we'll great,
we're all in a room,

18
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,380
we're all agreeing to collaborate,
what do we do?

19
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,200
We settled on information technology.

20
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,239
My background is quality improvement and
I knew that I was stymied at every turn

21
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,280
because of the paper based system,
that if we were really going to improve

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,140
quality we had to go for
health information technology.

23
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,600
So we became the place where SureScripts
decided that they would do their first

24
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,020
beta test of end to end true
electronic prescribing.

25
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,550
That pilot ended up being
an incredible success and

26
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,660
obviously SureScripts is
nationwide now and robust and

27
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,910
we're very proud of that
opportunity to participate in that.

28
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:32,020
From that point on,
we received the state on our behalf,

29
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,880
the state government received
a grant from the agency for

30
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,980
health care research and
quality called the State and

31
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,830
Regional Demonstrations In
Health Information Exchange.

32
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,700
That came in 2004, and kicked off
the funding for our privacy framework,

33
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,560
our governance framework, and our
stakeholder engagement piece of this.

34
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,210
Along came HITECH in 2009.

35
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,240
Our organization was the only
one to hit the trifecta,

36
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,630
to win all three major HITECH grants.

37
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:02,370
That was the Beacon, the HIE, and
the Regional Extension Center.

38
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,300
We were able to land about $27
million in 90 days to build

39
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,450
out everything we've done so far.

40
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:10,100
So, that's sort of the history
of how it all came about.

41
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:14,000
>> Now, one of the reasons I'm here is
because you're such an innovative and

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,560
extensive user of Direct.

43
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,390
So, how did that come about?

44
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:22,880
>> We are a big believer of a
centralized model in that what model you

45
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:29,480
choose depends on what you're looking to
do in the future, what your goals are.

46
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,760
For ours we wanted a very robust,
persistent database where

47
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,950
we could do research,
we could do quality improvement,

48
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,275
population health, comparative public
reporting, lots of things with that.

49
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:43,388
But in 2004 we did a little survey and

50
00:02:43,388 --> 00:02:48,040
there were 60 plus different,
EHR platforms in our state and

51
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,880
we said, what are we going to
integrate with all 60 of these?

52
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,820
There's going to be 70 and
there's going to be 80 and

53
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:56,080
then we have to keep every
interface up and running.

54
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,357
The cost of that was beyond our
reach and the time frame for

55
00:03:00,357 --> 00:03:03,640
doing that was beyond our comprehension,
we want to move fast here.

56
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,240
So suddenly we were at a national
meeting when Direct was announced and

57
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,060
then our Chief Operating Officer, Gary
Christianson, turned to me and said,

58
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,150
point to point.

59
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,840
He said what if one of those points is
in EHR and the other point is our HIE,

60
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,700
Current Care?

61
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,280
Couldn't we use that to lift
a continuity of care document

62
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,710
out of those EHR's?

63
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,980
No interface required,
no upkeep required,

64
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,610
no millions of dollars to
get our community connected.

65
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:33,770
We were astonished at the simplicity of
that solution and it has worked for us.

66
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:36,970
So we have platforms
in beta line of code.

67
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,480
When a physician closes a record or

68
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,210
some other trigger that they've put into
their platform, we close the record,

69
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:47,130
it sends out an automatic API call
up to Direct messages formed.

70
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,240
It attaches the current
continuity of care document,

71
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,660
ships it up to current care.

72
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,670
So it's all automated,
behind the scenes,

73
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,610
no physician ever has to push a button,
to remember to do something.

74
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:01,550
It's automated, so for us,
we were incredibly excited about it.

75
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:05,700
>> So, I want the students to
focus on what Laura just said.

76
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,550
I've talked repeatedly about the need
to integrate direct into workflow, and

77
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,650
you just heard an example of that.

78
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,270
>> That's right, that's right.
