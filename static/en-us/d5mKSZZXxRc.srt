00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Our last question was about cookies.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This person had an interesting point about whether or not storing the session info

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
in the database was actually better or not.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In the general case, the answer is no.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
If you're storing sessions in the database, that probably means you're hitting

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
the database on every page request.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Because sessions kind of by definition only last the session.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
If it's not permanent data, if it's just are you logged in,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
obviously you have to store are you logged in in a a cookie,

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
because that's how you are logged in.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Things like user preferences--my feeling is if the user is anonymous

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and you allow anonymous users to have preferences and a little bit of state,

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
trying to store it in the cookie first.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Because you don't want anonymous users to hit your database.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Say your website gets popular and they write about it in the New York times or something,

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and you get thousands and thousands of users before you were prepared.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If all of a sudden you've got a thousand people--I shouldn't say a thousand--

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
thousands and thousands of people writing temporary stuff into your databast,

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
that's going to hurt.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Now, maybe registered users, of course, you store them in the database,

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
but I still try to store as much temporary stuff in cookies as possible,

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
because that's the key to is stateless, getting the database out of the request,

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
hiding your database reads behind a cache,

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
hiding your database writes behind a queue,

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
which is something we really only talked about in unit 7.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That's the key to scaling, storing temporary data in cookies, which are designed for that purpose,

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
is a very important part of that.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Okay, I think that's about it.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yes, I know we said good bye a couple of times. Now this one is for real.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
First, Shawn, I'd like to thank you. This course wouldn't have happened without you.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Thank you, and thank you. You did an excellent job.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I know you kept apologizing that this is your first time teaching,

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
but I think all of our students will agree you did a great job doing it.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Thank you. It's been a lot of fun and a really cool experience.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm still hanging out in the IRC. There's still a group of people who do that.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Come join us if you want to talk about web apps or whatever.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Shawn I think is TAing a bunch of stuff.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The forums for 253 will still be around for ever, basically.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
There are a lot of great students, your co-students, in the forums still helping out.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and a lot of people have posted a lot of great projects that they've done

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
in addition or just a completely different projects after what they learned in this course.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So congratulations to you guys.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Good luck out there and drop me a note, drop Shawn a note if you have any trouble

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
or want to share what you're working on. That'd be really cool.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Thanks, Shawn. Thank you guys. We'll see you around. >>Yeah. See ya.
