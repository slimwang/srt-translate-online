1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,689
So I quickly want to sort of introduce
how virtualization actually helps us

2
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:08,620
in limiting the damage that can
be caused by a compromised or

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,070
hacked operating system.

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:13,240
Okay, we said, maybe you want to run
more than one operating system on

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,760
the same underlying hardware but this is
going to help us with security as well.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,590
So, limiting the damage of
a hacked operating system.

7
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,860
Let's see, how can we do that
when we have virtualization?

8
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:30,000
Okay, the way we do that is we change
the picture where we had the hardware

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,500
and the operating system,

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,320
well we introduce something between
the hardware and the operating system.

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,920
And that is called a Hypervisor.

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,501
On top of the Hypervisor, we support
what is called virtual machines.

13
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:44,459
And these virtual machines have
their own operating system.

14
00:00:44,459 --> 00:00:46,500
It's called the guest operating system.

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,390
And the guest operating
system then can support

16
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,450
a number of applications that
run within that virtual machine.

17
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,880
So if you, we look at our earlier
picture, we have the hardware,

18
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,940
then we have the Hypervisor,
then we have this virtual machines.

19
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,600
So this is the OS here and
the application here.

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,340
Compromise of an OS here only
affects these applications in

21
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,210
this virtual machine.

22
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,680
It doesn't do anything to
the application that may be running

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,610
in this different virtual machine.

24
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,740
With the same operating system or
a different operating system.

25
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,170
What we really have is isolation
between virtual machines.

26
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,580
So earlier,
we had isolation between processes or

27
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:31,990
applications, and they all shared
the same operating system.

28
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:36,120
Now we have isolation between
different virtual machines.

29
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,710
Each has it's own operating system or
guest operating system.

30
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:43,180
So I can do my package in
one virtual machine while

31
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:48,430
browsing potentially dangerous places on
the web in a different virtual machine.

32
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:52,850
Anything bad that happens in the second
virtual machine, or VM2, should not

33
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:58,560
affect your tax stuff that you're
doing in your first virtual machine.

34
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,270
So the tested computed base
really here is the Hypervisor.

35
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,990
In the picture that we had before
where we had the hardware and

36
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,770
the trusted computing base and
then the application.

37
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,780
It changes with virtualization
where we have the hardware,

38
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,180
Hypervisor, and
then the virtual machines and

39
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,130
those virtual machines have
their own operating system.
