1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,225
Each of the three solutions here that we're looking for is the x-coordinate of

2
00:00:05,237 --> 00:00:10,350
the proper line at the point where the y-coordinate is equal to 400. So, we're

3
00:00:10,362 --> 00:00:15,807
looking for where each of these lines intersects the line y equals 400. For line

4
00:00:15,818 --> 00:00:21,369
number one, this happens right here, at 30 gallons. Brand 2 and brand 3 actually

5
00:00:21,381 --> 00:00:26,171
both intersect our lovely green line at the same point. So, all three of these

6
00:00:26,183 --> 00:00:31,261
lines the orange, light blue, and the green, meet at whatever this point is. We

7
00:00:31,273 --> 00:00:36,378
know that the y-coordinate is 400 and the x-coordinate is, if you look down at

8
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,411
the x-axis, 25. Taking into account how many gallons of solution each of these

9
00:00:41,423 --> 00:00:46,156
brands can give us for $400, it looks like now, brand 1 is actually the best

10
00:00:46,168 --> 00:00:51,045
deal. So, turns out that it's a bit trickier to choose which brand is the best

11
00:00:51,057 --> 00:00:56,078
to go with then Grant might have thought earlier. As you can see from our graph,

12
00:00:56,102 --> 00:01:00,390
the brand that's going to help him use his money most efficiently is going to be

13
00:01:00,402 --> 00:01:04,485
different depending on how much money he wants to spend. No matter how much

14
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:09,035
money that Grant decided to spend on cleaning solution, this graph is definitely

15
00:01:09,047 --> 00:01:11,975
going to come in handy to help him make the best choice.
