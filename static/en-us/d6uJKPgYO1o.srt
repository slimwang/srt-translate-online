00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,620
Now that we've got this pure prototypal version of the car class, let's

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:08,060
refactor it into the very closely related pattern known as pseudo-classical.

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,200
The pattern we're about to build is called pseudo-classical because it

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,100
attempts to resemble the class systems from other languages by adding

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,540
a thin layer of syntactic conveniences.

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,410
If we plan on making a lot of classes in our programs, and we do,

7
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,710
there's a lot of code here that would get repetitive to repeat every time.

8
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,550
Perhaps the language could do more of these steps automatically somehow.

9
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:32,549
Which lines here seem likely to show up in every class you write and maybe seem

10
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,320
like the language could provide some mechanism for doing automatically for you?
