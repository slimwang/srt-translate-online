00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,176
To get to this answer of 1/10 faster, I
actually didn't need to wait to simplify.

2
00:00:04,272 --> 00:00:08,368
I could have done it sooner. Let's see
what that looks like. I can reduce any

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,494
common factors that appear in the
numerators and in the denominators. I know

4
00:00:12,506 --> 00:00:15,477
if I multiply these fractions, I would do
2<i>1 and 5</i>4.

5
00:00:15,477 --> 00:00:20,015
I'm going to break up my four into factors
of two. I know 2/2 makes one. So, whenever

6
00:00:20,027 --> 00:00:25,215
I see a 2/2, I can simplify that, then I
would just multiply as usual. 1*1 is one

7
00:00:25,227 --> 00:00:29,815
and 5<i>1</i>2 is ten, so I still get 1/10. You
might have heard of the term

8
00:00:30,227 --> 00:00:34,865
crosscanceling before, that could also
work. I know that two goes in a two and

9
00:00:34,777 --> 00:00:39,115
two goes in a four. If I would write a
factor in the numerator and at the

10
00:00:39,127 --> 00:00:44,221
denominator, I can cancel. 2/2 makes one,
and 4/2 makes two. When I multiply across,

11
00:00:44,661 --> 00:00:48,085
I'm going to have 1<i>1 and 5</i>2.
Either way, I still wind up with 1/10. The

12
00:00:48,097 --> 00:00:52,744
key thing is you want to make sure you're
only cancelling that factor that appears

13
00:00:52,756 --> 00:00:57,252
in the numerator and in the denominator,
because we know anything over itself is

14
00:00:57,264 --> 00:00:57,340
one.
