1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,110
Awesome.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,660
Your work here is done.

3
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:06,590
Feel free to close your text editor, and

4
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:11,090
in your VM type exit to leave the shell.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,589
And vagrant halt to shut down the VM.

6
00:00:20,165 --> 00:00:25,730
It's important to remember that exit
leaves the VM but doesn't shut it down.

7
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,790
Having a VM is like running two
computers on the same machine.

8
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,390
It's hard work and can be tough on
your computer's battery and speed, so

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,220
it's a good idea to shut it
down every once in a while.

10
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,200
You don't have to shut it down
every time you leave your computer.

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,930
But try to remember to run bigger and

12
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,190
halt, when you're done working for
the day.

13
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,700
You've now seen how to use
the shared folder in your Linux VM.

14
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,550
It's all right if you're not feeling
super confident in all the commands

15
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,522
you've seen in this lesson.

16
00:00:50,522 --> 00:00:53,860
You will learn more about how to
navigate the Unix command line

17
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:54,570
in the next lesson.
