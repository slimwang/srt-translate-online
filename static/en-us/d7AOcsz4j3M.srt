Ainsworth used three terms to describe her attachment theories. Secure

2
00:00:04,456 --> 00:00:09,708
Attachment, Anxious Ambivalent Attachment and Avoidant Attachment. Given the

3
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:13,700
name, what do you think an Avoidant Attachment is? Is it this one, where the

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:18,630
babies cry and become very distressed when the caregiver leaves? But once the

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,254
caregiver returns, gives them warm hugs, and settles down fairly quickly. Is it

6
00:00:23,254 --> 00:00:26,894
this one where the babies are distressed most of the time, especially when the

7
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:31,442
caregiver leaves. But when the caregiver returns the baby will go to the

8
00:00:31,442 --> 00:00:34,675
caregiver but there won't be any warm hugs going on and the baby might even

9
00:00:34,675 --> 00:00:41,140
push the caregiver away. Or Babies are not distressed at any time. Not when the

10
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,845
caregiver leaves, not when the caregiver returns, and there's no warm hugs or

11
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:50,310
affection at any time either. The caregiver is basically ignored. Give it your

12
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,709
best shot and select one.
