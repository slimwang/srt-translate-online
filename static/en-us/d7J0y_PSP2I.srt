00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,285
>> This one is true, especially for large data sets. In each of these samples,

2
00:00:05,285 --> 00:00:10,159
our sample size is only 10. So here we don't exactly have 50 percent of the

3
00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:15,373
data, but it's pretty close. And this will more and more closely approximate 50

4
00:00:15,373 --> 00:00:20,566
percent as the data set gets larger. Think of it this way. We split the data in

5
00:00:20,566 --> 00:00:26,797
half. We split it in half. And we split it in half here. If this is 25 percent,

6
00:00:26,797 --> 00:00:32,070
this is another 25 percent, another 25 percent, and another. Then here between

7
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:38,160
Q1 and Q3, we'll have about 50 percent. This one's false. We could make this one

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:45,121
a lot bigger, and the IQR would still be the same. However, we could change this

9
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:51,653
if we made it, say, 59,000. Then the IQR would get a little bigger. If we made

10
00:00:51,653 --> 00:01:00,443
54,135 bigger than 60,181, then this would be the new Q3. So sometimes certain

11
00:01:00,443 --> 00:01:05,242
values can influence the IQR, but it's not affected by every value in the data

12
00:01:05,242 --> 00:01:10,892
set. And the same concept applies here. We have this outlier, but even if this

13
00:01:10,892 --> 00:01:16,568
were something closer to the data set, like 63,000, the IQR would still stay the

14
00:01:16,568 --> 00:01:18,516
same. So this one's true.
