1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,210
Here's the answer I was looking for.

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,156
Square root of P, rather than P.

3
00:00:04,156 --> 00:00:04,658
Why?

4
00:00:04,658 --> 00:00:09,980
With a 2-d scheme it might be possible
to arrange the processes like so.

5
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:14,760
This is a 2-d grid of size,
say root P by root P on a side.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,568
I hope this idea reminds you of
the collective algorithms on

7
00:00:17,568 --> 00:00:19,720
multi-dimensional process grids.

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,640
With this kind of distribution,
you only need to use collectives to

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,660
merge local frontier updates
within process columns and rows.
