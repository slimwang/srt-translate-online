00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,870
Now I would be remiss in talking about strategic alliances

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,119
not to talk about the greatest strategic alliance ever made,

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:12,380
and that was Steve Jobs at Apple when he built the iPod.

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:18,450
Jobs understood that the iPod hardware was a wonderful device,

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:23,300
but without software, iTunes, it was still just another piece of iron.

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,510
But, even when they had the hardware and software ecosystem,

7
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,119
they were still missing the content, the music, that would go on it.

8
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:37,610
For 100 years, record labels had held that content so tightly,

9
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,350
allowing no one else access,

10
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,860
but there was a moment in time with Napster

11
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,110
and the record labels feeling threatened

12
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:48,690
that Jobs understood there was an opportunity to strike strategic alliances

13
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,900
that no one else had been able to do.

14
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,540
In fact, the rest is history.

15
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,310
The iPod, the iPhone, the resurgence of Apple,

16
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,640
music available to everybody and anybody in their pockets

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,450
to billions of people was, in fact, a strategic alliance.
