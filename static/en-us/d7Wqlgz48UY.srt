1
00:00:05,231 --> 00:00:08,160
Okay. So how do you want to cover nested information?

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,260
>> I mean, it's not too tricky.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,320
You know what?

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,040
Let's use object literal notation here.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,280
You could accomplish the same thing using dot or bracket notation.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,360
But, I want to show the students a really useful tool for making sure your

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,690
data are formatted properly which relies on object literal notation.

8
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:26,900
>> So you mean JSON?

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,670
>> Yep.

10
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,410
JavaScript Object Notation.

11
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:31,160
Hey James?

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,490
You had two majors, right?

13
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,530
Let's make it a JSON object that shows nested data.

14
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:37,360
Okay.

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,140
So, I'm seeing one big object with one property called schools.

16
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,050
In schools is a list of two objects, we know it's a list because we

17
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,710
have these square brackets here, indicating it's an array.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,920
The first object has the name Eckerd College, City of St. Pete and so on.

19
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,880
The second object has a name of Nova Southeastern.

20
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,150
In the city of Fort Lauderdale.

21
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,060
This looks like a good JSON to me.

22
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,460
Mind if we check it?

23
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:08,960
>> Not at all.
