00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,938
Data is the most essential part of statistics. Without data we couldn't do

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,926
anything. So now we have data on how many hours you slept, your recognition

3
00:00:09,938 --> 00:00:14,988
score and your temporal memory score, and we have data values for each one of

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,570
you who entered these scores. So the first person slept 7 hours, got a 91%

5
00:00:20,582 --> 00:00:26,922
recognition score and an 86% temporal memory score. So this row of data is for

6
00:00:26,934 --> 00:00:33,112
one person. The next person got 6.5 hours of sleep, a 95% recognition score and

7
00:00:33,112 --> 00:00:38,708
a 78 percent temporal memory score. And remember, that you can see this actual

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,366
data if you click on the BBC results link. Anyway, so we have columns of data,

9
00:00:44,487 --> 00:00:50,226
and each row corresponds to one person. Hours slept, recognition score, and

10
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:55,457
temporal memory score are called variables, because they vary across

11
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:00,703
individuals. So now we're returning to the question. You have an exam tomorrow.

12
00:01:00,807 --> 00:01:04,378
Should you get a good night's sleep tonight? Does it matter?
