00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:04,401
Let's try graphing some more hyperbolas. I want you to graph this equation on

2
00:00:04,401 --> 00:00:09,400
your own paper and then tell me what's the center and what's a and what's b.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,633
Just like before, we'll check to see if your graph matches this one and the

4
00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:13,930
solution.
