00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,944
Here, I'm computing the weighted average of the red, green and blue values

2
00:00:03,944 --> 00:00:08,448
using these funny numbers. By the way that can work, the result here is a

3
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:13,616
double because it involves fractional numbers. And I can't put a double into an

4
00:00:13,616 --> 00:00:18,964
end, that's where the cast comes in. Now I have my gray value. And I stick that

5
00:00:18,964 --> 00:00:24,490
into red, green, and blue and I'm done. Lets check it out. Here is Eliza in

6
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:29,460
color and here she is in black and white like in the olden days. That's pretty

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,113
nifty and it shows the reason to worry about casts. We had a situation where we

8
00:00:35,113 --> 00:00:40,569
had a decimal number expression that we needed to put back into an integer.
