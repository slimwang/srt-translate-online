00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,119
All right, I'm happy to be here today with Ian Buck from NVIDIA. Ian, welcome!

2
00:00:04,119 --> 00:00:07,744
>> Hey John, how are you? >> Doing great. Can you tell us what your job is at NVIDIA?

3
00:00:07,744 --> 00:00:11,439
>> Sure. I'm the General Manager of Computing Software at NVIDIA.

4
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:14,251
Basically what that means is I'm in charge of all the things for using GPU's

5
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:16,707
that are not really graphics or video related.

6
00:00:16,707 --> 00:00:19,333
Things like simulation and problem solving

7
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:21,036
that you don't really do in a game

8
00:00:21,036 --> 00:00:25,668
but recycling those cycles to use them more kind of supercomputing kind of applications.

9
00:00:25,668 --> 00:00:27,911
>> And you've had a lot to do with the development of CUDA.

10
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:33,700
>> Yeah, I started the CUDA team many years ago, going on 6, 7 years now,

11
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:37,649
finishing my work at Stanford to do it for real at NVIDIA.
