00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,840
Let's first discuss what would seem to be the

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,310
easiest way to impute a missing value in our data

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,180
set. Just take the mean of our other data

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:12,960
points and fill in the missing values. So, for example,

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,720
let's say that Ichiro Suzuki and Babe Ruth are

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,760
missing values for weight in our baseball data set. Well,

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,670
okay, no problem. We can just take the mean

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,686
of all other players weights and assign that value to

9
00:00:25,686 --> 00:00:28,170
Ichiro and Babe Ruth. In this case, we

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,610
would assign Ichiro and Babe Ruth both a weight

11
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:35,420
of 191.67. Wow, that seems really easy, right?

12
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,600
There's gotta be a catch. Well, let's first discuss

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,380
what's good about this method. We don't change

14
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,940
the mean of the height across our sample, That's

15
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,360
good. But let's say we were hoping to

16
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,590
study the relationship between weight and birth year. Or

17
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:53,440
height and weight. Just plugging the mean height into a bunch of our

18
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,040
data points lessens the correlation between

19
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,780
our imputed variable and any other variable.
