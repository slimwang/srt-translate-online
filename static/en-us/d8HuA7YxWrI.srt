00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Can you give me a hint about why Microsoft cares about any of this?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Well, Bing Maps is an obvious example.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Bing Maps computes driving directions.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Once you have the algorithms which are that fast,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
you do other things like taking real-time traffic into account.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Another application is in local search.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The reason it was an efficient way to find the nearest restaurants

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
or the nearest Italian restaurant which is open now and accepts American Express

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and things of this nature that can be very useful in local search.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The latest stat is that we have potentially more jobs than there are graduates

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
with these type of skills.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's become more and more important to kind of mine the social graph

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
in that we have way more data that we know what to do with,

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and we're starting to actually recognize that we have so many networks out there.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Now, we're collecting the data more than every.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Being able to now leverage that data into something

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
that can add value to a company is becoming more important.
