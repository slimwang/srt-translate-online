Hi, I'm Luke Wroblewski.

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:05,380
I'm a product director at Google, and
the experience I have that's probably

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,160
most relevant here is I wrote a book
called Web Form Design, and in

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,960
there I looked at all the little details
and nuances that make forms work online.

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,360
I think what you just said about
thinking purposefully about

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,150
forms is the key.

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,120
All right, don't treat these things
as one offs that you have to do.

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,390
Don't just copy a pattern out there and
assume that it works.

9
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,130
Actually take the time to think
what are you asking people,

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,390
how are you asking them that?

11
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,790
And if you put in a little bit of
effort, you'll have a lot of impact and

12
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,440
that's kind of the whole
essence of form design.
