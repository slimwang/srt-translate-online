00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,330
So let's pick a quadratic inequality to work with. How about x squared is

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:09,134
greater than 16. That's pretty simple, it seems like something good to start our

3
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:13,725
with. What I'd like you to start off by doing, is to modify this inequality so

4
00:00:13,725 --> 00:00:18,487
that the only thing on the right hand side is zero. Please write the new version

5
00:00:18,487 --> 00:00:20,305
of the inequality in this box.
