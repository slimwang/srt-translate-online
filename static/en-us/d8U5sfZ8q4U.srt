1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,710
So I'm sitting here
with Lauren Castellano,

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,640
who's a production
strategist here at Udacity.

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,210
She deals a lot with producing
material for our online courses.

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,900
She's going to talk to us a little
bit about creating online content.

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,510
So thank you so much for
talking to us today Lauren.

6
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,220
>> You're so welcome.
>> So

7
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,380
the first thing I wanted to ask is,

8
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,379
any of students who are familiar with
other platforms may have noticed it.

9
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,540
The production values at
Udacity tend to be very high,

10
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,380
and I don't mean that
solely as a compliment.

11
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,140
Because when you produce
content more on budget,

12
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,500
it's easier to make it available
to a large number of people, and

13
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,890
when you have a high cost associated
with it, it kind of creates a barrier.

14
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,930
So why do we invest so
much into our course production process?

15
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,250
>> So I really look at it
as a long-term investment.

16
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,290
You wouldn't put this much time and

17
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,130
money in a class we're just
going to release to 50 people.

18
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:44,030
So we're seeing, we want to see this
through, and see students learn from

19
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:49,540
these classes for years,
with edits to update them, but.

20
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,190
Another thing we've really done is
we're investing the student experience,

21
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,380
not just the course itself.

22
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,810
So yes we could give our highly
qualified instructors a camera and

23
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,280
they can just stand in front
of a blank screen and talk,

24
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,700
but we add a lot to it so that the
students can have the best experience.

25
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,880
So it takes a lot to have
all the different quizzes or

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,310
just making it a little bit fun.

27
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,780
When we were talking about material
design and filming with Porsches,

28
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,050
you just add some stuff and
it makes a better student experience.

29
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:23,380
So it's investing in your
student not just the course.

30
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,020
>> Yeah, it sounds like we're
kind of taking that opportunity,

31
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,230
knowing that instead of just this being
presented to 75 students a semester,

32
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,830
it's going to be presented to
thousands or tens of thousands or

33
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:35,300
hundreds of thousands of students
to really increase what we do.

34
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,670
And do maybe we'd like to always do, but

35
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,750
we just don't have the resources
to do it, initially.

36
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,360
And that's one of the things we tell our
professors when we're getting started

37
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,470
with our courses is, this is
the opportunity to do what you've

38
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,000
always dreamed of doing
with this course.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,900
Because you probably can't get the
funding to do it when you're teaching it

40
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,060
to 75 students once a year, but
if you're teaching it to 300 students

41
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,070
three times a year,
you can do a lot more.

42
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,300
So in your position you deal with
a lot of people who have never taught

43
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,080
online before.

44
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,640
Many of them are experienced teachers
in person who are just making

45
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,090
the transition to the Internet.

46
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,100
Others are subject matter experts
who have no teaching experience and

47
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,530
they're just experts in some
domain that we're interesting in.

48
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,690
So, let me ask you first when you're
dealing with a teacher professor who has

49
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,360
an abundance of in-person teaching
experience but has never taught online.

50
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,260
What are some of the unique issues you
wrestle with in trying to transition

51
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,860
them to teaching in this
online environment?

52
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:26,180
>> There a lot of things, one thing that
you really have to address early on is

53
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,360
the nerves that come
with teaching online.

54
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,720
That a lot of people don't
really want to talk about.

55
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,200
But when you teach in a classroom to
30 people, if you kind of mess up

56
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,690
explaining something, oh well,
shoot your students an email.

57
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,260
But when you're recording that and

58
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:47,080
broadcasting that to potentially 100,000
students, it's a little more terrifying.

59
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,380
And another thing I see really often is,
with the more experienced instructors,

60
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,370
is they start to teach for their peers.

61
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,780
And, not for their students.

62
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,356
Because they have to look good for
their peers and

63
00:02:58,356 --> 00:03:00,014
people that they're going
to see at conferences.

64
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:04,920
And, that can get a little bit
dangerous from a students perspective.

65
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,808
But one of, I think, the best things
that come out of that is that

66
00:03:08,808 --> 00:03:13,056
the teachers, the professors will
validate their material even more

67
00:03:13,056 --> 00:03:16,368
than they would just standing
in front of 35 people,

68
00:03:16,368 --> 00:03:19,550
because they know it's
going to be out there forever.

69
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:23,660
They know their peers are going to be
reviewing this too, and they take more

70
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,790
pride in that, and, I think, so those
nerves can kind of play in our favor,

71
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:32,070
but also against us, when we start to
lose the student experience in that.

72
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,780
So when they try to teach too high
level, and it's like, don't do that.

73
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,590
>> So when we're dealing with that issue
and we really want to make professors

74
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,100
remember the student experience and not
just focus on teaching for their peers.

75
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,980
What are some of the things that
they can do in this environment that

76
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,910
they can't do in the regular classroom,
that we need to make them aware of?

77
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,940
>> That's a great topic.

78
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,200
Because when you get to teach online,
the sky's the limit.

79
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,810
You have so many options.

80
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,810
And it's really important that you
think about, when developing a class,

81
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:00,580
that you think about,
what are the good teaching tools or

82
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,940
examples that I've used in class.

83
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,580
Strictly because I'm
constrained within four walls,

84
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,000
and how can we expand on that?

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,940
The sky is the limit when
you are teaching online.

86
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,910
You can do a million different things,

87
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:18,240
and use really cool teaching examples
that you could never use in a classroom.

88
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,320
One of my favorite examples is when
I got to teach with sea lions and

89
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,640
I was teaching about classical and
operate conditioning.

90
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,170
We got to go to a laboratory,

91
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:29,375
see some sea lions and
teach the students that way.

92
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:33,385
And they could see how sea lions
were learning husbandry skills.

93
00:04:33,385 --> 00:04:34,345
It was really awesome.

94
00:04:34,345 --> 00:04:37,565
And I could never bring a sea
lion into a university classroom.

95
00:04:37,565 --> 00:04:38,755
I've asked, they won't let me.

96
00:04:38,755 --> 00:04:39,696
>> [LAUGH]
>> So

97
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,855
you can really stretch the box that way.

98
00:04:42,855 --> 00:04:45,555
And it's really important for
instructors who have taught the same

99
00:04:45,555 --> 00:04:48,825
class for every semester for
the last ten years,

100
00:04:48,825 --> 00:04:52,070
and they use the same syllabus,
to kind of just shred that.

101
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:55,390
I would like to tell our instructors
don't just think outside of the box,

102
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,460
there is no box.

103
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,090
The world is your oyster when
it comes to teaching online,

104
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,730
so really just getting that creativity
out of them, when they're so

105
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:07,010
accustomed to doing the same thing over
and over again could be challenging.

106
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,507
But it's endlessly important for
a student experience.

107
00:05:09,507 --> 00:05:12,530
>> Yeah, I imagine that with many of our
professors who have been teaching for so

108
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,733
long they're very good at
the way they teach right now.

109
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:17,583
But I've encountered some at least
that I think have forgotten that

110
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,533
certain constraints that they have,
and it started as constraints,

111
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:23,370
that now they're just kind of
part of the fabric of the course.

112
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,670
It's something like I have the topics
broken up in a certain way,

113
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,700
well you only have the topics broken up
like that because you've been forced to

114
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,150
teach hour and a half lectures all,
for the past 20 years.

115
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,160
Now you can have a 15 minute lecture
followed by an hour long one.

116
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,930
So you have a lot of flexibility there.

117
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:37,500
But what about for

118
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,490
those incoming instructors who have
no teaching experience whatsoever.

119
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,880
They're subject matter experts at Google
or Facebook or something and, they don't

120
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,990
know what it's like to teach at all,
but they're experts in their field.

121
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,330
How do we help them get
accustomed to this?

122
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,690
>> So, one thing that's great about
the subject matter experts is

123
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,230
they've never started within that box.

124
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:59,770
So, they are really good with
the creativity and just expanding on

125
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:04,040
different ideas in giving the practical
application of what they're teaching.

126
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,330
One of the things that we
have to remind them to do is

127
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,130
anticipate student's questions.

128
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:12,430
And they don't have experience
with students in a classroom,

129
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,200
raising their hand saying, wait,
I don't understand that point.

130
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,930
So as course developers,
we try to highlight different areas.

131
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,950
And you see expert blind spot
a lot with subject matter experts.

132
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,050
When you don't as much
with professors because

133
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,470
they're used to students saying no,
that doesn't make sense.

134
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,610
So teaching them about expert blind
spot and saying okay, you're using

135
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,170
jargon there that your intro students
are not going to understand.

136
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,680
And they're in environments where

137
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,920
they don't have to think about that
kind of stuff, which is great for them.

138
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,082
But it's important for

139
00:06:44,082 --> 00:06:47,577
the students that they don't do
that anymore when they're teaching.

140
00:06:47,577 --> 00:06:50,230
>> So, Lauren is an expert at producing
online content and as a result,

141
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,677
she may be using jargon that some
of you aren't familiar with.

142
00:06:52,677 --> 00:06:56,150
[LAUGH] So, Lauren, can you tell our
students what expert blind spot is?

143
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,870
>> Shame on me.

144
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:00,730
Well so expert blind spot is when
you have an expert in a field and

145
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,900
they use jargon or explain the topic and

146
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:08,040
forget that some people might not know
the foundation that the expert has.

147
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,630
So you have to take yourself back a few
steps and figure out what it is that

148
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:16,170
you just assume people know and
what it is people actually do know.

149
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,830
So we try to have people lose
their expert blind spot,

150
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:24,628
by not having an assumption of
the knowledge a student has coming in.

151
00:07:24,628 --> 00:07:28,250
We actually need to go in, and
explore what their base knowledge is.

152
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:32,634
>> I have a very fond memories of
my freshman calculus class being

153
00:07:32,634 --> 00:07:35,938
taught by a Nobel Prize
nominated physicist.

154
00:07:35,938 --> 00:07:37,805
>> Fun.
>> Who had no idea what it was like to

155
00:07:37,805 --> 00:07:39,565
not know how to do a derivative.

156
00:07:39,565 --> 00:07:41,225
And so yeah, I think that's-
>> Yeah.

157
00:07:41,225 --> 00:07:42,310
>> A very important
thing to wrestle with.

158
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,380
And because we deal with so many
subject matter experts here at Udacity,

159
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,070
it's even more pertinent, because
they have no teaching experience.

160
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,770
All they know is their field.

161
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:51,670
>> Yeah.
>> But I think you're right,

162
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:54,600
it's also a great chance to have that
kind of blank slate to work with

163
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,340
someone who hasn't developed any bad
habits or hasn't really incorporate

164
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,511
those constraints of the classroom
into their outlook on teaching.

165
00:08:01,511 --> 00:08:02,110
>> Exactly.

166
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:05,170
>> So in this classroom we might have
many people who produce online content

167
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:08,290
for this class or might go into
teaching online in the future.

168
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:11,484
In fact, that's one of the project ideas
for this class is to actually film

169
00:08:11,484 --> 00:08:14,440
a mini-course for
some topic you're interested in.

170
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,050
So for those who might want to do
that for this class or in the future,

171
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,630
what advice would you give them on
getting started with online teaching?

172
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,200
>> I would say to really
reflect on your past teachers.

173
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,210
Pick and choose what things that they
would do that you really, really liked,

174
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,990
and really dissect that.

175
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:34,210
Were they good teachers because of
the context they were teaching in, so

176
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,909
were they great in a classroom, or
do you think what they were doing would

177
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:41,860
translate really well to online,
and how can you expand on that?

178
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,010
Just shred every syllabus you've ever
seen and really start from scratch.

179
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,210
Do the whole,
think way outside of the box.

180
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:51,770
That there just is no more box,
and be creative.

181
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,710
Start out with the most
outlandish ideas, and

182
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,790
then reel it in based on
your production constraints.

183
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:02,540
That way, you know, you'll at
least have a fun class at the end.

184
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,960
Another thing is to be
a really honest consumer.

185
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,300
You know, how long is it and when you're
watching this video until you want to

186
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,130
speed me up or skip to the next video?

187
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,870
And then try to reflect on that and

188
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,890
make a class that you would
actually want to watch.

189
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,380
Sometimes sitting through
a 20 minute screen cast or

190
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,140
head shot is not how you want to do it.

191
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,830
Most students would just fast forward or
be done with it.

192
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:32,360
So reflect on that and think about
the content you're making and

193
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,780
make sure that you're
picking the right medium.

194
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,890
Some things are just better
if people read them.

195
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,950
If you could create a PDF that they
should reflect on then come back to

196
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,320
video or discussion forum.

197
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,260
I don't know if you'll have that or
not, but look at your content and

198
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:51,490
then pick the best medium to teach that,
teach that content by.

199
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,680
So is it video?

200
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,740
Is it a screen cast of something?

201
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,320
Is it a reading node?

202
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,890
Which we call a reading node, but

203
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:02,100
I guess in your case you'd probably be
creating a PDF, but something like that.

204
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,780
I think the most important thing
is being the honest student.

205
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,066
Think about things from
a student's perspective.

206
00:10:07,066 --> 00:10:09,700
>> Yeah, I know that we've probably
given you some examples of some

207
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,970
courses out there that we
consider to be high quality.

208
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,600
We have not given you any examples of
courses that we don't consider to be

209
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,890
high quality because we don't
want that attached to us, but

210
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,170
feel free to ask your fellow
classmates on the forums for

211
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,830
examples of online courses
they've taken that were not good.

212
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,076
And they might recommend some
courses from other platforms.

213
00:10:24,076 --> 00:10:25,311
They might recommend
some Udacity courses.

214
00:10:25,311 --> 00:10:26,888
They might recommend some
Georgia Tech courses.

215
00:10:26,888 --> 00:10:29,655
But that will give you something
to actually learn from, and

216
00:10:29,655 --> 00:10:31,509
see not only what to do but
what not to do.

217
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:33,390
So, thank you so much Lauren for
talking to us today.

218
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,099
>> You're so welcome, yeah.

219
00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:35,420
>> And thank y'all for watching.
