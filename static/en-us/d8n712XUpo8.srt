1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,070
Why do we need to trust
the operating system?

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:07,250
And I'm going to talk about exactly
what does it mean to trust a system, but

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,480
that sort of differentiates
an operating system from

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,730
other applications that
may not be trusted.

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,130
So, why do we need to trust it?

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,520
In fact,
not only we need to trust it but

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,150
we actually also call it
a trusted computing base.

8
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:27,720
So let's see why do we call it a TCB or
a trusted computing base.

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,880
It is the base in some sense.

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,044
If you don't directly want to
deal with the hardware,

11
00:00:34,044 --> 00:00:37,580
we set applications on top
of the operating system.

12
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,800
So the operating system really is
the computing base that is seen

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,070
by the applications or
the user processes.

14
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:49,610
The need to trust to the operating
system comes from the fact

15
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,900
that we giving it
the keys to the kingdom.

16
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:57,040
Keys to the kingdom here are direct
control of all the physical resources.

17
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:02,110
So the operating system in some sense is
able to access anything that we have and

18
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:05,340
then it's the job of the operating
system to make sure that

19
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,600
these resources, or whatever,

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,850
high level resources we implement
using the low level physical resources

21
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:17,240
get accessed by the correct users in
the system or the correct applications.

22
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,059
And if you're going to make someone
sort of the in charge or the controller,

23
00:01:22,059 --> 00:01:26,520
you better be able to trusted that it's
going to do what it's supposed to do.

24
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,625
Otherwise, the results that you
going to have, you will not like them.

25
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:34,313
So that's why there's need to
trust an operating system.

26
00:01:34,313 --> 00:01:36,385
So what the exactly does it mean for

27
00:01:36,385 --> 00:01:38,905
us to be able to trust
the operating system.

28
00:01:38,905 --> 00:01:45,335
So what are the requirements that should
be met by this trusted computing base

29
00:01:45,335 --> 00:01:51,110
that we say sets an important
role in protecting our resources?

30
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:55,980
First of all, the operating system
absolutely has to be between

31
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,360
the untrusted applications and

32
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,150
the physical hardware
resources that we have.

33
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,550
This is called complete mediation.

34
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:07,830
Think about the request coming
from an untrusted application and

35
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:13,680
this request is for a resource that is
being requested by the application.

36
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,780
It has to go through
the operating system.

37
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,940
The operating system has
to mediate this request and

38
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,760
you can think about
why that's necessary.

39
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,200
It's necessary because we had
the operating system has to check

40
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,500
that the resource of
the request actually has access

41
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,270
is allowed to gain
access to this resource.

42
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,930
And for that check to happen,

43
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,550
the operating system has to become
between the request and the resource.

44
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,540
So that's called complete mediation.

45
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,830
Okay, you can't get to any resource that

46
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,700
need to be protected without actually
going through the operating system.

47
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,270
So trusted system is always
going to take a look

48
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:56,200
at any request before it actually
reaches the resource, and

49
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,390
the source of that request is
able to access that resource.

50
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:03,060
So the complete mediation
requirement is the first one.

51
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,330
The second requirement a trusted
computing base has to meet is,

52
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,542
what we call, it has to be tamper-proof.

53
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:14,700
In fact, we going to spend bunch
of time how to achieve that,

54
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,770
or how to meet that requirement.

55
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:21,280
The reason it has to be tamper proof is
that we're talking about untrusted code

56
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,210
and in the trusted computing base
of the trusted operating system.

57
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:29,710
Well, if the untrusted code can tamper
with the trusted operating system,

58
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,490
you can't trust anymore.

59
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:36,990
The untrusted code tampers with it,
changes it to do whatever it wants done.

60
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:41,070
In particular again, access to resources
that perhaps were not meant for

61
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:46,180
this untrusted application, which may
be compromised, could be malicious.

62
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,820
Third requirement is the so
called correctness requirement.

63
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:54,530
If you going to call a system trusted,
you going to completely rely

64
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:59,570
on it to make sure that you're protected
resources get used in a proper way.

65
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:04,390
Then however it does that,
whatever functionalities implemented by

66
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,100
the trusted computing base,
it should be done correctly.

67
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:13,020
Because if there is a vulnerability or
a bug or

68
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:17,459
some error in the trusted computing
base or the operating system.

69
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,990
I said it has the keys to the kingdom.

70
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:24,420
So, we said operating
system has to be trusted.

71
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,690
Now we know what it means for
it to be trusted.

72
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,420
You shouldn't be able to bypass it.

73
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,850
Okay?
That's complete mediation.

74
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,300
You have to go through it.

75
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,700
You can't alter or change it,
if you are an untrusted application.

76
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,660
And whatever functionality it
implements, that's done correctly.
