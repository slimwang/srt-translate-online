00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,700
You've learned quite a bit about
building our first sunshine screen

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,560
using RecyclerView.

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:07,039
But there's still so much more to do.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,460
In this lesson you'll create
the structure of your app and

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,580
learn how to navigate between screens.

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,099
Which means learning a whole
lot more about activities,

7
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,675
the intent framework and even learning
about how to use activities that

8
00:00:17,675 --> 00:00:19,429
come from other apps within your own.
