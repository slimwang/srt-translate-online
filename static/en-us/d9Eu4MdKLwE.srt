1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,470
This flight picker app was annoying.

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,090
I was tapping way too much
to pick flight dates.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,170
This site is obviously using
the wrong kinds of inputs.

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,000
There's gotta be a better way.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,290
So for this quiz,
I want you to think about the types of

6
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,630
inputs you're inflicting
upon your users.

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,930
So you don't make the same mistakes
that I did when I built this.

8
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,250
Here are two HTML inputs.

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,850
The first input is for date and
the second one is for time.

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,740
What types of inputs make the most
sense for these two inputs?

11
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,750
Check out the link in the instructor
notes to a list of inputs

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,230
on the Mozilla Developer Network.

13
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,000
Do some research, and when you're done,
type your answers into these boxes.
