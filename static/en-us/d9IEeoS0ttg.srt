00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,442
To find the side link of a cube, we actually take a cube root of the volume. So

2
00:00:04,442 --> 00:00:10,370
the cube root of eight would be the cube root of two cube. We need this factor

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:15,495
of two of third in order for us to take it out. Since this index is a three, we

4
00:00:15,495 --> 00:00:20,477
need to group the three factors to take out the two from the radical symbol. A

5
00:00:20,477 --> 00:00:24,991
cube root really just send us a third power. We can think of roots and powers

6
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:30,550
and inverse operations of one another. Pretty neat, huh? We can apply the same

7
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:36,161
concept for taking the cubed root of 125. We see that a factor of five appears

8
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:40,348
three times underneath the radical, so we just have five. And for the cubed

9
00:00:40,348 --> 00:00:46,315
root of 343, we just have seven. Here is the list of some perfect cubes. These

10
00:00:46,315 --> 00:00:49,402
numbers are considered to be perfect cubes since we can take the cube root of

11
00:00:49,402 --> 00:00:55,358
them to get an integer. Like we saw before, 8 was the same thing as 2 cubed. So

12
00:00:55,358 --> 00:01:01,540
the cubed root of 8, or 2 cubed is just 2. You'll want to keep a list of these

13
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,458
perfect squares and perfect cubes close by since they come up frequently. Make

14
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:08,278
a list on a separate sheet of paper or use and index card but either way you

15
00:01:08,278 --> 00:01:12,773
want to be really comfortable with your perfect squares and your perfect cubes.
