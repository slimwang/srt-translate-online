1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The answer is the second is actually a good representation of this outcome.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
When I color the pieces of the pie, we'll see that 50% of the pie falls into one class

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and the other 50% in the other class.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Compare this to this pie over here, which seems to be a 75 to 25 split,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
or the one over here, which is 25 to 75.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This is the one I would've chosen.
