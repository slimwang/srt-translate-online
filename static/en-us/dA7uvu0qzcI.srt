00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,120
Don just provided examples of a good

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,850
conceptual model. And an ineffective conceptual model,

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,510
using the two refrigerators at Udacity. We'll

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,170
talk more about why the ineffective example, was

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,110
ineffective in a moment. But first, let's

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,870
step back. And talk about what conceptual models

7
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,080
are. So a conceptual model is an

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,140
explanation. Usually highly simplified, of how something works.

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,125
Sometimes conceptual models are inferred from a

10
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:32,790
product itself. Sometimes they're learned over a, a

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,080
course of time. In other situations they're passed

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,570
down from person to person. They're really good

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,810
at helping people predict, how something will work.

14
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,580
And what to do in case something goes

15
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,230
wrong. I think conceptional models will like a

16
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,630
lot more sense, if I provide an example.
