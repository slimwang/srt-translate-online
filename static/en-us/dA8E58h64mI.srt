1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,614
We know this is the answer. This rational expression is the odd one out, since

2
00:00:04,614 --> 00:00:09,496
it equals positive 1. This expression over here is really equal to negative 1,

3
00:00:09,496 --> 00:00:14,040
since x minus 7 divided by the quantity x minus 7 simplifies to 1. We get a

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,112
negative 1 since we have a negative sign sitting out here. This is really

5
00:00:18,112 --> 00:00:22,350
negative 1 times 1. For this first rational expression, we can switch the order

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,425
of the denominator. I can have the negative x come first, and then followed by

7
00:00:27,425 --> 00:00:31,305
the positive 7. We can see that this expression is the same as this last

8
00:00:31,305 --> 00:00:36,021
expression down here. But this doesn't quite look like negative 1. But these two

9
00:00:36,021 --> 00:00:40,168
rational expressions don't look like negative 1, but in fact, they are. We know

10
00:00:40,168 --> 00:00:45,552
these expressions in the numerator and denominator are opposite polynomials. The

11
00:00:45,552 --> 00:00:49,930
x terms are opposite in sign, as are the constant terms. We can factor a

12
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:54,960
negative 1 from our denominator to get negative 1 times x minus 7. Then we can

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,976
simplify our common factors in the numerator and denominator, leaving us with

14
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:03,103
negative 1. Nice thinking if you found that one.
