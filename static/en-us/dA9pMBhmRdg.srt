1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,410
A, a simple example is shown here.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,430
Here is a sphere, you could sort of tell that it's a sphere, right?

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,670
It falls of down here so we're looking straight down.

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,610
With five different illuminations.

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,660
When we do photometric stereo on that, remember we can recover both surface

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,890
normal and the albedo, and that's what this looks like here, right?

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,600
So the albedo, you can see that it recovered,

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,570
the fact that it's got these four quadrants.

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,040
So even though this thing falls off slowly,

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,590
it knows that it's all the same albedo.

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,770
And then this is the estimated of the surface normals.

12
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,090
And so this is what's sometimes called the needle diagram, where you're

13
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:41,230
looking at where the needles are pointing, that's the surface normal.

14
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,400
Now you can actually do this somewhat for real.

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,040
So, here's an example where there are four input images, so

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,290
the lighting is coming from different directions, right?

17
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,570
You can see here, you get different kind of shading, right?

18
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:59,360
And it recovers both the albedo, which is sort of the paint, the color.

19
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,420
And you can see that it actually knows that there are these stripes on

20
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,280
there along with the surface normals.

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,580
So it recovered the shape.

22
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,130
In fact, there's a really cool app you can download from this

23
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:16,960
company called trimensional.com, and this is not a commercial endorsement.

24
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,630
It's just a Georgia Tech endorsement.

25
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,400
This was an app put together by Grant Schindler where you basically,

26
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,900
I don't know if he's got it on Androids now as well but

27
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,520
certainly at the time it was on iPhones.

28
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,210
And you take pictures from different locations and

29
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,040
it uses the light to illuminate it.

30
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,760
And it does a surface reconstruction.

31
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,260
All right?

32
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:41,712
And it works pretty cool and download it and I think it's it might be free.

33
00:01:41,712 --> 00:01:43,700
I know it might be a dollar, maybe it's four.

34
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,940
Whatever it is, if you, if you buy it, grant, send me
