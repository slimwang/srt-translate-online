00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,560
So let's do a quick check of our

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,460
knowledge of benchmarks and performance reporting. Which of

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,650
the following uses code from real applications, but

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,760
does not use all of the code from any

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,738
of, of the applications? The choices are, the

6
00:00:12,738 --> 00:00:15,958
actual workload mix from the user? An application

7
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:19,824
suite? An application kernel? Synthetic benchmarks? And peak

8
00:00:19,824 --> 00:00:24,670
performance reporting? Select all of those that satisfy this.
