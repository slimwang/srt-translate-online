00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,010
This chart summarizes some of the discussion so far. Content deals with

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:09,700
the content of knowledge. Encoding deals with the representation of knowledge.

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:14,000
Content and form. The content of knowledge can be visuospatial,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,710
that deals with what and where. Where is spatial, what is visual, and

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,390
the encoding of the visuospatial knowledge could be either analogical or

6
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:28,070
propositional. An analogical inquiry of visuospatial knowledge is a structural

7
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:32,350
correspondence between the encoding and the external world that is being

8
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:37,000
represented. In the propository presentation of visuospatial knowledge, there is

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,770
no such correspondence. Examples of this verbal knowledge include things like

10
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,320
scripts or going to a restaurant. The script for going to a restaurant again can

11
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,950
represented either propositionally or potentially analogically. And

12
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,670
a propository presentation of the kind we say we may have tracks and

13
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:59,140
props and actors. In an analogical representation of the script for

14
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,160
going to a restaurant, we may have a short movie. In much of the codes,

15
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,150
we have dealt with the right hand side of this chart with verbal knowledge and

16
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,140
prepositional presentations. Part of the point of this lesson on visuospatial

17
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:16,530
knowledge and reasoning is that reasoning and knowledge can be visuospatial, and

18
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,520
representations can be analogical. But we have yet

19
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,390
to fully understand the role of human cognition and you [UNKNOWN] agents that

20
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,500
can deal with visuospatial knowledge and analogical representation.
