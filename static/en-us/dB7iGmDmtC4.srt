00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:00,870
In this lesson,

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:04,000
we'll build the My Favorite Movies
app that uses The Movie Database API.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,920
And to build it, we're going to
learn how to authenticate and

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,650
secure our request so
that we can protect our users' data.

5
00:00:10,658 --> 00:00:14,030
Every API is different on how it deals
with authentication, but by the end of

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:18,970
this lesson, you'll have a foundation
for dealing with it, no matter the API.

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,170
Before we get started,
we're in for a real treat.

8
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,540
We're going to sit down with Travis
Bell, the creator of The Movie Database,

9
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,430
and he's going to tell us about
this awesome web service.
