1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,469
There are ten lessons in this course,
and

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:06,000
they correspond with the ten
chapters in the text.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,460
We've split Lesson 5 into two
sections because of its length.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,450
While the material is not
generally technically difficult,

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,100
there is a lot of it.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,340
More in fact than can be
covered in the lectures.

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,620
So reading the text and
the other suggested materials is key.

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:27,710
Lessons 1 and 2 provide background on
US healthcare delivery and the role of

9
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:32,436
federal government is playing to foster
adoption of information technology.

10
00:00:32,436 --> 00:00:36,990
Lessons 3 through 5 cover the core
technologies that all contemporary

11
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,866
health informatic systems and
tools rest on.

12
00:00:40,866 --> 00:00:45,140
Lessons 6 through 8 show how health
informatics is being used in real world

13
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:49,990
applications, from electronic records
for providers and patients, to

14
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:53,970
managing the health of large populations
of patients over an entire region or

15
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,429
state, to understanding and
improving public health.

16
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,100
Lessons 9 and 10 show how data can
be aggregated from these systems and

17
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,010
analyzed to gain new knowledge and

18
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,610
even improve the healthcare
system that generated the data.

19
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,810
During this course we'll hear from
experts in various segments of

20
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:12,800
the field.

21
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,550
It should help you see
how the knowledge and

22
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:18,230
concepts you're learning
are actually being applied.

23
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,830
Along the way you'll be able to test
your knowledge with frequent quizzes.

24
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,130
So I want you to get use
to that interactive format.

25
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,140
Let's try out an easy
question right now.

26
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,728
Which of these fields involves
the use of computing?

27
00:01:30,728 --> 00:01:35,960
Health informatics,
Bioinformatics, Both or Neither.
