Thanks, Chris, for that question. This one's a little bit more difficult. If you

2
00:00:04,348 --> 00:00:08,382
got 160, you got it right. Even though this is an absolute value problem, we

3
00:00:08,394 --> 00:00:12,527
also have to follow the order of operations. The absolute value symbols act as

4
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:16,531
parentheses as well. We know when we're working with parentheses, we need to

5
00:00:16,543 --> 00:00:19,343
work from the inner most parentheses outward.

6
00:00:19,348 --> 00:00:24,344
So, first thing we have to do is evaluate what is inside these parenthesis and

7
00:00:24,356 --> 00:00:29,262
follow the order of operations, and then we'll move on. The first thing I want

8
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:34,579
to do is evaluate this 6 squared. 6 squared is 36, so this turns into 6 minus

9
00:00:34,591 --> 00:00:39,759
36. First we want to evaluate 6 squared. 6 squared is 36, so here we have 6

10
00:00:39,771 --> 00:00:44,841
minus 36. We still have another operation inside the parenthesis before we can

11
00:00:44,853 --> 00:00:49,638
move the operations outside the parenthesis. So here I have to evaluate 6 minus

12
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,284
36. 6 minus 36 is negative 30. Now that I finish evaluating what's inside the

13
00:00:54,296 --> 00:00:59,193
parenthesis, I can move towards the absolute value symbols. When I'm working

14
00:00:59,205 --> 00:01:03,719
inside the absolute value symbols, I still have to follow the order of

15
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:08,921
operations. So I have an exponent. Let's evaluate that first. I have 2 times the

16
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:12,473
absolute value of negative 5 squared. Now, we have to evaluate negative 5

17
00:01:12,642 --> 00:01:17,710
squared. Since the negative is not in parentheses, negative is not part of the

18
00:01:17,722 --> 00:01:22,048
base, so we have negative 1 times 5 squared. And we know that 5 squared is 25.

19
00:01:22,222 --> 00:01:27,076
And I copy down the rest of the operations. I know when I write two numbers next

20
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:31,528
to each other that I have to multiply them. So the next thing I need to do

21
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:36,338
inside my absolute value is to evaluate the two multiplications in order from

22
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:40,709
left to right. So I have 2 times the absolute value Of negative 1 times 25,

23
00:01:40,865 --> 00:01:46,320
which is negative 25. Negative 25 times negative 2 is positive 50. Then I have

24
00:01:46,332 --> 00:01:52,670
negative 1 times negative 30, which gives me positive 30. So I have 2 times the

25
00:01:52,682 --> 00:01:58,576
absolute value of -1 times 25. Which is negative 25 times negative 2 is positive

26
00:01:58,588 --> 00:02:02,747
50 and then I have negative 1 times negative 30, gives me a positive 30. Now

27
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,109
that I've perform ed the multiplication and division inside the absolute value,

28
00:02:07,207 --> 00:02:11,463
I can do the addition and subtraction. So I have 2 times the absolute value of

29
00:02:11,475 --> 00:02:17,084
50 plus 30, which is 80. Since absolute value is the distance a number is from

30
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:23,027
zero, we know that the absolute value of 80 is simply 80. So, the last step is 2

31
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,104
times 80, and 2 times 80 gives us our answer of 160.
