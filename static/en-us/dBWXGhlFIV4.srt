1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,420
Now we're going to bring all
these components together and

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,750
consider risk adjusted reward and

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,940
this is just like the sharp ratio that
we've looked at in other contexts.

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:15,320
In the single bet case we can
calculate this ratio easily like this.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:23,376
So remember our reward or our expected
return was $20 and our risk was $31.62.

6
00:00:23,376 --> 00:00:27,530
So if we divide this out,
we get our sharp ratio.

7
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:31,420
Or just the adjusted risk/reward
ratio for this scenario.

8
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,474
And it turns out to be 0.63.

9
00:00:34,474 --> 00:00:37,815
I'd like now for you to fill in
the numbers for the multi bet case.

10
00:00:37,815 --> 00:00:42,835
In other words, a case where we point
one token on each of the 1,000 tables

11
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:45,115
and then get our return
from that single event.
