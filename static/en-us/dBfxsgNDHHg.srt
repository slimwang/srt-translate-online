00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,060
All right, so you might ask,
get ready Megan,

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,390
you might ask what does this
have to do with vision?

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,320
>> What does this have
to do with vision?

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,390
>> Well you might have some video
of something happening such as

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:15,900
a person moving their hands around to
wave, or point, or control something.

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,440
And you'd like to be able to say,
you know, which gesture is this?

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,210
Or you know, what action are they doing?

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,630
And the stuff I'm going to talk about
today is sort of some of this time

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,790
series work,
in particular Markov models,

10
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:31,430
apply to the decoding of
visual kinds of information.

11
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,350
So the real question is,
how do we model these problem?

12
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,750
How do we, you know, how are we going to
build, I showed you these time series.

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,660
Well, we need a model of these.

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,510
And in particular, we're going to
have to give it a bunch of them to

15
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,350
be able to construct that model.

16
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,080
So it's basically going to be
an inference or a learning problem.

17
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,750
The learning is, learning the model and

18
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,280
the inferences while
given a set of models,

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,160
which one do I think is most likely to
have generated the data that I'm seeing?
