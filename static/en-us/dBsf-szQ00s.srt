As you go through this course, and when you're

00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,580
analyzing data on your own, we want you to

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,380
keep the following in mind. Always be curious and

00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,834
skeptical when you're taking a look at data. Nate Silver

a statistician noted for his work in baseball and

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,660
in politics, captured the sentiment as well. He said, People

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,890
should be more skeptical when they see numbers. They

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,430
should be willing to play around with the data themselves.

00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,070
Exploratory data analysis is one of the best tools that we

10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,832
have for playing with the data. For letting the data speak

11
00:00:34,832 --> 00:00:40,277
really directly. When conducting an exploratory data analysis. We want to

12
00:00:40,277 --> 00:00:44,607
test our intuitions about the data set and develop new intuitions.

When you're going through this course and analyzing the data sets that we're

15
00:00:49,472 --> 00:00:51,917
going to take a look at. We want you to be excited to play

16
00:00:51,917 --> 00:00:55,421
with the data. But we also want you to be open to detecting

17
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:58,096
oddities in the data. Especially through

18
00:00:58,096 --> 00:01:01,270
the visualizations and summaries that you produce.
