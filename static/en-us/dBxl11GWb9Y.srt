00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,270
In the past, people used to find tricks
and detours to make Google search engine

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,170
think that they should be
ranked at the top of the page.

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,500
But the algorithm just
became smarter than us, and

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,710
it understands when
people try to do evil.

5
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:19,255
Tricks like writing your top key words
in white in the background of your page

6
00:00:19,255 --> 00:00:21,875
just don't work anymore, but nice try.

7
00:00:23,115 --> 00:00:26,805
That being said there are still things
that you can do to help your SEO.

8
00:00:26,805 --> 00:00:29,815
Your best choice is to make
sure your website is relevant

9
00:00:29,815 --> 00:00:32,130
to the key words that
you're trying to promote.

10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,550
If your keyword is pet sitting you
really want to make sure that people

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,690
that are searching for pet sitting
will find your website useful and

12
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,580
will want to spend more
time on your website.

13
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,640
That being said, words matter.

14
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,070
The search algorithm searches
every single word on the web,

15
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,060
including every word on your page so
the words you put on the page matter.

16
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,630
However, don't just pack
your site with search terms.

17
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,710
Because the algorithm is going to
be able to tell if they're actually

18
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,970
relevant to your site or not.

19
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,940
And if it's actually useful to
the person doing the searching.

20
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,500
So if it's not, the algorithm is
going to end up working against you.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,870
You're going to want to make sure
that you refresh your content so

22
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,850
it's always up to date and
staying alive.

23
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:21,410
If you have quality, growing content
on your site and growing links to your

24
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:25,410
site, the better the search engine
algorithm is going to rate you.

25
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,420
On that note,
what other people say matters.

26
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,570
It's even better when other people say
the great things about your website that

27
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,770
you would like to say yourself.

28
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:38,360
For example, if on the first page of
TechCrunch they say that Abarkment is

29
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,480
the best pet sitting app, with a link
to our site, that makes us look

30
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,800
really good, because they're
validating that, well, we're awesome.

31
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,850
So this will help our SEO.

32
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,550
However, don't forget that
the algorithm is smart.

33
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,830
If you try to just buy
links to your site.

34
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,150
That aren't actually relevant,
the search engine is going to know.

35
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,610
The more trustworthy your site is,
the higher the algorithm rates you.

36
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:05,940
The title of your page or
the meta data on your page also matter.

37
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,750
Now, this isn't visible to users,
it's actually hidden in your code base.

38
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,000
But it matters because it's
used as a suggestion for

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,910
the title in the Google search results.

40
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,030
This is where you're going to want to
describe your business in an informative

41
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,180
and concise phrase.

42
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,700
This is also true for your domain name.

43
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,510
It needs to be easy to read and
easy to understand.

44
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,380
And finally,
don't leave your images hanging.

45
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,130
People often forget to
optimize their images.

46
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:38,160
You're going to want to give your images
a short, descriptive file name, and

47
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,790
in the alt attribute,
describe what the image is.

48
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,560
And don't forget to add a caption for
each image.

49
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,720
Your caption should also
contain your keywords.
