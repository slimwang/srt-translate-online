1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,250
Awesome.

2
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:02,730
We've identified three places,

3
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,730
where app design could use
a high fidelity code prototype.

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,610
You may have found one,
many, or none of these.

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,360
First, as James said,

6
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,700
our apps new event functionality
could be usefully prototyped.

7
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:19,230
This part of the app uses user input,
and could behave in a couple of ways.

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,440
When a user presses the FAB to create
an event, some animation happens,

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,460
which we could ask a designer about.

10
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,470
And then again,
once the event is filled out and

11
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,650
saved, something happens to transition
the user back to the main screen.

12
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,250
We need to define these animations,

13
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,310
as well as how the event goes
into the list of events.

14
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,680
Does it always go in at the top?

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,820
Does it slide in
somewhere along the way?

16
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,650
Does that addition to the list
get animated in any way?

17
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,820
These are important questions to answer.

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,630
Secondly, our overview page
could use a code prototype.

19
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,242
Right now, we have sort of a placeholder
graphic that shows completed tasks

20
00:00:52,242 --> 00:00:55,180
versus created tasks
versus snooze tasks.

21
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,470
But this graphic would presumably
change when a user actually makes, and

22
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,510
modifies, and completes tasks.

23
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,050
What would that look like?

24
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,810
We'll need to find that out over time.

25
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,400
Finally, many calendar and to do
list apps rely on notifications for

26
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,290
communicating with users, when the app
is not the active app on their device.

27
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,370
What will these notifications look like,
and when will they be triggered?

28
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,470
Code prototypes could help us answer
that question using user research.

29
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,370
The second and third options are
defiantly things that we would want to

30
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,828
work on, after building a minimal
viable product for our app.

31
00:01:25,828 --> 00:01:28,980
The new event however,
is central functionality and

32
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,150
should be built out immediately.
