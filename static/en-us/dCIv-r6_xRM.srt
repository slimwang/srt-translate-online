1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
That didn't seem too hard.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This looks like English. This looks like German.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I may not be familiar with Azerbaijan,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
but it doesn't look like English, German, French, or Spanish,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
so I'll probably choose that, and that would be the right answer.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Now, how could I do that? Well, I could do it by recognizing some of the words.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
But it turns out I can also do it just by looking at letter sequences,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
the frequency of of single letters or pairs of letters or triplets of letters.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
In fact, you can get about 99% accuracy for language identification just looking at tables of letters.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And a great thing about dealing with letter models is that

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
the probability tables you need are much more compact.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
If you think about triples of words, there may be a million words in the vocabulary,

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
so a table of triples is a million to the 3rd power.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That's quite a number of entries.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Whereas for letters in the alphabet, most alphabets have about 30 letters or so.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So it's very easy and compact to store triples of those.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Now, in doing actual language identification,

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
it's also common to add other features, to not look only at the letter combinations.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So you might add words as well.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You might add a small number of words--the most common words in a language,

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
or it may be even better to add the most discriminative words--

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
words that show up in one language but not in another language

23
00:01:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and count the occurrence of those words.
