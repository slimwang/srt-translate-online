1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:04,040
Much of the background that you'll need to

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,570
know, is covered in this introductory lesson and

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:11,800
the review lessons taught by Charlie Brubaker. However,

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,480
to get the full benefit of this course, you

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,010
should have a strong undergraduate background in computer

6
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,340
systems and networks. With that in mind, let's

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,050
get started with our review and load some

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,010
of the operating systems basics into our collective memories.

9
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:33,240
I've intentionally structured this lesson to be quiz-heavy, since most

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,670
of the background material should be already familiar to you. And

11
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:40,260
hopefully that format that I'm going to use, we'll find this

12
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,790
to be a more fun way to jog our collective memories.
