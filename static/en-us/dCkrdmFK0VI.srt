1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,990
So, next part is, warping.

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:06,060
If you noticed again, in the earlier example I had shown you, not only are these

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,800
images aligned, they need to be warped a little bit to register them on top of

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,000
each other, so then actually when certain regions are the same,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,250
the images will also be kind of, appear to have similar, detail.

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,310
So, here basically kind of shows is that images are warped, so these were,

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,260
of course, rectangular images, before aligning them to various types of things,

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,510
I need to warp this image, this image, this image, and

9
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,010
this image, so then they'll register on top of each other.

10
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,939
So, let's look at this warping example, I am showing one frame.

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,370
In the next one, if I was to put them top of each other, while some parts may

12
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:45,290
align, if you notice there's still lot of blurriness going on,

13
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,680
none of the crowd is visible, so, to achieve this, I would have to take one of

14
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:54,660
the images and kind of put a warp on it to register to the first image.

15
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:00,060
So in this case, basically I need to find, what is the between points here

16
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:05,110
to there, so, if you notice this person's head is here on the other example, so

17
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:08,260
I need to figure out how to warp it, similarly, this person here,

18
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:12,090
this person here, and again, you can see the same thing for this building here.

19
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,630
They're all kind of misaligned here, and

20
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,270
I need to find these warp fields, this corner here with the same,

21
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,990
this corner here, this building is also in between two images.

22
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:27,535
So I need to kind, a, and complete warp field between these two and use that to

23
00:01:27,535 --> 00:01:31,330
align the two images together, and here I basically show you how we did this.

24
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,680
After I do the alignment, if you notice there's no more ghosting,

25
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,400
that's what we want to do.

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,200
Let me show them to you again.

27
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,030
This is before warp.

28
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:40,600
Post warp.

29
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,110
And that's the final result after we've done all the warping between the two

30
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,500
images, everything is registered.
