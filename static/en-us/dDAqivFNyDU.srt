00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,340
Let us briefly talk about evaluation in storage. These evaluation and

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,890
storage steps in analogical reasoning are very similar to the evaluation and

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,850
storage steps in case based reasoning. Analogical reasoning by itself does not

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,870
provide guarantees of correctness. So the solution that it

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,560
proposes must be evaluated by some manner. For the down correlation problem, for

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,020
example, we may evaluate the proposed solution by doing a simulation.

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,420
Once the evaluation has been done, then the new problem and a solution can be

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:34,750
encapsulated as a new case and stored back in memory for later potential reuse.

9
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,430
To return to the down correlation problem, as an example. Once we

10
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,930
have the solution of decomposing the laser beam into several smaller beams and

11
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,210
sending them to a tumor at the same time from different directions, we can do

12
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,760
a simulation of this solution and see whether they are successful. If it is,

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,875
then we can encapsulate the target problem and the proposed solution as a case,

14
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:59,590
and store it in memory. It might be useful later. It could potentially become

15
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,990
a source case for a new target problem to come later. Once again,

16
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:09,400
in this way, the AI agent learns incrementally. Each time it solves a problem,

17
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,790
the new problem and its solution becomes a case for later reuse.
