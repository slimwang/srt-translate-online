1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,899
>> A times b is negative 6, and a plus b is positive 5. Now again, I like to

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:08,218
start off with the multiplication bit. 3 and 2 don't work again here, because

3
00:00:08,218 --> 00:00:12,305
we'd have to have one of them negative, one of them positive, and then they

4
00:00:12,305 --> 00:00:16,411
wouldn't add to 5 anymore. But, what if this time we try negative 1 times

5
00:00:16,411 --> 00:00:21,539
positive 6, instead of negative 6 times positive 1. 6 minus 1 is 5, so that

6
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:28,251
works. So a and b must be negative 1 and 6, either way around. So we'll have x

7
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:30,236
minus 1 times x plus 6.
