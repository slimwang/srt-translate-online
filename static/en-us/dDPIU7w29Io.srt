And the surprising thing here is--well, it's not surprising anymore, but surprising once you see it--

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,950
is that the time to construct this table is O(n*v).

00:00:10,950 --> 99:59:59,999
There's no exponential part in the running time for bringing this table, apparently at least.
