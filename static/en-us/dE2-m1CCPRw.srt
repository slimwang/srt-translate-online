1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,863
So, why did we start off with shapes? And why are these different categories of

2
00:00:03,863 --> 00:00:07,757
2 dimensions and 3 dimensions? Well, we first looked at this overarching, or

3
00:00:07,757 --> 00:00:11,798
broad category called shapes. We think of shapes as being made up of curves and

4
00:00:11,798 --> 00:00:15,879
straight lines connected at points or vertices. Then we looked at how we could

5
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:20,126
find differences between those shapes, two dimensional, and three dimensional.

6
00:00:20,126 --> 00:00:24,545
We were wondering, are the shapes flat or not? And, from that single question we

7
00:00:24,545 --> 00:00:29,042
were able to make these two categories about our shapes. Well, this is also true

8
00:00:29,042 --> 00:00:33,607
about functions. We use functions to describe particular relationships in math.

9
00:00:33,607 --> 00:00:38,450
For this unit, we're going to focus on polynomials. Expressions with constants,

10
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:43,341
with linear terms, quadratic terms, or cubic terms are all considered to be part

11
00:00:43,341 --> 00:00:48,056
of polynomials. Constants are numbers like 3, negative 4,or 5 halves. Linear

12
00:00:48,056 --> 00:00:52,390
terms contain a single variable with an exponent of 1. We don't have to write

13
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:56,805
the 1 as the exponent, because we assume that's the case. A linear term might

14
00:00:56,805 --> 00:01:01,278
have constant terms on it or not, but it's the variable with the exponent of 1

15
00:01:01,278 --> 00:01:05,839
that makes it linear. Quadratic polynomials contain an x squared. And, cubic

16
00:01:05,839 --> 00:01:10,053
polynomials, they contain a cube, or a third power. For this unit, we won't

17
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:14,439
focus on the graphs of polynomials. We're going to focus on working with them.

18
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:19,205
So adding subtracting multiplying and dividing them. You might be wondering what

19
00:01:19,205 --> 00:01:23,332
some of these other functions are. They include square roots and exponentials,

20
00:01:23,332 --> 00:01:26,069
but don't worry about these. We'll get to them later.
