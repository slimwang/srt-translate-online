1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,360
So another consideration we might want to think about with

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,550
decision trees but you're not going to go into a lot

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,290
of detail but I think might be worth at least

4
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:10,890
mentioning is the problem of regression. So, so far we've

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,440
only been doing classification ,where the outputs are discreet, but

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,850
what if we were trying to solve something that looked

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,930
more like x squared or two x plus 17, or

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,660
some other continuous function. In other words, a regression problem.

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,390
How would we have to adapt decision trees, to do that? Any ideas Michael?

10
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,560
>> So these are now continuous outputs, not just continuous inputs.

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,890
>> Right, maybe the outputs are all continuous, maybe

12
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,370
the outputs are discrete, maybe they're a mix of both.

13
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,380
>> Well it certainly seems like out

14
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,840
rule of using, information gain is going to run

15
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,150
into trouble because it's not really clear how

16
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,850
you measure information on these continuous values. So,

17
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:56,880
I guess you could measure error some other way. Well we're not, it's not, it's

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,719
not error right it's tryin to measure how mixed up things are? Oh so ,maybe

19
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,140
something like variance? Cause in a continuous

20
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,470
space you could talk about you know, if

21
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,110
there's a big spread of, in the values

22
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,000
that, that would be measured by the variance.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,440
>> Oh good. So what you really have now is

24
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,156
a question about splitting. What's the splitting criteria? Maybe [CROSSTALK]

25
00:01:15,156 --> 00:01:15,900
>> I guess there's also an

26
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,000
issue of, of what you do in the leaves.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,280
>> Right. So, what might you do in the leaves?

28
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,270
>> I guess you could do some sort of more standard kind of fitting algorithm.

29
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:34,555
So, like, report the average or, or do some kind of a linear fit. [SOUND]

30
00:01:34,555 --> 00:01:37,270
>> Is any number of things you can do. By the way ,that's worth pointing out

31
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:41,640
on the, on the output that if we do pruning like we did before, we have errors,

32
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,420
we did actually say when we talked about that how you

33
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,190
would report an output. Right? If you don't have a clear

34
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,060
answer where everything is labeled true or everything is labled false,

35
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,110
how do you pick? So something like an average would work there.

36
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,760
>> I don't know, I mean, it seems like it depends

37
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,740
on what we're trying to measure with the tree. If the tree

38
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,740
is, we're trying to get as many right answers as we can,

39
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,178
then you probably want to do like a vote in the leaves.

40
00:02:03,178 --> 00:02:06,600
>> Right, which ,at least, if the only answer is true or false,

41
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,729
that would look more like an average I guess. Right, so

42
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,740
you pick, you do a vote. So we do a vote,

43
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,860
so we do pruning. We do have to deal with this

44
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:19,310
issue of the output. Somehow ,and something like a vote mixing.

45
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:28,580
And here, when you have a regression, then I guess average is a lot like voting.

46
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,160
>> Yeah, in a continuous phase.

47
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,820
>> Yeah. So either way we're doing a kind of voting. I like that.
