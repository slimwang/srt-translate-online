1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,726
The answer is one-third.

2
00:00:01,726 --> 00:00:05,025
Let's first consider the probability
that a fixed cycle say,

3
00:00:05,025 --> 00:00:07,650
this one illustrated here
is in the permutation.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,133
The probability that this first
edge here is made is one-hundredth.

5
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:19,463
Some edge has to come out of 55 and
all 100 destinations are equally likely.

6
00:00:19,463 --> 00:00:24,035
Next, we consider the probability that
this next edge in the cycle is made.

7
00:00:24,035 --> 00:00:27,373
57 already has an edge going
in from the first edge, so

8
00:00:27,373 --> 00:00:30,280
we can't have a self loop here.

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:35,250
That leaves only 99 destinations to
choose from, all equally likely.

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,335
So there's a 1 in 99 chance that
we pick 58 and we applied the same

11
00:00:40,335 --> 00:00:45,524
logic to this last edge here to give
us another factor of one over 98.

12
00:00:45,524 --> 00:00:50,160
Overall then, this gives the probability
that any fixed recycle will

13
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,293
exist in a random permutation.

14
00:00:52,293 --> 00:00:55,824
We can also think of this as
a random variable that is one,

15
00:00:55,824 --> 00:00:59,370
if the cycle is in the permutation and
zero, otherwise.

16
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,220
Therefore, this is
the expected number of times

17
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,710
that this particular 3-cycle
will occur in a permutation.

18
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,254
Well, to calculate the expected
number of 3-cycles overall,

19
00:01:12,254 --> 00:01:16,389
we just need to sum up this quantity for
all possible 3-cycles.

20
00:01:16,389 --> 00:01:18,574
All of their expectations
will be the same, so

21
00:01:18,574 --> 00:01:21,120
it becomes just a matter
of counting them.

22
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,240
Counting 3-cycles is the same as
counting permutations of length three,

23
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,010
except that this overcounts
by a factor of three,

24
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,620
because the starting point is arbitrary.

25
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:36,610
There are 100 ways to choose the first
element, 99 the second, 98 the third.

26
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:40,790
But in counting this way,
we counted every 3-cycles three times.

27
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,460
Once for each possible starting point.

28
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,930
Of course, in this calculation,
everything cancels out, except for

29
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:50,090
the 3 and we get one-third for
the answer.

30
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,220
This argument is actually much
more general than the question.

31
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,120
Note that the fact that we were using
100 vertices didn't show up anywhere in

32
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,768
the answer.

33
00:01:57,768 --> 00:02:01,852
And in fact, we can replace
the 100 with some arbitrary n and

34
00:02:01,852 --> 00:02:04,380
we get the exact same answer.

35
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,400
The cancellation happens
in exactly the same way.

36
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,342
And in fact,
we can also replace the 3 with k.

37
00:02:10,342 --> 00:02:13,332
The exact same cancellation
will occur and

38
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:17,241
we get an expected number of
1 over k cycles of length k.
