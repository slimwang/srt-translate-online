00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,420
Not just to, actually, for those of you
looking at other ways of doing things,

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,990
let me actually show you something well,
relatively fun and interesting.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,720
Here's a video of a person who
actually then figured out that if you,

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,060
if you look at a chicken, chickens have
an ability to keep their head stable.

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,270
Here, if you notice,
he's moving the chicken around, but

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,389
the head is as stable as possible.

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:22,330
Right?

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,630
This is not made up video,
this is original,

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,880
if you have access to chickens,
you can try to do this yourselves.

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,590
But you'll notice the chickens have
an ability to keep their heads

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:32,280
really stable.

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,880
Of course this whole idea was made into
a little bit more craziness by this

13
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,890
person here, who basically then kind
of claims to have made this mount for

14
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:49,410
a chicken and used that to generate
a stable camera or steadicam.

15
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,260
Ok well, to be honest, this is
a fake ad for a new LG camera, but

16
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,360
it's kind of interesting to note
that this, chickens do have a way of

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,800
keeping their necks stable and in fact,
more and more fun things have been done.

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,700
This, I'm just showing ti to you,
just to be funny.
