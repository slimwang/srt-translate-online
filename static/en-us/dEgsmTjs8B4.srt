1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,140
And the third problem which is undecidable is a problem called specification,

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,510
and that problem basically asks--does a program do what it is suppose to do.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,090
And that problem in the general case is also undecidable because determining the equivalence

4
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,520
of two programs is basically the same as using one of the programs

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,080
as a specification for what the other one does.

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,130
Unfortunately even determining if a program is correct cannot be done automatically,

7
00:00:26,130 --> 99:59:59,999
at least not in a general case and we'll get to the special cases at the end of this unit of course.
