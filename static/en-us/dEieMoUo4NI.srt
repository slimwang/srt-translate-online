1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,190
Even if you saw the activity
show up in the real time screen,

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:06,110
there's no guarantee, and
when the accumulated data shows up

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,690
from the other parts of the dashboard,
see, I still have zero users.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,460
When there's very low usage of an app,
then the data typically shows up for

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,390
too long.

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,650
While testing my app though,

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,310
I found I sometimes needed
to wait up to 20 minutes.

8
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,070
Not always, but sometimes.

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,750
How long does it take for
your data to show up?

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,040
Add a comment in the discussion forum.

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,500
If you see the date is showing up in
the analytics dashboard all is good,

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,010
however if you feel you've waited
too long, review this checklist.

13
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:41,580
To make sure you set up everything
correctly to send the data to analytics.

14
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,710
And the one that gets me almost
every time, is the date range.

15
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,650
So make sure you set date
range to include today's date,

16
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:51,370
and then check these other things.

17
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,010
Make sure you're using the correct
account ID, that's pretty important.

18
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:58,050
And make sure that you've
enabled auto activity tracking.

19
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,350
And of course,
make sure you've wrapped, deployed, and

20
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,330
ran and used the app on your device,
where you're not going to get any data.

21
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:08,040
You may find that the data
shows up faster in some

22
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,070
parts of the dashboard than others.

23
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:15,140
So I just noticed that in my
Screens page, which you get to by

24
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:21,070
going to Behavior and then Screens,
you see I do have some Screen Views.

25
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,520
And I've got the data on
which screens were visited.

26
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,795
Finally, my app overview
does have some data.

27
00:01:27,795 --> 00:01:30,650
You get to see how many
new users there were.

28
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,170
Only one, not surprising.

29
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,290
I'm the only person who used my app.

30
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,340
How many active users,
and, in this case,

31
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,450
the active users is
the same as the new users.

32
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,079
Could see the countries where the users
were and the devices that they used.

33
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,713
And the user engagement indicates how
much the user was engaged with the app,

34
00:01:48,713 --> 00:01:54,100
how long the sessions lasted, and how
many screens they visited per session.

35
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,450
The screen section shows you an overview
of the screens that were visited and

36
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,680
how many views they each had.

37
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,890
So when your data shows up,

38
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,880
take a look at the sections
in the app overview page.

39
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,669
And remember, you may find that the data
shows up faster in some other places,

40
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,670
like the Behavior screens,

41
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:16,120
the data may show up here before
it shows up in the Overview.

42
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,710
Anyway, when the data comes in take a
look at the sections in the App Overview

43
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,910
page, and then answer these questions.

44
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,570
What was the most visited screen?

45
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,140
Go ahead and write your answer in here.

46
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,439
How many visits did it have?

47
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,850
And where are the users?

48
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,860
And then that's it for this short quiz.
