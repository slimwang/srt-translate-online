00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,051
So there are two main pathways that are activated during stress response, that

2
00:00:04,051 --> 00:00:09,648
start in the hypothalamus. First is the adrenal medullary system. Now think

3
00:00:09,648 --> 00:00:13,459
back to lesson 1, when I saw the snake. When I initially saw the snake, the

4
00:00:13,459 --> 00:00:17,880
stress was encountered. In my hypothalamus, sends information, to the brain

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,742
stem, to activate the sympathetic nervous system. From an evolutionary

6
00:00:22,742 --> 00:00:26,341
perspective, our ability to engage the activation of our fight or flight

7
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:31,730
response, has important benefits. When we encounter an emergency, or a

8
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:35,817
dangerous situation, this causes the release of catecholamines and the

9
00:00:35,817 --> 00:00:42,150
activation of our fight or flight response, allow us to behave appropriately.

10
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:46,544
Meaning, we can either run away or we can stay and fight. So here are the

11
00:00:46,544 --> 00:00:50,450
catecholamines were released and I obviously opted to flee, rather than to

12
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:55,050
stand and fight. However, long term activation of your sympathetic nervous

13
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,372
system. Can have some serious negative effects. This constant increase in heart

14
00:01:00,372 --> 00:01:03,564
rate, can cause damage, but we're going to talk more about the negative

15
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:06,829
consequences of chronic stress shortly.
