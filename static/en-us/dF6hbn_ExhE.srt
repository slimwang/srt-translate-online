1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,415
So what is a video texture?

2
00:00:01,415 --> 00:00:05,642
Let's look at a few instances to
convince us of what the concept of video

3
00:00:05,642 --> 00:00:07,835
texture and videos itself provide.

4
00:00:07,835 --> 00:00:10,645
So, if we look at static
images like this.

5
00:00:10,645 --> 00:00:14,011
Here you can basically
see that there are static

6
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:17,385
images of four relatively dynamic scene.

7
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:22,045
A flag here, most probably is fluttering
and this is just one snapshot of it.

8
00:00:22,045 --> 00:00:22,567
Right?

9
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:24,086
Now you can see the flag, I mean,

10
00:00:24,086 --> 00:00:27,362
you can pretty much perceive that it
must be moving and here is a candle.

11
00:00:27,362 --> 00:00:29,280
Of course,
we know candles are always flickering.

12
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,192
So this is a static version of this.

13
00:00:31,192 --> 00:00:35,214
Looking at these two children on
a swing set, you pretty much again know

14
00:00:35,214 --> 00:00:39,304
that this must be a dynamic scene,
where the children are swinging and we

15
00:00:39,304 --> 00:00:43,952
basically have captured them on snapshot
and another example of these balloons.

16
00:00:43,952 --> 00:00:46,271
And of course, if you,
you don't have to imagine much, but

17
00:00:46,271 --> 00:00:48,737
you know that when it might be
fluttering these types of things.

18
00:00:48,737 --> 00:00:52,333
Each and everyone of them,
there is some sort of motion going on.

19
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,838
And still pictures,
of course are capturing it, but

20
00:00:54,838 --> 00:00:56,517
that's the extent of what they do.

21
00:00:56,517 --> 00:00:58,817
That is they just capture
one moment of it.

22
00:00:58,817 --> 00:01:01,866
Again, photographic value
was they're valuable, but

23
00:01:01,866 --> 00:01:04,733
they don't actually show
the dynamics of the scene.

24
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:07,865
Video on the other hand can
actually show the dynamics, right?

25
00:01:07,865 --> 00:01:12,151
Now, I can see everything in terms of
what the flickering is going on for

26
00:01:12,151 --> 00:01:17,020
the flame the flame for the flag,
the balloons and the children's swings.

27
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,690
But of course, we notice one thing.

28
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,317
It has a very well defined beginning and
end.

29
00:01:21,317 --> 00:01:24,608
As soon as the motion has ended,
the video came to a stop.

30
00:01:24,608 --> 00:01:27,018
I want to be able to
kind of see more of it.

31
00:01:27,018 --> 00:01:29,609
Well, and I want to be able
to film more time to it.

32
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:35,103
So here is what basically we can do it
by basically creating a video loop.

33
00:01:35,103 --> 00:01:37,802
So looping video basically
takes this video,

34
00:01:37,802 --> 00:01:41,064
which ends after a certain time here and
loops it again.

35
00:01:41,064 --> 00:01:44,445
So basically, what it does,
is it actually stops at that time and

36
00:01:44,445 --> 00:01:46,973
goes to the beginning and
starts another video.

37
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:50,689
Now, of course, there's a lot of
luck involved here, because what

38
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:54,808
may happen is you see a sudden jump when
the looping begins from begin to end.

39
00:01:54,808 --> 00:01:57,552
So for example here, boom,
everything shifted by a lot,

40
00:01:57,552 --> 00:01:59,408
because it went back to the beginning.

41
00:01:59,408 --> 00:02:04,002
So, of course, that basically
means we can actually loop it, but

42
00:02:04,002 --> 00:02:07,292
it does kind of have
an artifact of a sudden jump.

43
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:09,877
Video textures avoid all of this.

44
00:02:09,877 --> 00:02:13,238
See here,
all of these videos continuously play.

45
00:02:13,238 --> 00:02:15,721
And in fact,
they can go on infinitely long.

46
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:19,368
There is no sudden jump,
there is no end to this video.

47
00:02:19,368 --> 00:02:23,763
Basically what we've done is
created an infinite loop of videos

48
00:02:23,763 --> 00:02:26,351
that continue to play forever and ever.

49
00:02:26,351 --> 00:02:28,460
And that's what video
textures is all about.
