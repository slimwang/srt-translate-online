00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,730
Okay, one last thing I'd like to look at before

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:04,440
we move on to some more advanced query topics. Is the

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,270
ability to specify a projection document in addition to our query

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:12,370
document for calls to find. Now, what projection does is it

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,370
essentially describes the shape we would like documents to take in

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,850
the result set. I'm also going to break this out a

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,580
little bit here with the query and projection variable, and pass

8
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,140
those to find, instead of directly passing the dictionary that we

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,260
constructed to find. I point this out merely because we'll

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,360
see this later on in the lesson, and I don't want

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,850
anyone to be confused. Now, let's imagine that instead of getting

12
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,030
back all of the documents for our query specifying constraints on

13
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,730
manufacture and class, we actually are only interested in getting the

14
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,130
name of the document back. Well, we could simply print out

15
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,000
the name down here. But another way we can do that

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,060
is by specifying a projection as a second parameter to find.

17
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,180
And what that's going to do is say, all of the result

18
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:57,510
documents that come back, instead of having their full contents, I only

19
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,530
want to see name. No, by default, unless we explicitly say, I

20
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,209
don't want to see the ID field, we'll also get ID. So

21
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:07,590
that's why I've got ID set to zero here. Okay? So the

22
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,960
way we do this, is, essentially, we specify all the fields for

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,880
the documents in this collection. And then specify whether or not we

24
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,580
want them to occur in a result set. Alright? Let's run this.

25
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,720
Alright and here we can see that the documents

26
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,430
we get back simply have the name field in them.
