1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,670
Now, let's do the same thing again for clique.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:07,210
So, again, we're going to assume that we have a factor-2 approximation algorithm,

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,710
and the algorithm gives you a clique for a given input.

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,720
Again we're going to assume that the clique that you're getting contains 100 vertices.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,520
So now what is the maximum number of vertices in an optimum solution to clique?

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,450
And what would be the minimum number of vertices that are in an optimum solution?

7
00:00:22,450 --> 99:59:59,999
So please, again, enter your answers here in these boxes.
