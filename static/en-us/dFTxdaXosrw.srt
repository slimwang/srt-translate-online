1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is: just the keys.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This is the point of Kerckhoff's Principle,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
that we don't need to keep the encryption algorithm or the decryption algorithm secret,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
we want to make those public so they are carefully tested and understood,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and analyzed by many people.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We wanted only to keep this key secret.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The point of the encryption system is to allow us

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
to send the ciphertext over an insecure channel,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
so that's no longer going to be secret,

10
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and Alice is just a silly answer.
