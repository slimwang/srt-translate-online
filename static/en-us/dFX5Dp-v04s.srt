1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, so we've got our form,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
you've done all this before.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We've got our error case.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We've got a shell of a success case.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We are going to go ahead and fix that now soon,

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and we're rendering our form nicely with our error message

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and preserving our fields.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So far nothing is new to you other than the templates.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The next thing we're going to do is we're going to

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
start adding the database so we can store the art work

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
that is submitted by users.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The way you define an entity

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
in Google app engine is to define a class.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So we're going to make a class called art,

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and this is going to represent a submission from the user,

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and this inherits from db.model,

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and db.model is something that is included from Google.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You can see I've actually already imported up here

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
from Google.appengine.ext import db,

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and so our art class inherits from the db.model class,

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and this, this will allow us to create an entity.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So the first thing we need to do is

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
we need to define the types of this entity.
