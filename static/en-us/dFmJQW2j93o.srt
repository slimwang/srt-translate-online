1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,830
You have all these ideas and

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:06,170
at this point, you should be wondering,
which idea should I choose?

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,460
Well, to answer that question,
you have a lot to think about.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,190
Here are some of the considerations
you should keep in mind.

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,795
First, is your idea a painkiller or
a vitamin?

6
00:00:15,795 --> 00:00:19,210
Painkillers address an obvious and
functional need for users.

7
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,420
While vitamins address users emotional
needs and are really nice to have.

8
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,660
Now both types,

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,810
but especially painkillers,
can lead to successful companies.

10
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,880
For vitamin type ideas you'll need to
figure out how to get your users to

11
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,290
be sticky.

12
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,560
So that way they continue to come
back and use your product over time.

13
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:41,020
The second thing you should look for
is how easy it is to monetize the idea.

14
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,050
Now, you don't need to
monetize an idea on day one.

15
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,350
But understanding how to make
money out of the service or

16
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,150
product is essential to
building an enduring business.

17
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,990
Next, is the idea simple?

18
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,368
Can you explain your idea
in just a couple sentences?

19
00:00:55,368 --> 00:00:59,630
For example, bagborroworsteal.com
is like Netflix, but

20
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:04,330
instead of renting movies you can rent,
buy, or sell designer items.

21
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,690
Law enforcement and judges might
say the simplest explanation

22
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,240
is usually the right or truthful one.

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,690
And this should also be
true of your product.

24
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,800
Users should be able to
describe the product and

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,170
its benefits to other
potential users easily.

26
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,200
And here's where we get to
the heart of the matter.

27
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,480
Is your idea personally relevant?

28
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,273
For example you might be a diabetic and
want to develop affordable and

29
00:01:27,273 --> 00:01:30,278
convenient blood sugar monitors for
other diabetics.

30
00:01:30,278 --> 00:01:33,415
Now, don't underestimate this one.

31
00:01:33,415 --> 00:01:36,515
This is of great importance as it
relates to how likely you are to

32
00:01:36,515 --> 00:01:41,435
persevere in the face of challenge,
uncertainty or worse, looming failure.

33
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:44,725
You'll be more likely to see an idea
come to life if you care about the idea

34
00:01:44,725 --> 00:01:46,135
in the first place.

35
00:01:46,135 --> 00:01:48,835
Now another consideration for
your idea is whether or

36
00:01:48,835 --> 00:01:50,655
not you can follow through on it.

37
00:01:50,655 --> 00:01:53,640
Think about your ability
to organize a small team or

38
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,810
a large team to execute on that idea.

39
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,440
Can you get from A to B?

40
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,780
Next, you should wonder if you have
a large enough size of the market.

41
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,230
You want a really big slice of the pie.

42
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:07,060
The market just refers to your
number of potential customers.

43
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,788
You should be able to calculate a lower
estimate as well as an upper estimate

44
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:12,270
for your market size.

45
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,650
If you're unfamiliar with market
sizing refer to the instructor notes

46
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:16,690
there's a resource link there.

47
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,960
And finally, does your idea
have a legitimate secret sauce?

48
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,130
Does your idea leverage technology or
patents in a unique way?

49
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,890
Or do you have talent and capital
that no one else would ever have?

50
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,270
For Google the secret sauce
was the page rank algorithm.

51
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,140
The secret sauce has grown over
the years to include many features

52
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,060
that bring millions of page
results in fractions of a second.
