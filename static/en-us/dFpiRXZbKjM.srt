1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,430
The first answer I hope wasn't that difficult to find. This one is true.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:09,260
The rules of an independent set are that 2 vertices cannot be connected by an edge

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,950
if they are part of the independent set, and that means if we were to put this one

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,810
into the independent set as well as this one here, then we would have an error here,

5
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,400
which automatically also answers the second question.

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,630
It's not the case that both vertices can be in the independent set

7
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,480
because they are connected to each other.

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,560
This one here might have been a little bit more tricky.

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,380
So at least 1 of the 2 vertices must be in the independent set.

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,100
You might be inclined to think that

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,050
because we are looking for a maximum size independent set.

12
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,500
But actually, that is not the case, and I will give you a little example for that.

13
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,630
Say we have a very small network like this one here,

14
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,620
and here you have v, here you have u.

15
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,540
Then this network here has an independent set of size 2.

16
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,180
Actually, it has a number of independent sets of size 2,

17
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:57,850
but there is also 1 independent set of size 2 where v and u are both excluded.

18
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,540
This is a bit different from vertex cover because you can actually have the case

19
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:06,120
that both vertices are not part of the set even though they are connected by an edge.

20
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,710
So this is false.

21
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,160
Both v and u could be 0.

22
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,970
Yes, this is exactly what is also shown by this example.

23
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,380
You can have the case that both are not part of the independent set,

24
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,550
so this is definitely a yes here.

25
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:19,780
Do we have to set both vertices to 0? No.

26
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,500
This is also not the case because, for example, you could also have an independent set here

27
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,190
that you construct in this way.

28
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,590
You put u in and this one out.

29
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,290
So now we have also found a maximum size independent set,

30
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,160
but we have included 1 of the 2 vertices.

31
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,090
So this one here is clearly also not true.

32
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,720
If you take all of those observations together, it's pretty cool

33
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,490
because this now gives us a new search tree strategy

34
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,380
that is actually quite similar to vertex cover.

35
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,000
So we have our 2 vertices, v and u, here.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,940
Just as we did with vertex cover, we can spread into 3 different possibilities.

37
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:54,160
The first one is we take v into the independent set but not u.

38
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,790
The second one is exactly the other way around.

39
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,330
We do not take v but we take u.

40
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,170
And finally, it is possible that both are excluded.

41
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,920
As long as we find an edge between 2 vertices, v and u,

42
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,070
for which v has no assignment yet and u has no assignment yet,

43
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,690
then we can branch into exactly 3 possibilities.

44
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:16,800
Now, what happens if either v or u already has an assignment?

45
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,280
For vertex cover I told you what would happen then.

46
00:02:19,280 --> 99:59:59,999
This time I will let you figure this out.
