1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,930
What a week.

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:04,543
I mean, I just, I've been working on
this database the entire week and

3
00:00:04,543 --> 00:00:06,419
it's just so hard to figure it out.

4
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:09,990
I'm doing primary keys, I'm doing
foreign keys, I'm doing inner joins,

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,640
I'm doing outer joins,
just thank goodness it's Friday.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,500
>> Yeah, I can imagine.

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,519
It was a long week indeed, right?

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:19,280
So, you have any plans for the weekend?

9
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,339
>> I think I'm going to work on a few
burgers, I'm going to work on my tan.

10
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:25,890
And of course, all the database stuff is
just going to be going around the back

11
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,920
of my head so that when I hit
the desk again on Monday or

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,970
probably Sunday night, at least I'll
have something to start working on.

13
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:31,299
How about you?

14
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,390
What are you going to do this weekend?

15
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,730
>> Yeah, I'm not sure yet actually.

16
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:36,269
I think I might be building
an app this weekend.

17
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,090
>> You're building an app this weekend?

18
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,050
>> Do you know how long I've
been working on that app?

19
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:42,929
I've been working on it for weeks and
I've barely written any code yet.

20
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:44,119
I'm still designing data.

21
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:46,409
It's just, how are you going to
do an app in a weekend?

22
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:47,619
>> Yeah, I'm not sure yet.

23
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:50,759
But I think I'm going to
be using Firebase for it.

24
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,829
>> Firebase, I kind of heard about
that as a middleware type thing.

25
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:54,979
Is that going to help with the date?

26
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:58,189
Tell you what, I'll look after the
burgers, and you tell me about Firebase.

27
00:00:58,189 --> 00:01:01,659
>> Okay, well with Firebase,
like normally when you build an app,

28
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:04,530
you spend a lot of time on
the backend and on the middleware.

29
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,030
With Firebase,
you can ignore all that and

30
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,260
actually focus on what your
app needs to be special.

31
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,810
So what makes your app your app.

32
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:14,879
And I think with that, you could
be building an app in a weekend.

33
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:15,939
>> I could build it in a weekend?

34
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:16,879
>> I think so.

35
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:17,409
>> Really?

36
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:17,729
>> Yup.

37
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:17,850
>> Wow.

38
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:18,849
Hey Lila.

39
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:19,109
>> Yeah?

40
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:21,920
What's up?

41
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,620
>> We're going to build
an app this weekend.

42
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,840
>> Cool.

43
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,390
I'm in.

44
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,920
>> What kind of app are we going to do?

45
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,420
>> So how about we build a chat app this
weekend, but then let's actually set

46
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,719
the bar a bit higher
>> Alright.

47
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:35,250
>> Let's build a chat app not just for
one platform, but

48
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,969
we're going to build it for
iOS and for Android.

49
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:38,209
>> Okay.

50
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:40,009
>> How do we feel about that?

51
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:44,313
>> Well I could build an Android
app with my eyes closed, but

52
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,930
iOS, hey, Jared's calling.

53
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:47,950
Hey Jared, what's up.

54
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,850
>> Hey,
are you having a party without me?

55
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,030
>> Perfect timing,
want to build an iOS chat app?

56
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,620
>> Sure let's do it.

57
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,840
>> That's great, that settles it then.

58
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,700
So we're going to be building a chat app
for iOS and Android in the weekends.

59
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,510
How do we feel about that?

60
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,469
Are we ready to build an app guys?

61
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:04,179
>> Yeah okay.

62
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,070
>> Yeah, let's go.

63
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:05,599
>> Let's do this.

64
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,199
>> Bring it on.
