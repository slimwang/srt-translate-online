1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,060
There are a lot of subjects
that students learn about from

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,530
kindergarten all the way
through college,

3
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,220
that we could teach in some
really interesting ways.

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:06,790
So for example,

5
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:11,230
let's imagine you doing a unit on the
Amazonian rainforest in biology class.

6
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,910
One way you could teach that material
is by piling all your students on

7
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:14,670
to an airplane.

8
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,480
Flying them down to
the Amazonian rainforest and

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,020
letting them actually learn about it
by catching animals, dissecting them,

10
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,880
watching them in their natural habitat,
learning about them that way.

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,346
It would be really interesting and
really authentic, and really engaging,

12
00:00:26,346 --> 00:00:28,150
and completely unfeasible.

13
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,050
We can't load student onto
airplanes like that and

14
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,470
fly them down to a dangerous area just
to learn about how the rainforest works.

15
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,010
But what we can do is bring
them that experience to their

16
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,170
computers through something like
Amazon Trail, which is a game or

17
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,100
a simulation you all
might be familiar with.

18
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,810
So what we can do is we can use
computers to construct simulations of

19
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:46,990
the kinds of environments or

20
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,120
experiences we want students to have and
let them engage with it that way.

21
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,030
This can be powerful in another
on a number of different ways.

22
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,060
It's very authentic.

23
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,630
It lets them see not only the content we
want them to learn but also potentially

24
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,520
how people researching that content
actually work in their day to day life.

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,540
Lets them see what is it like to
actually research biology down

26
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,140
in the Amazon?

27
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,680
Or what is it like to
capture marine animals and

28
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,010
investigate them as a marine biologist?

29
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,580
It's also powerful because it can be
very empowering to let students explore

30
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,460
things on their own.

31
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,900
They kind of get to drive their own
learning and drive their investigation

32
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,050
which aligns very nicely with some
other things we've talked about so

33
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,450
far in this class.

34
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,090
So, simulation-based learning is a great
way to bring authentic and engaging

35
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:30,000
learning experiences to students
through the power of their computers.

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,770
So, in this morsel, we're going to talk
about how we can build simulations that

37
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,740
are engaging and authentic for the
material we want to teach the students.
