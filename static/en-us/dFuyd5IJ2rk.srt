1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,130
So the answer to the first one
is Flicker.galleries.getphotos.

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:06,910
The second one is
flicker.people.getpublicphotos.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,555
The third one is
flicker.stats.getphotostats and

4
00:00:11,555 --> 00:00:16,190
the last one is
flicker.urls.getuserphotos.

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,410
So each of these methods is
pretty intuitively named.

6
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,280
This is a good job on Flickr.

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,010
And not all APIs name theirs so
clearly, so

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,680
sometimes you got to do
a little bit more digging.
