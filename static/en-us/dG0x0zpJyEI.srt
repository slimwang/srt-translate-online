00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,690
Now in the last lecture, we have started
talking about image warping already.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:07,150
So now let's actually try to
make it much more foundational.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,630
Again, let's take this
simple image here.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,210
And what we want to do is basically
we want to distort this image.

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:18,090
And one of the ways we can do this is
distort it by simulating some sort of

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,340
an optical change in
aberration of some sort.

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,266
A typical one of that type would be
basically something like a fish eye lens

8
00:00:25,266 --> 00:00:26,100
here, right?

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,786
If you notice,
if you had a fish eye lens in a camera,

10
00:00:28,786 --> 00:00:31,150
everything in the front would pop out.

11
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,260
And of course, if you notice,
farther things are going back here.

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,250
And in this case, there's a bulging
in the middle here, right?

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,720
And this bulging is showcased by E is
much bigger here than it was there and

14
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,290
of course, there's all kinds
of curvature information.

15
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,570
Another operation could be,
we can project this onto a curved or

16
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,020
a mirrored surface.

17
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:55,790
So in this case, I basically
projected this image onto an arch.

18
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,020
So if you notice, it's curved and
of course, it now has a shape.

19
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:04,940
In essence, this almost could be looked
at as taking this image and warping it,

20
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,720
and putting it on some sort of an arch
so now it actually looks like, curved.

21
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,860
This could also be referred to as
texture mapping where I basically made

22
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,170
this image be a texture on a surface.

23
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,500
And in this case, it could be
a curved surface like this one.

24
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,100
It could be a cylinder or a sphere also.

25
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,300
Another method is,
we can basically take polygons and

26
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,850
basically kind of discretize this
into small regions of polygons.

27
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,960
And basically,
each polygon would be distorted.

28
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,710
So for example,
this is my original image.

29
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,010
This is my output image.

30
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,590
Let me show you some polygons on top.

31
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,860
So here I've basically,

32
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,510
in the original image,
basically shown a small quadrilateral.

33
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,600
What I want to do in this one is
of course I'm going to take this

34
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,120
quadrilateral, and
it will be warped in this one.

35
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,260
And any information that's
in this quadrilateral,

36
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,660
rectangle in this instance,
would now be transformed in this one.

37
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,120
Basically, you see that warping here,
right?

38
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,710
The T is there,
you notice the T is still there.

39
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,350
But the E is curved.

40
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,620
And of course,
there are other polygons next to it too,

41
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,460
I'm just showing you this.

42
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,950
For example,
you can see the other polygons.

43
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,600
This shape here, and
another one is also down here.

44
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,140
And there is another one here.

45
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,980
And these are again polygons.

46
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,900
In this case, I'm basically showing
the polygons not to just be linear

47
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,080
quadrilaterals but
to be various types of deformations.

48
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,520
In essence, what's happened
in this instance has been,

49
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,280
this has been converted
into a warped polygon here.

50
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,940
And of course, there's another whole
concept of distorting using morphing,

51
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,220
and we'll talk more about that too.
