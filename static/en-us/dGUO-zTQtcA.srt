00:00:00,635 --> 00:00:04,420
Knowledge-based AI is a collection of three things.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:09,350
Knowledge representations, problem solving techniques and architectures.

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,980
We have already look at one knowledge representation, semantic networks.

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:18,230
We have not so far looked at problem solving methods or architectures.

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,360
Today, I'd like to start by talking about the problem solving method.

6
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:27,880
Let us illustrate the problem solving method of generate and test with the same

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,470
examples that we have discussed earlier. When we were discussing this example in

8
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,250
the case of semantic networks, we simply came up with various states and

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:41,080
pruned some of them without saying about how an AI agent would know what states

10
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:46,750
to prune. So imagine that we have a generator that takes the initial state and

11
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,760
from that initial or current state, generates all the possible successive

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,030
states. For now, imagine it's not a very smart generator, it's a dumb generator.

13
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:00,490
So it generates all the possible states. So the generator test method not only

14
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:05,980
has a generator but also has a tester. The tester looks at all the possible

15
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:11,340
states the generator has generated and removes some of them. For now, let's also

16
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,949
assume that the tester is is dumb as well. And so the tester is removes only

17
00:01:15,949 --> 00:01:21,391
those states that are are clearly illegal based on the specific of the problem.

18
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:26,842
Namely, that one cannot have more prisoners than guards on either back.

19
00:01:26,842 --> 00:01:29,680
So the first and the third states are removed by the tester.
