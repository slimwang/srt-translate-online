1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,430
I want to focus more
deeply on selectors.

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:08,090
To do this,
I've created a simple unstyled web page.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,690
This web page showcases my top
three favorite books of all time.

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,825
If you couldn't tell,
I'm a big survival and adventure fan.

5
00:00:17,135 --> 00:00:18,985
Let's try to add some
styling to this web page.

6
00:00:20,065 --> 00:00:23,285
I've open the .HTML file,
and using tag selectors,

7
00:00:23,285 --> 00:00:29,940
we could write some CSS that selects all
the h1 tags, H2 tags or paragraph tags.

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,020
But what if we wanted to add
style to the book summaries, but

9
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,490
not the site description at the top?

10
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,510
Using tag selectors,
we can only select all paragraph tags.

11
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,820
So what do we do?

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,290
Thankfully, we have a few more ways
to select HTML elements with CSS,

13
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,230
besides using tags.

14
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,320
Instead, we can use attributes.

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,630
I'm going to change my html file
to demonstrate how this works.

16
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:55,910
All right.

17
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,710
So now reloaded my new html
file with a few changes.

18
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:02,870
If we look at the file I've
added this ID attribute

19
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,730
site description to my first paragraph.

20
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:09,170
And if we look at the rest of
the paragraphs I have this class

21
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,370
book summary.

22
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,840
These two attributes
are extremely helpful.

23
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,240
First, because attributes help us
describe the content of the page

24
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,400
inside the HTML markup.

25
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,750
You can now clearly see that
the first paragraph on my webpage

26
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,600
Is my site description.

27
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,080
Now keep in mind,
IDs should be used sparingly.

28
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,620
That's because an HTML element
can only have one ID and

29
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,670
IDs can only be used once per page.

30
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:34,630
For example.

31
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,570
If I type another ID, this is not okay.

32
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,800
Because I'm passing two ID's,
site description and

33
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,400
another ID to the same element.

34
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,580
If I add the ID site description here,
this is also not okay.

35
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,360
Because now I'm using site
description in two places.

36
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,530
If I wanted to add an ID here
I'd need to give it another name

37
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,220
that has not already been used.

38
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:01,360
If I change the ID to first
book then that would be okay.

39
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,600
Generally, when you're
styling your page,

40
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,700
you'll be styling collections of
elements, not individual elements.

41
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,030
If you want to add the same
attribute to multiple HTML elements,

42
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,010
use classes instead,
like I've done here for book summaries.

43
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,050
Classes can be added to
multiple HTML elements.

44
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,080
And HTML elements can
have multiple classes.

45
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,760
This makes classes extremely
powerful and flexible.

46
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,380
You will use them constantly
as a web developer, and

47
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,970
most web developers
prefer classes over IDs.

48
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:35,690
Besides organization, these attributes
can be used as CSS selectors.

49
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,770
If I revisit my question from before,
I wanted to style my book summaries

50
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,780
differently than my site
description here at the top.

51
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,090
Using the ID and class selectors,
I can easily do that.

52
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,960
For book summaries they
use the class attribute.

53
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,190
In order to select an HTML element with
the class attribute I will type a period

54
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,580
followed by the name of the class.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,510
For the site description
it uses an id attribute

56
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,590
in order select an HTML
element with an id attribute.

57
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:09,140
I will type of pound sign or
hash tag followed by the name of the id.

58
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,510
Okay, good.

59
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,840
Finally, allowed some quick styling
to make sure our selectors work.

60
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,605
Let's change the property color
to blue for our book summary.

61
00:03:14,605 --> 00:03:21,810
And let's change the property color
to red for our site description.

62
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:27,710
Okay, now save and refresh and perfect.

63
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:31,650
We can see that the site description and
the book summaries are different colors.

64
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,690
So our selectors worked.
