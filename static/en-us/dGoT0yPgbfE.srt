Let's practice collecting multiple values. I want to write a program that helps

2
00:00:03,994 --> 00:00:07,620
a user compute their average time for sprinting 100 meters. Here are the

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,130
beginnings of the average method. The method should be reading floating point

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,330
numbers from the user until the user enters zero and then it should return the

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:19,287
average of all of the numbers. You can use the average tester main method to

6
00:00:19,287 --> 00:00:20,819
test as you go along.
