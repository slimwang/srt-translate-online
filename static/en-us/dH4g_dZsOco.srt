In the last quiz, we transformed the function f of x equals x squared, into the

2
00:00:04,302 --> 00:00:09,750
function f of x equals x squared minus 2. And we saw that the way this affects

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,046
our graph is, it moves it down by 2 units. We called this a vertical shift

4
00:00:14,046 --> 00:00:18,142
downward. But remember, we're trying to help Athena with her function. And I'm

5
00:00:18,142 --> 00:00:21,911
not sure yet if we're going to need to move things vertically. We do know,

6
00:00:21,911 --> 00:00:25,737
however, that she's going to want to move her function horizontally. So why

7
00:00:25,737 --> 00:00:29,880
don't we try that for a second. So let's say that, once again, we start out

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,268
with the function, f of x equals x squared. This time however, I know that I

9
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:38,111
want to get a graph that's exactly the same as this one, but shifted over to

10
00:00:38,111 --> 00:00:44,533
the right by 3 units. What equation do I need for this new graph? Please write

11
00:00:44,533 --> 00:00:45,709
it right here.
