1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Well, let's take a look.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Suppose our word rule comes first, just like it does here on the page in some sense.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello is definitely a word, but actually,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
world in quotes is also a word because this quotation mark

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
is not a space, a left angle or a right angle.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
If this comes first, we get word, word, which would make us very unhappy.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
On the other hand, if it comes after string,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
then we'll end up getting the behavior that we're expecting.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
However, probably this whitespace rule

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
actually has to come first

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
lest we confuse whitespace and the body of strings.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Our word rule precludes us from including spaces as parts of words,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
but our string rule really does not, so we probably want our whitespace rule

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
to come if not first, somewhere near the top.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
That means that our word rule is the one that comes last.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
If our final ordering is either whitespace, string, word,

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
string, whitespace, word, we'll get the output we expect.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Let's walk through the first one and see how it goes.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We'll start with the h in hello. Does that match whitespace?

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
No, it does not. We'll try our next rule.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Does that match string? No, it doesn't start with a double quote.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Could it match word? Oh, it totally could.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And now we'll use our maximal munch power, and it will eat up the e,

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
the l, l, o, comma,

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
but it's going to stop because whitespace has higher priority.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We'll see the word hello,

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
then we'll see the space.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Does that match the whitespace rule? It does, so we'll pass over it.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Then we'll see these double quotes. Does that match the whitespace rule?

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
No. Does it match the string rule?

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yes, it does.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Maximal munch will take us all the way to the end of this token,

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and we get the output we expect, and the second case behaves similarly.
