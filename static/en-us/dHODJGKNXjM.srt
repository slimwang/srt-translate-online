00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:06,050
So why does the 0x20 encoding make DNS more secure? Is it because DNS names

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,252
are case-sensitive? Is it because the encoding adds

3
00:00:09,252 --> 00:00:12,160
additional entropy to the query? Is it because

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,670
the encoding make its easier to encrypt

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,830
the queries and replies, or is it because

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,572
the encoding adds the requirement for an additional

7
00:00:20,572 --> 00:00:24,690
layer of hierarchy into the DNS resolution infrastructure?
