00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,610
When you ran this query,
what was it that wasn't right about it?

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,350
Well, it seems to think
that each student is his or

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:12,070
her own roommate, and it lists each pair
of roommates twice in alternating order.

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:16,070
There are a lot of ways to fix this,
but here's just one of them.

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:21,310
By asking only for the rows where
this id, is less than that id.

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,980
We eliminate the rows where they're
equal, in other words the same student.

7
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,530
And, we eliminate one out
of each pair of duplicates.
