1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:02,580
In this lesson, we'll talk about

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,040
multimedia and streaming. We'll talk about digital

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,720
audio and video data, multimedia applications, in

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,010
particular, streaming audio and video for playback.

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,129
Multimedia transfers over a best-effort network,

6
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:19,170
in particular, how to tolerate packet loss

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,700
delay and jitter, and quality of service.

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,720
So we use multimedia and streaming video

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,770
very frequently on todays internet. YouTube streaming

10
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,710
videos are an example of multimedia streaming

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:41,470
as are applications for video or voice chat such as Skype or Google Hangout.

12
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,930
In this lecture we'll talk about the

13
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,580
challenges for streaming these types of applications

14
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,840
over best effort networks. As well has how to solve those challenges. We'll also

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,830
talk about the basics of digital audio and video data.

16
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,180
First of all, let's talk about the challenges for media streaming.
