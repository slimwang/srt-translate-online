00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,614
There are 2 parts to this problem, the first part is saving the vertex in the

2
00:00:04,614 --> 00:00:09,531
geometry object. This is pretty straight forward and you've seen it before. You

3
00:00:09,531 --> 00:00:14,125
add a point to the vertices. The trickier part is generating the faces. There

4
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:17,177
are a number of ways to do this, here's mine. You may recall from the

5
00:00:17,177 --> 00:00:21,532
triangulation exercises that a polygon with some number of points generates

6
00:00:21,532 --> 00:00:26,925
points minus 2 triangles. The loop here uses this fact with face looping through

7
00:00:26,925 --> 00:00:31,811
this many triangles. My loop makes this kind of fan with all the triangles

8
00:00:31,811 --> 00:00:35,733
including this top most point and radiating out from there.
