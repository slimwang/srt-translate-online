00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,782
Pretty much everybody has to pay taxes and Grant, with his new Gleaming Glasses

00:00:03,782 --> 00:00:08,497
company is no exception. The way that taxes depend on income can be described

3
00:00:08,497 --> 00:00:12,283
by functions. But these are slightly different functions than ones we've seen

4
00:00:12,283 --> 00:00:16,430
before. Let's check them out. First things first, here's a chart showing how a

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,907
person's yearly income, determines the amount of money they will pay the

6
00:00:19,907 --> 00:00:24,942
government in taxes where Grant lives. We can see that the tax rate over here,

7
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:28,270
or the percent of their income that a person will pay the government in taxes,

8
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:33,340
changes depending on how high the person's income is. The way this works is a

9
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,682
little bit complicated, so bear with me here. Now someone makes under $5000,

10
00:00:37,682 --> 00:00:42,037
please note this entire column is in dollars, so if someone makes under $5000,

11
00:00:42,037 --> 00:00:46,824
their tax rate is 0%. So, they actually don't have to pay the government

12
00:00:46,824 --> 00:00:51,442
anything at all. If someone's total income is between $5,000 and $15,000, the

13
00:00:51,442 --> 00:00:58,084
first $5,000 of their income is set aside and not taxed. Then what is left over

14
00:00:58,084 --> 00:01:03,088
is taxed at this 10% rate. If someone earns between $15,000 and $35,000 total,

15
00:01:03,088 --> 00:01:06,808
then, as with the person in this lower bracket, the first $5,000 of their

16
00:01:06,808 --> 00:01:13,044
income isn't taxed. The next 10,000, is taxed at 10%, and then the rest is

17
00:01:13,044 --> 00:01:18,700
taxed at 20%. If the person makes even more money than this total, then the

18
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:24,150
amount above $35,000, is taxed at 30%. We can think of this tax rate scaling as

19
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,992
a sort of layering effect. As were counting up the money a person makes, we

20
00:01:27,992 --> 00:01:32,430
don't start by thinking about the total. We start by counting from zero. Once

21
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,902
we get to 5,000, then we start to add our tax rate, and we keep counting up and

22
00:01:35,902 --> 00:01:39,289
up, increasing the rate when we need to.
