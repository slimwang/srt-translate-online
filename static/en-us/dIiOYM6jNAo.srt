1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,151
The left-hand side of the equation is just y, and in place of y, we're

2
00:00:04,163 --> 00:00:08,553
substituting in the y-coordinate at this point, which is 7. So, the left-hand

3
00:00:08,866 --> 00:00:13,701
side should just become 7. The right-hand side, as we can see over here, has an

4
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:18,360
x in it. So, we need to substitute 3 into that spot. Simplifying that all the

5
00:00:18,372 --> 00:00:23,361
way, gives us 4. Unfortunately, 7 is not equal to 4. In answer to the question,

6
00:00:23,472 --> 00:00:28,621
are the sides equal, we have to say no. Since plugging in the coordinates this

7
00:00:28,633 --> 00:00:33,708
point makes it so that the two side of our equation are no longer equal, which

8
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,844
we remember is the requirement of an equation, this point must not lay on this

9
00:00:38,856 --> 00:00:45,388
line. In other words, these values for x and y do not satisfy the equation, y

10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,860
equals 3x minus 5.
