00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,899
Now we have a list of weather data
that scrolls in our activity.

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:04,785
Great job!

3
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:06,830
You've already come so far.

4
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,789
You've accomplished a lot
in this first lesson.

5
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:11,109
You started with nothing
more than Android Studio and

6
00:00:11,109 --> 00:00:13,739
the hope of one day writing
your first Android app.

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,530
Now you've created your first project.

8
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:19,169
Built and deployed it to virtual and
perhaps actual devices.

9
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,950
And even created a simple scrolling
text based UI that's populated from your

10
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:24,559
application code.

11
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,429
You also learned a little about what
makes mobile, and Android in particular,

12
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:32,490
a different environment to develop for
then desktop, web, and server.

13
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,109
But we've only gotten started,
the app that we've got so

14
00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:37,219
far is using static mock data.

15
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:40,549
So join us in lesson two to learn how we
can hook it up to data from the network.
