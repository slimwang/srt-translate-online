Let's look at two different functions now, but still nothing too complicated. I

2
00:00:04,724 --> 00:00:10,238
like these two. Here we have p of x, equals x plus 4. And q of x, equals

3
00:00:10,238 --> 00:00:16,370
negative 2x minus 5. So here are three graphs. Which one represents p plus q,

4
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:22,009
which one is p minus q, and which one shows q minus p? Now to figure this out,

5
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:25,608
think about how much each line should be moved up or down at each x value,

6
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:31,489
based on the value of the other function at that same position. Another way, of

7
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:34,881
course, to figure this question out, will be to use the equations right here,

8
00:00:34,881 --> 00:00:39,703
of p and q, to figure out the equations of the other lines. Then you can use

9
00:00:39,703 --> 00:00:41,199
those to pick the graphs.
