00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,410
Now that we have an idea of what our graph will mean, I've gone ahead and drawn

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:07,135
it for you. Know that the graph looks like it's made up of pieces of four

3
00:00:07,135 --> 00:00:11,484
different lines with different slopes. And in fact, it's exactly what's

4
00:00:11,484 --> 00:00:15,010
happening. So, we can see how they all compare to one another. I'd like you

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,185
tell me what the equation in for each part of the line is. Remember that the

6
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:22,967
slope of each line will be the tax rate of the bracket that corresponds to it

7
00:00:22,967 --> 00:00:27,926
written in decimal form. If you figured this out for each line segment, and

8
00:00:27,926 --> 00:00:31,454
then simply find a point on each of these sections of the line, you can use the

9
00:00:31,454 --> 00:00:36,986
point-slope formula to find the equation of the line. Please use x for the

10
00:00:36,986 --> 00:00:40,890
income, which is on the horizontal axis and t for taxes owed, since it's on the

11
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,109
vertical axis.
