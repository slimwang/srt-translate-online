1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,710
So we just covered the first constraint, which is

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:06,090
find that data and battery life. Now as developers,

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,930
it's, I mean it's, it's easy for us to

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:10,630
know that these constraints are very important not to violate.

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:11,140
>> Yeah.

6
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,940
>> But once you actually talk to a user

7
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,980
that's feeling the pain. From when these constraints have

8
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,170
been violated, that really sheds a light on how

9
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,950
truly important this is. We cannot overstate this fact.

10
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,890
>> So we talked to an actual Android user about

11
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,400
her experiences with her phone. Let's hear what she says.
