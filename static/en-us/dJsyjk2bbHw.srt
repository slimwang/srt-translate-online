1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Well, you always start with a, because you can get a

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
by looking at the case of x equals 0 and then b doesn't matter.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So if x equals 0, so it means you write over here, then y equals a

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
that falls us directly from this question because x equals 0.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So what's the y value over here? It's 1 so that means a is to be 1.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Now that we know this, you can look at b.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We know that if x = 4 then the expression on the right over here gets us a 2 in the y dimension.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We really know a is you can put the a in which gives us 4b+1=2. We bring 1 to the right side.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Therefore, 4b=1 and then we divided by 4, which means b equals to fourth or quarter

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and 0.25 and 1 other correct answers here.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So now you understand about lines. Let's talk about linear regression.
