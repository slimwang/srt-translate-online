00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I have another gradient quiz.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Consider the following quadratic arrow function.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We are considering the gradient in 3 different places.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
a. b. and c.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And they ask you which gradient is the largest.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
a, b, or c or are they all equal?

7
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
In which case, you would want to check the last box over here
