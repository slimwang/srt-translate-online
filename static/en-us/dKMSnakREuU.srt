00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,029
Here's how I figured it out. If I look at an arbitrary point, x and y, where as

2
00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:07,933
always in our graphical coordinate systems, x grows this way and y grows this

3
00:00:07,933 --> 00:00:13,367
way, downward. And it's clear that the x value here has nothing to do with

4
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:19,130
which color to chose. But the y value does, so I have to worry about the y

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:24,981
value being. Greater than or maybe greater equal, we'll come back to that in a

6
00:00:24,981 --> 00:00:29,322
minute, then half the height. Now if it's greater than or greater than equal,

7
00:00:29,322 --> 00:00:33,570
or less than or less than equal, it's easy if it would make these things wrong.

8
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,724
So, let's look at the actual numbers. Let's assume that the height is 200. In

9
00:00:37,724 --> 00:00:44,578
that case the Y values can be from 0 to 199. So, if they're from 0 to 99 then I

10
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:51,579
want red. And if they're from 100 to 199 then I want white. So, if height is

11
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:56,854
200 then height is over 2 is 100. Greater or equal than 100 should give me

12
00:00:56,854 --> 00:01:01,662
wide. So, this is exactly the right condition, we'll put it in here and

13
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:07,060
otherwise I want Red. Let me put it in and demo it to you. I'll just make a

14
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,010
flag, many flags as I want in a half times as wide as they are tall and I'll

15
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:21,341
use the same here. And here it is. Red on top, white on the bottom. Let's move

16
00:01:21,341 --> 00:01:24,523
on to a more complicated flag.
