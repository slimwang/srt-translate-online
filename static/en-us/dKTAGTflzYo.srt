1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,420
All right Charles, let's work this out.

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:03,719
>> We're going to work this out?

3
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:05,170
>> Well, you're going to work this out.

4
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,300
>> Ok well, so I'm looking at this.

5
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,280
I actually think this ones pretty
straight forward to do once

6
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,830
you have the first insight.

7
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,249
The first insight is,
you want to go backwards.

8
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,280
And the reason you want to go
backwards is because I already

9
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,220
know what the answer for the final state
is, and I can go back one step and

10
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,050
use that to figure out what the states
before are, and so on and so forth.

11
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,440
So with that, why don't we actually
be explicit about it then.

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,126
So.
>> Yes.

13
00:00:30,126 --> 00:00:35,150
The value of s of f would be zero.

14
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,180
That's a given,
that's pretty easy, okay.

15
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:42,190
So then I can ask,
well what would be the value of s4 say.

16
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:50,350
So s4 is the reward you get for leaving
that state and taking the action.

17
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,000
Plus gamma times the state
you're going to end up in.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,230
Well, so that would be 1 + gamma x 0,
which is 1.

19
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,930
Well, that's pretty good.

20
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,400
Okay, and then for
S5 I can do the same thing.

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,360
In this case it would be 10 + gamma x 0.

22
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,820
Which of course is 10.

23
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,550
All right, am I right so far?

24
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,520
>> You are right so far, but that's not
the question that was asked, it was S3.

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,590
>> Oh, okay.
Fair enough.

26
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,910
All right, so let's do S3 then.

27
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:26,770
So S3 would be the reward that I get,
which is be 0 + gamma times.

28
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,750
The value of the state that I end up in.

29
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,740
Well, if I end up in state 4,
that would be 1, but sometimes,

30
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,190
I'll end up in state 5,
and that would 10.

31
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,810
So 90% of the time I end up in 1.

32
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,440
10% of the time I end up in 10.

33
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,200
So I multiply the first one by 0.9,
the second one by 0.1.

34
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,110
And then I add them up and
we go from there.

35
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,618
And that number is .9 + 1 is that right.

36
00:01:51,618 --> 00:01:56,021
Which is 1.9.

37
00:01:56,021 --> 00:01:58,360
And that was easy because gamma was 1.

38
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,080
>> Nice very good.

39
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,640
>> So I think actually might
as well go ahead what S1 and

40
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,130
S2 would be then because why not.

41
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:07,700
>> Okay.

42
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,080
>> All right the value of S1 would be 1
>> Plus

43
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,220
gamma times the value
of S3 which is 1.9.

44
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,050
And so that would be 2.9.

45
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:23,290
And S2 would be 2 + 1.9,
which is 3.9, so this is good.

46
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,420
So if there was some state zero,
and I had a choice between going to

47
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,930
state one and and state two from it,
I should go to state two.

48
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,090
>> Yes, because it's just the same
expect you get that extra one bonus

49
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,490
going out of state two.

50
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,450
>> Right, okay that makes sense.

51
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,670
>> Great.
Nicely done.

52
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,170
>> Thank you.
