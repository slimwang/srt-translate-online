1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,033
So part of figuring out how to solve word
problems well is figuring out what

2
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:08,193
information isn't important for the
question that we're trying to answer. We

3
00:00:08,205 --> 00:00:12,487
want to know how much money Grant's going
to make from selling nozzles. All that

4
00:00:12,499 --> 00:00:16,772
this is going to depend on is the price
per nozzle and how many people want to buy

5
00:00:16,784 --> 00:00:21,032
nozzles. That means that these answers
with 36, which has to do with the people

6
00:00:21,044 --> 00:00:26,638
who want to buy wipers are irrelevant for
this question. Also w is the price per

7
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:32,523
wiper set not per nozzle, so this answer
which depends on w can't be correct. And

8
00:00:32,534 --> 00:00:38,206
this one even though it also involves an
n, involves a w so, it can't be right

9
00:00:38,218 --> 00:00:44,090
either. We're only focusing on nozzle
sales here. So what are we left with 11,

10
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:49,445
11 times 2 and 22 and 11n. Well, this looks
pretty good nothing having to do

11
00:00:49,457 --> 00:00:55,540
explicitly with wiper sales. However,
these 2 answers 11 and 22 don't involve an

12
00:00:55,552 --> 00:01:01,403
n. That will mean that no amount or how
many nozles Grant sells, he's going to

13
00:01:01,415 --> 00:01:06,973
make either just $11 or $22. I would hope
that, for his sake, the more nozzles he

14
00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:12,624
sells, the more money he makes so we want
to say that those answers aren't correct.

15
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:18,403
So now we have 11 times 2n and 11n. The key here
is remembering that each of these eleven

16
00:01:18,415 --> 00:01:24,545
people want two nozzles. Not just one
nozzle. So each person who buys two

17
00:01:24,557 --> 00:01:31,395
nozzles is going to pay him not n dollars
but 2n dollars. If 11 people paying 2n

18
00:01:31,407 --> 00:01:36,332
dollars so that means we need 11 times 2n which
is this answer right here.
