The equation of the curve that I just showed you in the last solution is this,

2
00:00:04,544 --> 00:00:10,280
f of x equals 4 over x minus 1 plus 1. How can we write this equation in the

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,115
normal form for the equation of a rational function as one polynomial divided

4
00:00:14,115 --> 00:00:19,108
by another polynomial. So, you want just a single fraction here, where both the

5
00:00:19,108 --> 00:00:23,423
numerator and the denominator are polynomials. Please fill this in and make

6
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:26,687
sure that the common factor between the numerator and the denominator is 1 in

7
00:00:26,687 --> 00:00:28,310
this case.
