1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Thrun] So C is not independent of A.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In fact, A influences C by virtue of B.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
But if you know B, then A becomes independent of C,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
which means the only determinate into C is B.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
If you know B for sure, then knowledge of A won't really tell you anything about C.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
C is also not independent of D, just the same way C is not independent of A.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
If I learn something about D, I can infer more about C.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But if I do know A, then it's hard to imagine how knowledge of D would help me with C

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
because I can't learn anything more about A than knowing A already.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Therefore, given A, C and D are independent.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The same is true for E and C.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 99:59:59,999
If we know D, then E and C become independent.
