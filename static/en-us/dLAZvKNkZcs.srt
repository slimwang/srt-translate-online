00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here we are in the file we've been working in this entire lecture.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This has our class link.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
That just has the basic properties,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and then 25 instances of that class that we've been scanning and searching over.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What I'd like you to do--this doesn't involve any SQL--

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
is implement this function link by ID.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That takes a link ID and will return

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
the link object itself.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So for example, if I gave it 24,

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
it would return this entire link object.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Use the global variable links to find this.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Okay, good luck.
