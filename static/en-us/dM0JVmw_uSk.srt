00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,070
One important aspect of distributed
shared memory systems is,

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,720
how do we determine where
a particular page is?

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,510
In order to do this the DSM component
has to maintain some metadata.

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,260
First, let's see how is a page
identified in this system in

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,990
the first place.

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,000
Well, the page has its address.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,460
And that may be some notion of
the node identifier plus the page

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,200
frame number locally at that node.

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,270
And we said that the node
identifier also identifies the home

10
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,750
node of the system.

11
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:33,240
Considering this address format then,
we see that the address itself

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,280
directly identifies what is
the manager node, the home node.

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,950
That knows everything about
that particular page.

14
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,700
Every single node in
the system just by looking

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,030
at the address of a particular page.

16
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:51,100
Can uniquely determine what is
the manager node for that page.

17
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,810
So it's as if the manager
information is available on

18
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,560
every single node in the system.

19
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:02,090
This could be captured via a global
map that has to be replicated

20
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:07,430
that will tell us how for
a particular object we find the manager.

21
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:11,640
What that means is that the information
about the manager is available on

22
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,170
every single node.

23
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,858
So it's as if the information
about the manager is

24
00:01:15,858 --> 00:01:17,650
available on every single node.

25
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:22,211
Since whenever any of the nodes in
the system wants to access a particular

26
00:01:22,211 --> 00:01:26,060
address, they just need to
look at the node identifier.

27
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,550
And we'll be able to get to the specific
manager, the specific home node for

28
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,760
that address.

29
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,061
This information, that captures
the translation from an identifier of

30
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:37,969
an object, a page in this case.

31
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:41,520
To the management node of that object.

32
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,680
Represents a global map.

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,620
And this needs to be replicated.

34
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,830
It needs to exist.

35
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,790
This information needs to be available
on every single one of the nodes.

36
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,080
Once we get to a particular manager,

37
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:58,355
that's the entity that will have
the per-page, or per-object, metadata.

38
00:01:58,355 --> 00:02:03,180
That's necessary in order to perform
this specific access to that page or

39
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,210
to enforce its consistency.

40
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:09,050
What this means is that in
the DSM system, the metadata for

41
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,465
individual objects or individual pages.

42
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:14,638
It's partitioned across
all of the home nodes.

43
00:02:14,638 --> 00:02:17,090
All of the management
nodes in the system.

44
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:22,220
But in order to quickly find where the
manager for a particular data item is.

45
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,390
It is necessary to maintain
an additional data structure,

46
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,670
a global map, that will be replicated
on every single one of the nodes.

47
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,930
That will in some way take an object
identifier and map it to that manager.

48
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:39,050
One final note,
in the example that we discussed so far.

49
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:42,430
We somehow implied that
certain bits from the address

50
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,420
are used to identify
the node identifier.

51
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,060
And that means that for
every single page,

52
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:54,040
there will be a fixed manager uniquely
identified from that page identifier.

53
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,680
If we want some additional flexibility,
we can take that object identifier and

54
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,670
then use it as an index
into a mapping table.

55
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:08,560
This mapping table is the one that
will be used at every single node for

56
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,000
the global map.

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,560
And every entry in that mapping table
will actually encode a manager node.

58
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,307
So for a particular object or
a particular page identifier,

59
00:03:19,307 --> 00:03:22,107
we will first index into
that mapping table.

60
00:03:22,107 --> 00:03:26,870
Using some bytes from the object id or
some hash function.

61
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,820
That's applied on top of this object id.

62
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,900
And then, the entry at the particular
location at the mapping table will tell

63
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,510
us what the manager node for
that page is.

64
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,360
What's nice about this approach is.

65
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,670
If for any reason, we want to
change who is the manager node for

66
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,950
a particular object or
of a particular page.

67
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,390
Whether the original manager field or

68
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:52,380
whether we need to rebalance
the system or any other reason.

69
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,110
We just need to update
the mapping table.

70
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,890
There is no need to consider
making any kind of changes for

71
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,290
the object identifier.

72
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:04,580
The object can remain identified
in the exact same way

73
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,997
as it was before we chose to make
a change into the manager nodes.
