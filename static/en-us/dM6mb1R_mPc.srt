1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Suppose you are sick,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
and you wake up with a strong pain

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
in the middle of the night.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You so sick that you fear you might die,

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
but you're not sick enough not to apply

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
the lessons of my Statistics 101 class

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
to make a rational decision whether to go to the hospital.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And in doing so, you consult the titer.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You find that in your town, over the last year,

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
40 people were hospitalized

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
of which 4 passed away.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Whereas the vast part of the population

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
of your town never went to the hospital,

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and of those, 20 passed away at home.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So compute for me the percentages

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
of the people who died in the hospital

17
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and the percentage of the people who died at home.
