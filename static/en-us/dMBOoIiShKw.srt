1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer is we don't need to resort to proof by intimidation in this case.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We can prove this by dividing by P i.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So what happens when we divide by P i?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Well the left side--we have this product of primes.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So we're going to still have this product of primes, now removing P i from the product.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
plus the 1 which is now divided by P i

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and we divided P i out of P i times Q so we have Q here.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This is our contradiction.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Q is an integer.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This is an integer.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
P i cannot be 1 because it's a prime.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It must be some integer 2 or greater.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So that means that this is not a whole number.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So there's no way we could get an integer as Q by adding something

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
that is not an integer to an integer.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Thus we've shown that there are infinitely many primes

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
by contradicting our assumption that there was a limited set of primes.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This isn't quite enough to be happy that we can generate large prime numbers when we need them.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We need to know how dense the primes are and how to find a large prime.
