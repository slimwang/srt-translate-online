1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,750
So take a moment now to download
the app from Github and

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,520
open it in Android Studio.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,140
See the instructor
notes if you need help.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:13,090
Spend some time learning your way around
the app, investigate the app code,

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:16,600
look at the layout and
the resources and the activities, and

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,840
make sure you know what the app
is doing and how it does it.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,400
And then, go ahead and run the app.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,470
You can use your own device, or you can
use the emulator in Android Studio.

9
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,730
What is for dinner?

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,200
Not beet soup, I hope.

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,500
Go ahead and
check the boxes when you're done.
