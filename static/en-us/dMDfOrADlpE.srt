1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
Let's summarize the remaining work left

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,110
to send the recorded audio file to the

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,370
View Controller where it will play sounds.

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,950
Specifically we’ll be sending the

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,869
file path where the recorded audio

6
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:10,439
was saved,

7
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:13,289
not the file in its entirety.

8
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:14,968
The file path will be all that we need when we

9
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:16,710
get around to playing the audio back.

10
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:24,899
Right now when recording is complete, the

11
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,910
file saved and the AVAudioRecorder

12
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,679
calls the audioRecorderDidFinishRecording,

13
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:30,839
because we set this View Controller

14
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:33,659
as its delegate. We then need

15
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,369
to call the stop recording segue and

16
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,469
send along with it the path to our

17
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:40,619
recorded sound. We add this line to the

18
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:42,090
audioRecorderDidFinishRecording

19
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,159
function, we can call the stop recording

20
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:46,649
Segue and send to it the path where the

21
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:49,890
recorded file is located. Here the path

22
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,719
is in the form of the URL, but it's

23
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,509
essentially a regular file path.

24
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:56,159
We should also note that the

25
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:58,259
audioRecorderDidFinishRecording receives a

26
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:00,840
flag indicating if saving the recording

27
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,869
was successful or not. We should read

28
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:05,909
that flag and if saving the recording

29
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:07,769
failed, we can print out a message to the

30
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:10,590
console. So let's clean this up a bit

31
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,438
with an if statement. If the successfully

32
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:15,959
flag is true, then we'll perform the

33
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:18,269
segue, otherwise we'll print out a

34
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:20,579
message that the recording failed.

35
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:23,040
Now we just need a way to inform the

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,719
View Controller we're transitioning to

37
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:27,209
that it has received the URL of the recorded

38
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:30,030
audio. Luckily for us, UIKit makes

39
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,530
this fairly simple, and I'll show you

40
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:37,549
that in the next step.
