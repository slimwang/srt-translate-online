Hello. You may not know this from looking at me, but I am plagued with an

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:10,225
unfortunate circumstance. You see, I'm nearsighted, which means the lenses in

3
00:00:10,225 --> 00:00:13,525
my eyes are a little, shall we say, overzealous, and they bend light just

4
00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:18,864
slightly too much. Since the light does not bend around my retina, my world is

5
00:00:18,864 --> 00:00:24,130
a blur. But of course, with every problem, there is a solution. By placing a

6
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:29,140
diverging lens in front of my eyes, I could fix my faulty vision. And to think

7
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:36,491
for years I was condemned to wearing glasses. Me. In glasses.

8
00:00:36,491 --> 00:00:37,814
[LAUGH]

9
00:00:37,814 --> 00:00:44,818
How passe! How cliche, I thought. I was as appalled then as I'm sure you are

10
00:00:44,818 --> 00:00:50,294
now, but, I did find a solution with Odin's eye monocles. With Odin's eye

11
00:00:50,294 --> 00:00:56,065
monocles, I can fix my vision with style, one eye at a time. It works with

12
00:00:56,065 --> 00:01:00,493
farsighted people, too. So, if I have trouble reading as I age, I can simply

13
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:05,980
buy a converging lens to fix that problem as well. But, I know what you might

14
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:10,567
be saying. What about your depth perception? How can you gauge distance if you

15
00:01:10,567 --> 00:01:14,908
only have one eye working at a time? Well, I laugh at your childish notion of

16
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:18,492
binocular depth perception, for I have discovered that monocular cues have

17
00:01:18,492 --> 00:01:23,146
served me just fine. By looking at the relative size of objects or taken

18
00:01:23,146 --> 00:01:27,540
advantage of linear perspective or interposition. I have been able to gauge

19
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,499
distance quite well. Quite well, indeed. >> [SOUND]

20
00:01:30,499 --> 00:01:34,020
>> Odin's eye. It worked for me. Will you let it work, for you?
