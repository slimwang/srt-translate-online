00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,883
Believe it or not, you're already a quarter of the way through the course.

2
00:00:03,883 --> 00:00:07,522
Excellent work. In the last unit, we learned about linear equations and

3
00:00:07,522 --> 00:00:11,778
inequalities. We looked at how they can be represented using tables, graphs, and

4
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:15,959
equations. In this unit, we'll continue that approach. We'll look at not just

5
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:19,953
one line, but two. Two lines or two linear equations are considered to be a

6
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:24,381
systems of equations. Let's try to make meaning of these systems of equations by

7
00:00:24,381 --> 00:00:28,387
renting a car. You're going to rent a car from a car company called Car-nival.

8
00:00:28,387 --> 00:00:32,296
You have $45 to spend on the car rental and Car-nival is going to charge $5 for

9
00:00:32,296 --> 00:00:36,127
a registration fee and $10 per hour for renting the car. So we're going to

10
00:00:36,127 --> 00:00:40,389
figure out what's the longest time you can rent the car. You might already be

11
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:44,578
able to solve this problem in your head, but we're going to try a different

12
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:46,910
approach. We're going to use systems.
