1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,410
Next we have affiliate marketing.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,100
This is a way for

3
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:08,560
a company to sell it's product by having
other people market it for a commission.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,170
If you join another company's affiliate
program, usually wanting to pay up front

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,810
only when people buy your product or
service through the other company.

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,060
For example,
say you're on a crafting blog and

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,290
you see a link to Amazon to
buy craft related products.

8
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,750
That is affiliate marketing in action.

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,510
If you were to buy what Amazon
was advertising on the blog,

10
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,630
you, the owner of the blog,
will get a percentage of the sale price.

11
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,880
There are businesses that are working
with thousands of affiliates.

12
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,940
And their lead generation
relies on these concepts.

13
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,790
Other businesses are playing
as the affiliate and

14
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,500
building their business
model as an affiliate.

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,090
For you to begin with,
if it's not your core business model,

16
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,670
you can start with a few partners
that can start as your affiliates and

17
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,860
you pay them per lead or per conversion.
