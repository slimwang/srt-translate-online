1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,750
One way of cheating on associativity
is called way prediction.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,840
We start with a set-associative
cache which has a low miss rate but

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,310
would have a slow hit time.

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:15,488
Now what we do, we guess which line
in the set is the most likely to hit.

5
00:00:15,488 --> 00:00:19,140
So what we do is we use the index
bits to determine which set should we

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,750
be looking at and now instead of reading
out all the tags in that line and

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,410
checking which one hits, we guess
which one is the likely to hit and

8
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,650
just check that one.

9
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,953
So this gives us the access
time similar to a direct-mapped

10
00:00:31,953 --> 00:00:33,485
cache if we guessed right.

11
00:00:33,485 --> 00:00:38,810
If we are wrong,
then we got no hit on the line we tried.

12
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,190
But the set has other lines, so

13
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,970
we try a normal set-associative check,
which will have a higher hit time.

14
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:51,870
So the idea is that, overall, our miss
rate is that of a set-associative cache.

15
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,980
We either find it this way or this way.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,230
So the miss rate will be
similar to a set-associative

17
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,300
cache because even if we didn't find
it in a kind of direct-mapped way,

18
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,210
we will find it this way.

19
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,210
But the hit time,
if our guesses are mostly right,

20
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,300
is mostly that of a direct-mapped cache.

21
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:14,030
So we have combined the low miss
rate of a set-associative cache with

22
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,850
most of the time getting the hit time of
a direct-mapped cache and sometimes only

23
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,000
having to suffer the longer hit time
of a normal set-associative cache.
