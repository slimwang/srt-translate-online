1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,120
So notice that in this approach we don't have a class model.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,190
We just started with the use cases.

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,230
And we're going to actually derive the class model from looking at

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:09,500
the use cases.

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,370
So let's look at the first use case, user presses the brew button and

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,150
play through what happens.

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,110
First off, which of the three classes,

8
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,540
which of these three classes receives this event from the hardware interface?

9
00:00:23,784 --> 00:00:25,100
Check the, check the one that applies.
