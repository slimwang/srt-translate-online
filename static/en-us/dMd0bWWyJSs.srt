00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,920
In order to assist our users, we should
give them helpful information when

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,130
the database is empty, and the screen
would otherwise display nothing.

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,460
We'll take advantage of
the built in capacity for

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,680
list view to display an alternate
view when the list is empty, so

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,600
our user doesn't see an empty screen.

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,870
This functionality is actually part
of the adapter view parent class.

7
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:24,710
Typically, you place the list view
into a frame layout that contains

8
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,600
the list view and an Empty View, and

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,550
then you call the set Empty View
method on your list view.

10
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:35,290
For now, add a No Weather Information
Available message to your application

11
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:39,670
when there is no data by using the set
empty view function on your list view.
