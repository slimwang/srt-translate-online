00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,850
Before we do some exercises,
I want you go back to x code and

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,200
open up the Maze project.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,790
Once you have it open, I want you
to navigate to the Move.swift file.

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:17,490
It's located under Maze > Under The Hood
> Maze Moves > Move.swift.

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,220
This is where we describe the move
struct, but it's just a single file and

6
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,490
that seems a little confusing.

7
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,080
Since the robot is
moving more than once,

8
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,490
don't we need more than one move struct
or more than one Move.swift file?

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,360
The answer is no.

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,030
Think back to the analogies we
used like engine blue prints.

11
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,560
And the blue prints of a particular
component was defined only once.

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,270
But actual instances of the component
will physically exist in tens and

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,110
thousands of actual engines.

14
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,900
And that's what this file is.

15
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,330
It's like the blue print for
the move struct.

16
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:55,431
We create this single blueprint as we
can see here, in the Move.swift file,

17
00:00:55,431 --> 00:01:00,230
and than we can create man instances
of the new struct in our application.

18
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:04,920
In programming lingo,
we'd call this blueprint a definition.

19
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,390
Or we would say that in the Move.swift
file, we define the move struct.
