1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,930
For incoming traffic,

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:07,430
the SPI in IPsec header is used
to look up the SA in SADB.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,010
And the packet is
unprocessed accordingly.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,150
Then the SPD is looked at to
make sure that the packet

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,670
had the proper security measures
according to the policy.

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,000
And only then,
the packet is delivered to that player.
