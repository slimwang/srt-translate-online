00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,380
A bit earlier you changed some
permissions on the authorized key file

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,030
and the .ssh directory using
a command called chmod.

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,090
But what exactly does that mean?

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:15,480
Let's dive a bit deeper into how
Linux manages file permissions.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,740
I've listed the contents of
the students' home directory.

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,060
And we're going to look at three
pieces of information provided here.

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,830
The first column we've
looked at briefly before.

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,040
Remember the d means
that this is a directory.

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,420
The dash means that it's a file.

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,610
Now, you might think that there are nine
additional spaces here for information,

11
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,810
but what's actually happening is
there are three separate sections and

12
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,460
each of those sections has
three pieces of information.

13
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,260
Let's break out this entry here for
bash.rc.

14
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:50,459
The three individual entries are rw-,
r--, and r--.

15
00:00:50,459 --> 00:00:52,580
Let's go ahead and
label each of these entries.

16
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:57,800
This first one I'm labeling owner,
then group, and finally everyone.

17
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,410
This means the owner can read and
write the file.

18
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:06,390
The dash here indicates that
the owner cannot execute the file.

19
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,980
If they could, there would be an x here.

20
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,290
Users within the group can read
this file, but they cannot write or

21
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:12,800
execute it.

22
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:18,920
Finally, everyone can read this file,
but they cannot write or execute it.
