1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,540
We mentioned previously CAMPS.

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,610
The first letter letter stands for
Culture.

3
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:04,939
What does that mean?

4
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:07,350
Huge inspiration for DevOps, is Agile.

5
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,600
And one of Agile's key points is,
people over process over tools.

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,280
You can have the most efficient product,
development, operations, and marketing

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,960
teams in the world, but if they do not
communicate, there's no feedback or

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,600
collaboration between teams, it can lead
to a huge waste of time and resources.

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,650
Lean is also a major inspiration for
DevOps culture.

10
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:29,940
Lean is centered on streamlining
operations, reducing waste,

11
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,080
with the end goal of
maximizing customer value.

12
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,320
Improving separate points in
the production pipeline is not enough,

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,340
you have to improve the whole flow.

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,500
Ever hear the phrase hurry up and wait?

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,920
Reminds me of traveling
on international flights.

16
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,780
Having a faster silo doesn't really
help in getting me to the plane quicker.

17
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,750
I usually just end up
waiting in the next line.

18
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,480
This is also true for DevOps.

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,870
If we focus on our
customers as the main goal,

20
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,045
it becomes an easy common ground for
all concerned parties.

21
00:00:56,045 --> 00:00:59,245
A great culture is also important,
fostering respect.

22
00:00:59,245 --> 00:01:00,755
You can also call it hug ops.

23
00:01:00,755 --> 00:01:04,885
When you can understand and you can
empathize on both Dev and Ops teams,

24
00:01:04,885 --> 00:01:08,185
you can really focus your
energies on positive outcomes.

25
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:11,495
Usually known as going to work thinking
how can I make this harder, but

26
00:01:11,495 --> 00:01:13,755
there are various reasons
as to why it happens.
