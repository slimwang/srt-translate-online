Using real coffee and then decaf coffee for the placebo is great. This way,

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:08,210
participants won't know if they're actually getting caffeine or not. This is

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:13,480
perfect for our single-blind study, because we as the researchers, know who is

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,514
getting what, but the participants don't know.
