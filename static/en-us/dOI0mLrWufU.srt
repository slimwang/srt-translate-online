1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,530
So to use an API, you generally have
to go through a couple of steps.

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,460
Typically, you have to sign up for

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,370
an account with the service,
if you don't have one already.

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,510
You have to register
the app you're making.

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,090
And later on, in order to make requests,

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,300
there's usually some sort of
authentication process involved.

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,830
In order to keep this setup simple for
now,

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,890
our Sleeping in the Library app
is going to use the Flickr API.

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,480
Unlike other similar services, Flickr's
API allows us to bypass a few of

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,150
the normal set up steps, requiring
us to only sign up and register.

11
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,520
We'll cover the parts skipped,
namely the authentication flow,

12
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,890
later in the course.

13
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,870
Signing up for a service like Flickr or
Yahoo is pretty straightforward, so

14
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,580
let's talk about registration.

15
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,970
When you register an app, you're usually
given what's called an API key and

16
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:41,660
sometimes additional keys as well.

17
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,250
That are used to uniquely
identify your app.

18
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,140
The reason for a service to want to
uniquely identify your app is so

19
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,330
that they can detect requests
coming from your app and

20
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,230
protect against apps that
are making too many requests.

21
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,980
This allows the service to ensure apps
don't do harmful stuff, like say,

22
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,630
flood the network with so many
requests that their server shuts down.

23
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,920
So you can see why these identification
keys would come in handy.

24
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,019
So let's get started using our API.

25
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,010
You'll want to sign up for a Yahoo
account if you don't have one already.

26
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,470
I know this part may be
a little bit annoying, but

27
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,260
trust me this does
make our lives simpler.

28
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,630
Click create an app,
then you'll want to get your API key.

29
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:21,135
You want to click non-commercial, since
we don't plan on making any money off on

30
00:01:21,135 --> 00:01:23,525
pictures of people
sleeping in the library.

31
00:01:23,525 --> 00:01:26,115
You'll then fill out these two fields,
and upon submitting,

32
00:01:26,115 --> 00:01:28,535
you'll receive a key and secret.

33
00:01:28,535 --> 00:01:31,005
I'm going to call this
Sleeping in the library.

34
00:01:38,293 --> 00:01:40,940
Copy these two values and
paste them somewhere safe.

35
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:41,620
You'll need them soon.

36
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,540
Lastly, you'll want
to take some time and

37
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,900
look around
the Flickr API Documentation.

38
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,880
This will give you an idea of some
of the methods that you could

39
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,680
potentially use.
