1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The correct answer of the 1 step is 3, 3, 3, and 3.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
For example, for cell A we can only get particles from B or C.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Those will come to A with a 50% chance each.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So 6 times 0.5 is 3 for A.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Each cell has exactly 6 particles in its total neighbors,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
so therefore, each of those cells gets a 3.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Asymptotically, this won't change. It's again 3, 3, 3, and 3.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I apologize it is a little bit misleading here that all these answers are the same number,

9
00:00:31,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but that's what this example gives us.
