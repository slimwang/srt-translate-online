1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And surprisingly, when you look at both majors together,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
you find that males have a much higher admissions rate than females.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm not making this up.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
These numbers might be fake, but that specific affect

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
was observed at the University of California at Berkley many years ago.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But when you look at majors individually,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
then you find in each major individually

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
the acceptance rate for females trumps

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
that of males, both in the first major and the second major.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Going from the individual major statistics to the total statistics,

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
we haven't added anything.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We just regrouped the data.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So how come, when you do this,

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
what looks like an admissions bias in favor of females

15
00:00:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
switches into admissions bias in favor of males?
