1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,719
In one way machine learning grew
out of artificial intelligence,

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:06,370
artificial intelligence was about
creating machines that were themselves,

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:07,870
as smart as humans.

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,470
And along the way the field diverged
into different schools of thought,

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,170
including cognitive system which is
focused on thinking like humans.

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:14,860
And machine learning,

7
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,980
which is focused on creating machines
that act autonomously in general.

8
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,000
Regardless of whether or
not they're thinking like humans do, so

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,620
to start our conversation
about machine learning,

10
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,490
let's talk a little bit about
artificial intelligence in general.

11
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,820
And where machine learning fits in, to
do this we're going to borrow from one

12
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,955
of the classes at Georgia Tech called
Knowledge-Based Artificial Intelligence.

13
00:00:31,955 --> 00:00:32,970
It's taught by Ashok Goel and I, and

14
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,560
the video that you're about to see
are covered very early in the course.

15
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,090
If you're interested you can find a link
to the full course in the instructor's

16
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:39,620
notes below.
