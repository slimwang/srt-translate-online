>> So this new equation was super fun to solve. It was great. We knew exactly

00:00:04,591 --> 00:00:09,576
what we were doing. But what if we change one little tiny thing? What if I make

3
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:14,527
this a negative 5, instead of a positive 5. The question I have for you is, is

4
00:00:14,527 --> 00:00:19,584
this an equation that we can solve? In other words, is this an equation at all?

5
00:00:19,584 --> 00:00:20,792
Tell me, yes or no.
