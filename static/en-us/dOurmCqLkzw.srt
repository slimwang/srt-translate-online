00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Congratulations on mastering nested environment frames and variable lookups.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
While it might seem a bit foreign now,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
this notion of looking up a variable in an environment

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
is very common in languages like PHP,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Ruby, JavaScript, or Python.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's how it's done in the real world.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Identifiers like home or friend

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
may not mean the same thing in all contexts.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
My home may not be the same as your home.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
My friends may not be the same as your friends.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
But we both have homes, and we both have friends.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This is an area where your intuition will really guide you to the right answer.
