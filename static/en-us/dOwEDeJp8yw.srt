00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,770
For the first project you'll build a

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,600
neural network to predict bike-sharing

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,330
rides. Imagine yourself owning a bike sharing

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,790
company like Cycle Hop. You want to

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,920
predict how many bikes you need because

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,750
if you have too few you're losing money

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,120
from potential riders. If you have too

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,250
many you're wasting money on bikes that

9
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,490
are just sitting around. So you need to

10
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,769
predict from historical data how many

11
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,779
bikes you'll need in the near future. A

12
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:26,609
good way to do this is with a neural

13
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,380
network which is exactly what you'll do.

14
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,869
In this notebook, you'll implement a

15
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:32,250
neural network and train it on

16
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,780
historical data to make predictions.

17
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,890
First, load and prepare the data. We

18
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,300
provided the code to prepare the data

19
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,280
but you'll be learning how to do all

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,469
this in a future lesson. So feel free to

21
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,300
read it over but you'll just need to run

22
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,320
through the code.

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,539
This is where you'll build your network.

24
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:50,700
We provided some of the code for the

25
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,770
network but you'll be implementing most

26
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,469
of it. And down here is where you'll

27
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:57,300
train the network and view its

28
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,430
performance as it's being trained.

29
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,410
Finally you'll compare your networks

30
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,420
predictions with actual data. If you

31
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,979
build your network right you should find

32
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:06,570
the network does a really good job, for

33
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,180
the most part. Right! It's time for you to get

34
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,320
started on your project.

35
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,650
Good luck!
