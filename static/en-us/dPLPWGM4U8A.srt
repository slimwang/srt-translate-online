00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,189
So, how would you use meta-reasoning to design an agent that can answer Raven's

2
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:06,240
progressive matrices? Throughout this course we've covered a wide variety of

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,030
different methods for addressing this test. And each method has its own

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,200
strength and its own weaknesses. Certain methods are better for some problems,

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,640
and other methods for other problems. Meta-reasoning will tell us, though,

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,330
that you don't have to choose just one. Your agent can have multiple methods to

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,300
choose from. Discuss how you might design an agent to have meta-reasoning.

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,330
What methods would it have to choose from?

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,950
How will it evaluate a new problem and decide what method is best for

10
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,030
that problem? How much improvement do you really expect to see in

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,970
your agent's performance based on equipping it with meta-reasoning? And finally,

12
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,530
will your agent engage in any kind of meta-meta-reasoning as we've discussed?

13
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,500
Will it not only think about the methods themselves but also about how it's

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,490
selecting a method? And if so, how will that improve it even further?
