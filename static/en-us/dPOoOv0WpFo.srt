00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,470
So let's see if we can figure what
the problems are with UMA aka SMP

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,530
aka Multicore.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,280
Let's suppose that we want
to have a lot of cores and

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:16,110
have them use this centralized
shared memory in a UMA SMP fashion.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:20,700
Which of these are problems we'll
have to face when we do this?

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:27,230
First, memory needs to be very large and
thus slow for this type of a machine.

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,700
Our main memory will get too
many accesses per second.

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,300
Basically, we'll need a huge memory
throughput that a normal memory module

9
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,150
will not be able to provide.

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,540
The next option is,

11
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:43,030
we'll need a lot of small memory modules
in proportion to the number of cores.

12
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:47,460
Next, our caches will have
very small block sizes.

13
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,340
And finally, the pages for

14
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,660
our virtual memory will become
too small to be usable.

15
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:57,380
So, select all of those that are
problems for this type of architecture.
