1
00:00:00,115 --> 00:00:04,240
Enter, scan, or more precisely, exclusive scan.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:16,170
Exclusive scan of this input is 0, 12, 46, 84, which is simply the exclusive sum scan of this input.

3
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,526
With this, we can answer the question--

4
00:00:18,526 --> 00:00:23,086
If I'm 170 cm tall, how many people are definitely shorter than me?

5
00:00:23,086 --> 00:00:25,407
And just look at the answer here.

6
00:00:25,407 --> 00:00:28,212
We know that 46 people are definitely shorter than me,

7
00:00:28,212 --> 00:00:31,735
out of the 100 people that we interviewed in front of Udacity headquarters.
