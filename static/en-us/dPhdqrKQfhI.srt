00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,140
I'd like to introduce some terminologies that we can talk more easily about the

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,364
different quantities we're dealing with. We'll call the amount of money that

3
00:00:09,364 --> 00:00:14,380
Grant initially invested in the account, the principal, which in Grant's case

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:20,831
is $10,000. We also already mentioned the interest rate before. And in Grant's

5
00:00:20,831 --> 00:00:26,215
case, this is 3%. Now, let's think back to the math that we were doing. In the

6
00:00:26,215 --> 00:00:35,000
expression, 10,000 times 1 plus 0.03. Where do the numbers 10,000 and 0.03 come

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,156
from? For each one, please pick one of these choices. The number of years the

8
00:00:41,156 --> 00:00:46,007
money is invested, the number of times interest is compounded per year, the

9
00:00:46,007 --> 00:00:50,704
interest rate as a percentage per year, the interest rate as a decimal per

10
00:00:50,704 --> 00:00:57,493
year, the principal or the number of months in a year.
