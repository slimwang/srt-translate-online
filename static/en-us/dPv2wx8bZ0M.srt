00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,250
So in the last slide I kind of talked about that images basically have a lot of

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,540
numerical values that we can actually be traversing around on a matrix and

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:09,550
a regular grid.

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,660
Now let's look at what we can do with that kind of stuff.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,490
One of the things I want us to think about is the whole concept of

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,000
an image histogram.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,150
An image histogram basically measures the statistics of the image.

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,960
In terms of all of the gray values that exist in that image.

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,040
So imagine if I could.

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,600
As I have created a bin which has values of 0 to 255.

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,150
And every time I will scan through this image.

12
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,250
And every time I'll say, come down to the first one.

13
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:41,390
I see the value of intensity is let's say 120, I will put one there.

14
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,920
And then I will go find another one maybe 125.

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,630
I might move around and, and

16
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:50,450
basically it starts mentioning how many pixels have a value of let's say 200?

17
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,050
How many pixels have a value of 100?

18
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:56,990
And that will start of kind of creating a histogram of that image and

19
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,480
kind of start giving you statics of that image.

20
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,630
And this basically is what this image's histogram looks like.

21
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,380
With a peak here, comes down, and closes this way.

22
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,200
Now interesting thing to note is there're not a lot of full 100% white values

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,640
here, and if you look at this image, you might actually see that to be true.

24
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,920
There's a few zeros, dark values here.

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,580
But most of the information is right in the middle.

26
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,072
Now of course, we don't have to do this for the entire image.

27
00:01:23,072 --> 00:01:26,880
Now the things to note is that we can actually do statistics on the whole image.

28
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,150
We can compute the average for the entire image.

29
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,290
You can compute the median, or

30
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,820
any other kind of statistical, statistical information for that image.

31
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,220
The scope of this need not be the entire image.

32
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,726
I could just say is I want to do it for this box.

33
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:44,310
Or I want to actually, even if I could figure out how to come up with this,

34
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,760
just this region, what would be the statistics of this, or just the,

35
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,380
you know, pixels associated with that eye.

36
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,220
Of course, I would have to find the scope,

37
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,880
the range of that region to be able to do those computations in.

38
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,790
But that entirely depends on us.

39
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,380
This histogram of course is for the entire image.

40
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:08,020
But of course, in the, histograms could also be for specific ranges.

41
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,560
I could do one for this region, this region, this region.

42
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,420
And again it basically starts giving me information about what is the range of

43
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,670
information, of the pixel values, the intensities for that specific subpart.

44
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,970
It could be region-based, and of course it could be channel-based.

45
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,560
Now I haven't actually introduced concept of channels yet, but

46
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,290
that's coming soon.
