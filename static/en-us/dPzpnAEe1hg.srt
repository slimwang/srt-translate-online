1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,210
Alright Charles, you were about to say, how we could do this.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:10,150
>> I think the answer is, simply, that we basically need to flip the, here's

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,480
my thinking. We need to flip zero and

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,340
one, which suggests that either our weight or

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,870
our threshold needs to be negative. And since we, we The threshold is in above,

6
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:25,345
it's going to end up being our weight being negative. So, lets say, if we have a

7
00:00:25,345 --> 00:00:28,010
zero, we want to turn that into something above

8
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,360
the threshold and if it's a one, we

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,430
want it to be below the threshold. So,

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,220
why don't we make the weight negative one.

11
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:34,330
>> Okay.

12
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,058
>> And that, that turn a zero into a zero

13
00:00:37,058 --> 00:00:40,750
and it will turn a one into a minus one. Alright.

14
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,350
>> And so, then the threshold just has to be zero.

15
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,730
>> So that would mean that anything,

16
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,420
I see, so anything that's negative will be

17
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,230
greater than, zero or negative would be greater than

18
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,820
or equal to the threshold. And anything on the other

19
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,290
side of that. would be under the threshold. So

20
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,890
we get this kind of dividing line at one, so

21
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,500
were taking advantage of the fact the equation had

22
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,790
a greater than or equal to in it. So, yeah,

23
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,003
right, that ought to be a Not. So ,we've got

24
00:01:11,003 --> 00:01:16,020
And, Or, and Not are all expressible, as perceptron units.

25
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,470
So and, or, and not are all expressible as perceptron units.

26
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,140
>> Hey that's great because if we have AND,

27
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,270
OR, and NOT, then we can represent any Boolean function.

28
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,890
>> Well, do we know that? We know that

29
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,990
if we combine them together, we combine these perceptron units

30
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,800
together Can we, can we express any perceptron, oh sorry,

31
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,020
any boolean function that we want using a single perception?

32
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,310
>> So, what do we normally do in this case?

33
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,420
So ,what's the most evil function we can think of?

34
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,340
>> Yes indeed, we'll when we're woking on, on decision trees The

35
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,760
thing that was so evil was the XOR, the called parity more generally.

36
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,310
>> Right.

37
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,620
>> So, alright. I mean, may, maybe if we can do

38
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,790
that, we can do anything. So, let's, let's give it a shot.
