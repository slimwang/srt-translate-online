1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,180
So this, is my exposure triangle, shutter speed, aperture, ISO.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,590
By changing the aperture,

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:11,240
we can actually can impact the depth of field, increasing ISO,

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:17,010
we get more grain, and decreasing the shutter speed, we can get motion blur.

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,370
So, it's a combination of these three things,

6
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:23,690
that allows you to explore how we can actually, best take the pictures we want.

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,703
So, aperture opening, is one of the parameters we want to to control,

8
00:00:27,703 --> 00:00:30,990
shutter speed, that is how long do I want to keep the shutter open to

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,870
get the amount of light in, to my sensor is something I want to do, and

10
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,820
once it hits the sensor, I want to actually know more about the sensitivity of

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,220
the film, or, the digital sensor that we're using.

12
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,650
And again, photographers basically optimize these based on

13
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,850
their experience to get a desired exposure.

14
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,060
On the website for this class,

15
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,920
I'm going to put a small applet that actually people at Stanford built,

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,730
that will let you explore, the variability of the these three to be able to

17
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,070
get the best exposure in a synthetic kind of a play around mode.
