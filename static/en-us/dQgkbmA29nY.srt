1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,800
The first one, 4n²-300n+12 € O(n²) because n² is the fastest growing term. So it's correct.

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,830
And it's also the best possible bound because we have n² here as the fastest growing term,

3
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,630
which is exactly the same that we wrote here.

4
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:24,790
The second one is also correct because n³ grows faster than n², but it's not the best possible bound

5
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:29,380
we can give because we already found out that n² is the best possible bound that we can give.

6
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:38,790
Now down here 3ⁿ+5n²-3ⁿ grows much faster than n² so this is not true and of course it cannot be the

7
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,350
best possible bound if it's not a correct bound at all.

8
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:47,540
In the next one, 3ⁿ is the fastest growing term and this is exactly what we're setting on the right here

9
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,370
so it's correct and it's also the best possible bound that we can give.

10
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,920
The next one, again, the bound is correct.

11
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,000
This is similar to here when we compared n³ to n²

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,430
so 4ⁿ grows much faster than 3ⁿ, but again, it's not the best possible bound

13
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,740
because we already know that 3ⁿ is the best possible bound that we can give.

14
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,830
This one down here is similar to one of the examples that I just showed you,

15
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:19,590
so we can ignore the constant here and 2ⁿ(n²) grows faster than 2ⁿ so this is not correct.

16
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,300
And since it's not correct, it cannot be the best possible bound.

17
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:30,990
Now, this one down here is probably a little bit tricky because 2.1ⁿ indeed grows faster than

18
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,750
2ⁿ(n²) so if you plot those two functions

19
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:43,910
you can see that 2.1ⁿ will outgrow this part here, 2ⁿ(n²), so it is a correct bound

20
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,990
but it is not the best possible one

21
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:54,550
because the best possible one would be 2ⁿ(n²) and not 2.1ⁿ, which grows much faster.

22
00:01:54,550 --> 00:02:00,980
So, as you can see, O notation is simply about looking at which part of the function grows

23
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:06,960
the fastest and then it's a very convenient way of actually describing the growth of that function while

24
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,770
ignoring details that are a bit distracting and

25
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,480
not necessary for the analysis that we are going to do in this course.

26
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,000
Now, there's one final note I should make.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:28,970
Some people instead of writing f(n) € O(g(n)) also write f(n) = O(g(n)) and sometimes but this is

28
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:33,500
not very common people will also write it as if it were a subset.

29
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:38,400
So they would use the symbol here and say subset contained in O(g(n)).

30
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,700
This here is probably the most correct way to state it because O(g(n)) is actually

31
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,350
a set of functions if you were to consider it mathematically.

32
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:53,400
But this one appear = O(g(n)) is also a very common one that you can also find in many

33
00:02:53,400 --> 99:59:59,999
scientific papers and even teaching books.
