Just to help us practice with this,

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:07,360
I'm going to give you a couple of interesting quiz questions.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,860
Here is my input image.

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,600
I have a box kernel like this.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,490
And the goal is for

6
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:18,080
you to figure out what would be the output of cross-correlation or convolution.

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,180
Check the boxes of the right answers, which could be either this or

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,470
this for cross-correlation, or convolution would be one this one.
