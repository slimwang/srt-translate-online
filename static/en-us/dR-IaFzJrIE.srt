1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,870
Let me use this concept to introduce
the basic premise of what is called

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:04,540
Image Morphing.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,600
Here, you basically see,
now a sequence of images generated,

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,900
to be able to go from one frame to
the other, which we actually captured

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,490
separately the rest of them were
basically generated, on their own.

6
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,980
So, this created and animation
that basically changes all morphs.

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:23,970
One image, and

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,750
it could be shaped also into another
through a seamless transition.

9
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,920
This is widely used in movies and

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,760
is actually a very well known concept
in even trying to understand shapes.

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,330
And in fact this very famous
book I recommend anybody

12
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,710
who's interested in shape and
form to look at this,

13
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,490
that talks about biological phenomenon
that could be tested to this.

14
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:47,130
And talks about we can, basically,
take a simple surface like this.

15
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,460
And by changing the regions and
the warp itself, generate other types

16
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,010
of fish that actually, you know,
have the same kind of structure but

17
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,340
of course, now have different shapes and
stuff like that.
