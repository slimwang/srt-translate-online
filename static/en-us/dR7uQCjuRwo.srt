We're going to focus in on this idea of opposite polynomials. For two polynomial

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,185
expressions to be opposite, every corresponding pair of terms must opposite in

3
00:00:09,185 --> 00:00:14,251
sign. We know addition is commutative so we can rewrite these terms by adding

4
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:18,486
the opposite. I'll move the negative x squared to the front, the 3x to the

5
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:22,990
middle, and the negative 8 to the end. Notice that when we move these terms

6
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,434
around, we just keep the sign with it. The three x's are positive, the eight is

7
00:00:27,434 --> 00:00:32,110
still negative and the x squared is also still negative. Now we can definitely

8
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,026
see that these two polynomials are opposites. The x squared terms are opposites

9
00:00:36,026 --> 00:00:39,933
since one is positive and the other is negative. The three x's are opposites

10
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:43,837
since one is negative and the other is positive And the eights are opposites,

11
00:00:43,837 --> 00:00:48,030
since the first one's positive and the second one's negative. And the neat part

12
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,650
about opposite polynomials and rational expressions is that they simplify to

13
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,940
negative1 . We can think about factoring a negative 1 from each of these terms.

14
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,960
So we'll have negative 1. Times the opposite sign of all those terms in the

15
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,037
denominator. The numerator will just stay the same and we can think about

16
00:01:05,037 --> 00:01:09,696
multiplying it by a positive 1. Here we have a common factor in the numerator

17
00:01:09,696 --> 00:01:14,072
and a denominator, so this all equals 1. And finally, since we have this

18
00:01:14,072 --> 00:01:18,426
negative sign down in the denominator, our answer simplifies to negative 1.
