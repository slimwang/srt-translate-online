1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,839
This is not an easy question.

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,359
So let's actually make a table
with the values of these equations

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,850
on each of the four points.

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,679
Here we have the four
points on the top row.

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,660
And now, each of the other rows
will be one of the functions.

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,660
Here's x + y.

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:21,471
We fill in the first row as follows,
0 plus 3 equals,

8
00:00:21,471 --> 00:00:27,100
1 plus 2 equals 3, 2 plus 1 equals 3,
and 3 plus 0 equals 3.

9
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:30,289
So, we see that x + y, or

10
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:34,418
the sum of the two coordinates is 3 for
each one of the points.

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,850
For the second row we see that
the products are 0 times 3 equals 0 for

12
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,055
the first one.

13
00:00:42,055 --> 00:00:45,224
1 times 2 equals 2 for the second.

14
00:00:45,225 --> 00:00:51,956
2 times 1 equals 2 for the third, and
3 times 0 equals 0 for the fourth.

15
00:00:51,956 --> 00:00:56,441
And for the last one x squared
we see that 0 squared equals 0,

16
00:00:56,441 --> 00:01:01,630
1 squared equals 1, 2 squared equals 4,
and 3 squared equals 9.

17
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,670
So let's think, which of these equations
separates the green and the red points.

18
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,740
We look at the sum x + y and
that gives us 3 at every value, so

19
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:15,079
it doesn't really separates them.

20
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:21,459
If we look at x squared, so the first
coordinates squared, we get 0 and 9 for

21
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:25,089
the red values and 1 and
4 for the green values.

22
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:29,974
This one also doesn't separate them
since the red values are small and

23
00:01:29,974 --> 00:01:34,134
large 0 and 9 and
the green values are in between 1 and 4.

24
00:01:34,134 --> 00:01:37,064
So we look at the product xy and
that gives us 0 for

25
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:40,039
the red values, and
2 for the green ones.

26
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,800
So, it seems that this one does a job,
right?

27
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,739
Since it’s a function that gives
us one value for the red point and

28
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,729
another value from
the green points then,

29
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,719
it’s a function that can tell red and
green apart.

30
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:54,759
So, if you said xy, that is correct.

31
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,750
That is the magic equation we'll use.

32
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:02,990
So let's see, here we have our 4
points with coordinates x,y and

33
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,634
a products of the coordinates xy.

34
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:12,602
So for the, red points x, y,
we have that the product xy = 0.

35
00:02:12,602 --> 00:02:18,066
And for the green points, x, y,
we have that the product xy = 2.

36
00:02:18,066 --> 00:02:20,367
And what separates a 0 and a 2?

37
00:02:20,367 --> 00:02:26,774
Well, a 1, so
the equation xy = 1 will separate them.

38
00:02:26,774 --> 00:02:29,640
And what is xy = 1?

39
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:33,039
It's the same as y = 1/x,
and the graph for

40
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,429
y = 1/x is precisely
this hyperbola over here.

41
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,960
That is the curve we wanted.

42
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:43,949
Okay, now let's look at what
happens in three dimensions.

43
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:49,074
And we recall that our magic equation,
which will separate the points is xy.

44
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:57,609
So we have our points with coordinates
(0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1), and (3, 0).

45
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,974
And here we have a copy of the plane
with an extra axis, the axis z, for

46
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:02,590
height.

47
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:07,929
So let's add this magic equation,
xy, to our core needs.

48
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,969
In other words, let's consider the map
from two dimensions to three dimensions,

49
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:19,080
which takes the point in the plane with
coordinates (x, y) to the point in space

50
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,750
with coordinates( x, y, xy).

51
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:30,582
This map says the point (0,
3) to the point (0, 3, 0).

52
00:03:30,582 --> 00:03:35,507
The point (1, 2) to the point (1, 2, 2).

53
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:40,227
The point (2, 1) to the point (2, 1, 2).

54
00:03:40,227 --> 00:03:44,490
And the point (3, 0),
to the point (3, 0, 0).

55
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:48,358
So in a different way, it still
separates the point since it sends

56
00:03:48,358 --> 00:03:53,039
the green points up by 2, and
it leaves the red points underneath.

57
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,449
Now what could separate these points?

58
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:56,989
Well a plane could do it.

59
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:00,610
This is the way to visualize
the kernel trick in three dimensions.
