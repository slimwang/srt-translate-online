1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,460
So we have this initiation set.

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:03,510
So that's places where it's, let's say,

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:09,030
legally reasonable to actually execute
this option or this abstract action.

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,710
Similarly, we have termination sets.

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:17,801
And a termination set is not the set
of states where an option may be ended,

6
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:21,349
it's actually a generalization of that.

7
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:23,345
It's a set of probabilities.

8
00:00:23,345 --> 00:00:27,829
So, it maps states to a number,
which is the probability that

9
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:31,984
the option will end in that state,
or can end that state.

10
00:00:31,984 --> 00:00:32,577
>> I think that makes it sense.

11
00:00:32,577 --> 00:00:35,335
So they're both they're
both kind of sets but

12
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:38,103
this is kind of a more
soft general kind of set.

13
00:00:38,103 --> 00:00:40,678
And is it saying that no matter what,

14
00:00:40,678 --> 00:00:45,829
when the option gets to one of those
termination states a coin is flipped,

15
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:49,690
and if it comes up heads
then the option's done?

16
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:54,580
>> I think from the point of view of the
person sitting outside the option, yes.

17
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:58,150
Inside the option it's
not quite done that way.

18
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,980
It's not like the option is running and
it's always flipping a coin.

19
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,120
This is more sort of a a way of
describing the fact that something

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,410
can end in a particular state.

21
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,955
Now, of course, you could turn this
into a set by putting a probability of

22
00:01:10,955 --> 00:01:13,840
0 over all the states,
where you don't want it end and

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,070
having a probability of 1 exactly
where you want it to end.

24
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,640
>> I see, so that's a sense in which
it's a generalization of that idea?

25
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,110
>> Right, exactly.

26
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:25,554
But basically, I'm going to execute this
action starting from one of the states

27
00:01:25,554 --> 00:01:26,102
in set I.

28
00:01:26,102 --> 00:01:27,850
And it's going to run and

29
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:32,740
it will in end up in some state
when the option terminates.

30
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,570
And this gives me a probability
of it being in one particular

31
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:36,520
state or the other.

32
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,536
So all an action is, is it's,
well you're in a state,

33
00:01:39,536 --> 00:01:42,760
you take an action and
you end up in another state.

34
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,980
But since we're talking about
these temporally abstract options,

35
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,600
things that happen over time,

36
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,470
we need to know what's happening
inside the option while it's running.

37
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,900
And we already have a term for that.

38
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,190
It's called a policy.

39
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,460
So, here we have a generalization
of the way we've been talking about

40
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,295
policies in a way.

41
00:01:59,295 --> 00:02:04,207
Within an option of policy is more than
just a mapping from states to action.

42
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:10,490
Here, it's a probability of being in
a state and taking a particular action.

43
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,898
But again,
we could turn that into a normal policy,

44
00:02:12,898 --> 00:02:14,760
as we've mostly been talking about it,

45
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,181
by just having a probability of 1 over
the action that we're going to take.

46
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:20,991
And 0 zero over everything else.

47
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:23,860
And then it is just a direct simple
mapping from state to action.

48
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:28,030
>> Like a deterministic
Markov memoryless policy?

49
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,970
>> Thingamajiggy, yes, exactly right.

50
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,530
But, anyway, this is a formalism, but
I think it sort of is just trying to

51
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:38,260
capture this idea of, as you say, kind
of a procedure or a function that runs.

52
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,351
There are places where you
can execute the function.

53
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:44,166
There are states where you'll end up
after you've executed the function.

54
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,029
And there are things that
are happening inside the function.

55
00:02:46,029 --> 00:02:48,895
The code itself is the policy.

56
00:02:48,895 --> 00:02:50,179
It's the actions that you're going to

57
00:02:50,179 --> 00:02:51,680
take in the states that
you're going to see.

58
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,755
>> Hm, okay.

59
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,655
>> Okay, so
let's see what we can do with that.
