00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,330

00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,840
You need to pair your wearable
to your phone or tablet.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,170
You need to set up ADB to both devices.

5
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,560
You need to create a new phone and
wear project.

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,980
You need to build and
install it to the phone or tablet.

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,390
