1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Norvig] Within a class of 5 properties,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
the class must cover the 5 houses but in any order.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
How many ways can we make that assignment?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In other words, here's 5 houses, here's 5 properties in a property group,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and here's 1 possible assignment.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
How many different assignments are there of assigning these properties

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and matching them up with the houses?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Are there just 5 ways, 5 squared ways, 2 to the 5th ways, or 5 factorial ways?
