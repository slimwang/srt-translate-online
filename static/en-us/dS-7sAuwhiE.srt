00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,526
Now, remember from the sense Olympics, we discussed the basic process involved

2
00:00:03,526 --> 00:00:07,912
in sensation and perception. And we see that our sensory memory system is quite

3
00:00:07,912 --> 00:00:12,016
clear cut. Remember that our sensory neurons take information from external

4
00:00:12,016 --> 00:00:16,570
stimuli and our sensory organs to different parts of the brain. Recall that

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,665
sensation travels to the thalamus, which then relays a sensor information to

6
00:00:20,665 --> 00:00:25,952
the cerebral cortex where it gets further processed. Three out of our five

7
00:00:25,952 --> 00:00:30,990
sensory systems have a specific cortex for processing sensory stimuli.
