1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,960
This is a somewhat trivial example so
the answer yes.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,170
This is a sequentially
consistent execution.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,280
Any of the updates in the system
are all performed from processor one.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,040
We know that sequential consistency
requires that all of the updates from

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,320
a single processor,
that they be visible in the same order.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,900
And if we take a look at P2, yes indeed.

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,380
The fact that the memory location m3
was updated to value y only becomes

8
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:32,500
visible after we have seen that on P2
that the value of m1 has become x.

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:40,100
If we had a situation where these reads
here to m1 were still returning zero.

10
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,110
So, this write was not visible however,
this read from m3

11
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:50,390
already returned y so this write became
visible that would've been the problem,

12
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,600
but that's not the case
in this scenario.

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,900
So this is the correct answer.
