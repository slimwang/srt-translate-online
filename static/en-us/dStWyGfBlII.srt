1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,860
So one of the brilliant things
designers do is produce designs.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,010
They can also help you with one
of the other more important parts

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,910
of the process,
which is choosing between those designs.

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,190
So, Jonathan,
what are some best practices for

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,410
making decisions between
designs using user feedback?

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:19,941
>> Sure, I like to think of it as three
sort of different general areas of your

7
00:00:19,941 --> 00:00:25,000
designs, when you're thinking about how
to structure your app or your website.

8
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,400
So we have information architecture,

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,730
which is sort of the way that things are
structured, and the sort of the flow.

10
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,580
There's also interaction design,
which is whether or

11
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:40,860
not it's easy to find a button
on your page or your app.

12
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,380
And then there's also the design
element or the visual design.

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:51,750
The visual design allows a user
to give feedback on the appeal,

14
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,550
or the color scheme, or
other elements within your design.

15
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,360
So thinking a bit within
these three general areas

16
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,480
gives you sort of the ability to sort
of ask the questions that you want to

17
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,300
get good feedback from your design.

18
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,070
<< Okay, so as an example we had

19
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:13,970
feedback in our original paper prototype
that our structure was confusing, you

20
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,720
just couldn't actually check things off
in that from information architecture.

21
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,490
And then we also had feedback that the
frequent action button was good size,

22
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,460
and so
that would be like interaction design.

23
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,140
>> Exactly.
>> And

24
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,250
then we also had feedback that our
check boxes were hard to find, or

25
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,180
not visually appealing.

26
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,990
And so that would be visual design.

27
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,580
>> Correct.

28
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,220
Yeah.

29
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,670
All those elements combined
together I think are essentially

30
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,350
the concept or
some experts call the conceptual design.

31
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:46,230
But all those aspects are fundamental
to the design of your app.

32
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:51,080
And you want to be thinking about all
three as you are developing your app.

33
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,590
>> Okay.

34
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,850
So let's say we've got
a designer who's given us

35
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,580
two different visual designs for
an element.

36
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:01,060
Let's say they've given us a button
that is designed one way and

37
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,660
a button that is designed another way.

38
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:06,070
How would we go about using user
research to choose between those?

39
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,220
>> Sure.

40
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,220
So you can do two types of studies.

41
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,320
One, you can run through
a group of users, like two or

42
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:18,160
three users where you show button A then
you show button B and you ask for

43
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,070
them to provide feedback on that set.

44
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,580
Then in a separate study,
you can do it for

45
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,890
a separate group of users
showing button D, then button A.

46
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:31,000
You can compare your notes from both
of those studies to find out which

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,840
is the best button to use.

48
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,010
>> And do users tend to prefer
the one they see first generally, or

49
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,110
the one they see last generally?

50
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,280
Or is it not as clear as all that?

51
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,760
>> It's not always that clear and
simple.

52
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,020
Oftentimes you want to get
a user's initial reactions.

53
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,300
But showing them close together
really helps give them

54
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,710
a visual cue to telling you whether or
not it's something they really enjoy.

55
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,660
>> Okay.

56
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,280
One of the things we just used
as an example was there's button

57
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:58,900
A and there's button B.

58
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,470
What happens if the designer gives
you five or ten button designs?

59
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:07,700
Do you still test all of those at once
or do you test just two at a time?

60
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,340
>> Yeah, that's a great question.

61
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:15,090
I think it's really important to be
thinking about can the user achieve

62
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,780
what you're intending them
to achieve with your design.

63
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,730
So, it can be ten buttons or
it can be 15 buttons, but

64
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:29,600
can they achieve what the intended task
or objective is with your designs?

65
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,350
So, if the designer presents you
with many different buttons,

66
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,650
it may be helpful just to kind
of trim it down a little bit.

67
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:43,420
But, if you have that many buttons in
order to achieve the intended task,

68
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,860
you may still need to test on all of
those buttons being available there.

69
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,300
>> So it sounds like it's best to

70
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,790
compare these buttons
in separate studies.

71
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,500
It also sounds likes it's best to think
about all three levels of design,

72
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,750
when you're thinking about
alternate designs for your app.

73
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,590
>> Yeah.
That's right.

74
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,900
And I think you sort of hit
the nail on the head when you say,

75
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,280
thinking about all three levels.

76
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,450
Thinking about all three levels
really encompasses the heart or

77
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:15,260
the concept or the conceptual
design aspect of your app.

78
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,000
You should really be doing something

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,040
that enables a user to do
something that they love to do.

80
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,500
And that's really the heart
aspect of your app.

81
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,520
Something that I always really
enjoy talking about too.

82
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,920
>> Awesome,
thank you again for coming in.

83
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,760
I appreciate it.

84
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,260
>> Thank you.
