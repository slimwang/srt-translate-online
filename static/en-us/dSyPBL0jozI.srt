1
00:00:00,071 --> 00:00:01,627
This is the one I would pick and the reason,

2
00:00:01,627 --> 00:00:04,941
if it’s twice as likely to be born before noon,

3
00:00:04,941 --> 00:00:07,357
it means the density in the morning, before

4
00:00:07,357 --> 00:00:10,108
noon, should be twice as high as the density

5
00:00:10,108 --> 00:00:12,624
in the afternoon. And that’s best depicted by

6
00:00:12,624 --> 00:00:14,758
this diagram over here. This one would be

7
00:00:14,758 --> 00:00:17,206
uniform so ignoring the fact that it’s twice

8
00:00:17,206 --> 00:00:18,977
as likely. And, this is even worse; it

9
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:22,000
emphasizes the afternoon over the morning.
