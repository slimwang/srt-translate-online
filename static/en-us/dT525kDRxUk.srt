1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,670
Now let's draw this a little bit longer.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,200
Again I'm going to ask you 2 questions here.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,730
The first one is again that I would like to know from you

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:12,660
the length of a shortest path from A to B that visits all vertices.

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,930
Please enter this here in this box.

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:21,040
I would also like to know from you how many different shortest paths there are from A to B.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 99:59:59,999
I would like you to enter your number here in this box.
