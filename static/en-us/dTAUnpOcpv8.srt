00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,204
Nice work!

2
00:00:01,204 --> 00:00:05,270
You should have found all of
the functions in your app.js file.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,900
The function that gets the weather
forecast from the API is called

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,120
getForecast.

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,180
The function that updates the forecast
card with the weather data is

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,340
updateForecastCard.

7
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:22,089
The function that hides and shows
the Add City dialog is toggleAddDialog.

8
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:27,730
And there are two buttons that
have aria-labels in index.html.

9
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,720
Building accessibility into your
progressive web app is an important

10
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,470
part of the process and not something
that can be tacked on at the end.

11
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,610
Be sure to check out the web
accessibility course
