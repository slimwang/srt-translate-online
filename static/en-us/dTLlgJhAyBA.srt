00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,220
Looking at our TV sales XLSX, you can
see the number of toothbrushes sold

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,440
in column B will now calculate
the first difference in column C.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,420
The first difference of a time series
is a series of changes from one period

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,430
to the next.

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,750
To calculate this, you take the value
in the current time period and

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,320
subtract it by the value
in the previous period.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,230
This difference will provide us a look
at whether we have a constant mean and

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,970
variance overtime.

9
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,030
Plotting the different series in
a time series plot, we can see that

10
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,940
the difference revolves around
the constant mean of almost zero and

11
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,400
has a relatively constant variance.

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,170
If the first difference of the series is
unable to transform the data stationary,

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,130
we would calculate the second
difference, third difference and so

14
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,270
on until the series is
rendered stationary.

15
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,680
Note that the second difference is not
the difference from two periods ago,

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,010
rather it is the first difference of
the first difference as calculated here.

17
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:56,830
The third, fourth, fifth difference,
etc., would be calculated the same way.
