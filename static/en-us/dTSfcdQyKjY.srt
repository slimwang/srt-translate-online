00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,695
We had the problem that simply calling display inside the display method

2
00:00:03,695 --> 00:00:07,280
couldn't possibly work, it would just call the method itself and itself, and

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,510
itself. The way to get the super class method involved, which displays the

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:17,956
question text, is simply to use the keyword super. This will work. Now the

5
00:00:17,956 --> 00:00:24,634
program correctly shows, first the text of the question and then the list of

6
00:00:24,634 --> 00:00:27,215
choices.
