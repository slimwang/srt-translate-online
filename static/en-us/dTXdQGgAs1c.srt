When I'm on my tumblr blog page,
I'm asking the tumbler servers

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,270
to get all the data associated with
my account to load on my computer.

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,178
So this process is a Get Request.

4
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:16,381
If I were to create a new blog post,
that would be a Post Request because I'm

5
00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:19,400
submitting data to be stored
in the tumblr database.

6
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,750
Remember, with a Get Request,
you're getting information, and

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,570
with a Post Request, you're posting it.

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,938
Now let's hear from Andy about
