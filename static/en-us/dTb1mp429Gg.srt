1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,252
So, it was great to hear from a real user and to hear her describe her

2
00:00:03,252 --> 00:00:05,291
attributes, use cases, and see how that really

3
00:00:05,291 --> 00:00:07,630
played into the feature that she loved the most.

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:08,980
>> Yeah and let's look at dorm room

5
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,210
Debbie again. We have her attributes and use cases

6
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,780
here. What features do you think she would like,

7
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,210
in her perfect pizza ordering application? Do you think

8
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,690
she would like to split the bill? Do

9
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,190
you think she'd like delivery? Or pick-up? Would she

10
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,500
be into coupons? Or would she want to know

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,915
the name of the farmer that made the dough?

12
00:00:24,915 --> 00:00:27,000
[LAUGH]. Or would she want multiple payment

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,960
options? Or perhaps hi-res photos of the ingredients?

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,830
>> So check all that apply that would make the perfect feature list for Debbie.
