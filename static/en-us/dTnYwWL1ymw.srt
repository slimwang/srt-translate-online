00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,960
Downloading code into the kernel and secure binding, how is this secure? This is

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:12,170
a bit dicey. Here, the library operating system is given an ability to

3
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,910
drop code into the kernel. The rationale

4
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,360
is purely a performance one. Namely, avoid

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,520
border crossings. But obviously it can be

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,320
a serious security loophole. Even in spin

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,340
we've noticed that a core service may have to step outside the language

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,310
enforce protection mechanism. In order to control

9
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,160
hardware resources. Bottom line is, while both

10
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:46,140
SPIN and Exokernel start out with the idea of allowing extensibility, they may

11
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,870
have to necessarily restrict who will be allowed to do such extensions. Not any

12
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,840
arbitrary user. It has to be a trusted set of users.
