1
00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:04,715
So, here, once again, is our graph of the volume of a box versus the length of

2
00:00:04,715 --> 00:00:09,182
the cut that we put in it, to be able to fold the sides up. And clearly, the one

3
00:00:09,182 --> 00:00:12,878
that we have here is the restricted domain version, the one that Athena wanted,

4
00:00:12,878 --> 00:00:16,684
because of the real life situation that she was using this in conjunction with.

5
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:21,402
However, let's take a second to look at the equation for this function. We had A

6
00:00:21,402 --> 00:00:27,047
of x so you go to 7 minus 2X times 5 minus 2X times x. And you'll remember

7
00:00:27,047 --> 00:00:32,046
earlier on, I multiplied all of these out. And when we do this all of this

8
00:00:32,046 --> 00:00:36,930
multiplication out, we get a different form, for expressing this function, 4x

9
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,754
cubed minus 24x squared plus 35x. And the reason I wanted multiplication out

10
00:00:41,754 --> 00:00:46,564
right now, so I think you might notice, this equation is pretty different from

11
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:51,253
anything else that we've grasped so far in the course. In particular, we have an

12
00:00:51,253 --> 00:00:55,080
exponent of 3 in our function. What on earth does a graph that has a third

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,596
degree term in it look like? Well, why don't we get rid of these domain

14
00:00:58,596 --> 00:01:02,250
restrictions briefly and zoom out, and look at the entire graph that this is

15
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,745
part of. So, here's the full version of our function without any domain

16
00:01:05,745 --> 00:01:10,540
restrictions. Multiply it out. The function, itself, is 4x cubed minus 24x

17
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:15,197
squared plus 35x. This is a totally different equation than anything we've dealt

18
00:01:15,197 --> 00:01:19,481
with before, graphically, at least, though we did see expressions that look like

19
00:01:19,481 --> 00:01:23,153
this early on in the course. Because this function has a different degree than

20
00:01:23,153 --> 00:01:26,377
other functions we've dealt with, it's going to have different graphical

21
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:30,248
properties as well. Now, I've labeled a few different special points on the

22
00:01:30,248 --> 00:01:34,372
graph or points that may potentially be special. And I'd like you to help

23
00:01:34,372 --> 00:01:38,610
identify what they are. So, in each of the purple boxes over here, to complete

24
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,390
the statements, I'd like you to fill in letters that go with these different

25
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:47,016
points. And there's this blue one right here, this, I'd like to be a number that

26
00:01:47,016 --> 00:01:51,782
you just type in. So basically, I'm asking you which points are the x-intercept

27
00:01:51,782 --> 00:01:56,031
and how many are there? Where the function changes from increasing to

28
00:01:56,031 --> 00:01:59,816
decreasing, and when it changes from decreasing to increasing.
