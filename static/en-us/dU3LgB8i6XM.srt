00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,889
As the sample size increases, we have a more accurate representation of our

2
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:10,423
population parameters. In general, we want bigger samples. And since the

3
00:00:10,423 --> 00:00:16,654
standard error tells us the interval in which the population mean is most likely

4
00:00:16,654 --> 00:00:21,950
going to lie, the standard error decreases. It's okay if this is somewhat

5
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:26,930
confusing right now. I promise that you're going to get it. So, as n gets

6
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:33,279
bigger, the entire denominator gets bigger, and then the quotient gets smaller.
