00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now that we know how failure is going to be, let's look into how to systematically find our causes.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What we need is a way to organize the debugging process

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and for this, we use the process called the scientific method.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's a cool name isn't it.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's actually a big name for little thing but this little thing again has big consequences.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What the scientific method does is provide a systematic process

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
by turning some aspect of reality into a theory that explains how this aspect of reality works,

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and that makes exact predictions on this reality.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Let me come up with a simple example of how the scientific methods works.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Suppose your a human--say, Isaac Newton,

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
your laying in your orchard and all of a sudden your watching an apple fall down.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So now you wonder, well I've just seen this apple falling. This is an aspect of reality.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Why do apples fall down?

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What the scientific method does is provides you a way

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
to come up with the most general prediction method available.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So you can think that if an apple falls and you can repeat this experiment over and over

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
by letting an apple fall, you may also think about well do bricks fall.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Here's a brick and lo and behold, it falls.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Do plates fall? Oh yes they do. Do cups fall down too? Oh yes they do.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Put yourself in the mind of a 3 year old and you will find that everything falls down,

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and everything really means everything.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So I can easily generalized that everything falls down.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Unless you happen to see a say--a balloon.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Here's the balloon and the lo and behold the balloon goes up.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So not everything falls down, but you can easily extend your theory

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
to say--well a balloon is larger than air.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
If the air falls down, then the balloon must go up. So still everything falls down.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What does down actually means? Down means toward the center of the earth.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Everything is attracted towards the center of the earth.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Well, the sun is not attracted to the center of the earth. It's rather the other way around.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So you see that from these observations on even experiments that you can conduct,

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
you will eventually be able to come up with a full pledge theory that explains

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
where things will be moving, that explains at which velocity they will be moving,

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
which explains where the acceleration will be.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
In the case of Isaac Newton, then became the theory of gravitation.
