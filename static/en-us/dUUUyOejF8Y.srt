1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,220
So yes, you get the user's location,
we already saw that.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,939
You get to see their devices.

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:07,960
You don't actually get to see
what buttons they clicked.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,400
Although, if clicking a button starts
a new activity with a visible screen,

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,460
you can track button clicks that way.

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,120
But not all button clicks
start a new activity.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,480
But to track button clicks, you need
to send event hits to Analytics,

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,700
and we're actually going to look into
how to do that in the next lesson.

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,620
Users email addresses,
no absolutely not, never.

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,990
And you never get to see
what other apps users have.
