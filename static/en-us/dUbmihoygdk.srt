1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:06,950
Now, a router in AS1 might learn two routes to a destination, one via the AS

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:12,580
path 24 and the other via the AS path 34. Local preference or simply local pref

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,840
allows an operator to configure the router to

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,000
assign different preference values to each of the

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,620
routes that it learns. The default local preference

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,520
value Is 100. If the operator prefers that this

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,400
router select the path through AS two, it can configure the router to set a

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,680
higher local preference for that route. Such

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,072
as 110. This results in this router selecting

10
00:00:37,072 --> 00:00:42,896
the route through AS two and sending traffic to the destination in AS four via

11
00:00:42,896 --> 00:00:46,230
AS two. In this way a operator can

12
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,570
adjust local preference value of incoming route to

13
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,870
control put bound traffic or to control

14
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,930
how traffic leaves it tominac system in route

15
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,520
to a destination this is extremely useful in

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,519
configuring primary and back up routes for example

17
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,520
here the route though A.S two might

18
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,082
be the primary route,and the route through AS

19
00:01:10,082 --> 00:01:12,770
three, is the backup route. Now typically as

20
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,920
I mentioned, local preference is used to control

21
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,260
outbound traffic. But sometimes autonomous systems can

22
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,760
attach what's called a BGP community to a

23
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,040
route to effect how a neighboring autonmous system

24
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,270
sets local preference. A community is nothing more,

25
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:35,345
but a fancy jargon word for a tag on a route. So let's suppose that AS four

26
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:41,165
wanted to control inbound traffic by affecting how AS two or AS three set

27
00:01:41,165 --> 00:01:47,593
local preference. In this case, let's suppose, that AS two wanted traffic

28
00:01:47,593 --> 00:01:53,730
to arrive via AS three, its primary, rather than by AS two, its backup. In this

29
00:01:53,730 --> 00:02:00,870
case, AS two might advertise its BGP routes with primary and backup communities.

30
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:06,270
The backup community value might cause a router in AS two to adjust its local

31
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,050
preference value, thus affecting how AS two's

32
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,150
outbound traffic choices are made. So, again

33
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,990
local preference is used to control outbound

34
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,170
traffic, in this case AS two's outbound traffic

35
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,570
decision, but the use of a BGP

36
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:24,830
community on the route advertisement can sometimes

37
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,060
be used to cause a neighboring AS

38
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,130
to make different choices regarding it's outbound traffic.

39
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:37,240
Thereby, allowing an AS to specify a primary or back up

40
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,350
path for incoming traffic. This type of arrangement requires prior agreement.
