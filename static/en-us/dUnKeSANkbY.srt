00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,670
Wow that last lesson got pretty deep.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:06,650
Now the kind of connection that you've
seen in Netcat is a TCP Session

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:10,860
which lets two programs send strings of
bytes back and forth over the network.

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,370
TCP is kind of the middle layer of
a stack of networking protocols or

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:20,690
protocol stack which supports all sorts
of different internet applications.

6
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:24,150
HTTP and other applications
are built on top of TCP.

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,880
And TCP is built on top of IP,
the Internet Protocol.

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,930
In this lesson, we'll take a closer
look at how these layers work together.

9
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,540
As we do, keep an eye out for
two things,

10
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,870
how each layer depends on behavior or
guarantees made by the layer below.

11
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,720
And also how it hides
the details of the lower layer,

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,680
giving programmers a simpler interface.
