00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,090
>> So Matt, you're telling me that we have over 3 billion letters or nucleotides

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,440
in each one of our cells. But how does this DNA actually make who we are?

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,768
>> Right, it's a very good question and it's kind of hard to conceive that so much

4
00:00:10,768 --> 00:00:15,530
information can fit in such a small space. It's important to recognize that we

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:19,910
call the total amount of genetic information your genome. And within

6
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,870
everybody's genome, there are segments called genes that code for something,

7
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,800
typically proteins.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,610
>> Well, what do you mean by coding for proteins though?

9
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:32,418
>> Proteins are a large part of what makes up who we are. So the physical stuff

10
00:00:32,418 --> 00:00:36,830
like the, the flesh, the skin, the hair. When you look at another person, who

11
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:42,822
they are is coded for by these genes, which are segments of their genome. Now,

12
00:00:42,822 --> 00:00:47,082
genes only make up 2% of the human genome.

13
00:00:47,082 --> 00:00:49,691
>> Well, then what's going on with the other 98%?

14
00:00:49,691 --> 00:00:53,722
>> Well, that other 98% is still very important. Now, a large part of it we know

15
00:00:53,722 --> 00:00:57,861
regulates that 2%. It determines how those genes are turned on and off at the

16
00:00:57,861 --> 00:01:02,999
right time, and the right place. And there is also another bit of that 98% that

17
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:07,206
we don't know what's going on yet. And we're actively researching that and

18
00:01:07,206 --> 00:01:08,730
learning more every day.
