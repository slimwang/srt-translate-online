1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,838
>> Okay, Michael. So, I've drawn a little thing on the screen for you.

2
00:00:02,838 --> 00:00:06,210
because want to illustrate a problem. So, you see this little graph that I have?

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,850
>> It looks just like all the other graphs you've drawn so far.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,590
>> More or less. I think there are fewer

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,420
points, but I think you're right. It more or less

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,320
looks like the same one. And, we found the

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,140
line that is linearly separating the two clouds of points.

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,578
>> [LAUGH]

9
00:00:21,578 --> 00:00:25,570
>> And you agree, that's a technical term. And you agree that

10
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,060
it linearly separates them. And you're even willing to accept, for the purposes

11
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,500
of this discussion, that is in fact the line that maximizes the margin.

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:32,960
>> Sure.

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,070
>> Even if it's not. Okay, cool. So, this is

14
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,850
easy right? So, what are you going to do, Michael,

15
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,630
if I take this now and I add one more

16
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,000
point? And here is the point that I'm going to add.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,710
>> Hmm.

18
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,170
>> It's another minus.

19
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,200
>> I can think of two things to do. One is I can

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,070
put a vertical line through it, and that makes things nearly separable again.

21
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,730
>> That's usually not allowed.

22
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:54,780
>> And the other one is, since it's a

23
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,250
different color I feel like I could just erase it.

24
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:57,688
>> No.

25
00:00:57,688 --> 00:00:58,284
>> No, all right.

26
00:00:58,284 --> 00:01:00,436
>> That's not acceptable. I control the pen. .

27
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:02,450
>> I mean in some sense the margin is now

28
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:06,030
negative, right. because this, this point, there's going to be no

29
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,380
way of slicing this up so that all the negatives

30
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,150
are on one side and all the positives on the other.

31
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:10,830
>> That's true.

32
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,450
>> It's not linearly separable.

33
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,320
>> Okay. Can you think of some clever way to fix it?

34
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,260
>> Well, again, I mean, I feel like, I mean I was

35
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,010
making a joke before. But maybe a reasonable thing to do is to have

36
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,640
some kind of, you know, I'm allowed to delete some number of points thing.

37
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,510
Or, or, find the line that linearly

38
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,820
separates the positives and the negatives, while

39
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,370
at the same time, minimizing the number of things that are on the wrong side.

40
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,000
>> Right. So you wouldn't be linearly summarizing,

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,790
separating them. But you'd be finding a line

42
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,850
that make sort of the minimal set of

43
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,410
errors while also maximizing the margin, if you kind

44
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,460
of were allowed to flip a few points from positive to

45
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,770
negative or negative to positive. I think that's what you said.

46
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,320
>> Yeah. And then you need to have kind

47
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,050
of new knob now to trade off those two things.

48
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,366
>> Right, and it turns out you can do

49
00:01:53,366 --> 00:01:55,647
that. We're not going to about it. Instead we're

50
00:01:55,647 --> 00:01:57,410
going to make a homework assignment about it then,

51
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,730
and let the students think about it a little

52
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:01,060
bit. But I think even that little clever thing

53
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,900
that you came up with, even though it is

54
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,790
used, won't work in another case that I'm thinking

55
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,280
of. So let me draw that case for you.

56
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,710
Okay, Michael, how does that look?

57
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,510
>> Well, the good news is it's not exactly

58
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,110
like all the other graphs you've drawn but it is,

59
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,940
it is very similar to it. There's going to be

60
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,420
a linear separator that falls between that bottom plus and

61
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,560
the line of minuses. And there's a maximum margin

62
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,350
one. So its, this seems all within the bounds of

63
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,450
what we've been talking about. << That's true. You're very

64
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,200
smart. What if I add just a few more points?

65
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,760
>> Okay, that doesn't

66
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,570
seem like just a few. [LAUGH] Wait, so I guess this is

67
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,640
different from the other example because where before, as before, it looked like

68
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,910
there was maybe like an outlier or an intruder. Now, it's like there's

69
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:49,220
a ring around the whole thing. Oh, is that why they're linearly married?

70
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:49,940
>> Yes.

71
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,680
>> Ha! All right. So now, you know, you can draw lines

72
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,600
all day long, and it's just not going to slice things up.

73
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,220
>> That's right. So now we have to come up with some clever way of

74
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,800
managing to make this work, or we're going to have to throw away

75
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,670
support vector machines altogether. And I

76
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,202
like support vector machines, so I want

77
00:03:06,202 --> 00:03:11,270
to avoid doing that. So here's the little trick we're going to do. I

78
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:16,380
am going to change the data points without changing the data points.

79
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:16,410
>> Ouu.

80
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,550
>> That's going to be a neat trick.

81
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,670
>> That seems possible and impossible.

82
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:25,225
>> Here's what I'm going to do, Michael. I am going to define a function,

83
00:03:25,225 --> 00:03:28,320
okay. Here's the function. I'm going to create a

84
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,140
little function here. And this function's going to take

85
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,360
a data point, okay. And because we've been using

86
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,300
to many X's and I's and Y's and J's, I'm

87
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,130
simply going to call it Q, okay. Now, Q

88
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,170
is one of the points that are in, it's in

89
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,940
the same dimension as these other points. So in

90
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:50,760
this case, it's two dimensions in a plane, okay. And

91
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:57,090
I'm going to transform that particular point Q into another kind of point. But

92
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,770
I'm going to do it in another

93
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:03,130
way that doesn't require cheating, okay. You ready?

94
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,220
>> Sure, Im perplexed but okay

95
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,470
>> Okay. So what is Q? Q is in the Y, is in the plane. So that means

96
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,560
it has two different components, Q1 and Q2. And

97
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,880
I am going to produce from those two components,

98
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,579
Q1 and Q2, a triple. So I am going to put that point

99
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:22,430
into three dimensions now. And the dimensions are going to look like this.

100
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,400
How does that look, Michael?

101
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,240
>> Strange. So you took, so q\Q is a two dimensional

102
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,050
point. So it's got, Q1 and Q2 are its two components.

103
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:33,393
>> Yup.

104
00:04:33,393 --> 00:04:36,070
>> And you're saying, you're going to take the first component, make a new

105
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,530
vector where the first component of that

106
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,800
is squared, take the second component, make a

107
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,200
new vector where the sec, that value is the second component squared. And now,

108
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,660
just because apparently it wasn't weird enough,

109
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,980
you're going to throw in a root 2

110
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,068
times the product of those two as the third dimension. Okay.

111
00:04:53,068 --> 00:04:54,316
>> That's right.

112
00:04:54,316 --> 00:04:57,170
>> You're, you know you have an interesting sense of style.

113
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:00,640
>> I do. I kind of like it. Now let me point out something

114
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:07,180
for you. One is I haven't actually added any new information, in the sense that

115
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,220
I'm still only using Q1 and Q2. Yeah, I threw a constant in there, and

116
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,050
I'm multiplying by one another, but at the end of the day, I haven't really

117
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,230
done much. It's not like I've thrown in some

118
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,030
boolean variable that gives you some extra information. All

119
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,860
I've done is taken Q1 and Q2 and multiplied

120
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,820
them together, or against one another just because, why not?

121
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,580
>> Okay.

122
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,070
>> Okay? All right. Now, Why did I do this? I did this

123
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:34,280
because it's going to turn out to provide a cute little trick. And

124
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,100
in order to see that cute little trick we need to return to

125
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,761
our quadratic programming problem. So let me remind you what that equation was.

126
00:05:40,761 --> 00:05:44,320
All right, Michael. So I've written up the equation for you, as

127
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,740
I promised I would remind you, of the quadratic program that we're

128
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,650
trying to solve. I didn't write down all of the constraints and

129
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,250
everything. I'm hoping that you remember them. And I wrote it up there

130
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,450
for a reason. And the reason I wrote it up, is because

131
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,570
you'll recall, just not too long ago, I asked you to talk about

132
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:03,510
XI and XJ, and what it looks like in this equation. And

133
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,900
what I think we agreed to, or at least I know I agreed

134
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:11,680
to, is that we can think about XI transpose XJ as capturing

135
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,670
some notion of similarity. So, it turns out then, if we sort of buy that idea of

136
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:21,080
similarity, that really what matters most in

137
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,520
solving this quadratic problem, and ultimately solving

138
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,460
our optimization problem, is being able to

139
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:31,010
constantly do these transpose operations. So, let's ask

140
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:34,840
the question that, if I have this new function, fee or

141
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,680
fi or whatever the right pronunciation is, what would happen if

142
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,500
I took two data points, and I did the transpose or

143
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,210
the dot product between them. What would I get? So, let

144
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,810
me just write that out. Or, I don't know, you can

145
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,850
try telling me if you want to. So let's make that,

146
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,920
let's make that let's make that simple, Michael. And in fact,

147
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,080
let's make it so simple we can make it into a quiz.
