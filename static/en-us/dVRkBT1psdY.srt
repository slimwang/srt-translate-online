00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,060
For this module,

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:05,590
you'll need to open up the file entitled
lesson eight, Calm the compiler.

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:09,493
And now we're going to play a few
rounds of Calm the compiler.

4
00:00:09,493 --> 00:00:11,573
You'll see a series of
compiler errors and

5
00:00:11,573 --> 00:00:14,970
quiet them by using
the correct protocols syntax.

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,580
In this first error, the Minion class
has adopted the dirty deeds protocol.

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,200
But the compiler is complaining.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,040
Type minion does not conform
to protocol dirty deeds.

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,190
Pause the video.

10
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,780
Take a minute to fix this error.

11
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,680
And then, continue on.

12
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,910
To conform to the dirty deeds protocol,

13
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:37,800
the Minion class needs to implement
the methods cheat and steal.

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,510
So if we add those implementations,
the compiler is happy again.

15
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,080
Let's try another one.

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,120
Here we have our DinnerCrew class again,
along with the Souschef protocol.

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,310
The goal here is to initialize
a deviousDinnerCrew

18
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,080
with an array of minions.

19
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,240
But we get the following error.

20
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,940
Cannot invoke initializer for

21
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,430
type DinnerCrew with an argument
list of type [members: [Minion].

22
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:01,930
How can we fix this?

23
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,080
What could be wrong
with the argument list?

24
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,570
Right now, the Minion class does
not adopt the Souschef protocol.

25
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,520
So minions can't be a part
of the deviousDinnerCrew.

26
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,260
If we add the Souschef protocol to
the Minion class definition, and

27
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,370
then implement the methods in
the Souschef protocol, chopped and

28
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,760
rinse, this error goes away.

29
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,410
Let's do one more.

30
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,400
Here, we have the DogWalker protocol.

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,060
And the class Neighbor is
adopting this protocol.

32
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,060
We've seen this error before.

33
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,380
Type neighbor does not conform
to protocol DogWalker.

34
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,390
Last time we got this error it
was because we hadn't implemented

35
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,320
the protocol methods yet.

36
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,298
But here you can see that
the methods have been implemented.

37
00:01:42,298 --> 00:01:43,598
What's going on?

38
00:01:43,598 --> 00:01:45,483
Here's what's going on.

39
00:01:45,483 --> 00:01:48,690
The throwBall method signature
in the protocol definition

40
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,592
indicates that throwBall
should return an int.

41
00:01:51,592 --> 00:01:54,430
The throwBall method in the Neighbor
class, on the other hand,

42
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,420
is not returning anything.

43
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:01,010
If we add the return type int to
neighbor's implementation of throwBall,

44
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:05,050
and then add the line return count,
the compiler is satisfied.
