1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,740
So Pete,
what kind of design principles or

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:06,020
design thinking goes into
the product of Optimizely?

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:06,830
>> Sure.

4
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,160
So two things come to mind that I think
has served us well from the beginning.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,540
When we started Optimizely,
to see our competitor's products,

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,160
you had to go through a multi-step sale
cycle, which was really frustrating.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,070
And so, we had no name.

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,410
We had no reputation,
we had no sales people either.

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,265
And so we built our product in such
a way that anybody could go to

10
00:00:25,265 --> 00:00:30,180
Optimizely.com and enter their website,
and immediately get the feeling for

11
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,430
what it was like to use our product.

12
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,090
And I like think of that as putting
our product where our mouth is.

13
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:35,650
You know?

14
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,150
And that forced us to design something
that was easy enough to use that

15
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,210
anybody could get it.

16
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,260
Because the product was
the sales person, initially.

17
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,450
And the second one I think that really,
really served us well was this idea of

18
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,550
enabling the novice, but
empowering the expert.

19
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,510
And that comes through.

20
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,460
When you look at our product,
we built a visual editor.

21
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,090
So, whether you're
looking at a website or

22
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,290
a mobile application,
you can use your mouse.

23
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:03,360
You can drag things around.

24
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,459
You can change text.

25
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:06,980
You can do a lot of simple
things without having to

26
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,600
understand code at all.

27
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,110
But we're engineers,

28
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,250
and we were never really all that
trustful of wizzy wig editors like that.

29
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,210
We don't typically use
Microsoft Word for that reason.

30
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,700
And so, to satisfy our own itch there,

31
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,140
we also made it possible for anybody
to go under the hood and see exactly

32
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,105
the code that we were generating as
a result of all this visual stuff.

33
00:01:29,105 --> 00:01:32,830
And that made it possible for
a marketer to go in and use it, but

34
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,670
also their web developer to go in and
see exactly what was going on.

35
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,640
We found that that's one of our
most consistently used features,

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,330
to our surprise.
