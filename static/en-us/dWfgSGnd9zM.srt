00:00:00,389 --> 00:00:02,466
In addition to thinking
about the major themes and

2
00:00:02,466 --> 00:00:05,681
keywords to include in your targeted
resume, it is helpful to think about how

3
00:00:05,681 --> 00:00:09,690
to structure your profession narratives
so that it tells an interesting story.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:10,691
How can you do this?

5
00:00:10,691 --> 00:00:14,090
By strategically ordering
the sections of your resume.

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,990
In the Master Resume section we
examined the various sections

7
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,920
your Master Resume should include.

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,570
In your targeted resume,
order these in an engaging and

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,560
meaningful way that is
appropriate to your background.

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,660
This is because the order of your
resume sections helps provide logical

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,670
evidence of your experience.

12
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,900
Whether you're just starting your
career, or making a career change, or

13
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,650
have many years of experience
within a single industry,

14
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,020
your resume will look
slightly different.

15
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,203
In the next section you'll see
some common resume structures.

16
00:00:41,203 --> 00:00:44,000
Based on this information,
fill out your targeted resume and

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,250
see which order communicates your
goals and experience most clearly.
