1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And the solution is that all of these modes can be decrypted in parallel.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Let's look at each one of these modes one at a time.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
ECB can be decrypted in parallel

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
because for each C-naught that we have

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
we can decrypt it in reverse

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
to end up with our original message.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This can be run on one processor,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and you do the same thing on this one and for all the other chunks

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
of the message that we have, and all those can be run in parallel.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Counter mode is also decryptable in parallel.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
For counter mode, the important part that we need to calculate

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
is this bit into the XOR, and we know our nonce,

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and we know our counter advance,

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
so this whole chunk can be calculated at one processor.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This whole chunk can be calculated on another processor,

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and so on, and once we calculate those, we can calculate our XORs

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
to reverse the C1 into the message, and this can also all be done in parallel.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
For cipher block chaining mode, similar to counter mode,

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
the important part, this input into the xor again,

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
which for the first block we know the initialization vector,

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
so that can be calculated.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Independently, we are already given C-naught,

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
which can be processed in parallel to this part.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
In C-1 we know, and this could be processed in parallel, and again,

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
we can process--calculate this, calculate this,

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and CBC can be decrypted in parallel.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Similar to cipher block chaining mode, the cipher feedback mode

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
is decryptable in parallel.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The idea is very similar to the 2 modes we just discussed.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We need to calculate the input into the XOR.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This entire chain is known in advance.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
From C-naught we have this entire chain, which is also known in advance,

33
00:01:41,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and we can calculate all these inputs into the XOR in parallel and decrypt our message.
