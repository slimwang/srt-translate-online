1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:05,850
The second thing to decide about in coming up with a constraint

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:11,140
is whether the constraint is associated with the system or

3
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,310
a part of the system that is a class. Or whether it is associated with

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:18,500
an operation. If it's associated with a system as a whole or with a class then

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:23,150
we're going to use an invariant. Saying what must be true about the system or

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:27,820
what must be true about the class. Whereas if it's associated with an operation,

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,800
then we talk about the pre-conditions for the operation and the post-conditions

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,149
for the operation and we will use the pre and post keywords to express those.

9
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:42,960
Okay, in this, in this case, when we're talking about the check out period,

10
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,330
does it sound to you more like it's an invariant or as an operation.
