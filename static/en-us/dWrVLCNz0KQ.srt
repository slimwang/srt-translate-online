00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,951
So let's continue with our practice of the
Distributive Property. Can you tell me

2
00:00:05,963 --> 00:00:11,681
what -5y(y+z) is equal to? Remember to
simplify within each term as much as you

3
00:00:11,693 --> 00:00:17,297
can. And also remember if you need to
write an exponent, let's say you need to

4
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:22,055
write 2^3, you would type that in as 2^3.
So, write the carrot sign before any

5
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:22,055
exponent that you need to type.
