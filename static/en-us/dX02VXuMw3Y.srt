The answer is Error: incompatible types. A Dog is not a kind of House. If you

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,956
try to store a Dog in a variable that's made to hold a House, you'll get a

3
00:00:08,956 --> 00:00:14,842
compile time error, which is good. If Java let you store a Dog in a House

4
00:00:14,842 --> 00:00:20,780
variable, you might then try to call House methods on the Dog. And the Dog

5
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,792
wouldn't know how to do them. Getting this error is actually a good thing. It

6
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:28,067
means that java is helping us. This is one of the things that we were talking

7
00:00:28,067 --> 00:00:32,476
about when we mentioned really early on that java is a safe language. If java

8
00:00:32,476 --> 00:00:35,836
let you create a Dog and then store it as a House, you might try to live in it

9
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:40,530
later and fail. But instead of doing that, the compiler will immediately tell

10
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,422
you that there's something wrong with your code. Other languages might allow

11
00:00:44,422 --> 00:00:46,816
you to keep running the code, and then mysteriously fail or return the wrong

12
00:00:46,816 --> 00:00:51,952
results. This third option isn't quite what we want. This the area that you

13
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:56,692
would get if Dog were an interface. If you tried to make a new Drawable, then

14
00:00:56,692 --> 00:01:01,192
you would get an error like this. Error Drawable is abstract cannot be

15
00:01:01,192 --> 00:01:06,336
instantiated. The Drawable interface has methods sort of, but it doesn't have

16
00:01:06,336 --> 00:01:11,890
enough detail about them for Java to actually make an object Drawable for you.
