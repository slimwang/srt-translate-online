1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,890
The only regression coefficient that's significant is for religiosity.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,405
Therefore, that's the only one that we can conclude has a relationship with

3
00:00:09,405 --> 00:00:14,420
days of alcohol use. In this case, we would reject the null, but since the

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,420
regression coefficient for self-esteem is not significant, we would fail to

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,280
reject the null. And there is no evidence that there is a relationship between

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,100
self esteem and alcohol use.
