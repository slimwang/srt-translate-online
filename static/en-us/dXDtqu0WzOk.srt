1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,170
What actually happens in Lambertian shading is the following.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,270
Okay, when the light is reflected out, basically it falls off, so

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,140
there's, it, it's sort of equal area here.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,870
So you see this amount?

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:20,840
So more light is reflected perpendicularly out than is reflected sideways.

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,500
Okay? And in fact,

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,200
as you fall off this thing goes down by the cosine of the angle.

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,690
So that actually almost no light at all goes out sideways.

9
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:35,700
So a lot of light reflects back up and almost no light at all reflects sideways.

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,800
So you might ask.

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,950
Get ready Megan.

12
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,480
Well why does it look equally bright from all directions?

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,030
>> Well why does it look equally bright from all directions?

14
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,640
>> I love it when stuff works.

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,720
It's that same foreshortening effect, but

16
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,930
this time it goes the other way around, right?

17
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,470
If I've got sort of a pixel having a particular angle, so that's what

18
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:59,240
this is meant to be, a pixel having an angle, when I look down through here.

19
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,010
It has a smaller area.

20
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,570
It's drawn sort of wrong here.

21
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,170
Than when I look this way.

22
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,260
Think about it this way.

23
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,960
If I had a camera out here, the same angle,

24
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,290
right, would now get a much bigger area coming into the same pixel.

25
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,570
So if I understand the math right, and

26
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,480
I think I do, what this means is, is that.

27
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:26,740
The amount of area that I see on the surface grows by the cosine of that area.

28
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,580
Or I should say one over the cosine of that angle.

29
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,720
So as that angle gets smaller and gets closer and closer to 90 degrees,

30
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,489
right, I start to see an infinite amount of patch in the same little pixel,

31
00:01:39,489 --> 00:01:45,070
but over here I'm putting out smaller and smaller and smaller light.

32
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,350
And these cosines, in fact here they are here, this one and that one.

33
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,140
They cancel.

34
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:54,790
And that's why it looks equally bright from every direction.

35
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:55,970
So, I think I got that right.

36
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:59,620
I'm sure my computer vision colleagues are going to send me email, or

37
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,810
just make fun of me on the web if I got that wrong but I'm pretty sure that,

38
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:04,740
that's the way it works.

39
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,800
What you need to know is that it appears equally bright from all directions.
