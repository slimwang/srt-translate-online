1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
So far so good. But we need to figure out

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,500
a couple things. Mainly dealing with

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,209
sending the audio to our second View

4
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:09,449
Controller which are about to build.

5
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:10,888
If we think about this, we have two problems

6
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:12,480
at hand.

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,759
First we need a way to pass the audio

8
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,739
file from the first View Controller to

9
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:18,269
the second View Controller, so that it

10
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:20,460
can play it back.

11
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,899
The second issue is answering the

12
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:24,329
question to what happens when we record

13
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:26,640
a really large file and transition

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,320
before it's been written out the storage.

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,009
In other words, we need to only move from

16
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,109
the first View Controller to the second

17
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:35,759
View Controller once the AVAudioRecorder

18
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:37,738
has finished saving the

19
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:44,328
recordedVoice.wav file.
