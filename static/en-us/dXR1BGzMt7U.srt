1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,299
And the answer is no, we're not done yet. We have reached a goal state.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:12,199
We put a path onto the frontier that reaches the goal of Bucharest, but we haven't popped that path off the frontier.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,766
And uniform cost search continues to search until we pop it off the frontier.

4
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:20,799
We continue looking to see if there's a better path that also reaches the goal.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,399
So let's see. I forgot to say Thagoras is explored, so let's continue.

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,232
Let's take the cheapest path on the frontier and expand that.

7
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:38,666
The cheapest path is this, 146. We'll expand that, get another path into (Sibiyu).

8
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:43,066
That's a worse path than we had before, so we'll drop it.

9
00:00:43,067 --> 00:00:50,932
Then let's see what's next. Looking on the frontier, the cheapest now is here at 299.

10
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:56,332
We'll expand that. We get a path of cost 374.

11
00:00:56,333 --> 00:01:00,032
Put that on the frontier. Now let's go again.

12
00:01:00,033 --> 00:01:04,965
Now the cheapest path is over here at 317.

13
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:12,132
We'll mark that as explored and add two more paths--one here that's a worse path, so it gets dropped.

14
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:21,332
And one path that also reaches the goal, and that has a total cost of 418.

15
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:27,499
So that just shows it's a good thing we waited, a good thing we didn't stop when we found the first path to the goal,

16
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:33,599
because now this second path found is actually cheaper than the first path found.

17
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,499
But we're not going to stop here because we still haven't popped off a path that reaches the goal.

18
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:45,966
So we'll continue. What's next? Now the cheapest path on the frontier is here at 366.

19
00:01:45,967 --> 00:01:52,599
We expand that, and we get paths that are worse paths to points we've already seen before.

20
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:59,232
So nothing new goes on the frontier. Next, the cheapest path on the frontier is at 374.

21
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:06,799
Again, expanding that leads nothing useful. Only worse paths than we've seen before.

22
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:14,232
And now finally, the cheapest path on the frontier is this 418 path to Bucharest,

23
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:18,899
so we pop that off, and now we reach the goal, and now we stop.

24
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:25,399
So even though we found the 460 path first, we don't stop there because there might be another path

25
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:33,399
that also reaches the goal that's cheaper. We keep on going until we popped a path off of the frontier that reaches the goal,

26
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:40,000
and that's why uniform cost search is guaranteed to find the cheapest path to the goal.
