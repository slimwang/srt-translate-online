00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,930
Let's get some practice with nested loops. This digital clock can display any

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:11,232
time of day. It's an American clock, so the hours go from 1 to 12 and minutes

3
00:00:11,232 --> 00:00:16,480
go from 00 to 59. We can use a nested loop to print this table of all of the

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,978
possible times the digital clock can display. We'll need two loops. One will

5
00:00:21,978 --> 00:00:26,870
count up the hours, and one will count up the minutes. To make sure that

6
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,070
minutes are printed with a zero before them so they fill up two digits, you can

7
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:35,032
use the format string %02d. And if you're not sure where to start while writing

8
00:00:35,032 --> 00:00:41,030
your code, think about what code you would write just to print the first line.

9
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,287
And how that differs from the code that you would write to print the second

10
00:00:43,287 --> 00:00:44,040
line.
