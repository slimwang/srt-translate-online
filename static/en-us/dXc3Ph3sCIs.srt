1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,860
Here's the project, and we can see
a pretty organized file structure.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,630
Project files go in the app directory.

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:10,770
It's got a single HTML file and several
directories, with the two important ones

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:15,157
being views, which is for templates, and
scripts, where all the JavaScript lives.

5
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:20,550
Notice that the HTML file includes
angular down here at the bottom.

6
00:00:23,725 --> 00:00:29,520
Let's do a little cleanup by fixing
the indentation here, and here.

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,790
Most likely, you'll want to include
analytics in your project, but for

8
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,820
now I'm going to remove
the Google Analytics code.

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,280
And for the last bit of cleanup
let's remove these nav links.

10
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,440
The angular generator bundles
grunt into its workflow.

11
00:00:45,525 --> 00:00:48,610
Grunt is a task runner, and out of
the scope of what we'll be covering, but

12
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:51,560
you can find more information
about it in the instructor notes.

13
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,210
We'll be using grunt to
serve the project files and

14
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,900
reload the browser
when any files change.

15
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,512
To start the server,
just run grunt serve on the terminal.

16
00:01:05,169 --> 00:01:06,307
And here's our project.

17
00:01:09,163 --> 00:01:12,399
Lastly, the angular generator
package provides generators for

18
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:14,518
every Angular component.

19
00:01:14,518 --> 00:01:16,975
We've just used this first
one to create the app, and

20
00:01:16,975 --> 00:01:19,800
we'll be using most of the others
during the rest of the lesson.

21
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,820
It might be a good idea to bookmark
this page so you can refer back to it.

22
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,894
We saw that angular can be quickly and
easily added to an existing project just

23
00:01:27,894 --> 00:01:31,918
by including a link to angular, and
adding the NG app attribute to the page.

24
00:01:31,918 --> 00:01:35,201
But to keep a consistent and organized
project, we'll be using yeoman and

25
00:01:35,201 --> 00:01:37,660
the angular generator package
to create our projects.

26
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,080
Now that we know how to get up and

27
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,790
running with the new angular app,
let's learn how to create modules.
