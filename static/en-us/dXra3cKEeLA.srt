00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,520
Let's discuss some attacks on
packet filtering firewalls and

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,680
the appropriate countermeasures.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,230
The first attack is source
IP address spoofing.

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:12,690
Here the attacker transmits packets from
an outside host, but with a source IP

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,170
address field containing
the address of an internal host.

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,910
That is, the attacker spoofs the packets
source IP address as if it is from

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,100
an internal host.

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,060
The attacker hopes that
the use of a spoofed

9
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:29,910
internal source IP address will allow
the firewall to let the packet pass.

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,720
The firewall is typically
configured to let

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,150
traffic from one internal host
to another to pass through.

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,150
The countermeasure is to discard
packets with an inside source IP

13
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:44,255
address if the packet arrives
on a external interface.

14
00:00:44,255 --> 00:00:47,685
In fact, this kind of measure is
often implemented at the router,

15
00:00:47,685 --> 00:00:49,155
external to the firewall.

16
00:00:49,155 --> 00:00:52,265
That is, when the router receives
the packet from the Internet,

17
00:00:52,265 --> 00:00:55,355
it would check whether the source
IP address is correct.

18
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:58,085
If the source IP address
is an internal IP address,

19
00:00:58,085 --> 00:01:02,365
the router should know that this IP
address is spoofed, because the router

20
00:01:02,365 --> 00:01:06,970
just received this packet from
the Internet, meaning an external host.

21
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,660
A related attack,
is a source routing attacks.

22
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,800
Here, the attacker specifies
the route the attack should take

23
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,150
as it crosses the internet.

24
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,520
And the attacker hopes that this
will bypass security measures and

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,390
checks along the way.

26
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,470
A countermeasure is for the firewall or

27
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:25,430
the router to discard all
packets that use this option.

28
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,200
Another attack is
a tiny fragment attack.

29
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,810
Here, the attacker uses the IP
fragmentation option to create

30
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,860
extremely small fragments, and

31
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,260
forces the TCP header information
into separate packet fragments.

32
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:42,440
This attack is designed to circumvent
filtering rules that depend on TCP

33
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,080
header information.

34
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,340
Typically, a packet filter
will make a filtering decision

35
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,950
based on the first fragment of a packet.

36
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,280
The attacker here hopes that
the filtering firewall examines

37
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,640
only the first fragment and that the
remaining fragments are passed through.

38
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,990
This attack can be defeated by enforcing
that the first fragment of a packet

39
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:06,700
must contain a predefined minimum
amount of transport header information.

40
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,560
If the first fragment is rejected,

41
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,320
then all the subsequent fragments
should also be rejected.
