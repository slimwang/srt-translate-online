Personality requires that we know three things about a person. First, is how

2
00:00:04,901 --> 00:00:09,917
different is the behavior compared to others. That is, how unique is the

3
00:00:09,917 --> 00:00:15,269
behavior. Second, is does the personality trait exist in many different

4
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:22,165
situations. And finally, does the personality trait exist regularly over time?

5
00:00:22,165 --> 00:00:26,679
Until we can answer all three of these questions, we can't say much about a

6
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:29,287
persons personality.
