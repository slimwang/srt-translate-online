00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,097
Say, I have two images from a stereo setup.

2
00:00:03,097 --> 00:00:06,709
One in which I have a tree on the right-hand side and

3
00:00:06,709 --> 00:00:10,157
a person standing in front of it a bit to the left.

4
00:00:10,157 --> 00:00:12,931
Stereo images are not very different.

5
00:00:12,931 --> 00:00:15,868
In the second image, I have the same tree.

6
00:00:15,868 --> 00:00:19,410
But the relative position of the person is a little different.

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,228
Can you figure out which is the left image and which is the right image?

8
00:00:23,228 --> 00:00:27,310
Enter the word left or right in the corresponding box below each image.
