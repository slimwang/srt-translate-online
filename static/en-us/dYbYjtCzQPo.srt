>> Well this one would just be one value, where we take one of the data values,

2
00:00:04,892 --> 00:00:09,870
subtract the mean, and divide by 10. But we used all of these values, so it

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:15,245
can't be this one. This one doesn't really make sense, we wouldn't add the mean

4
00:00:15,245 --> 00:00:20,414
to one of the values and then divide it by 10. This one makes a little more

5
00:00:20,414 --> 00:00:25,790
sense because we have this summation sign, sigma sum, but we're not adding up

6
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:30,559
the Xi's and dividing by 10. That is the mean, but we are adding up the

7
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:36,040
deviations from the mean, which are each of these, and then dividing by 10. So

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,369
this is the formula that describes what we just did. Good job.
