00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,230
So to start off with the least exposure, your therapist will probably make you

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,942
hear the word snake and then move up to seeing the word snake and print, remind

3
00:00:07,942 --> 00:00:11,538
you these two things might be switched and you may see it before you hear it,

4
00:00:11,538 --> 00:00:18,510
but the fact is these are going to be very low on the list. Then your therapist

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,669
would make you imagine a snake. The next step up would probably be seeing a

6
00:00:22,669 --> 00:00:27,418
picture of a snake in a terrarium. Then after that maybe seeing a picture of

7
00:00:27,418 --> 00:00:31,958
somebody holding a snake. And then after that finally seeing a real snake, but

8
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:36,321
it's in a terrarium across the room. Then next, you might be ready to see

9
00:00:36,321 --> 00:00:41,156
somebody actually holding the snake across the room. And finally, the most

10
00:00:41,156 --> 00:00:45,239
exposure, would of course be holding the snake yourself.
