00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,285
Here I'm back to tell you how to write conditions in Java. Those conditions

2
00:00:04,285 --> 00:00:08,301
that you can put inside an if statement to make a decision. Often times you

3
00:00:08,301 --> 00:00:11,949
want to compare two values to see which one is smaller, which one is larger and

4
00:00:11,949 --> 00:00:16,660
there are a bunch of operators that you can use. Here's a list of them. A

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:21,547
couple of them look just like what they look in regular mathematics. The others

6
00:00:21,547 --> 00:00:25,750
look slightly different. This one here, you would write as greater than or

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:31,662
equal, or maybe greater than or equal, like that, in math. This one here is a

8
00:00:31,662 --> 00:00:35,286
less than or equal. This one here is a simple equality, and this one here is a

9
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:39,512
not equal. Of course, these three symbols were chosen because there's no

10
00:00:39,512 --> 00:00:44,214
keyboard character , for the mathematical symbols. The equal, equal on the

11
00:00:44,214 --> 00:00:49,780
other hand was chosen because the plain old equal already has another meaning.

12
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,379
In Java you use the equal, equal for comparison and the single equal sign for

13
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:59,673
assignment. If you want to assign a value to a variable, here we want to assign

14
00:00:59,673 --> 00:01:05,077
the number 13 to the variable 4. Then we use the equal sign, and of course

15
00:01:05,077 --> 00:01:09,407
afterwards, floor is 13. If on the other hand, we want to test whether or not

16
00:01:09,407 --> 00:01:15,300
floor equals 13, then we use the equal, equal comparison symbol. Let's put if

17
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,950
statements and relational operators to use in a fun graphical way, to draw

18
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,630
flags. Here you see the flag of Indonesia, as simple as flags get, red on top,

19
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:30,870
white on the bottom. Here you see the outline of a simple class for drawing a

20
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,615
flag. Its get color at method, its called for every x and y value in the flag,

21
00:01:35,615 --> 00:01:41,406
your job will be to complete it so that the correct colors appear. You'll

22
00:01:41,406 --> 00:01:44,878
want to know the dimensions of the flag, so that you can decide when to use red

23
00:01:44,878 --> 00:01:49,516
and when to use white. And they're available to you in these instance

24
00:01:49,516 --> 00:01:54,640
variables. Don't worry about how the get color at method is, called. You can

25
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,790
actually peek below and see it, but it uses loops, which we only introduce in

26
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:05,030
the next lesson. Right now your job , is to fill out this method here. Put in a

27
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:10,660
condition here, select the right colors. And as an added challenge, I want you

28
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:16,498
to use the greater or equal operator. Now be careful, for exactly half of the

29
00:02:16,498 --> 00:02:21,885
rows, you want red, and for exactly half of the rows, you want white.
