>> For this problem, we start with our slope formula. And, we already know the

2
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:09,025
slope, it's 1 4th. We also want to fix one of these points to be x and y, and

3
00:00:09,025 --> 00:00:13,480
then this other point will be x 1 y 1. So I have the slope is 1 4th, I fix the

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,246
point x,y, and then this last point is 6 negative 1. So 6 for the x, negative 1

5
00:00:18,246 --> 00:00:23,252
for the y. After substituting the values, here's the equation I get. You can

6
00:00:23,252 --> 00:00:28,116
think about cross multiplying here, or just multiplying by the least common

7
00:00:28,116 --> 00:00:33,010
denominator, which would be 4 times x minus 6. The 4 is reduced to 1, and the x

8
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,913
minus 6, and the x minus 6 also reduced to 1. 1 times x minus 6, is well, just x

9
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:43,037
minus 6. And then, I have 4 times the quantity y plus 1. So I need to distribute

10
00:00:43,037 --> 00:00:47,564
this four to both terms. So 4 y plus 4. I want to write this equation in

11
00:00:47,564 --> 00:00:53,031
standard form, like this. So I need to move this constant to the right and the 4

12
00:00:53,031 --> 00:00:57,951
y to the left. I'm going to add 6 to both sides to get a constant on the right

13
00:00:57,951 --> 00:01:02,675
so I get x equals 4 y plus 10. And now I subtract 4 y from each side. So I get x

14
00:01:02,675 --> 00:01:07,848
minus 4 y equals 10. I just list these terms here because they are not like. If

15
00:01:07,848 --> 00:01:12,206
you got x minus 4 y equals 10, amazing work. I know this isn't the easiest

16
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:17,351
problem and we haven't even covered how to do this part here. So, if you got it,

17
00:01:17,351 --> 00:01:18,425
excellent work.
