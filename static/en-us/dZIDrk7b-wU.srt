00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,109
Since e taken to a power and natural log are inverses, e to the natural log of

2
00:00:05,109 --> 00:00:11,328
x should just give us x. We can visualize this again like we did earlier. We

3
00:00:11,328 --> 00:00:16,746
plug in x to natural log, we end up with natural log of x. If we make the

4
00:00:16,746 --> 00:00:21,554
exponent of e natural log of x, then we get x again. This also works if we

5
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:23,019
reverse the cycle.
