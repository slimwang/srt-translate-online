1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,890
The solutions here are 3 plus or minus root 10, all divided by 2. Great work,

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:10,290
using that square root method, if you got this one correct. We start solving

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,330
this equation by adding 10 to both sides. This leaves us with the square

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:18,630
isolated on the left and positive 10 on the right. Now that we have something

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,815
squared alone, we can take the square root of both sides. This means we will

6
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:26,986
have 2x minus 3 on the left. And plus or minus root 10 on the right. We add 3

7
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:32,940
to both sides to get 2x by itself and then divide both sides by positive 2.

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,266
This leaves us with 1 x in our answer. And again if you really wanted to, you

9
00:00:38,266 --> 00:00:42,556
could split this up into two separate fractions, 3 halves plus or minus root 10

10
00:00:42,556 --> 00:00:46,240
divided by 2. Either form is the same.
