1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
Let's do a little quiz here.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:07,220
What is true for any valid--and by valid I mean with respect to independent set--

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:12,350
any valid 0, 1 assignment to the vertices v and u if they are connected by an edge?

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:16,370
Is it that at most, 1 of the 2 vertices can be in the independent set--

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:21,490
and I'm going to write independent set as IS here just to not move out of the screen here.

6
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:26,330
Is it that both v and u can be in the independent set?

7
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:31,130
Is it that at least 1 of the 2 vertices must be in the independent set

8
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,650
because we're looking for the largest possible independent set?

9
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,660
Could it be that although we're looking for the largest possible independent set,

10
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,010
they are both not contained in that independent set?

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,860
And finally here, because both vertices are connected by an edge,

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,170
is it the case that we would have to exclude both of these vertices

13
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,990
from the independent set?

14
00:00:49,990 --> 99:59:59,999
Please check each one of those here that are correct.
