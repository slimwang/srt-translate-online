1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
There is one more thing to deal with when we have to talk about games--and that's chance.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We want to move from purely deterministic games to stochastic games

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
like backgammon or other games that introduce dice or other parts of random action.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That means that the actions that an agent takes

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
are not specifically specified to have a single result.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's see how we can deal with stochastic games

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
by looking at our value function and modifying it to allow for this.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Here we have our valuation function, and we're dealing with four types of nodes--

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
one, nodes that we decide to cut off on our own, because we reached a certain depth;

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
second, nodes that are terminal according to the rules of the game;

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and third, max to move and min to move.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Now I'm going to add one more type, which is a chance node.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We say if the state is a chance node, then we want to return the expected value of S

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and carry along these bookkeeping variables.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What we're saying here is if it's at the point of the game where it's time to roll the dice,

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
then we're going to role the dice, and we're going to take the expected value

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
of all the possible results rather than the max or the min.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Here we have a schematic diagram for a stochastic game--a game with dice.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We start out. The chance node or the dice-rolling node is first.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The dice is rolled--one of six possibilities.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Then the next player gets his move.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
In this case, we've let Min move first, and Min has various moves possible to make.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
For each one, there is then another role of the dice, and then Max gets to make his move.
