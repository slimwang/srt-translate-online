1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,696
We start out number puzzle by multiplying 5 and 2, which equals 10. 7 is the x

2
00:00:04,696 --> 00:00:10,000
term, so that goes into the bottom. We want to find a factor pair of 10 that

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,044
sums to 7. That must be 2 and 5. We can rewrite the 7x as positive 2x and

4
00:00:16,044 --> 00:00:21,198
positive 5x. Now we'll use factoring by grouping to finish out our problem. From

5
00:00:21,198 --> 00:00:26,111
the first two terms I can factor out an x, leaving me with 5x plus 2. The second

6
00:00:26,111 --> 00:00:31,126
two terms are a little bit tricky. They don't share a factor of 5, of x or 2,

7
00:00:31,126 --> 00:00:36,526
but they do share a factor of 1. We can always factor out a 1 if it appears that

8
00:00:36,526 --> 00:00:42,805
two terms do not have common factors. Our final factored form is x plus 1 times

9
00:00:42,805 --> 00:00:46,520
5x plus 2. I want to acknowledge that there's other ways to factor this. You

10
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,530
might have switched the 5x and the 2x and then continued factoring by grouping.

11
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:55,650
That would work as well. As a quick check on the end, we can do some mental math

12
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:00,802
to make sure this factored form is equal to this polynomial. X times 5x is 5x

13
00:01:00,802 --> 00:01:08,894
squared, 1 times 5x is 5x. And x times 2 is 2x. If I add 5x and 2x together,

14
00:01:08,894 --> 00:01:14,113
I'll get 7x. And finally, 1 times 2 is positive 2.
