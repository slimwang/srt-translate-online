00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,115
>> Remember that this first equation, y equals Ax squared plus bx plus C, is the

2
00:00:05,115 --> 00:00:10,169
equation of a problem written in standard form. Because this contains two

3
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:15,446
variables, x and y, we can use it to graph points on a two dimensional. Plane.

4
00:00:15,446 --> 00:00:19,082
For any value of x that we might want to consider, we can come up with a

5
00:00:19,082 --> 00:00:23,599
corresponding value for y. And then, of course, plot that point on our plane. We

6
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:27,911
can't do that with this equation over here. Because there is no variable on the

7
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:32,095
left side. The only variable in the quadratic equation is x. So clearly, the

8
00:00:32,095 --> 00:00:36,503
equation of parabola relates y to x. Whereas, the quadratic equation does not.

9
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:40,897
However, the quadratic equation is very powerful and useful for us in it's own

10
00:00:40,897 --> 00:00:45,089
ways. It gives us a very straightforward way for finding the x-coordinates of

11
00:00:45,089 --> 00:00:49,397
the x-intercepts of the parabola that it corresponds to. And of course, we could

12
00:00:49,397 --> 00:00:53,557
find that equation, the equation of the parabola, by replacing the zero with y

13
00:00:53,557 --> 00:00:57,781
again. The other thing that's very useful about a quadratic equation is that it

14
00:00:57,781 --> 00:01:02,714
can actually be solved. Because we have one variable x in this equation and

15
00:01:02,714 --> 00:01:07,979
there's only one equation, we can isolate x and find some number of values that

16
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,867
it needs to equal in order to make this equation true. So the equation of a

17
00:01:12,867 --> 00:01:18,503
parabola can yield a graph, A quadratic equation can yield solutions. For values

18
00:01:18,503 --> 00:01:22,508
of x, that tell us a lot about these graphs of parabolas. I know this is a

19
00:01:22,508 --> 00:01:26,996
really subtle distinction, so if this seems a little bit confusing at all, that

20
00:01:26,996 --> 00:01:31,391
makes perfect sense. I myself messed this up several times. Several crucial

21
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:35,746
times, before I really got the difference, so just keep reminding yourself of

22
00:01:35,746 --> 00:01:38,184
the distinction, and when we use each one.
