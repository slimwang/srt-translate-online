00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,650
Starting at the top
with the Chrome logo,

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:06,440
it's pretty clear that it's
a set of colors, set of lines,

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,880
set of gradients, and
some pretty regular shapes.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,890
In fact, if you open it up in DevTools,

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,610
you'll see that this is in SVG,
making it a vector image.

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:22,020
Sam's cute kittens are a photo, which
means that is by default a raster image.

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,230
That is to say,
it's a grid of colored dots.

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,410
The Mexican flag is pretty complex,
but believe it or not,

9
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,770
this is an SVG,
making it a vector graphic.

10
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,115
This middle part here is
obviously the tough part.

11
00:00:34,115 --> 00:00:38,160
And while it does look complex,
you can make it with an SVG.

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,520
If you don't believe me, check out
in DevTools this file's source.

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,980
And for this last gradient, it can
be defined as some geometric rules

14
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,190
governing how the color should change,
so this one is also a vector image.

15
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,160
So the final tally is that
the Chrome logo is a vector,

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,570
the kitten is a raster.

17
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,920
And then the Mexican flag,
repeat background,

18
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,330
and gradient backgrounds
are all vector images.
