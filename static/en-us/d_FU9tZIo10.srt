00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Before describing it mathematically, I'm going to describe it

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
as an analogy to paint mixing, and this analogy comes from Simon Singh

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
from "The Code Book," which is a really fun book about the history of cryptography.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We have our usual suspects, Alice and Bob, that want to establish a shared key,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and they're going to do this by first picking a public color.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's say they both like yellow.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And they'll start with cans of identical yellow paint.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Both Alice and Bob start with a can of yellow paint.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Then each party will pick their own secret color.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Let's say Alice picks a greenish color,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and Bob picks a purplish color.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Then what they do is mix their secret colors with the public color.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
They're going to mix those two, and the green and yellow

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
will make some ugly green color,

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and Bob will do the same thing, mixing the yellow and purple

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
to get some new ugly color.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
At this stage, they change colors.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Alice gives Bob the ugly green color that she got by mixing her secret color with yellow.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Bob gives Alice the ugly pinkish color he got by mixing yellow with his secret color.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Once they've received the other party's colors,

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
they mix their secret color with the other party's mixed color.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
At this stage, both parties should have the same color.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Alice mixed her green with the pink that came from yellow and Bob's secret color,

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and that will give some new color probably uglier than the grey that I'm drawing,

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
but Bob will get the same thing because Bob is mixing the yellow,

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Alice's secret color, and Bob's secret color and getting the same color.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This gets them the same color. They've mixed the same 3 colors together.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It would be secure if someone who knew yellow

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and could intercept these 2 transmissions

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
couldn't guess the secret colors.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This assumes that paint unmixing is impossible.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Probably not a very good assumption, and certainly not a practical way to actually do this.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What we want is to do the same thing with mathematics.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
This is also the main operation we used in symmetric ciphers.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
XOR = + mod 2.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
To do key agreement, though, plus is not going to be the main operation.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The main operation we'll use is multiplication.
