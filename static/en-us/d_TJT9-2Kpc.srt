1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,340
The correct answer is
either one of these.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,440
Realistically, there is no way
that GIF is going to show up

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,210
in less than 16 milliseconds.

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,980
And the request adds extra overhead,
too, in the animation phase,

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,970
which is not the time to handle it.

6
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,720
Have the GIF prepared well
in advance before the users

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,080
actually click on video.

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,740
It's small, so why not make it
a part of the initial app load?

9
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,000
Either way, don't request it now.
