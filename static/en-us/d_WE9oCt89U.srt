00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,620
Let's break down the process
of parsing JSON.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,180
JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation,

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,190
is a popular way of describing
a collection of key value pairs.

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,430
The keys could be
represented as strings, and

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,280
the values can be other strings,
numbers, arrays, or even dictionaries.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,400
For the web services that we'll
interact with in this course,

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,440
as well as many others, we can use JSON
to pass data to and from our apps.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,860
For now, I just want you to focus on
getting JSON data and then parsing it.

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,530
We can break this process
down into three steps.

10
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,170
First get the raw JSON data.

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,120
Second, parse the JSON data into
a usable foundation object,

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,380
such as an NS dictionary or an NS array.

13
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,320
And third, grab the data
from the foundation object.

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,340
These steps will make more sense in
code, so let's demonstrate them now.
