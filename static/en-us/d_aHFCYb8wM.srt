00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Following along from the last problem, we can show that Hamiltonian cycle is

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
actually NP-complete, and we can show this from a reduction from shortest tour

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
to Hamiltonian cycle.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
To show this, let's say every edge for shortest tour has a cost,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
or an edge length, of 1.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Then, we can say that a shortest tour for a given graph with n vertices

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
has a given length if and only if the graph has a Hamiltonian cycle.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And what I'd like you to do is give me this length that completes this.
