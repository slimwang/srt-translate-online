00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,268
But we don't have to evaluate functions just the numbers. We could find f plus

2
00:00:05,268 --> 00:00:11,203
g of x. This would be the function of adding these two functions together for

3
00:00:11,203 --> 00:00:16,544
any number x. In other words I want to create a function so that way when I

4
00:00:16,544 --> 00:00:22,082
plug in that number into it, I always get f plus g of that number. I want to

5
00:00:22,082 --> 00:00:26,242
have a function that can quickly add these two outputs together. So what do you

6
00:00:26,242 --> 00:00:29,620
think is this function? Type it in here.
