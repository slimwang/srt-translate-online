Ilya you mentioned the Critical Rendering Path. It sounds pretty important.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,190
>> It is. The Critical Rendering Path is the sequence of steps

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,720
that the browser goes through to convert the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,990
into actual pixels on the screen. And, if we can optimize that,

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,990
then we can make our pages render fast, which makes for happier users.

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,520
>> Cool. So what's involved in it?

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,010
>> So, this diagram captures all of the essentials.

9
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,380
First we grab the HTML and we start building the

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,630
document object model. We then have to fetch the CSS and build the

11
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,250
CSS object model. We combine those two to create the Render Tree. Then

12
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,840
we have to figure out where everything goes on the page, which is

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,740
the Layout step. And then finally we can paint pixels on the actual screen.

14
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:45,760
>> Wait a second though, you only

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,670
talked about HTML and CSS, what about JavaScript?

16
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,730
>> right, yeah, so that's a big important part of the performance

17
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,013
puzzle. But before we get there let's talk about, how we construct

18
00:00:56,013 --> 00:00:58,820
a document object model, the CSS object model, and then

19
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,870
we'll talk about how JavaScript affects the actual rendering pipeline.

20
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:03,510
>> Okay, that sounds great.
