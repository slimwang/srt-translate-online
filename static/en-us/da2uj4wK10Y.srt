1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And the correct answer is indexes increase the speed of database reads.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yes, that is true. That is what they are used for, at least.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Sometimes you don't make the right index,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
but assuming you made the correct index, your index matches your query,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
yes, you will increase the speed of reads.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
At least you hope so.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Indexes increase the speed of database inserts.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
No, that is false.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
They probably decrease the speed of database inserts.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That is because when we're inserting a new round to our table,

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
we probably also have to update all of our indexes,

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and that takes time.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So there's a tradeoff.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We can probably get faster reads at the expense of slower inserts.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And probably slower writes in general, for just updating a row,

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
but there's actually a few perverse cases

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
where an index can actually increase the speed of an update.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Let me give you a little real demo

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
of how indexes can affect things in the real world.
