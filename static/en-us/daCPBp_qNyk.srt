1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,110
You are doing research on
the progression of the risk factors and

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,500
complications of both treated and
untreated hypertension over time.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:15,430
To model this, you might best use
Decision Trees, Markov Models,

4
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:19,850
Discrete event simulation,
Agent-based simulation.

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,070
Explain your choice in
the space provided.
