1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,560
This is a quadratic equation. We know it's not a linear equation because we

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,700
have this term that has an x squared in it.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,610
We also know that it's not an equation for

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:14,600
a parabola because x is the only variable. We don't have a y anywhere that we'd

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,000
be able to relate to x so we could graph the equation on a coordinate plane.
