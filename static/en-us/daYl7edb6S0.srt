00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,680
There's a couple more things about
Android Build Variants that you should

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,370
know about, but you won't necessarily
need to use them very often.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,650
Consider a game that contains
a great deal of drawable resources.

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,160
So many in fact that including
all the drawables for

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,910
every resolution would result
in an unacceptably large APK.

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,840
This would be an excellent time to use
product flavors, one for medium DPI and

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,480
one for high DPI.

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,310
Now, consider what happens if we
want to add free and paid flavors.

9
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,730
You'll want both a free and
paid medium DPI version, and a free and

10
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,440
paid high DPI version.

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,750
This comes out to four total flavors.

12
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,720
However, now if you want to include
additional functionality in

13
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,630
the paid version, for example,
you have to put it in two places.

14
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:44,140
One for the paid medium DPI and
one for the paid high DPI.

15
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,050
Now, suddenly we've lost all
the code release advantages of

16
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,310
using flavors in the first place.

17
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:52,140
Fortunately, the Android plug-in
supports the concept of flavor

18
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,500
dimensions to deal with this use case.

19
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,410
Just like the Android
plug-in will create tasks for

20
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,780
each combination of build type and
product flavor.

21
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,310
You will now be able to build every
possible permutation build type,

22
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,349
product flavor, and flavor dimension.
