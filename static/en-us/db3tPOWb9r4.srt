The people at the Expo love Grant's product, his glasses wipers. But they find

2
00:00:04,832 --> 00:00:09,683
that washing their glasses with water just isn't enough. There needs to be some

3
00:00:09,695 --> 00:00:14,317
sort of cleaning solution that will be the solution to their problem. Grant

4
00:00:14,329 --> 00:00:18,976
decides to get on it right away. He contacts the three biggest lens cleaning

5
00:00:18,988 --> 00:00:23,610
solution vendors and asks them how much they charge to buy their solution in

6
00:00:23,622 --> 00:00:29,014
bulk. He needs this stuff fast. So, he asks how much it would be to get these

7
00:00:29,026 --> 00:00:33,585
samples rush ordered. Grant takes careful notes when he's on the phone with

8
00:00:33,597 --> 00:00:38,516
these companies. Once he's done, he has the following information. Brand number

9
00:00:38,528 --> 00:00:43,463
1 charges $10 per gallon of solution plus a $100 rush order fee. The second

10
00:00:43,475 --> 00:00:48,406
brand charges $8 a gallon plus a $200 rush order fee. And the third brand

11
00:00:48,418 --> 00:00:53,811
charges $10 per gallon with a $150 rush order fee. Now, Grant has some decisions

12
00:00:53,823 --> 00:00:58,727
to make. He needs to figure out how much solution he needs to buy and who he

13
00:00:58,739 --> 00:00:59,982
should buy it from.
