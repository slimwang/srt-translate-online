Here's the sum of two more trinomials. These trinomials are a little bit more

2
00:00:04,051 --> 00:00:08,290
complicated because they have multiple variables with exponents. I want you to

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,511
try this one out. What do you think the sum of this trinomial and this trinomial

4
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:16,534
would be? Enter your answer here. You might stumble a little bit on this one,

5
00:00:16,534 --> 00:00:19,217
which is totally okay. I want you to try your best.
