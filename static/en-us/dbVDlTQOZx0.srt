1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This is not that easily solved.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
What ratio is 12,000 to the total number of students?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Well, 12,000 over the total number of students ends up being the same as 12 over 144,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and that's the same as 1/12.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The correct answer would have been the check box over here.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This area over here corresponds to the age group of 13 to 19.
