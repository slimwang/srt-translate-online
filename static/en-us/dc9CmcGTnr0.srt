00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,310
Before you get started with
this nano degree program,

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,650
it's really important for you to
evaluate whether or not you're ready for

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,735
the kinds of things we're
going to talk about.

4
00:00:06,735 --> 00:00:09,590
We're try and build as much knowledge
necessary for machine learning into

5
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,920
the curriculum, but there's some things
you need to know before you get started.

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,370
If you aren't familiar
with any of these things,

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,590
we invite you to use some of
the resources that we've provided, or

8
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,710
some of the resources available online
to learn the requisite knowledge to

9
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,070
get started.

10
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,960
Generally speaking, what you really need
to know to get started is some math.

11
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,470
You need to know some basic statistics,

12
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,270
some basic calculus, and
some basic linear algebra.

13
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,250
If you can do these like calculating
a standard deviation by hand,

14
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,590
calculating a derivative, or
calculating a determinate of a matrix,

15
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,920
then you're probably ready
to get started here.

16
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,930
Now, of course, at some point
during the nano degree program you

17
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,860
might come across something
that you're not familiar with.

18
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,960
And in that case, we invite you to
pause, go look up some additional

19
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,200
information and learn what you
need to know to move forward.
