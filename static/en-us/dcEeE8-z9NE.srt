1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Do you know that the acceleration equals (2π)² r/T²,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:19,000
but on the other hand we have Newton's law telling us that this acceleration is G*mE/r².

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This yields the following. Multiply both sides by r² , (2π)²r/T²=G*mE/r².

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Let's take r² over here, T² over here, (2π)² over here, so we have,

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:04,000
if r³ is whatever remains on the right hand side, r itself is the ³ √ G<i>mE</i>T²/(2π)²

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and if you plug in the numbers, that's about 42,000 km,

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
which is the same as the length of the equator of the earth.

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So this spacecraft, the distance between the spacecraft and the center of the earth

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
has to be almost the same as the length of the equator of the circumference of the earth.

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Remember that the distance between that spacecraft and the center of the earth

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
is not the height of that spacecraft.

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
To get the height, you would have to subtract the radius of the earth.
