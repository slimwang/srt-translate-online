1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,810
Let's compare firewalls with IDS.

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,230
A network IDS performs
passive monitoring.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:10,930
That is, while the IDS is copying and
analyzing the network traffic,

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,630
the traffic is continuing
to reach its destination.

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:18,020
Traffic analysis can take
a lot of computing power, and

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:22,460
therefore the IDS can be overloaded
by large body morph traffic.

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:27,300
When an IDS is overloaded, it cannot
detect intrusion in a timely manner.

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,408
That is, it fails to
adequately protect a network.

9
00:00:30,408 --> 00:00:34,829
We call this situation fail open,
meaning that when the IDS fails,

10
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,790
the network is open to intrusions.

11
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,490
On the other hand,
a firewall performs active filtering.

12
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,270
That is, all traffic must
pass through the firewall and

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,310
the firewall performs relatively
simpler and more efficient analysis.

14
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:54,130
However, it can still be overloaded
by large volume of traffic.

15
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,490
When this happens, it will simply
not let the traffic go through.

16
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:01,680
We call this fail close,
meaning that when a firewall fails,

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,379
the internal network is closed to
the external network, and it is safe.
