00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,444
Now we have to think. Why did we want to come up with that equation in the first

2
00:00:04,456 --> 00:00:08,964
place? Think back to our original problem. We are trying to figure out the cost

3
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:13,320
to make one set of wiper blades. With our new equation, 598 equals 92c, that

4
00:00:13,332 --> 00:00:17,689
means finding out what number c needs to equal to make this equation true. So,

5
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,109
what kind of equation are we dealing with? With here.

6
00:00:21,116 --> 00:00:26,169
Is this a conditional equation, is it an identity, or is this not an equation at

7
00:00:26,181 --> 00:00:26,407
all?
