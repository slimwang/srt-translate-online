00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,890
Welcome to iOS development.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,090
I'm Rod, and I'm going to be
your instructor for this course.

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,330
In the first part of this course,

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,990
we're going to build an app that
lets you record your voice and

5
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,150
play it back with sound effects.

6
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,350
This course assumes you're familiar
with basic programming concepts,

7
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:17,400
like if statements, loops and classes.

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,740
You don't need to have written any iOS
apps, or any experience with Swift.

9
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,540
We'll cover everything you need to
know as you go through this course.

10
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,460
Developing for iOS is a lot of fun.

11
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,150
You get to write apps that you
can carry right in your pocket.

12
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,770
Let's start by looking at the steps
we'll take to build this app.
