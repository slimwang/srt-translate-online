00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,310
In the previous lesson, we studied
an operating system scheduler adaptation

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,740
for providing accurate timing for
upper layers of software,

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,700
especially needed for
real time multi-media applications.

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,930
Now we move up in the food chain.

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,770
The focus in this lesson is
in the middleware that sits

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,210
in between commodity
operating systems and

7
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:28,280
novel multimedia applications that
are realtime and distributed.
