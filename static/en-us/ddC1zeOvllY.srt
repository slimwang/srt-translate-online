1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,608
To find out what c needs to equal to make this equation true, we have to modify

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,952
both sides of the equation so we get c by itself on one side of the equal sign,

3
00:00:08,964 --> 00:00:13,378
and everything else on the other side. Now, to insure that both sides of the

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:18,175
equation actually remain equal to each other, so that we can legally continue to

5
00:00:18,187 --> 00:00:22,598
write equal signs in our equation, whatever we do to one side of the equation,

6
00:00:22,696 --> 00:00:26,708
we need to do to the other side as well. If these two things start out having

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,051
the same value, but I, for example, add 4 to the left side and subtract 1 from

8
00:00:31,063 --> 00:00:35,208
the right side, then they can't possible equal to one another anymore, since

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,364
I've changed them in different ways. We'll do plenty of practice with that

10
00:00:39,376 --> 00:00:43,254
concept in the coming lessons. For now though, let's think about what's

11
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:47,371
preventing c from being by itself. We know that we want our final equation to

12
00:00:47,383 --> 00:00:51,647
look like c equals blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, something. So, it means we need

13
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:55,671
to isolate c as my petitions like to say. Instead of having just c though, we

14
00:00:55,683 --> 00:00:59,890
have 92 times c. Remember, there's an invisible multiplication sign right here

15
00:00:59,902 --> 00:01:04,004
between our coefficient and our variable. We basically need to undo this

16
00:01:04,016 --> 00:01:08,655
multiplication, get rid of it, and the way to undo multiplication is to do some

17
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:13,045
division. Since right now, c is being multiplied by 92, to have just c on its

18
00:01:13,057 --> 00:01:17,485
own, we need to divide by 92. But that also means, since I'm dividing on one

19
00:01:17,497 --> 00:01:22,821
side of the equation that I also need to divide on the other side. So, I also

20
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:28,019
need to divide 598 by 92. Looking at the right side, 92c over 92 is, as we

21
00:01:28,031 --> 00:01:33,647
wished, just c. And on the left side, 598 divided by 92 is equal to the number 6

22
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,250
and a half. Just to be safe, it's always a good idea to check your answer if you

23
00:01:39,262 --> 00:01:43,720
know how to. In this case, we can just use substitution. Starting with our

24
00:01:43,732 --> 00:01:48,227
initial equation, 598 equals 92c, we can plug in our new value for c and see if

25
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,760
this makes a true equation.
