00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,200
The true power of UI
router is in nested views.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,980
Let's add a nested view
to the items detail page.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,900
Let's add a state to see an item's
reviews and one for its nutrition facts.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,030
To add a nested view,

5
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:15,020
we need the same name as the main view
that this one will be nested inside.

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,040
So that's item.

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,817
Then we need a dot and
then it's the nested views name.

8
00:00:21,265 --> 00:00:23,610
We need to generate both
of these templates.

9
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,790
But we don't need controllers because
they'll just inherit the item's data

10
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,470
from the parent route scope.

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,000
Here's what we have for the nutrition
template and over here is the one for

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,880
the reviews.

13
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,070
See that for the reviews template uses
an entry repeat directed to loop through

14
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,360
all the reviews.

15
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,050
Lastly, I added some reviews
to the item JSON file so

16
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,328
that they'll have something to display.

17
00:00:40,328 --> 00:00:45,640
So UI router knows of the nested
item and the templates to use.

18
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,780
We need to tell UI router where we
want these views to appear though.

19
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,050
We need the UI view directive again.

20
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,520
But since we want them to
display on an items page,

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,000
we need to add it to our item.html.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,920
Finally, we need to create a link for
each view,

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,240
and we now have nested routing.

24
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,720
Nested views in at management can
be very complex and complicated.

25
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,660
UI Router makes this
incredibly easy though.
