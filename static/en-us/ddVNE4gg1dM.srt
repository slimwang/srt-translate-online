1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,926
Factoring the expression on the left gives us x plus 45 plus x minus 10 times x

2
00:00:04,926 --> 00:00:09,559
minus 10 is less than or equal to 0. So our 2 critical values for x then that

3
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:14,636
are going to split up our number line are negative 45 and 10. Our interval then,

4
00:00:14,636 --> 00:00:19,692
that we get from these critical numbers are x is less than or equal to negative

5
00:00:19,692 --> 00:00:24,527
45. Negative 45 is less than or equal to x, which is less than or equal to 10,

6
00:00:24,527 --> 00:00:29,409
and 10 is less than or equal to x. Here, we include the critical values in each

7
00:00:29,409 --> 00:00:33,984
of these intervals, because we have a less than or equal to sign, not just a

8
00:00:33,984 --> 00:00:38,387
less than sign. We know that if x equals either of these critical values, the

9
00:00:38,387 --> 00:00:42,876
expression will actually equal 0 and that means it definitely would satisfy the

10
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:47,031
inequality. So we want to test these intervals. We want to include those

11
00:00:47,031 --> 00:00:48,873
critical values in each of them.
