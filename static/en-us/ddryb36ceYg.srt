00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,840
So far, we've examined the basic structure of AJAX request alongside some

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,520
basic use cases.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,770
We've used def tools to identify that Facebook and

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,410
Twitter use AJAX request to load content on the fly.

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:16,360
We've seen how Reddit and the Reddit enhancement sweep use AJAX request to

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,870
load data inline as users request information.

7
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:23,870
And, we've briefly taken a step back to examine how even big websites like Yelp!

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:28,280
Take advantage of external API's to add functionality to their website.

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,220
In the next part of the lesson, you'll be diving into building the moving

10
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:35,110
planner app which is going to integrate Google Street View in the background.

11
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,800
The New York Times API to give us these articles, and

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,580
the Wikipedia API to give us these articles.

13
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,710
For this quiz, I want you to spend a moment to brainstorm what kind of APIs you

14
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:48,080
could use to mix and match in interesting ways.

15
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,300
Take a look through the massive list of APIs in the instructor notes, and

16
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,340
take a moment to think about some kind of cool,

17
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,160
novel way you could integrate different APIs together in a single web app.

18
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,020
Once you finish your brainstorm, type what APIs you want to try out in this box.
