00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,748
Our need to belong is one of the strongest of the human needs. However,

2
00:00:03,748 --> 00:00:07,634
unfortunately, there are times when we're rejected. Rejection can lead to a

3
00:00:07,634 --> 00:00:11,386
variety of negative consequences, including loneliness, isolation, and even

4
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:12,540
pain.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:12,855
[NOISE]

6
00:00:12,855 --> 00:00:15,780
Now this is a perfect time to bring up bullying, and the negative consequences

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,555
of bullying. When a person's bullied, he or she is rejected and often ridiculed

8
00:00:20,555 --> 00:00:25,452
by others. Rejection can be overwhelming and actually cause pain for the

9
00:00:25,452 --> 00:00:29,310
person. Do you remember in the sensation and perception lesson when we talked

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,210
about social pain activating the exact same part of the brain as physical pain?

11
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:38,824
So when people say being rejected hurts, it really is painful. Some of the

12
00:00:38,824 --> 00:00:42,464
other problems associated with rejection are eating disorders, more health

13
00:00:42,464 --> 00:00:46,400
problems, depression, and, tragically, sometimes suicide.
