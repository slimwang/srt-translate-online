1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,460
So it's pretty clear that if you were raising around to capital, going to friends and family

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:13,580
or crowdfunding like Kickstarter or angel capital or venture capital or corporate partners,

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,290
all kind of make sense for financing.

4
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:20,700
Also, going to the small business administration or getting SBIR grants

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,810
also fit into the financing column.

6
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:29,600
But for operating capital that is money you need when your company is an ongoing concern

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:35,740
in generating revenue--well, lease lines make sense, factoring, vendor financing.

8
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:41,010
And what's really interesting is you might also get operating capital from government grants as well

9
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,490
and corporate partners that are also fit there.

10
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:47,530
So there's two actually went into the correct category.

11
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,880
Well, surprisingly of course venture capital always does follow on rounds

12
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,980
so this was kind of a trick question.

13
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,350
You could always get more operating capital in subsequent rounds

14
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,450
from venture capitalist, not on the corporate partners.

15
00:01:00,450 --> 99:59:59,999
Just remember that VCs will invest more money to get more ownership of your company.
