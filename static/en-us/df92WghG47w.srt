1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,194
So we've discussed interim memory, working memory and long-term memory, such as

2
00:00:04,194 --> 00:00:08,718
episodic or semantic memory. But how do we get information to our long-term

3
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:13,521
memory? Well, there are four steps to long-term memory formation. There's

4
00:00:13,521 --> 00:00:19,092
encoding, consolidation, storage and retrieval. Let's first start by looking at

5
00:00:19,092 --> 00:00:22,943
encoding. So the first out of the four steps of turning information into

6
00:00:22,943 --> 00:00:27,782
long-term memory, as we said, is encoding. This means that we attend to new

7
00:00:27,782 --> 00:00:32,136
information, we take it in, and then we process the new information. So, our

8
00:00:32,136 --> 00:00:37,010
brain focuses on something new, takes it in, and we process that information.

9
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:42,540
That is us encoding new information. Now the key here is attend. It's important

10
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,619
to remember that we have to pay attention. Attention is what drives the process

11
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:49,926
of encoding. That is we have to pay attention to and be aware of the

12
00:00:49,926 --> 00:00:54,138
information that we are trying to remember. Now, there are two types of

13
00:00:54,138 --> 00:00:59,448
encoding. One type of encoding is termed automatic processing. As the name

14
00:00:59,448 --> 00:01:02,828
implies, it refers to encoding information that occurs with little effort or

15
00:01:02,828 --> 00:01:07,343
conscious attention to the task. Remember, at the beginning of the lesson, when

16
00:01:07,343 --> 00:01:11,487
we asked if you remembered what you had for breakfast. This is an example of

17
00:01:11,487 --> 00:01:16,120
the kind of automatic processing we're talking about. So although you may have

18
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,207
encoded what you had for breakfast this morning, by the evening you may have

19
00:01:19,207 --> 00:01:23,840
forgotten it. Because it took little effort or conscious attention to the task

20
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,030
the second type of encoding for long term memory is termed, effortful

21
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,933
processing. Effortful processing happens when we carefully pay attention to

22
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:36,549
information and try to make a conscious effort to remember the information. For

23
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:39,994
example, the type of symantic memories we have, such as remembering the names

24
00:01:39,994 --> 00:01:44,566
of the presidents of the United States. Or trying to remember the names of all

25
00:01:44,566 --> 00:01:48,468
the continents. These involve our ability to consciously pay attention to

26
00:01:48,468 --> 00:01:52,794
information and to put an effort into retaining this information. While you

27
00:01:52,794 --> 00:01:56,572
take notes for this class. Or watch our videos, you're engaging in effortful

28
00:01:56,572 --> 00:02:01,100
processing because you're trying to retain the information that you've learned.

29
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,847
At least I hope so. So, how do we go about engaging in effortful processing?

30
00:02:05,847 --> 00:02:09,627
Psychologists theorize levels of processing relate to our ability to more

31
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:14,568
deeply encode information so that our recall improves. Let's go into a little

32
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:16,029
more detail about this.
