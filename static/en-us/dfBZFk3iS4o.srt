1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,730
We just discussed
the basics of functions.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,250
We know how to define them and
call them.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,759
If you look at all
the code we've written so

4
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:09,559
far, you'll start noticing
functions everywhere.

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,640
They'e ubiquitous.

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,410
Most importantly they allow us to
compartmentalize our code into tasks,

7
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,629
which keeps things concise and readable.
