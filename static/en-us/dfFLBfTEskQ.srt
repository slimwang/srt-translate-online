00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,400
Suppose you're given this
complete binary search tree.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,810
Here's what the conventional in-order
ordering of the nodes would look like.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,360
The numbering serves as offsets for
laying out the nodes linearly in memory.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,040
And, by the way, if this is an actual
tree data structure with left and

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:14,660
right pointers,

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,360
let's assume that those pointers
are stored along with the node values.

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,000
But, what about a different ordering?

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,830
For this quiz,
I want you to generate the sequence that

9
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,080
would result from a Van Emde Boas
ordering instead.

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,120
Enter the node values and the linearized
array that appears below the tree.

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,150
So, you'd type a, b, c, d, e, f,
g, or whatever in these boxes.
