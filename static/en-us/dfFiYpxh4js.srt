00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,630
Okay, we're going to go back to our editor and add an

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:06,570
extra little feature here. Okay, so we're got our first input, type

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,910
equals text. I'm going to add a new input that we may not

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,490
have dealt with before called type equals hidden. And this is a

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,130
sneaky way of including values when you submit your form that

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,830
the user can't actually see. Sometimes when you submit a form you

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,530
actually want to have more information then what the user's just given

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,880
you. That's what type hidden is for. I'm going to give it name,

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,310
food and I'm going to give it value X. Okay,

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,490
back to the browser. I've refreshed our browser and

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,260
reloaded that new page. Now, I'm going to enter in

12
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,720
steak here again. And time for another quick quiz. What

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,430
happens when I click add here? What happens when

14
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,470
I submit the form, that has a hidden input

15
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,800
in it already? Do we see one value in

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,880
the URL with what we just submitted? Do we see

17
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,520
two values in the URL? The one we just submitted and the

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,340
hard coded value. In this case, the hard coded value, what I

19
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,440
mean by that is. The word eggs that we put in that

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,269
hidden input that was in our code. Or does the browser error?
