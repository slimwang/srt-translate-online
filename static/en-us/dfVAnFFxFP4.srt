1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The final quiz, let's assume our message is "Today is secret."

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And again, it might look like spam because the word "secret" occurs.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I'd like you to compute for me the probability of spam given this message.
