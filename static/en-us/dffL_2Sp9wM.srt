1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,190
Now here, just because the fact 3 approximation algorithm

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:06,110
for vertex cover doesn't carry over here

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,660
doesn't mean doesn't mean there can not be an approximation algorithm

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,780
for Clique and Independent Set;

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,580
it's just that we can not use this one.

6
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,940
So Bob and Carol still don't have to be unhappy,

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,070
but unfortunately, I'm now going to make them very unhappy.

8
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,290
For Clique and Independent set,

9
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,400
there is no constant factor approximation algorithm

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,740
unless P equals NP.

11
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,720
That, of course, is a very unpleasant surprise

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,350
and it's very surprising,

13
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,340
so where did I get that from?

14
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,220
Well, the proof for this result here

15
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,850
relies on some very, very deep results

16
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,870
of theoretical computer science

17
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:44,300
which you will only get to know in very advanced

18
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,010
theoretical computer science courses, if ever.

19
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,060
But what I would like to do is just give you an intuitive idea

20
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,790
for why there is no constant factor approximation algorithm

21
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,570
for Clique and Independent Set

22
00:00:55,570 --> 99:59:59,999
unless P equals NP.
