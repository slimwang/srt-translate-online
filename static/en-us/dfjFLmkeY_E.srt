1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,650
So, hopefully we now are setting
all sorts of error states, but

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,820
we aren't using them to help
display anything to the user yet.

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,490
Let's change that.

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:13,160
First, we need to add a new utility
method to get the current location

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,170
status, and next, we'll update
the function that changes the string

6
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,390
displayed in the empty view to use both
the location status and the network

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,680
state, instead of the call we have now,
that only looked at network status.

8
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,610
As I mentioned before, one of the great
advantages of using a shared preference

9
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,480
to store the status of the location,
is that we can listen for

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,690
changes to shared preferences.

11
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,980
We'll have forecast fragment implement
an onSharedPreferenceChangeListener.

12
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,620
We'll register this listener with
default SharedPreferences in onResume,

13
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,100
and unregister it in onPause.

14
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,880
When the location status changes, our
onSharedPreferenceChangeListener will

15
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,630
get called, and we can update
the string displayed in the empty view.
