Another important role during a review meeting is that of the recorder.

00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,560
The recorder is responsible for making a record of the issues raised during

a review. Note that it may not be possible to determine in a review meeting

itself whether an issue represents a defect. This determination may

00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:20,660
require some offline research. It is the job of the recorder to proactively

00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,659

00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,450
understands the essence of the problem being discussed.
