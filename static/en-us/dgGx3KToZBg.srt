1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,680
So how do you identify competitors?

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,910
Well, you could always just ask.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:09,105
Ask potential customers how they
solve the same need you solve.

4
00:00:09,105 --> 00:00:11,580
So with the bark myth,
we can go to a dog park and

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,160
talk to different dog owners and
ask them how they solve the problem

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,430
of having someone watch their
dog while they're on vacation.

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,400
We can ask them,
do you take your dog to a kennel?

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,700
Do you get your dog walker to come
a few times a day when you're out?

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,610
Do you ask your friends to watch
your dog when you're gone?

10
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,100
We can try to find out how they do
research to figure out where to

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,175
put their dog.

12
00:00:31,175 --> 00:00:32,905
Maybe it's just word of
mouth between people.

13
00:00:32,905 --> 00:00:34,255
Maybe they go online.

14
00:00:34,255 --> 00:00:36,915
Maybe they ask each
other at the dog park.

15
00:00:36,915 --> 00:00:40,565
Another way to identify your competitors
is to just search for them yourself.

16
00:00:40,565 --> 00:00:42,315
Here, let's try it with a bark myth.

17
00:00:42,315 --> 00:00:44,260
If I search dog sitting online.

18
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,380
I can see who my biggest
competitors are.

19
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,310
Look, the first people who come
up are Rover and Doggy Vacay.

20
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,840
They're very well known
names in the industry.

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,290
And I can see who's buying ads for
this same keyword search.

22
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,920
I want you to take a moment to
think about your own app idea or

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,070
business idea.

24
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,540
Who are your competitors?

25
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,190
I want you to think about some
keywords you would use to search for

26
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,580
your potential business.

27
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,960
And so some search queries to see
whose at the top of the list.

28
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,190
You can check out the Playstore or
any app store to do the same thing.

29
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:16,260
Now if you don't have an app idea
feel free to use a bark myth but

30
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,230
don't use the competitor
examples we already talked about.

31
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,880
Insert the competitors
names in these three boxes.
