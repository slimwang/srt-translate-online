1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,969
Show you an example of erosion, and
here we're eroding with a disk,

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:07,880
a circular disk,
with the origin in the middle, okay?

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:12,020
So this is the original image,
we saw this one before, and

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:17,710
if we erode with a disk of radius 5, you
can see that what's going to happen is,

5
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:22,190
first of all of these lines that
are thin, they all go away.

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,430
Why do they go away?

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,640
They're thinner,
obviously than the size 5.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,890
Or actually it's radius 5.

9
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,150
So they're thinner than size 10.

10
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,170
Alright?
And so, none of,

11
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,240
there's no place you can put that
disk down and have the pixel survive.

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,740
Obviously, there's one Stretch
here that's thick enough, and so

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,910
that lead survives.

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,550
So I make the radius bigger,
this thing, they all go away.

15
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,860
And if I made the radius
even bigger yet,

16
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,300
what happens is all these leads go away.

17
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,230
And also you notice this square
is shrinking by that amount

18
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,800
because the only place.

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,440
That you can fit that inside
there is at this level, and

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,950
so, it's going to pull
away from the edges.

21
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,700
So that's erosion.

22
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:13,658
Now, as you saw, dilation fills holes
and stuff, but it grows your picture.

23
00:01:13,658 --> 00:01:17,310
Erosion removes little things
you might not want there, but

24
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,060
it shrinks your picture.

25
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,370
I don't really want to grow or
shrink my cells.

26
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,180
I just want to disconnect them.

27
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,890
Not my cells, the cells in the picture.

28
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,260
So I don't really want the things
to get bigger or smaller.

29
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,820
I just want to clean them up.

30
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:33,390
Well, so that should make you think
probably I could some eroding followed

31
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,340
by some dilating, or
some dilating followed by some eroding.

32
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,470
And [LAUGH] you'd be exactly right.

33
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:43,360
And those two operations are referred
to as opening and closing.

34
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,890
And, I say here the two most useful
binary morphology operations.

35
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,900
That is just one man's opinion.

36
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,950
My humble, well okay, my not so

37
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,430
humble opinion that that's
probably the most important thing.

38
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,760
And the only reason I say it's most
important, is in many systems that I've

39
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,960
worked on, a, down in the, in the guts,
somewhere we're doing some opening and

40
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,780
closing just to clean up our
binary images a little bit.
