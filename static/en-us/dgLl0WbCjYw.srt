00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,442
All right, so let's take a look at
how we would change the setup in

2
00:00:03,442 --> 00:00:05,530
the NumbersActivity to use a for

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:09,840
loop instead of a while loop to
move through the words list.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,960
So currently in the while loop we
have the setup of the index position,

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,600
the condition, and
update variable all outside.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,240
But remember for the for loop,
we can have that all in one line.

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,231
So now I'm going to go ahead and
remove those three parts.

8
00:00:24,231 --> 00:00:30,541
[BLANK_AUDIO]

9
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:34,719
So what we've done here is start off
with the for keyword, then condense

10
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,378
the three parts of the while loop, the
initial condition, the test condition,

11
00:00:39,378 --> 00:00:42,960
and the updating of the counter,
all into this one line here.

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,080
So the task we want to complete in
each iteration remains the same, so

13
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,360
we won't alter the body of the loop.

14
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,770
So now this is what the final version
of the NumbersActivity using a for

15
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:54,460
loop looks like.
