1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,419
In order to solve this quadratic inequality we need to first factor. When we

2
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:10,726
factor we get that quantities x plus 2 and x minus 1 are less than or equal to

3
00:00:10,726 --> 00:00:16,259
0. This gives us our critical points of x equal negative 2 and x equals 1. So if

4
00:00:16,259 --> 00:00:21,654
you look over here at our number line, we have our number line with the critical

5
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:26,996
points on it, and we will begin to look at which intervals are true or false. So

6
00:00:26,996 --> 00:00:32,070
now you can see we have 3 intervals. We have an interval from negative infinity

7
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,809
to negative 2, from negative 2 to 1, and from 1 to infinity. So if we pick a

8
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:41,975
point in each interval and check to see if it's true, we'll find out where out

9
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:47,357
solution set lies. So, let's check in our first interval, negative infinity to

10
00:00:47,357 --> 00:00:52,049
negative 2. Let's select the point negative 3. So we select negative 3 in

11
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:57,198
interval negative infinity to negative 2. You can see we obtain the solution of

12
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:02,889
4, 4 is not in the interval negative infinity to negative 2. So we selected

13
00:01:02,889 --> 00:01:09,693
three points, let's look at x equals -3 first, when we substitute that in, we

14
00:01:09,693 --> 00:01:14,795
get 4. Is less than or equal to 0 which is not a true statement. The second

15
00:01:14,795 --> 00:01:19,261
point we select is 0 we get negative 2 is less than or equal to 0 we can see

16
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:23,989
that, that is a true statement. And the last point we selected 2 when we

17
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:29,235
substitute that in we get 4 is less than or equal to 0 which is also not a true

18
00:01:29,235 --> 00:01:35,222
statement. So our solution lies between negative 2 and 1, including both of

19
00:01:35,222 --> 00:01:41,287
those points. Our solution is negative 2 is less than or equal to x, which is

20
00:01:41,287 --> 00:01:43,185
less than or equal to 1.
