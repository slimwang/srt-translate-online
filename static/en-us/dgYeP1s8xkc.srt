[Peter] Given 2 strings, s and t, we want to print out udacious

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
without using any quotes, and we're going to do that

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
by using the subsequence operator, the colon.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Let's say we want to get the first 5 characters from s

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and the last 3 from t.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Since we want to print our result out,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
we need the print statement, and let's print our s part first.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We want to go from the beginning, so we're just going to put the colon there,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and we want to go 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Since we want to include the fourth character,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
we're going to go end it at 5.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Now we want the rest to come from t, which are the last 3 characters.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So we're not going to want to start at the beginning.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We want to start at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6th character.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And we want to go to the end.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This will print out udacious without using any quotes, as you can see.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
But there's another solution if you're a true Python guru.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Let's go to the interpreter to try that out.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We have our 2 strings, s and t.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Let's say you're like me, and you don't like counting above the number 4.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And we still want to solve this problem without using any quotes.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So we're going to have our print, and we're going to use

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
everything but the last 2 characters and s, as we did before.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And since we know all we want is everything but the last 2 characters,

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
we can just type in -2.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
This gives us--the first part, we had an s,

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
but without having to count 1 character at a time until the end.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Let's do this same thing with t.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Here we have a little different problem.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We want to start with the last 3 characters.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We're going to use the same negative notation

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and go all the way to the end.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
This gives us our 2 parts,

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
so all we have to do is combine them.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And we get this result without having to count really at all.
