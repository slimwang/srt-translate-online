00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,089
What do you think is the biggest challenge facing the field of interactive rendering at this point?

2
00:00:04,115 --> 00:00:07,537
I think it's mobile graphics. Everything seems, everything is going in that

3
00:00:07,537 --> 00:00:11,206
direction right now. Things are moving away from the desktop onto the pads and

4
00:00:11,206 --> 00:00:16,364
the phones. And when you go from a standpoint of trying to get performance per

5
00:00:16,364 --> 00:00:21,165
dollar or performance per, in the, in the film industry it's performance for

6
00:00:21,165 --> 00:00:24,930
BTU of cooling capacity.

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:25,280
[LAUGH]

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,430
And now we're going into, performance per watt of power that you can have, on

9
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:33,144
your device. It, that's a really interesting challenge for how to get what you

10
00:00:33,144 --> 00:00:37,255
want on your device for that little tiny bit of power.

11
00:00:37,255 --> 00:00:42,924
>> Managing complexity. We have so much high definition data, like. Sometimes you

12
00:00:42,924 --> 00:00:46,401
just want to render a house but the bolts in the house all contain a million

13
00:00:46,401 --> 00:00:52,496
polygons. How do you turn that rich information into something that is just the

14
00:00:52,496 --> 00:01:00,380
most important for rendering a pretty image? I think that's the big thing.

15
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,223
>> I think in my field, coming from that, that maker, everyone is a designer,

16
00:01:04,223 --> 00:01:08,381
standpoint, is, is that, that play between 3D printing, and physical objects,

17
00:01:08,381 --> 00:01:12,287
and rendering, and the, the hardship that is when I create something on the

18
00:01:12,287 --> 00:01:20,068
screen, I can do it in whatever I want. When I create that reality, sometimes

19
00:01:20,068 --> 00:01:20,731
the reality doesn't

20
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:21,004
[LAUGH]

21
00:01:21,004 --> 00:01:22,570
match up with the rendering.
