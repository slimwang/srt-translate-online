00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,906
Let's try a third problem on working together. It takes Melissa 2 hours longer

2
00:00:03,906 --> 00:00:08,584
to edit a short film than it takes Carlos, who is a professional editor. If it

3
00:00:08,584 --> 00:00:13,305
takes them 2 and 4 10th hours to edit a short film as a team. How long would it

4
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:18,056
take them to do it alone? Now, before we saw for each person's time to edit the

5
00:00:18,056 --> 00:00:22,754
film alone, let's find an equation. Enter the equation in here and you want to

6
00:00:22,754 --> 00:00:26,580
make sure that you use x as your variable. Good luck.
