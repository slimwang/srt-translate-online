1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And Quantum Mechanics provides a notion of random events

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
--that there are events in the universe that are inherently random--

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and we can count things like radioactive decay with a Geiger counter

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and use that to generate randomness from physical events.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Thermal noise is an easier thing to measure in most circumstances.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If you can measure that precisely enough--it also depends on Quantum Mechanics--

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
at some level and produces randomness.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And many modern processors have a way of generating a small amount

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
of randomness by measuring thermal noise in the processor.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Whether it's really physically random depends on a lot of other things.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You can also look at things that actually happen, and think that

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
they are random. Maybe if they're key presses or user actions--

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
maybe those are random. An example of this is when we generate

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
a new key using GPG, it will ask you to generate

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
--when you start to generate a key--it says we need lots of random bytes

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and you can perform some type of action like moving the mouse using the disc

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
to help generate more randomness for it.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And humans aren't good at doing random stuff

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
When we move the mouse, we're probably moving it in a pattern--

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
When we type on the keyboard, maybe we're doing things

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
that are not very random. So unless you're generating your randomness from

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
quantum physics, there's always some question whether it's really random enough.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Or whether you can predict the particular motions I took. And certainly

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
given that this has been recorded and released, the fake key that I generated

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
for Alyssa B. Hacker should not be used for any secure purpose.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So this approach of waiting for physically random events

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
is OK for GPG, maybe, because someone using it is

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
probably patient enough to sit around for a while, doing random stuff

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
as well as a human can to generate a key.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This would not work very well when you need more randomness

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
more quickly. And this happens every time you do a web transaction.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Every time someone does a secure web session,

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
any time you see the lock key in your browser,

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
there's a protocol going on called TLS. We'll talk about that more in a later unit.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But one thing that that requires is a new random key.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
for each secure web session.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I don't think many people would tolerate being asked to move around their mouse

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
and do strange things to generate enough randomness in the hopes that

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
that key is secure every time you connect to a website.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So we need something better. We need a way to take a little bit

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
of physical randomness, and that's usually known as the seed--

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
that's the initial state, and that's the input to what's known

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
as a pseudo-random number generator. And that produces

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
a long sequence--that is longer than the amount of physical randomness

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
we started with--of random bits.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So that's our goal--to take a small amount of physical randomness

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
--some source of entropy that we can use as a seed--

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
have some function that will compute from that seed a long sequence

49
00:03:00,000 --> 99:59:59,999
of apparently random bits.
