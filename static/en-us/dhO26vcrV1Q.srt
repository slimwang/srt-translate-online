1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Your first task was to fill in the rest of the code of this for loop down here.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So the first thing that we changed is the wood density.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The new wood density is going to be equal to the old wood density

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
minus the time step times the burn rate.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Since remember the burn rate is really just the time derivative of the wood density.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Now for the change in temperature. Of course, we start with the initial temperature.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And then we add to it h times a bunch of stuff.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Now all of this code is just taking into account those four factors that we were saying

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
influenced the change in temperature.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So the first thing we have right here you can see is a 2D heat equation.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And this is actually implemented using the finite difference scheme.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
After this, we also take into account heat loss and then the wind and then also the combustion.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Now going up to the top of our wildfire function,

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
let's talk about this initial distribution of wood density.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This first line right here is just a translation of that mathematical expression

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I had written out for you.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The y intercept of the point that we're considering is just equal to some y value

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
minus the slope that we're given times x and actually this xy

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
is the xy that we're talking about at this moment.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
That means that the wood density then is equal to wood value 1.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Well, a bunch of typos. Well that's a problem. Let's fix that right now.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
See everyone makes mistakes. This should be wood 2. This should be wood 1.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Okay now that all of that is fixed we have the wood density at our point xy

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
is equal to wood 1 the maximum possible wood density plus all of this.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This is the difference between wood 2 and wood 1.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's that range in which w is allowed to vary

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
across the terrain divided by the difference between intercepts.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So you remember on the graph that I showed you earlier.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
This graph right here actually.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That is the slope of this line since wood density here is on the y axis

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and the intercept is actually on the x axis.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
If we take the difference in wood density divided by the difference in intercept

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
we get the slope of this pink line right here.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So now you can see that we have the slope of that pink line times the intercept of the line

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
up to the point we're considering is on minus intercept 1.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So this is really just using point slope form to calculate w.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Remember, we only want w to range between wood 1 and wood 2.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So this line restricts it to that range. Now let's look at the plot we get.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So finally a graph of our forest.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
In both images, we're looking at the xy square of terrain that we've been talking about.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Here we're graphing the temperature shown by these different colors,

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
and here we're graphing the density of wood.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Now unfortunately this is only a 50 x 50 pixel image.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
If we wanted to see what's happening with much better resolution, we should use 200 x 200.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Unfortunately my computer is not cooperating so we're going to have to settle

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
for this less perfect image.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Even though this isn't really a perfect picture,

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
you can still tell that the wood has been depleted in the center.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The density of wood is very low right here compared to the rest of the area

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
where the fire hasn't spread yet.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You can also see that as we wanted the density of the wood does vary along lines like this.

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
In the 200 x 200 image, you would be able to see that the wood had been

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
very depleted in the center and that the fire had marched out the rim of this area.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We can kind of tell that there is sort of a red circle around here.

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
However, we'd be able to better that the fire is moving slower,

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and it's less hot in the area where there's less wood.

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The spreading the fire is way to slow on this image and one reason for that is that

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
the heat is averaged over larger pixels so actually not lowering the temperature

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
reached the temperature of ignition in a lot of places.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I hope you found talking about wildfires as exciting as I have.

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Awesome job on this problem and throughout the entire course.

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I hope you're excited for the final exam.

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I think it'll give you a great look at a ton of different examples

64
00:03:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
not just from the material we've learned about but also from some new kinds of applications.
