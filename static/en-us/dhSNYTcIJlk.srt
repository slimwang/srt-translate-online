1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,790
Okay now for
something a little more hands on.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,620
I want you to analyze one of
the Android Wear samples and

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,930
answer some questions
about how it works.

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:10,920
So you will need to use the input
sample feature of Android Studio and

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,630
search for Data Layer.

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,190
You should build and install the sample
to both the phone and a wearable or

7
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,580
a phone and an emulator.

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,700
When it's running, you'll see
things happening on both sides.

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,270
Once you've got that working,
I want you to review the source code and

10
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,500
then we're going to answer
the following questions.

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,330
First one, is what transmission
mechanism is used in

12
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,650
the send start activity
message on the phone side?

13
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,190
This method here is used to launch
the activity on the wearable.

14
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,420
And the second question is what
thread does the send start

15
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,960
activity message run on?
