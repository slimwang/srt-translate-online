1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,418
For the lower bound, we have our point estimate for the differences, 15.14,

2
00:00:04,418 --> 00:00:10,525
minus the t critical value. Before using the positive value, we'll subtract it.

3
00:00:10,525 --> 00:00:15,965
That's the same as adding the negative t critical value, if we were to use that

4
00:00:15,965 --> 00:00:23,280
one, times the standard error, 15.72. And we get about negative 18.19. Since we

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,620
got a negative value for our lower bound, then it's possible that males own

6
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:34,290
more shoes than females. That if we subtract them, we'll get a negative value.

7
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:42,326
For our upper bound, we'll do the same thing, 15.14 plus 2.12. And note that

8
00:00:42,326 --> 00:00:45,910
that's the same as subtracting negative 2.12, if we were to use the negative t

9
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:50,490
critical value, times 15.72. This comes out to 48.47. Good job.
