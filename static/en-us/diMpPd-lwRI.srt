00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,030
So to review,
this first step is all about our layout.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,110
You need to create a new layout for
our getting the current location.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,390
And also grab the system icons.

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,350
But then you need to modify
LocationEditTextPreference

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,950
to issue a toast when
the widget is clicked.

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,450
Also, make sure you are only displaying
the widget when Google Play services is

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,820
available.

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,070
So to see the code that we went over,

9
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,470
check out the GitHub commit link
in the instructor notes below.

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,090
You'll need to implement each of these
changes in your app before moving on.

11
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,310
And once your code is ready, go ahead
and just click here to let us know.
