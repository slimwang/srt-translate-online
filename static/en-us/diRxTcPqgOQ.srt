1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,190
And in computer graphics and in computer vision,

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:07,800
what we often do is we combine that diffuse and the specular.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,640
And it's referred to as the Phong model because Phong was one of

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,450
the first people to do it.

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:12,630
Then there's the Blinn Phong model.

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,590
And there's lot of models that have increased beyond that.

7
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,100
But the idea, basically, is that you say that.

8
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,170
You can model the BRDF of lots of surfaces,

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,870
as a combination of a Lambertian plus a Specular.

10
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,220
So we have the Lambertian which is the,

11
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,930
you know, everything looks equally bright from all directions.

12
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,130
That's what these equal sized arrows are meant to show you.

13
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,760
Remember, the light doesn't go out equally.

14
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,970
It just looks equally bright.

15
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:44,800
Plus the Specular Model whose sort of blur amount is defined by that fall off.

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,630
And when you combine those you can get sort of the Matte plus the Specular.

17
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,900
And here's an example of some recovered imaging where here you

18
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:57,755
have a original image, and here you've sort of broken it down into the.

19
00:00:57,755 --> 00:01:00,980
Matte components and the sepcular components.

20
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,519
Likewise here you have this object that has the, the matte surface.

21
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:08,600
That's the paint itself, plus the glossiness of the varnish.

22
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,350
Or whatever it is.

23
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,059
When you, what, what is it you put on top of ceramics to make it glossy?

24
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,130
>> Gloss? >> Gloss, thank you very much.

25
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,610
Okay, and the idea is that this is the matte component and again,

26
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,010
this is the specular component.

27
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:25,130
And the ability to pull those out, is a computer vision problem.
