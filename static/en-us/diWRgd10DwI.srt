00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,687
Note that web audio is still not fully supported in all browsers, it's

2
00:00:03,687 --> 00:00:07,531
supported in web kit browsers only today and Mozilla is actively working on

3
00:00:07,531 --> 00:00:12,841
adding support for it in Firefox. It would be nice if we caught this and let

4
00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:15,661
potential players running in those browsers know that they might have a

5
00:00:15,661 --> 00:00:19,878
degraded experience. In order to do this, we need to catch any exceptions when

6
00:00:19,878 --> 00:00:24,670
we try to initialize our sound manager class and alert the player. Go ahead and

7
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,691
fill in the init function shown here, catching any exceptions to the

8
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:30,564
WebKitAudioContext initializer throws.
