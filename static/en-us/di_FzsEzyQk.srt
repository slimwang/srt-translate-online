1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay. Let's learn about another form element.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Instead of checkboxes, I want to use radio buttons.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So let's change the word from "checkbox" to "radio"

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
for these 3 inputs.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Okay. I've changed "checkbox" to "radio" for these 3 inputs,

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
for the type="radio",

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and I've left the names the same: "q", "r", and "s".

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's take a look at this in our browser.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Okay. Here we are in our browser, and you can see

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
we have our 3 radio buttons instead of checkboxes.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And I can turn a Radio on by clicking on it.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And if I click on a different radio button,

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
it also turns on.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Now that's probably not the behavior you were expecting.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Normally, when we have radio buttons,

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
they behave in a group.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
These ones, obviously, aren't doing that.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What happens when I click the Submit button here?

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You can see that they behave, actually, just like the checkboxes do:

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
q=on, r=on, and s=on.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So these are--basically what we here are checkboxes

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
that you can't be unchecked--

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
really convenient, right?

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So now you know how radio buttons normally behave.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I should be able to select the second one and the first one should go off.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,577
How do you think we might accomplish that?
