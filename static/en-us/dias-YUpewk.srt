00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,440
I wanted to continue my investigation, so I decided

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,620
to add another term. This time I used the

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,780
word election. And here's what was interesting, I noticed

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,620
these peaks spaced evenly out over time. And then I

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,660
realized that these peaks made a lot of sense

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,180
because the US Presidential election occurs every four years

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,790
in November. If I hover right over the graph,

8
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,840
I can see these peaks in November. Finally, I wanted

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,860
to see if there was a word that appeared more than

10
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,890
any of these other words in the last few years. So,

11
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,580
I typed in the word Facebook. This created a drastic change

12
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,010
in the vertical scale in the graph. And I noticed Facebook

13
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,140
didn't even come out on the scene until around 2007. I

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,930
think it's pretty cool that a word such as Facebook draws

15
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,980
words like chicken, music and movies. Facebook is certainly the giant

16
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,870
when it comes to this graph. This is one small example of

17
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,100
how data is everywhere around us and it's waiting

18
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,610
to be explored. Let's have you get your hands

19
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,697
dirty, by performing your own trend analysis. Search for

20
00:00:58,697 --> 00:01:01,506
celebrities, music, movies, or anything else that you find

21
00:01:01,506 --> 00:01:04,330
interesting. You can use the time series graph that

22
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,150
I used, or something else on the site. Once

23
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,440
you've got your exploration, share it on the forums,

24
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,340
and comment on any posts that you find interesting.
