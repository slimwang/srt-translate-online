1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,798
You need to pick your
investors very carefully,

2
00:00:03,798 --> 00:00:08,328
probably as carefully that you want
to pick your your co-founders.

3
00:00:08,328 --> 00:00:12,132
Because while you can
part from a co-founder,

4
00:00:12,132 --> 00:00:16,090
it's very hard to part form an investor.

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,111
He have money.

6
00:00:18,111 --> 00:00:23,386
He put money in your company and
the money's gone, and what now?

7
00:00:23,386 --> 00:00:25,490
It will be very hard to buy him out.

8
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,834
So, you need to make
sure that you're taking

9
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:33,322
money from someone you can work with and
you can learn form and

10
00:00:33,322 --> 00:00:36,761
can bring actual value
to you in your company.

11
00:00:36,761 --> 00:00:42,898
Because if you're working with someone
who just can't bring you money.

12
00:00:42,898 --> 00:00:47,417
There's this horrific expression,
friends, fools and family.

13
00:00:47,417 --> 00:00:50,377
And what is fools?

14
00:00:50,377 --> 00:00:52,455
You're taking money from a fool.

15
00:00:52,455 --> 00:00:53,489
It's so bad.

16
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:57,185
It's getting the entrepreneur
condescending, yeah,

17
00:00:57,185 --> 00:00:59,346
I'll take money from that fool.

18
00:00:59,346 --> 00:01:02,830
Or you're taking money from
someone who can't help you.

19
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:07,110
It's horrible and
it makes entrepreneur seems stupid.

20
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,869
So, never take money from a fool.

21
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,889
And try not to take
money from family also.

22
00:01:11,889 --> 00:01:12,852
And not from friends.

23
00:01:12,852 --> 00:01:17,577
I hate that expression,
family, friends, it's horrific.

24
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:23,842
But choosing the right investor
can make or break your company.

25
00:01:23,842 --> 00:01:27,742
Because a bad investor that try
to micromanage the company and

26
00:01:27,742 --> 00:01:29,318
try to micromanage you.

27
00:01:29,318 --> 00:01:30,978
And demands explanations.

28
00:01:30,978 --> 00:01:35,075
And wants to be involved in everything.

29
00:01:35,075 --> 00:01:38,208
Can really make you miserable.

30
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:43,073
And if you're not experienced you don't
know how to put him in his place.

31
00:01:43,073 --> 00:01:48,533
And it can make your life very,
very hard.

32
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:53,420
A good investor can make your company,
can help you do everything.

33
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,161
But a bad investor, and

34
00:01:55,161 --> 00:02:00,740
there's more bad investors than good
investors, can really hurt you.

35
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:07,020
And there's not enough money in
the world to to make this worthwhile.
