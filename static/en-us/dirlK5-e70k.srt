1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,320
There was a more recent application of SIFT.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,550
Very explicit.

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,760
You guys, I don't know how old you are anymore, but

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,240
maybe you remember the Sony AIBOs, the dogs that used to go around and

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,380
would recharge themselves and live in your house.

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,360
It was sort of an experiment that Sony did for a while.

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,888
It was kind of successful, but eventually they stopped making them,

8
00:00:18,888 --> 00:00:22,540
because I think, I think they were learning from it and moving from there.

9
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,450
Well, one of the things that the dog could do, well there were two things.

10
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:31,430
It could recharge itself and you could show it cards and

11
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,110
it would do the commandment based upon what was draw on the card,

12
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,220
what was printed on the card.

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,570
And the way it did that was using SIFT features.

14
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,190
All right?

15
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,330
So the charging station had a pattern on it, and as the dog walked around and

16
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:47,720
just did kind of whatever it did,

17
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,086
whatever little robot dogs do, it would see this pattern.

18
00:00:51,086 --> 00:00:51,710
It would be oriented,

19
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:56,030
it would be translated off to the side somewhere at a different scale.

20
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:00,040
But remember, SIFT is translation, rotation scale, and variant.

21
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,430
So it could find the charging station.

22
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,510
Also, they had these what were called visual cards.

23
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,840
And they were things like this.

24
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,790
And it doesn't really matter at all what's on the cards as long as

25
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,050
they have gradients distributed all over them.

26
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,780
The dog can recognize which card you're showing it.

27
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,980
You know, I said it doesn't matter at all what's on it.

28
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,760
It does matter a little.

29
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,440
It has to not look like anything the dog would see otherwise.

30
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,440
So if you wonder why do these cards look so

31
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,200
strange, it's because it can't look like my dining room table.

32
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,280
Because if it looks like my dining room table, my dog will look see

33
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,850
my dining room table, and roll over and play dead or whatever robot dogs do.
