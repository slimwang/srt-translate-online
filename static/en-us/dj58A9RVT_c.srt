We know our equation is in slope intercept form, so the y intercept is b, or in

2
00:00:04,737 --> 00:00:09,611
this case, negative 1. So, our line has to cross the y-axis at negative 1. That

3
00:00:09,611 --> 00:00:14,541
would be this point here. We don't move horizontally on the x-axis, because the

4
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:19,398
x coordinate is 0. The y value is negative 1, so we move down. Nice work if you

5
00:00:19,398 --> 00:00:19,871
got it.
