In the sample code provided you'll notice

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,000
that we create a Http Url connection. To

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,430
use Http to send and receive data over

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,960
the network, we have two clients on Android.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,740
The Http Url connection class, as well as

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,700
the patchy Http Client class. Both options support

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,010
Https, streaming uploads and downloads, configurable time outs,

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,460
IPB 6 and connection pooling. We recommend the

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,850
Http Url Connection class because it's general purpose and light

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,730
weight, and it's been optimized to suit the needs of

11
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,460
most Android apps. To learn more about connecting to the

12
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,130
network, see the training guide and blog post link below.
