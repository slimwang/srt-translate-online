00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,590
The first thing we need to do is just substitute each side of the equation into

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:09,270
our log operators or our natural log operators rather. Taking the natural log

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:15,610
of each side gives us natural log of e to the negative 0.5t equals natural log

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:21,310
of 5 over 1000. We can simplify the left hand side by remembering that natural

5
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:26,810
log and e taken to an exponent are inverse operations. Or inverse functions.

6
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:31,520
That means that all that's left on the left hand side is negative 0.5t. For

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,999
now, let's just keep the right hand side the same.
