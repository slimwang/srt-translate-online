00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,650
Flipping a coin is the best option because it's random. So, the logic here is

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,020
that there's a million different variables that can effect somebody's reaction

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:13,340
time. Whether you're old or young, male or female or how much you slept last

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:18,220
night. All of these things may or may not influence reaction time, but these

5
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,800
aren't the variables we're interested in.
