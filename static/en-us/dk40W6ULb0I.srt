00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So the first main topic we'll introduce is symmetric cryptosystems.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Symmetric means both encryption and decryption are done with the same key.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I want to introduce some terminology that we'll use throughout the course.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So we can think of encryption as a function,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and it takes as input a plain text--this is the unencrypted message--

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
it outputs a ciphertext, and then our goal is to be able

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
to send that ciphertext over an insecure channel.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This could be a wireless network, this could be the internet,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
this could be a courier carrying your message,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
any channel where we can't trust the channel to be secure.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We hope what comes out of the channel is the same ciphertext we put into it.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Then that goes into a decryption function, and what comes out

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
is the message that we sent it.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Our cast of characters--we often talk about Alice sending the message,

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Bob receiving it.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We also have malicious characters who might be listening in on this channel.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
One of those is called Eve--for eavesdropper--and she has really big ears

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and can hear the messages sent between Alice and Bob,

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
but she only hears what's sent over the insecure channel,

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
she doesn't have access to the plain text--that's the input to the encryption function--

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
or the plain text that comes out of the decryption function at the other end.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But she can hear the ciphertext that's sent over the insecure channel.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
To think about this a little more precisely,

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
the plain text is some message, and it's selected from a set of messages.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So, M is the set of all possible messages,

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and M could be finite--for a given length, M is finite--

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
and we'll often be thinking about fixed-length messages,

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
so there's a finite set of them, and M is some message selected from that set.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The ciphertext is C--selected from the set of all possible ciphertexts,

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and the encryption and decryption functions are functions.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The encryption function--as shown here--

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
is a function that goes from an element of M to an element of C.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The decryption function goes from an element of C--a ciphertext--to an element of M.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
In order for Bob to receive the same message as the one Alice encrypted,

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
we need this property--that the D function is an inverse of the M function.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So we need it to be the case for all messages.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
The result of decryption the encryption of that message is the same as the message we started with.
