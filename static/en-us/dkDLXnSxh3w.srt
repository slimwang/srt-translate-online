00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,732
The first thing that I notice when I look at this, and really the first thing

2
00:00:03,732 --> 00:00:07,572
that you should check for whenever you look at any polynomial expression, is

3
00:00:07,572 --> 00:00:11,464
that there's a common factor of 2, in every term in the expression. So let's

4
00:00:11,464 --> 00:00:15,333
start by pulling that out. Now we only need to concern ourselves with what's

5
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:19,176
inside these parenthesis, just have to make sure that we don't lose track of

6
00:00:19,176 --> 00:00:24,008
this 2. Now it's time to factor by grouping. You can pull out 2x squared, out of

7
00:00:24,008 --> 00:00:28,616
these first 2 terms, and the last 2 terms are a little bit tricky, because they

8
00:00:28,616 --> 00:00:33,048
only share a factor of, well, 1, so that is what we will write. Luckily, we

9
00:00:33,048 --> 00:00:37,899
still see that we have a common factor, between the two terms we have left. The

10
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:41,805
fully factored form of this is then, 2 times the quantity x minus 3 times the

11
00:00:41,805 --> 00:00:45,934
quantity of 2x squared plus 1. Now in the event that you forgot to pull out the

12
00:00:45,934 --> 00:00:49,964
common factor of 2 at the very beginning, all is not lost, we can still solve

13
00:00:49,964 --> 00:00:53,847
the problem that way too, lets check it out. If we start off by grouping,

14
00:00:53,847 --> 00:00:58,137
instead of pulling the common factor of 2, then we can just proceed by factoring

15
00:00:58,137 --> 00:01:02,575
by grouping as normal. We end up with x minus 3, times 4x squared plus 2. At

16
00:01:02,575 --> 00:01:07,191
this point, however, when we think that we're fully factored. We have to take

17
00:01:07,191 --> 00:01:12,001
that last step to double check, and make sure that neither of these factors has

18
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:16,684
a greatest common factor greater than 1. We see, however, that this term, 4x

19
00:01:16,684 --> 00:01:21,556
squared plus 2, has a common factor of 2 between its terms. Then we pull that

20
00:01:21,556 --> 00:01:25,994
out. And that is what gives us our final factored form, which of course is the

21
00:01:25,994 --> 00:01:30,051
same answer that we got doing the problem the other way. Awesome job.
