1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
To do this with math, the main operation we need is multiplication.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
There's a few key properties of multiplication that we'll take advantage of.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The first is that it's commutative.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That means that a times b is always equal to b times a.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This is true on integers.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's also true using any modulus.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This property also holds for powers of powers.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That means for any integers, a to the b based to the c power,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
well, that's equivalent to a to the b times a to the b times a to the b c times,

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
which is equivalent to a to the b times c.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm just adding powers when we multiply here,

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
which is also equivalent to a to the c times b.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We know that from the commutative property of multiplication,

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
which is also equivalent to a to the c to the b.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Using the same property here, a to the c, a to the c b times.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
These things are all equivalent, and they're also equivalent

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
with modular multiplication as well.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
That's the main property the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange takes advantage of,

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and I'm going to show you the protocol next, and then we'll talk about

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
why it's secure and some of the details in actually implementing it.
