1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,940
So let's do a little example here just to get a feel for

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,160
what you can do in continuous output spaces with machine learning.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,870
It's a contrived example, but suppose we graph all the people in the world and

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,170
record their age and their net worth.

5
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:18,270
If you don't know what net worth is, this is kind of the total money that you

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,340
kind of own, both in cash, and houses, and cars, and so on.

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,850
And just for the sake of the argument,

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:31,970
let me assume there aren't quite seven billion people, and the relationship

9
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:36,940
between net worth and age looks about like this.

10
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,770
In reality, that's often not the case.

11
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,870
But let's assume that's the case here.

12
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:45,000
I now want you to fit an imaginary line through the data and

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,030
pick two of the points I'm kind of marking here,

14
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,520
as two representative points to which the line would go.

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,060
Just click on two of those points that best represent the line,

16
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,310
that best describes the data.
