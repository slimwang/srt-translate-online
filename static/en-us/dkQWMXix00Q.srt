What do you have, David?

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:04,700
>> So with the Morgan's Law,
we take the negation on the outside and

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:09,330
apply individually to the predicates
on the inside, and flip the operator.

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,340
So has-wings becomes not-has-wings,
not-has fur because has-fur.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,530
And the and becomes an or.
