1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,940
Now that we know how to save,
we're pretty much set.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,710
One thing to keep in mind though
as we mentioned before is that

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:08,450
when you save this is where
what you're saving is validated

4
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,420
against the data model you've created.

5
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,490
So this means if the object you're
saving doesn't have everything the model

6
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,400
says it should or it doesn't fit
the model's description of what it

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,150
should be,
you'll be looking at an app crash.

8
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,100
This is where it's important
to recheck your model and

9
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,030
make sure things match up.

10
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:27,210
>> One of the most common places for
this issue to arise is with deletion.

11
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,110
Let's take a look at our model again.

12
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:35,960
The deletion rule for our notebooks
notes relationship is cascade.

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,300
This means it will delete
all the associated notes.

14
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,140
That sounds reasonable.

15
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,580
If we look at the inverse relationship

16
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:51,270
that notebook relationship with a note
the deletion rule is nullified.

17
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,340
This means that when a note is deleted,

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,630
all the references to it are removed or
made no.

19
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,660
The notebook just
forgets about that note.

20
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,660
This also sounds reasonable.

21
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:10,820
But what if by mistake, we set the note
deletion rule to cascade also?

22
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:16,150
Then if we delete a notebook, core
data it will try to delete the notes.

23
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:20,400
However, if the note
deletion rule is cascade,

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,040
core data will then try to
delete the notebook again.

25
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,010
Trying to delete an object twice
is a sure recipe for an app crash.

26
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,720
This is a very common beginner mistake,
so

27
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,960
make sure your deletion
rules make sense.
