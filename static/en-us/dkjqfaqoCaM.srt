1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,220
If you've watched any of the other
interviews I've done here at Udacity

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,800
you'll notice that I'm in
the other chair today,

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,330
and that's because we're talking about
a topic that is very important to me.

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,730
My dissertation research was on using
an intelligent tutoring system in

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,876
an exploratory learning environment
to teach students meta-cognition.

6
00:00:14,876 --> 00:00:18,390
And meta-cognition is really the thing
I'm ultimately most interested in, so

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,780
I'll be talking about that today.

8
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,240
Also, Jason has again agreed to give me
my questions for this little interview.

9
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,570
>> All right David, let's get started.

10
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,140
Why do you have so
much interest in meta-cognition?

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,170
>> So the main reason I have a lot
of interest in meta-cognition

12
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,330
is that there's actually research,
that you've probably covered so

13
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,940
far in this lesson,
that shows that meta-cognition

14
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,190
is the chief determinant in
students success going forward.

15
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,250
That if there's on thing we can
teach them, that will really

16
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,400
ensure that they're successful in later
academic career, it's meta-cognition.

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,980
It's thinking about how do I learn,
what are the best processes for me?

18
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,010
How do I monitor that when I'm trying
to learn something if I'm struggling.

19
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,623
Instead of just continuing
to just struggle and

20
00:00:52,623 --> 00:00:55,300
assume that there's something wrong
with me if I can't learn this material.

21
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,184
How can I actually reflect on this,
and say what is it about this that I'm

22
00:00:58,184 --> 00:01:00,590
struggling with, and
how can I adjust for that?

23
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,140
So to really treat the learning
process as a first class object.

24
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,050
Really think about that as a part of the
learning, that the process is something

25
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,460
that I can control,
that I get to drive my own learning.

26
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,970
And this is really important because,
it's kind of that old principle,

27
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,010
if you teach a man to fish,
he'll eat for a lifetime.

28
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,300
If you teach a person to learn,
they'll learn for a lifetime.

29
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,566
Many times in education we're focused
on teaching students some material, and

30
00:01:23,566 --> 00:01:26,840
the material is very important and
I would never insult that.

31
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,841
But if you teach a student
to learn in general,

32
00:01:28,841 --> 00:01:31,355
that's really going to help
them later in their life, and

33
00:01:31,355 --> 00:01:34,330
that's the main reason I'm most
interested in meta-cognition.

34
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,920
I think that philosophically, it's what
really determines students success, and

35
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,170
there's also empirical
evidence that says that.

36
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,230
A student's mindset towards learning
is what will determine whether or

37
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,020
not they're successful at new
things that they come across.

38
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,210
>> Oh wow.
That's pretty powerful.

39
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:48,920
>> Yeah.
>> What

40
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,250
are some of the main challenges in
teaching students about meta-cognition?

41
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,120
>> So the main challenge is
that meta-cognition by its very

42
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,610
definition is inside the head.

43
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,680
It's I'm thinking about my own thinking.

44
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,730
So the thinking is inside the head, but
at least when I'm thinking about like

45
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,300
the cameras that are in front of me,
I can think about how they work.

46
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,010
I can reason about them physically.

47
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:06,880
I can reach out.

48
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,520
I can adjust them.

49
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,758
I can manipulate them.

50
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,390
When I'm thinking about thinking, I'm
thinking about something that's inside

51
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:15,450
my head as well, and so
if I'm teaching somebody algebra,

52
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,210
I can look at the output
of what they're doing.

53
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,334
But with meta-cognition,

54
00:02:18,334 --> 00:02:21,360
I'm not looking explicitly on
the output of their meta-cognition.

55
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,284
I'm looking at the output of
the thought that was reasoned over, so

56
00:02:24,284 --> 00:02:27,517
there's a couple layers of separation
away, we're talking so much about

57
00:02:27,517 --> 00:02:31,085
thinking about thinking, it's a little
bit hard to even have the conversation.

58
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:33,029
>> [LAUGH]
>> That's part of the reason why it's so

59
00:02:33,029 --> 00:02:35,590
difficult, is that,
what are we thinking about and when.

60
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,060
So that's part of the difficulty.

61
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,020
But because we're not operating
on something that we can see,

62
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,590
we're kind of feeling around in
the dark, and we're trying to figure out

63
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,020
what a person is really thinking
underneath the hood, so to speak.

64
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,350
Can I look at the things that you're
actually outputting, or saying, or

65
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,490
writing, and
use that to infer something about

66
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,300
the meta-cognition that went into it,
and it's very difficult.

67
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,790
And it's difficult for human tutors,
for AI tutors it's even more difficult,

68
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,110
because they don't have the benefit
of all the information that we have.

69
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:07,705
They don't have the nat's of the human
empathy that I think a lot of teaching

70
00:03:07,705 --> 00:03:10,810
meta-cognition to another person is
that you're a person, I'm a person.

71
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,870
To a certain extent,
I can put myself inside your mind, and

72
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,510
I can kind of re-simulate that.

73
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,640
Computers have no natural
ability to do that.

74
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,470
>> Right.
>> So even just building in

75
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,950
human empathy, or human thought,
or human, approaches to problems,

76
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,580
is part of being able to teach them
to do, to teach meta-cognition.

77
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,610
So yeah, the main reason it's difficult
is what we're operating on is invisible,

78
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,890
and it's not easy to manipulate
something you can't see.

79
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:34,850
>> For sure.
>> Yeah.

80
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,140
>> How can technology foster
meta-cognitive development?

81
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,630
>> So even the main thing that we first
have to wrestle with is exactly the same

82
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,090
issue that I mentioned before.

83
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,750
The main challenge to facilitating
meta-cognitive development

84
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,900
is making the invisible visible.

85
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,355
>> Right
>> Taking what's invisible

86
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:51,680
inside the brain and putting it out
on the page, putting it in software,

87
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,760
somewhere like that.

88
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,280
And so the way we can do that, is by
structuring the environment in which

89
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,310
this development takes place, such that
students have to make that explicit.

90
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,975
So one way we can do it is by
asking them to do what we call

91
00:04:04,975 --> 00:04:07,860
think-aloud protocol, which is where
they go through an activity and

92
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,930
just think aloud about it.

93
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,730
It's not the best approach because
research has shown that, when I ask you,

94
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,240
while you're doing whatever you're about
to do, tell me what you're thinking?

95
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,253
It actually changes the way you think,
and so I don't get at the root of what

96
00:04:20,253 --> 00:04:23,840
you would really think if you
weren't actively reflecting on it.

97
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,103
But at the same time it gives you
a learning experience of making your

98
00:04:27,103 --> 00:04:30,194
own thought process explicit,
which is very valuable that even

99
00:04:30,194 --> 00:04:33,420
sometimes just making students
aware of what they're thinking.

100
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,316
Even if we're not entirely sure what
they're actually thinking, just forcing

101
00:04:36,316 --> 00:04:39,560
them to reflect on it can be the most
valuable learning experience of all.

102
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,950
But in my dissertation research,
what I ended up doing was taking

103
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,180
a certain part of the activity
that students were completing and

104
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,080
asking them to output that to the page.

105
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,190
So it was constructing theories to
explain natural phenomenon, and

106
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,330
part of that is why do I
believe what I believe.

107
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,550
That's part of meta-cognition,

108
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,940
is reflecting on the internal
reasons that underly my beliefs.

109
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,310
And so we took that and basically said,
take whatever it is that makes you

110
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:07,380
believe what you're currently believing,
and put it on the page.

111
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,510
Code it in a certain way as a kind
of classification system of saying

112
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,050
this is an example of
this kind of belief,

113
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,630
this is an example of this kind
of belief, and put it out there.

114
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,280
So we're making explicit, something
about the meta-cognitive process.

115
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,360
It's not always easy.

116
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,180
Actually, it's never easy, but
it's not always impossible, but for

117
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,010
certain domains, we can do some
things where students are asked

118
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:28,310
to make their meta-cognitive
process explicit.

119
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,720
And in fact, it's something that we do,
I think, really strongly in this class,

120
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,950
or at least we try to,

121
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:36,360
which is take the way you think about
the course material and externalize it.

122
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,216
Externalize it into context
to your own problems.

123
00:05:38,216 --> 00:05:41,989
Externalize it in the context of the
solution that you'd like to develop, and

124
00:05:41,989 --> 00:05:42,650
share that with your classmates.

125
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:46,083
And in that way, you're sharing a little
bit about how you approach the problem,

126
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:49,219
and how you're thinking about a problem
with others to get feedback on your

127
00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:51,290
meta-cognition a little
bit more explicitly.

128
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:55,392
Again, not easy, and I don't think I
could even begin to imagine right now

129
00:05:55,392 --> 00:05:59,380
how I might design an AI agent to be
a TA, or an instructor for this class.

130
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,182
>> [LAUGH]
>> But maybe several years from now,

131
00:06:02,182 --> 00:06:06,670
based on a project that someone in this
class starts to develop, we might start

132
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:10,890
to see a meta-cognitive agent that's
more than just a tutor, or guide.

133
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:15,300
It's actually kind of a partner, or
a mentor in an environment like this.

134
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,608
It can mimic some of the things that it
wants you to learn to do, which I think

135
00:06:18,608 --> 00:06:22,300
is really the best approach for teaching
meta-cognition, is to demonstrate it.

136
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,191
To show, this is how I would think
about this problem that you might want

137
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:26,430
to think about this way, so.

138
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,900
>> That's fascinating.

139
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,880
>> Thank you again, Jason, for
interviewing me on another topic.

140
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,920
>> Of course, dude.

141
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,010
>> And thank y'all.
