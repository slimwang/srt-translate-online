1
00:00:00,315 --> 00:00:04,190
getAccountName on the Account API
will return the email address

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,260
of the signed-in user.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,460
It will store it and
return it to you as a String.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,600
So how would you go ahead and

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,970
update your onConnected method to handle
this instead of the People API and

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,660
prevent your app having that
bug when you're in email scope?

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,350
Go ahead and edit the method, and
check this box when you're done.
