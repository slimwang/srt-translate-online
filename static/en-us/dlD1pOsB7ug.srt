00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,862
Let's implement a solution. We need to increase the size for these fields. We're

2
00:00:05,862 --> 00:00:10,957
going to go up to 34 bits. That's what you need in order to model up to area

3
00:00:10,957 --> 00:00:16,203
code 999. 33 is not going to be enough. If you have done this, now you can

4
00:00:16,203 --> 00:00:19,713
randomize all the way up to area code 999. Great.
