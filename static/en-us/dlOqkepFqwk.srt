00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,440
Now that we've got our project
skeleton together, for GigaGal,

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,090
let's get to the point where we can
start drawing sprites to the screen.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,550
The first thing to do is going to
be setting up our texture atlas,

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:14,490
which means setting up the pack textures
task in our Gradle Build build file so

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,550
we can generate our atlas.

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,550
The biggest part of this exercise
is going to be setting up this

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,520
Assets singleton class.

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,180
Now using the find texture region
method is actually quite slow.

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,840
And we want to set up where we only have
to ever do this once for each texture.

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,120
Setting up a singleton is a pretty
efficient way to do that.

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,200
As part of setting up
our asset singleton,

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,240
we'll also create this GigaGal assets
class that will hold onto the specific

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,870
regions of the texture outlets
that we'll use to draw GigaGal.

14
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,780
Then over in GameplayScreen,
we'll create all of

15
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,200
the drawing infrastructure we're used
to, like a SpriteBatch and a viewport.

16
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,540
Then down in render,
we'll set the background color,

17
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,980
setup the SpriteBatch's
projection matrix, and

18
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:01,130
then go grab the texture region out
of our GigaGal assets in our class.

19
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,155
Finally we'll draw that
texture region to the screen.

20
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:06,880
And here we go,
we've got our first glimpse of GigaGal.

21
00:01:08,275 --> 00:01:11,535
As always, the to-dos in the course code
will show you exactly what you need to

22
00:01:11,535 --> 00:01:13,105
do to setup Asset Loading.

23
00:01:13,105 --> 00:01:13,605
Good luck.
