1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,850
So for Step 6, on the activity itself,

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,084
create a class variable
called mSignInProgress.

3
00:00:06,084 --> 00:00:12,450
And three constants, STATE_SIGNED_IN,
STATE_SIGNING_IN and STATE_PROGRESS.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,084
And give these the values 0,
1 and 2 respectively.

5
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:20,422
Then in your OnConnected override,
which you need to implement,

6
00:00:20,422 --> 00:00:22,680
you're going to manage the buttons.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,459
So this disables the sign-in button and
enables the sign-out and

8
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:27,690
the revoke buttons.

9
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,639
Then also you want set
the mSignInProgress,

10
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:33,127
this value, to STATE_SIGNED_IN.

11
00:00:33,127 --> 00:00:34,496
because you've just signed in.

12
00:00:34,496 --> 00:00:38,550
And then finally use the Plus.People.Api
to get the user's name.

13
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,875
And set the status control
to the user's name.

14
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,770
And when you've done all this,
check this box.
