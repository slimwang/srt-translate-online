1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,110
So here is the pseudo code on the top right.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,820
And the first step therein is to create a path to an audio file.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,950
Now I will need AVFoundation to work with audio.

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,628
So what I've done is imported that framework at the top of my code here.

5
00:00:13,628 --> 00:00:18,540
Then I found an MP3 file of the movie quote I actually want to play from my app.

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,880
This file currently resides on my desktop.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,640
By the way, it's also available for you to download in the instructor notes.

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,120
To add this to our add what I will do is go back to Xcode,

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,860
click on the file menu, and then click on Add Files to Pitch Perfect.

10
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,920
And then simply add the MP3 file.

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,790
Make sure this Copy items if needed box is checked.

12
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,120
Okay, so now if you look in the Navigator,

13
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,480
we've added the movie quote file to our project.

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,860
I can drag it into the Supporting Files folder.

15
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,450
All right, now that I have the MP3 file added to my project,

16
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,390
I can get a handle on it inside viewDidLoad.

17
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,160
Using the following piece of code.

18
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,180
By the way, this code is also available in the instructor notes for you to use.

19
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,666
So at this point I want you to use the Option key on your keyboard.

20
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:09,946
And try and figure out what these things called NSBundle, mainBundle, and

21
00:01:09,946 --> 00:01:12,020
pathForResource are doing.

22
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,940
Here is your question one more time.

23
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,400
Enter your response in this box.
