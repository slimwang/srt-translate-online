1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here I've recopied the grammar.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I've abbreviated the non-terminals a bit.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Subject became subj, and probably whether or not these are upper

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
or lower case has been a little iffy.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Let's allow all of those details for now.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I don't care about case.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We just care about the concepts in grammar.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And now down here I've written 6 possible utterances:

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
students think, teachers write, plus 4 more.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's quiz time.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
In this multiple, multiple choice quiz,

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'd like you to identify which of these 6 utterances

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
could be derived using this grammar starting from sentence.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And again, don't worry about exact spelling or upper or lower case.
