00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,899
Mike, how times have you heard somebody say,
wow, this was a lot harder than I thought

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,349
it'd be. — Oh, all the time. I think I heard you
say this morning. — I think I say it a few

3
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,429
times a week, I mean, coding, no matter how
long you've been doing it, there's always difficult

4
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,539
problems come up. — That's true, in
reality, the sign of a good developer

5
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:20,850
isn't someone who's very smart,

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,380
it's someone who's good at solving
problems and can persevere. You're going

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,529
to run into problems, you're going to get
frustrated,

8
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:33,300
there will be times you are confused and
you're going program yourself into a

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,649
corner that seems inescapable. Whenever
you run into these situations, it's

10
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:39,390
important that you keep going.

11
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,719
Not only keep going in the sense that
you just bang your head against the wall

12
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,739
and get more and more frustrated. I mean
going in the sense that day after day,

13
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:50,699
little by little, you just make some
progress. That's how you can get through

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,120
any problem. To help out, here are a few
problem-solving strategies.

15
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:57,930
First off, there's sleeping on it.

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,820
Seriously, it's helpful take a break, come
back fresh, and you'll be surprised to

17
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,369
find how much easier some problems get.
You also have google and Stack Overflow

18
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:14,880
to help out. Most of the time, your errors
are going to have messages. Copy and

19
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,810
paste those messages into Google, and
you'll be surprised to find out how

20
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,540
quickly you can get answers to your
questions.

21
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,520
Stack Overflow is awesome because people
vote on answers,  so you can get a sense

22
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,770
of what strategy the community thinks
will solve a problem. Seriously,  this is a

23
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:37,170
great strategy and will solve lots and
lots and lots of problems for you. But

24
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,689
hey, speaking of community, try asking the
community. You aren't alone, remember

25
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:47,460
you're going to be learning alongside a
lot of other people. Reach out and ask

26
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,570
for help. If you're lucky enough to know
some web developers in real life, talk to

27
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,309
them too. They might be able to point you
in the right direction. And sometimes you

28
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,670
might need to rethink what you're doing.
When I'm working on something

29
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,950
complicated, I like to draw a picture.
This picture is an actual drawing I made 

30
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,660
the other night for an actual project.
It's not very pretty, it's just pencil on

31
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,270
graph paper, but it really doesn't have
to be. Shapes, 

32
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,410
words, and arrows are often good enough.
This drawing turned out to be super

33
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:22,510
helpful for me, and wound up saving me a
lot of work later. So, it's often helpful

34
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,799
to get your ideas on paper and stop
juggling them in your head. You'll be

35
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,750
able to make better decisions if you can
see the whole picture. And lastly, I want

36
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,400
you to look at your mistakes and
missteps as learning opportunities, look

37
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,720
at it like this: 

38
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:44,859
you're never really wrong, you just
aren't right yet. That's really solid

39
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,890
advice, I think I've done all of those
things throughout my career.

40
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:52,590
Yeah I think we all have. To me as you will
know, the best thing is at the end of the

41
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,500
day, feeling is just absolutely
incredible when something starts to work.

42
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,310
We want you to keep these techniques in
mind as you work on your nanodegree and

43
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:00,610
beyond.
