1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And the correct answer is n over n - 1.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We can see this just with looking at the single example

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
because of the other options, the only other one that yields 2 is n.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That would imply that the correction factor grows linearly with the amount of data.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So if we have a million data points,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
our variance would need to be somehow multiplied by a million

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
to come up with the actual variance.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That doesn't correspond well with intuition

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
because, presumably, as we have bigger and bigger samples,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
we should be getting closer to reality,

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
although that's not a true proof, but you can prove it to yourself

12
00:00:40,000 --> 99:59:59,999
by trying this out on some larger sample sizes.
