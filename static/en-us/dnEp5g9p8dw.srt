[Thrun] So if you got those questions right, I'm in awe with you--wow--

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
because you understand the very basics of using a hidden Markov model for 2 things now.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
One is prediction, and one is called state estimation.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
In state estimation that's a really fancy word for just computing the probability

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
of the internal or hidden state given measurements.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
In prediction we predict the next state, and you might also predict the next measurement.
