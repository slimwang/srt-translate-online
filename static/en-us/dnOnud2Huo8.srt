1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,769
the data is prepared the next step is to
perform the analysis and if appropriate

2
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:06,869
model the problem

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,519
there are a number of different methods
available for performing the analysis in

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,240
the next lesson of this course will go
into detail on how to select the

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,698
methodology and modeling method that is
best suited for your scenario let's use

6
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,880
our electricity example to elaborate on
this step

7
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:28,739
earlier in the problem solving framework
we determined that we needed to predict

8
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:33,238
the temperature for the next day using
some of the factors we identified and

9
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:37,078
then we're going to predict the
electricity usage using the predicted

10
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,780
temperature as well as other factors

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,590
so we start by building out a predictive
model that helps us predict the

12
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,609
temperature for the next day we have
identified a number of factors that may

13
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:51,030
be good at predicting temperature but
we'll start with one to create our

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,149
initial model and learn during the
process

15
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:58,170
once we have created our first model
will validated and then determine if we

16
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,170
need to update the model with additional
information

17
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:04,829
once we have a model that we can
confidently predict temperature with

18
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:07,829
will repeat the process to predict
electricity usage

19
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:13,079
after creating a model that we're
comfortable with one that predicts

20
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:17,219
electricity usage forgiven our on the
next day we need to perform our analysis

21
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,659
this may include the number of
electricity plants that we need for any

22
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:24,359
given temperature as well as the
thresholds

23
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:27,569
when we need to activate additional
plants or purchase electricity on the

24
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:32,879
market will probably perform the
analysis step multiple times until we

25
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:34,560
have confidence in our analysis

26
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,350
so let's discuss how we get the level of
confidence that we need
