1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,282
>> So these two equations give us two different ways of expressing the exact

2
00:00:04,282 --> 00:00:09,003
same curve. But considering this one with the parentheses might not look quite

3
00:00:09,003 --> 00:00:13,286
as pretty as this other one, why would we ever want to use the second form?

4
00:00:13,286 --> 00:00:17,907
Well, from it we can actually find out some information about the curve before

5
00:00:17,907 --> 00:00:22,239
we even graph it. If I label this first form of the equation 1 and this second

6
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:26,655
form of the equation 2, then what does equation 2 automatically tell us about

7
00:00:26,655 --> 00:00:31,032
that we can't see right off the bat with equation 1? Thinking about the curve

8
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:35,064
that it graphs, this parabola over here, can we learn very quickly about the

9
00:00:35,064 --> 00:00:39,096
maximum or minimum, about the x-intercepts, or about the y-intercept from

10
00:00:39,096 --> 00:00:39,864
equation 2?
