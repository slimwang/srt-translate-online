1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,730
What do you think, David?

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,843
>> So what I did,
is I looked across the rows and

3
00:00:03,843 --> 00:00:07,310
tried to see which features
all three birds had in common.

4
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,410
They all lay eggs, so
I'm going to figure that birds law eggs.

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,580
They all have wings, so I' going to
figure that birds have wings.

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,835
And none of them have fur, so

7
00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:17,805
I'm going to figure that
birds don't have fur.

8
00:00:17,805 --> 00:00:19,555
Whether or
not they have talons can actually vary.

9
00:00:19,555 --> 00:00:22,185
So the eagle and bluebird have
talons but the penguin does not.

10
00:00:22,185 --> 00:00:24,135
And whether or
not they are large can vary.

11
00:00:24,135 --> 00:00:26,945
The eagle and penguin are large,
but the bluebird's not.

12
00:00:26,945 --> 00:00:29,230
So those things don't necessarily
define what a bird is.

13
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,860
But these three things
seem to me like they do.

14
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,270
>> That's a good answer, David.

15
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,580
But I should quickly note that
this idea that we can decide on

16
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:42,440
the features that should go into
a super class, given the features

17
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,800
that are shared among these subclasses,
works only for certain kind of concept.

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,780
It doesn't work for all concepts.

19
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,850
Particularly, it work for

20
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,860
concepts that have a formal nature,
as we will see in just a minute.
