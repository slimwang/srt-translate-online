1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,482
This time, we're not solving for x since there's no x in our equation. Instead,

2
00:00:04,482 --> 00:00:08,844
we're solving for c, since c stands for the price per wiper set. We want to know

3
00:00:08,844 --> 00:00:12,862
what values of c will make p equals 0. Now, this is in a general form for a

4
00:00:12,862 --> 00:00:17,334
quadratic equation. That means, we can use the quadratic formula. And this may

5
00:00:17,334 --> 00:00:21,346
be a little bit confusing because our variable is called c and what we do

6
00:00:21,346 --> 00:00:26,139
usually refer to this constant term at the end as c. What's really important

7
00:00:26,139 --> 00:00:31,221
though, isn't what we call these constants, rather, it's where we place them in

8
00:00:31,221 --> 00:00:35,895
the quadratic formula. Once we have this all written out, we just need to

9
00:00:35,895 --> 00:00:40,768
simplify and solve. Simplifying gives us these numbers. C equals negative

10
00:00:40,768 --> 00:00:45,657
18,400, plus or minus the square root of 232 million, all over negative 400.

11
00:00:45,657 --> 00:00:50,083
This is one of those moments where I'm very grateful for calculators as much as

12
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:54,503
I really do think it's important for people to be able to manipulate numbers on

13
00:00:54,503 --> 00:00:58,864
their own. But I can't figure out the square root of 232 million in my head.

14
00:00:58,864 --> 00:01:03,129
Because of the plus or minus, this is going to split into two answers for c.

15
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:07,555
Now, we can simplify what's under the square root and also divide both terms in

16
00:01:07,555 --> 00:01:12,236
the numerators by negative 400. So, we get 46 minus 5 root 58 and 46 plus 5

17
00:01:12,236 --> 00:01:17,828
square root 58. Let's look at the decimal approximations of each of these. The

18
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:23,226
first one is about equal to 7.92. And the second is about equal to 84.08. So,

19
00:01:23,226 --> 00:01:28,604
these are our 2 solutions. Let's check out the graph for a second. So, here's

20
00:01:28,604 --> 00:01:34,230
the graph of our equation for Grant's profit. P equals negative 200c squared

21
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:40,077
plus 18,400c minus 133,200. This is this lovely curve we've seen several times

22
00:01:40,077 --> 00:01:45,428
now. Please note, of course, the scale on either axis. These bolder vertical

23
00:01:45,428 --> 00:01:50,636
lines each mark 20 units or $20, and these bold horizontal lines, each mark

24
00:01:50,636 --> 00:01:56,020
$50,000. So, let's look at our x-intercepts, and yes, this one does look like

25
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:01,307
it's just before 10. So, $7.92 makes sense or 7.92, for this point. This one is

26
00:02:01,307 --> 00:02:06,531
just past 80, so $84.08 makes sense as well. So, let's keep in mind what we're

27
00:02:06,531 --> 00:02:11,366
actually doing in problems like this. When we start with an equation for a

28
00:02:11,366 --> 00:02:16,241
parabola like this one, if we want to find the location of its x-intercepts, we

29
00:02:16,241 --> 00:02:20,816
can set the vertical coordinate equal to 0 since that's what's true at the

30
00:02:20,816 --> 00:02:25,939
x-axis or the horizontal axis, the c-axis in the case of this problem. And then,

31
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:30,259
when we set that vertical coordinate equal to 0, we can use the quadratic

32
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:35,042
formula to solve provided that the rest of the equation is in the proper form.

33
00:02:35,043 --> 00:02:39,621
The quadratic formula gives us the horizontal coordinates of those points that

34
00:02:39,621 --> 00:02:43,954
have a vertical coordinate of 0. In other words, it gives us the x-coordinates

35
00:02:43,954 --> 00:02:48,261
of the x-intercepts. Or in this case, the c-coordinates of the c-intercepts.
