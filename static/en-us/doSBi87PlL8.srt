1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:08,800
Cramer's V then would be 7.78 divided by 150 times k which is 2 minus 1, which

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,740
is just 1. This comes out to about 0.23. What does this mean? Well, remember

3
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:19,000
Jacob Cohen, you calculated Cohen's D before. He's a very renowned

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,420
statistician. He established some guidelines for Cramer's V, which help us

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:29,050
decide if this is a large, small or medium effect size. This table provides his

6
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:34,810
standards for interpreting Cramer's V as k increases. However, Cohen is quite

7
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:39,980
cautious in his suggested use of these values. He treats them more as labels to

8
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,683
aid future power analysis rather than hard and fast descriptors. But these can

9
00:00:44,683 --> 00:00:49,010
kind of give us the idea that the value we got for Cramer's V is a small

10
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:49,650
effect.
