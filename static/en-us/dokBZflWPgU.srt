00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,324
I also want to mention one pet peeve, the

2
00:00:05,324 --> 00:00:09,110
door slam. It's great if you've sunk development money

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,610
into developing a native mobile app, and it's fine

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,560
if you want to make sure your users know it's

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,780
available, but you shouldn't block access to your web

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,070
application with a full page ad for your native

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,670
mobile app. Make this offer unobtrusive, and make my

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,640
decision to ignore it sticky. Now, you can use smart

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,270
app banners, in iOS, to make this offer a little less intrusive, but if

00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,580
I open a URL in a browser, I probably want to stay in the browser.
