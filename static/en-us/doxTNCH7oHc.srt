1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,859
Alright, Michael. What's the answer?

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:03,670
>> I think I've already made a mistake.

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,100
>> Okay. What's the mistake?

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,120
>> Suggesting that we do a quiz.

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,670
>> [LAUGH] I'm pretty sure that's always true. Unless

6
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,060
Michael, by doing a quiz now and suffering pain,

7
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,440
you, in the future, are a better person. In

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,880
which case, you have made the right long term decision.

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,710
>> I see. You're, this is a MDP metapoint you're making.

10
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:22,923
>> Mm-hm.

11
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:25,390
>> Alright. So let, but let's, let's just buckle down and do

12
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,110
this thing. So.

13
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:26,610
>> Okay.

14
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,920
>> Alright, so at that state x, we have

15
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,180
to consider, according to the equation, we're going to do

16
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,830
U sub one at x. And that's going to be

17
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,503
the reward at x, which is minus .04. Mm-hm.

18
00:00:38,503 --> 00:00:40,380
>> Plus gamma, which is a half.

19
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,120
>> Yes.

20
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,470
>> Feel free to write these things down.

21
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:51,150
>> Okay, so, let's see. It's going to be minus .04 plus one half times.

22
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,930
>> Alright. So now we need to do four different actions.

23
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:55,560
>> Right.

24
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,740
>> So, I don, I would make like a brace-y

25
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:03,250
thing at this point. Not a bracket, but a brace. Alright?

26
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,760
>> Or I could do a bracket, because you're going to

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,840
notice immediately that it's obvious what the right action is.

28
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,840
>> Okay, alright. Well, we know that the, the

29
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,670
right action's going to be to go to the right.

30
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,160
>> Yeah, but even then, you know you don't

31
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,190
have to do the rest of the computation because my

32
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,710
first guess at all the utilities is

33
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,140
that they're 0. Which means you're always going

34
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,760
to want to take the action that gets you to plus one with the highest chance.

35
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,840
>> Right.

36
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,670
>> So there's just no point in.

37
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,350
>> I see. Okay. Fair enough. Thank you for.

38
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,470
>> Okay.

39
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,000
>> The shortcut. So, so we only have to

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,500
do the one action which is to the right.

41
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:30,801
>> Mm-hm.

42
00:01:30,801 --> 00:01:32,020
>> And so if we go to the right,

43
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,010
there's three possible next states we could go in.

44
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:34,530
>> Yeah.

45
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,980
>> One is back to x, which has a value of zero.

46
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:37,785
>> Mm-hm.

47
00:01:37,785 --> 00:01:41,620
>> One is to the thing underneath of x, which has a value of zero.

48
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,690
And then the last one with probability 0.8 needs to go to the plus one.

49
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:46,870
>> Which is.

50
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,790
>> 0.8 times plus one.

51
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,180
>> Which is 0.8.

52
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:50,770
>> 0.8.

53
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,170
>> Okay. And that is?

54
00:01:52,170 --> 00:02:00,389
>> Okay. So 0.8 times a half is 0.4 minus 0.04 is 0.36.

55
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:01,990
>> Yep. And that is correct.

56
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:07,060
>> Okay, so to

57
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,810
do the same thing for you too, we're going to need the

58
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,570
U1 value for a bunch of other states, seems to me.

59
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,590
>> Maybe, so let's right that down. So we

60
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:19,370
know for now the utility here is .36 right?

61
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:19,730
>> Yeah.

62
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,740
>> And you're saying that in order to do U two,

63
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm now going to have to, you know, I was able to avoid

64
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,060
doing some of the math before because, these are all zeroes.

65
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,280
So it was just easy to do. But when I went right,

66
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,900
I either stayed where I was, went to the

67
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,960
plus one, or I ended up going down. Well I

68
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,170
think by the same argument that allowed us to cheat

69
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,460
our way out of to cheat our way out before.

70
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,160
>> Okay,

71
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,350
>> It's still going to be best to go to the right, so.

72
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,330
>> Yeah but I know that but the value itself

73
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,580
is going to depend on the value in several other states.

74
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,890
>> Yeah well how many other states?

75
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:55,770
>> Oh, just that one.

76
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:56,860
>> Just this one,

77
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:02,900
so what was U one of this state? I see. So, presumably, we want to avoid falling

78
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,700
into the pit, so the, the best thing we

79
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,230
can do is bash our head against the wall,

80
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,455
>> Mm-hm

81
00:03:07,455 --> 00:03:09,220
>> Which will get us a -.04 for that statement.

82
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:09,640
>> Right.

83
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,410
>> Okay, alright, so maybe this isn't so, so bad.

84
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:12,783
>> Mm-hm.

85
00:03:12,783 --> 00:03:16,217
>> So now for our u2 values we need -.04

86
00:03:16,217 --> 00:03:21,274
plus a half times point, point one times point 36. Plus.

87
00:03:21,274 --> 00:03:21,908
>> Mm-hm.

88
00:03:21,908 --> 00:03:27,573
>> 0.1 times negative 0.04, so that's minus 0.004,

89
00:03:27,573 --> 00:03:33,330
plus 0.8 times one. Oh, which is 0.8 again, just like it was last time.

90
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,490
>> Yep.

91
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,315
>> And I get 0.376.

92
00:03:36,315 --> 00:03:38,640
>> Which is what I get by also getting

93
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,290
out your calculator. Okay, so 0.376, and you can imagine

94
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,230
how we would do that on and on. I want

95
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,330
to point something out, Michael, which is that. You decided

96
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:52,420
to figure what the true utility was for the

97
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,100
state under X by bashing your head into the

98
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,780
wall. But you know that based on the discussion

99
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,000
we had earlier that actually the optimal policy would involve

100
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,980
going up instead of bashing your head into the

101
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,610
wall. What you did at that point was in

102
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,540
fact right because everything else in this utilities were

103
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,150
all zero. The best thing you could do is avoid

104
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:17,269
getting, avoid ever falling into minus one, so the policy

105
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:19,779
of the very first of bashing your head into the

106
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:22,180
wall, is infact the right thing to do at that

107
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,670
point. But what youll notice is that next time around

108
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:30,710
the utility for the X state Is bigger than zero.

109
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,470
In fact, will keep getting bigger and bigger than zero.

110
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,020
As you can see, it went from .36 to 0.376.

111
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,980
Which means that at some point it's going to be worthwhile

112
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,420
to try to go up instead of bashing your head into a wall.

113
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,560
>> I see. So this, so this is kind of cool that it

114
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,920
works. But, it does seem like a really roundabout way of getting there.

115
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,970
I mean, is there some way that we could some, I don't

116
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:54,380
know, maybe take advantage of the fact that there's not that many policies?

117
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:58,340
>> Yeah, so you actually said something, fairly

118
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,650
subtle there, so let's see if we can

119
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:04,040
unpack it. So, lemme point out two things, which I think will get us to what

120
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,310
you're answering. The first is. Do you realize

121
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:10,220
that the reason that the value iteration works is

122
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,470
because eventually value propagates out from its neighbors,

123
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:18,310
right? The first time we can calculate the .36

124
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,560
without really worrying about anything around it because

125
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,810
the utilities are all zero, and in fact, based

126
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:26,140
on the initial utilities. Even for this state

127
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,100
here, we do the wrong thing. But after some

128
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,140
time, this state becomes a truer representation of its utility

129
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,350
and, in fact, gets higher and higher. The right thing to

130
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,650
do here will go up. You'll also notice that after

131
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,100
another time step I'm going to need to start looking at

132
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,680
the value of this state as well. Alright. So, eventually

133
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,880
I'm going to have to figure out the value, the utilities

134
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,800
or the values of all of these states and this

135
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,650
plus one is going to propagate out towards the other states.

136
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:59,550
Where this minus one will propagate out less because you're going to try

137
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,090
to avoid falling in there. So that

138
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,030
makes sense, right? But what's propagating out,

139
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,600
Michael? What's propagating out is the true utilities, the true values of these

140
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,950
states. But what's a policy? A policy is a function from what to what?

141
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,670
>> States to actions.

142
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,890
>> Right, a policy is the mapping from

143
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:20,050
state to action. It is not a mapping from

144
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,870
states to utilities.

145
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:22,590
>> No, that's what U is.

146
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,000
>> That's what U is.

147
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,860
>> Or that's what you are.

148
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,430
>> So, [LAUGH], so if we have U, we can figure out pi, but U

149
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,400
is actually much more information than we need to figure out pi. If we have a

150
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,810
U that is not the correct utility, but

151
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:39,400
say, has the ordering of the actions correct,

152
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,750
then we're actually doing pretty well, right? It

153
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,318
doesn't matter whether we have the wrong utilities.

154
00:06:43,318 --> 00:06:44,753
>> I see. Uh-huh.

155
00:06:44,753 --> 00:06:45,290
>> You'll remember

156
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,960
we did this in the, the first third of the class

157
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,310
as well when we noticed that we were computing in the

158
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,540
Bayesian learning case actual probabilities. But we don't really care about

159
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,330
actual probabilities. We just care that the labels are right. There's

160
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,860
a very similar argument here. We don't care about having the

161
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,270
correct utilities, even though by having the correct utilities, we have

162
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,660
the right policy. All we actually care about is getting the

163
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,480
right policy. And order matters there rather than absolute value. Does that

164
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:10,850
make sense?

165
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,640
>> Yeah, that's interesting. It's almost kind of like pi

166
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,890
is more of like a classifier, right? It's mapping. Inputs

167
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,990
to discreet classes and the user kind of like, more

168
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,970
like regression where its mapping these states to continuous values.

169
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,750
>> Right and given one, given the utilities, we

170
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,340
can find pi, given pi there's an infinite number

171
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,840
of utilities that are. Consistent with it. So, what

172
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,990
you end up wanting to do is get a utility

173
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,420
that's good enough to get you to your pie. Which is one reason why you don't

174
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,872
have to worry about getting the absolute convergence

175
00:07:41,872 --> 00:07:44,520
in [UNKNOWN]. But it gives us a hint of

176
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,010
something we might do that's a little bit

177
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:49,030
better with the policies that might go faster

178
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,920
in practise. So, I'm just going to take three

179
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,780
seconds to give you an example of that. Okay?

180
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,630
>> Awesome.
