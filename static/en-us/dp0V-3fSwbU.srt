00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,550
Before I came to Udacity, I was an

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,680
elementary school teacher and there are

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,970
a lot of things I liked about it. But it

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,370
just wasn't the right job for me.

5
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,440
So after that, I really started to try to

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,509
go back to school and I wanted to do

7
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:14,880
something in computer science. But I find

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,550
it was really difficult to balance class

9
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,680
and working full time. I was looking for

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,600
a program that that could work on my

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,490
timeframe and my schedule. I wasn't

12
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,529
able to leave my job, I couldn't, you know,

13
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:27,599
go away for nine weeks and doing

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,220
bootcamp or anything like that. So I was

15
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,630
like, I have to find something that's

16
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,540
either online or in the evenings. And so

17
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,430
that narrows it down quite a bit. I

18
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,260
discovered Udacity from developers

19
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,700
that I interacted with on a regular

20
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,430
basis. I kept pestering them to learn

21
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,670
what resources they used to grow

22
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,899
themselves professionally and personally.

23
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:48,420
And eventually a developer

24
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,300
pointed me towards Udacity. He said

25
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,379
this is a great resource for someone

26
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:54,780
like you. I went with iOS. I like

27
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,430
the mobile aspect of it specifically,

28
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,370
because I really like the portability

29
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,440
aspect. And you can build an app

30
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,930
really pretty quickly and get it

31
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,610
onto your phone and have it with

32
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,110
your finger, you know at your fingertips

33
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,610
at any time. I think that's really cool.

34
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,340
Udacity provided that platform of clear

35
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,880
structure and being able to learn the core

36
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,670
elements of iOS within a very quick

37
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,000
time and build on it rapidly. I went from

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,159
no coding ability nine months later to

39
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,500
building iOS apps. Udacity is what gave

40
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,299
me the confidence to be like I can do

41
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,640
that, I can figure out how that works.

42
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,799
I had tried other online college programs

43
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,290
before and it's very easy easy to start

44
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,770
feeling like you're isolated. And with

45
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,350
Udacity, not just when you got stuck on

46
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,700
something, but there's also a lot of

47
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,300
other opportunities to communicate with

48
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,110
your peers.

49
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,430
Here's the project you need to do,

50
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,380
here's what we require. It's almost like you

51
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,259
know working and building apps that have

52
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,300
like design requirements. Providing the

53
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,409
community to really like tackle some

54
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:56,759
problems. Like hey I don't know what I'm

55
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,649
doing here, can someone help me out.

56
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:00,509
And then also to begin providing some

57
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:02,400
contributing back and help answer other

58
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,360
people's questions. Like hey I grappled

59
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,890
with the same thing, here's how I did it.

60
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,360
I've seen a transition from the point

61
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,900
where my business was an idea to when I

62
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,190
had a product to just on my phone. So when I

63
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,170
have a product in the App Store.

64
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,900
it's fun talking to people and

65
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,800
seeing how the reactions have changed

66
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,500
throughout all those steps.

67
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,150
I would recommend this Udacity Nanodegree to everyone.

68
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,760
I am using the skills that I've

69
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,489
learned at Udacity every day. Not just

70
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:27,500
the very specific things they taught me,

71
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,890
but learning to find the answers on my own.

72
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,500
Because there's so much more to know

73
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,920
and what Udacity provides is that

74
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,319
foundation and the skills you need to go

75
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:41,360
out and learn those new things.

76
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,959
I now work at Audible as an iOS developer.

77
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,970
A lot of the skills I've learned, I've

78
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,510
already so totally totally totally worth it.

79
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,760
If I met someone in a party and I

80
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,160
wanted to tell them about what the iOS

81
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,590
Nanodegree was like, I would tell them

82
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:01,459
that it is definitely a challenge, but it

83
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:05,480
is so worth it, because you end up with

84
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,450
the skills that you need to get a job in

85
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,940
iOS development. It's just remembering

86
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,319
where you want to get to and not being

87
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,560
too daunted by it and just staying on

88
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,300
that journey. And just every day you're

89
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:17,900
going to learn something new and

90
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,160
sometimes maybe you don't want to pick up on

91
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,400
this but because you want just continuing to

92
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,620
just push forward and learn new things

93
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,630
and when you get to that point that you

94
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,670
have your app in the App Store, it's it's

95
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:32,600
it all it all be worthwhile then.

96
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,730
But don't don't wait. If this is what you

97
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,769
want to do with your life, start right now.

98
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:39,380
we're so proud of our students and

99
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,790
we can't wait to see what you'll build.

100
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:46,900
Let's get started
