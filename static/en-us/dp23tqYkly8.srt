00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,320
Alright, we've got VIP tickets sold 2, general admission, 4. Very cool.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,102
>> Got it.

3
00:00:06,102 --> 00:00:09,840
>> Okay But this is obviously wrong. Tickets sold should be 6, not 0.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,850
>> Yeah, that's true.

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,740
>> Should I do another roll-up summary?

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,670
>> Well, we could do another roll-up summary, but you

7
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,200
can only have ten roll-up summaries per object, and we might

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,230
want to calculate some other things, so. Instead of using a

9
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,670
roll up summary, we can do what's called a formula field.

10
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:23,100
>> Okay.

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,650
>> Very similar, but it's a little bit more dynamic and you have

12
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,020
more functionality you can add to it.

13
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:27,490
>> Okay.

14
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:28,900
>> But really, all we're obviously trying to

15
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,890
do here, is adding those two numbers together.

16
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,010
>> 2 plus 4. So, how should I add this formula field?

17
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,910
>> Well why don't you try and figure it out?

18
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,010
>> Okay.
