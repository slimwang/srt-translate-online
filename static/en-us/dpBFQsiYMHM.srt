1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,080
First, reduce false alarm rate,

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,040
while detecting as many
intrusions as possible.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,000
This is true.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,040
Obviously, we want to detect
as many intrusion as possible.

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,530
We also want to reduce
the false alarm rate so

6
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,050
that we don't burden
the systems with false alarms.

7
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,870
Second, apply detection models at
all unfiltered packet data directly.

8
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:27,280
This is false, because most likely,
the base rate at this level is very low.

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,590
Therefore, the IDS will have
a low Bayesian detection rate.

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,400
Third, apply detection models

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,740
at processed event data
that has higher base rate.

12
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,090
This is true, because as long as
we can keep the intrusion evidence

13
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,680
in the event data, the event data is
gong to have a higher base rate and

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,540
therefore, the ideas will have
a higher Bayesian detection rate.
