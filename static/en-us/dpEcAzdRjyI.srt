1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:07,092
Remember that the only numbers that are
natural numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4 and so on

2
00:00:07,104 --> 00:00:13,955
going up, but counting by ones. If we did
that we would eventually get to 735 so

3
00:00:13,955 --> 00:00:22,169
this is a natural number. So is 6. 89.1
lies between two natural numbers. 89 and

4
00:00:22,169 --> 00:00:29,705
90 but it in itself is not a natural
number because of the decimal of .1.

5
00:00:29,705 --> 00:00:36,325
-1000 and 1/3 are both less than 1, which is the
smallest natural number, so neither of

6
00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:44,062
them belong in the set of natural numbers.
Our last answer, 19 however is a natural

7
00:00:44,062 --> 00:00:48,420
number. We can already see this from the
quiz, that there are a lot of numbers out

8
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,607
there that don't qualify as natural
numbers and we'll talk more about them

9
00:00:52,607 --> 00:00:53,777
very soon.
