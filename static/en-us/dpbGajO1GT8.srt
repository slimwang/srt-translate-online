1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,680
So the answer is, it's an error. And the

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,290
reason why is this first assignment has minutes on

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,840
the right side, but we didn't define minutes previously.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,880
So, if we use a variable that's not defined, there's

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,670
no meaningful value for this. The Python interpreter will

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,900
give us an error. Let's see that in the

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,990
Python interpreter. So here, we have just the first

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,350
assignment. When we run this, we get the error that

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,550
says the name minutes is not defined. Minutes is not defined

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,490
because we didn't introduce that variable yet. It looks like we're defining

11
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,610
it. We've gotten in on the left side, but the right

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,530
side needs to execute first. So without knowing the value of minutes,

13
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,490
there is no sensible value this code can produce, so running

14
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,540
the code produces an error. If we have a statement before this

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,065
that gives minutes a value, then the code will be fine.

16
00:00:48,065 --> 00:00:50,380
We can run this, there's no error. And we can do the

17
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,590
assignment that we had in the quiz, assigning to seconds

18
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,590
minutes times 60, and print the value of seconds. This

19
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,220
works now, but only because we added this definition. We

20
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,890
need to always introduce a variable before we use it.
