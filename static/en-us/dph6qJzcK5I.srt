considered inevitable. A quarter of our brain is used to process what comes

from our eyes. We're a very visual species. If we were blood hounds, we might

be using NPUs, nasal processing units. Me? I was amazed when 3D accelerators

caught on in the last half of the 1990s. Who would pay a few hundred bucks just
