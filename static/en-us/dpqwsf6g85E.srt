00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,390
To fetch the data from open weather map within an

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,750
app, first we need to make an HTTP request to the

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,150
API at the URL that we decided on earlier. Then we

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,520
need to read the response from the input stream to get

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,480
a JSON string. It hasn't been parsed yet, but we'll worry

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,080
about that later. Then we clean up by disconnecting the connection

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,300
and closing any input streams. We also log any errors that

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,300
we catch. Since it's a lot of networking boiler plate code,

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,500
we've provided you with a code snippet

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,890
that handles these steps. See the link for
