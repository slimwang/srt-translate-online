00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,630
By now, you should have a polished
GitHub profile that shows off your work.

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,346
You learned how to format readmes and
commit messages with others in mind.

3
00:00:08,346 --> 00:00:11,464
You've also learned how to be a good
member of the open source community and

4
00:00:11,464 --> 00:00:13,160
how that's reflected in your profile.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,158
You can use the checklist I've provided
to ensure your profile is ready to

6
00:00:18,158 --> 00:00:19,381
impress recruiters.

7
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:22,621
When you've gone through the checklist
and met all the requirements,

8
00:00:22,621 --> 00:00:25,704
you're ready to move on with your
Nanodegree, congratulations.
