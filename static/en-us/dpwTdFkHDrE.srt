Famous computer scientist
Edsger Dijkstra said,

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,200
if debugging's the process
of removing software bugs,

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,950
then programming must be
the process of putting them in.

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,450
There's a lot of truth to that.

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,750
When we're programming, we're bound
to introduce errors in our code.

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,530
Even the best apps on the app store
have their fare share of software bugs.

7
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,080
So as developers, we can expect we'll
be spending a lot of time debugging and

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,030
fixing our problems, whether it's
our own code or even someone else's.

9
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,300
But trust me,
it's not as bad as it sounds.

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,500
Debugging's just part
of being a programmer.

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,930
And thankfully for us,
Xcode makes this process easy and fun,

12
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,740
once you know what you're doing.

13
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,600
My name's Jared Parks, and
I'll be the instructor for this course.

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,220
Let's get started.
