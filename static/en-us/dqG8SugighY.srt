1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:02,670
Okay, we've done this
a couple times before, so

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,790
I'm going to move pretty quickly.

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,655
But I've linked to the original video
if you want a slower walk-through.

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,920
All right, click Start a new
Android Studio project.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,660
Our app is going to be
called Court Counter.

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,990
And as long as you
haven't changed anything,

7
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,000
your company domain should be
the correct android.example.com.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,960
And then I'll let you decide where
you're going to locate your project.

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,200
Downloads is probably not a good place,
so I'm going to change that for myself.

10
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,880
Okay, we'll put it in Documents.

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,926
As with before, we're designing only for
a phone and a tablet, and

12
00:00:34,926 --> 00:00:36,620
we're going to use API Level 15.

13
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:41,875
And we'll stick with what we know, use
Blank Activity, and keep these defaults.

14
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,918
All right, it's going to load for
a little bit.

15
00:00:45,918 --> 00:00:48,870
Okay, great, and
there's my new Court Counter app.

16
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,700
Move on and we'll make this more
than just a Hello World app.
