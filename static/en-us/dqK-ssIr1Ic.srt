1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In this unit you learned about bar charts and histograms.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
They both use vertical bars, and they both aggregate data.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The big difference was that the bar chart is defined over 2D data.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The one dimension applies to the x axis and the other to the y axis

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
whereas histograms only apply to 1D data

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
where the y axis becomes the count of that data.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
In the next unit we'll encounter another plot.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Without giving it away, it is some how related to this birthday pi.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So stay tuned.
