1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,471
How about we look at a color image?

2
00:00:02,471 --> 00:00:05,008
What do you think is the size of this image?

3
00:00:05,008 --> 00:00:06,575
Let's find out.

4
00:00:06,575 --> 00:00:10,144
258, 320, and 3.

5
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:12,270
Why are there three numbers?

6
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,380
The first two are the height and width.

7
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,600
The third one is a number of color planes or

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,510
channels in the image, which is three.

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,960
So how would you select a single color plane?

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,040
We'll use the same indexing notation we used to crop an image.

11
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,420
Say we want to select the red channel, which is at index one.

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:39,870
We want all the rows, all the columns, but only the first plane.

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,050
Now what does this look like?

14
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,220
All right.

15
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,830
So that's what the red channel looks like.

16
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:52,130
Brighter areas indicate higher red values and darker areas vice versa.

17
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,620
The apples are not as bright as you'd expect.

18
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,710
Why do you think that is?

19
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,440
Let's also figure out the size of this color channel.

20
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:05,459
As expected, the width and height of the color channel are the same as

21
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,370
the original image, but it doesn't have a third dimension.

22
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,250
Well, that makes sense, doesn't it?

23
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,460
This color plane is one of three,

24
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,620
which are stacked together to create the color image.

25
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,070
Each one of them is a two-dimensional array.

26
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,370
Note that the extracted color channel is an image by itself, so

27
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,610
you can apply the same operations as you've seen before.

28
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,037
Let's try plotting the values from a row of the image.

29
00:01:30,037 --> 00:01:34,090
And that's what the plot looks like.

30
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,210
Play with this image in the code editor,

31
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,960
try out different operations, try selecting other colored channels.
