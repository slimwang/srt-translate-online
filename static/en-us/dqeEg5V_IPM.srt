[Narrator] Hi, and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This unit is about planning.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We defined AI to be the study

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and process of finding appropriate

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
actions for an agent.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So in some sense planning is really

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
the core of all of AI.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The technique we looked at so far

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
was problem solving search

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
over a state space using techniques

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
like A star.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Given a state space and a problem description,

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
we can find a solution,

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
a path to the goal.

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Those approaches are great for a variety of environments,

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
but they only work when the environment

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
is deterministic and fully observable.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
In this unit, we will see how to relax those constraints.
