1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This class is all about 3D vision.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
There's a scene somewhere here, and there's a camera over here,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and the scene is projected into the camera plane.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Obviously, the camera image is only 2D. The scene is 3D.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
3D vision vision attempts to recover the full 3D information.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The most important missing thing is called the range,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
sometimes called depth or distance to the camera plan.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Cameras are deficient in that they can only recover 2D information-

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
a perspective projection of the image.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The question right now is going to be can we possibly recover the full 3D information

11
00:00:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
about the scene outside the camera just as single or modular camera images.
