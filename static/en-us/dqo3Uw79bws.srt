1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,018
So, let's see if we can figure out the disk access time. Suppose we have a disk

2
00:00:05,018 --> 00:00:07,787
that has a 1000 cylinders and 10 sectors

3
00:00:07,787 --> 00:00:11,970
per track. Suppose that the head assemble starts out

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,022
at cylinder 0, at one end of the

5
00:00:14,022 --> 00:00:17,214
disk, and the cylinders are of course numbered 0

6
00:00:17,214 --> 00:00:21,550
through 999. Suppose that the speed at which the

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,430
head assembly can move is 10 microseconds per cylinder.

8
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,718
So it's moving at linear speed. And the

9
00:00:28,718 --> 00:00:32,900
disk rotates 100 times per second. Suppose we have

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,020
a perfect controller in the bus, or very, very

11
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,394
fast relative to this. And suppose that there is

12
00:00:39,394 --> 00:00:41,176
no previous request so we don't have to

13
00:00:41,176 --> 00:00:44,776
worry about queuing. So the question for you is

14
00:00:44,776 --> 00:00:47,436
what is the average time to read a randomly

15
00:00:47,436 --> 00:00:50,476
chosen byte from this disk, where every bite on

16
00:00:50,476 --> 00:00:53,600
the disc has the same chance of being requested?
