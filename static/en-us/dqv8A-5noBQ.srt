00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,410
For this last practice problem, I want you to write these four numbers in

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:07,560
scientific notation. After you've written these in scientific notation, combine

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,983
the powers of 10, and list that exponent here. Good luck.
