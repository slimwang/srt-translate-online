1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,650
So, next we're talking with Elaine
Fontaine who's director of Data Quality

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,980
and Analytics at the Rhode Island
Quality Institute in CurrentCare.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,870
Thank you very much for
being with us today.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,660
>> Thanks for having me.

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,980
>> We all know, Elaine, that we
need new financial models to make

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,790
healthcare work the way
we'd like it to work.

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,990
The students are quite familiar with
that from earlier lessons in the course.

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,670
And they recognize that those are
intimately tied to quality reporting and

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,490
quality improvement.

10
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,020
So, can you tell us the things that
CurrentCare is doing to support

11
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,360
providers here in Rhode Island
to achieve those things?

12
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,885
>> So I think that we are currently
providing actually outside of

13
00:00:38,885 --> 00:00:43,710
CurrentCare data, quality data
management on reporting services for

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,230
the Chronic Care
Sustainability Initiative,

15
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,250
which is Rhode Island's
patient-centered medical home project.

16
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:54,390
And for that project, we're actually
collecting and aggregating data on

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,660
about 15 quality measures that
are sort of related to meaningful use.

18
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,220
We're also doing
utilization reporting and

19
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:07,800
patient experience through the patients
under medical home caps survey which is

20
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,960
what NCQA requires of those practices.

21
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,510
And with those data we're really sort
of looking, grouping them up and

22
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,210
aggregating them in
a variety of ways to help

23
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,300
the practices see their
performance over time.

24
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,600
And assess their success with
regard to improving the quality and

25
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,295
reducing costs which is
of course not that easy.

26
00:01:29,295 --> 00:01:35,825
But we think that the differences
in the data sources associated with

27
00:01:35,825 --> 00:01:40,915
what's available to the HIE,
relative to what's available to a EMR,

28
00:01:40,915 --> 00:01:43,515
relative to what's available
in a claims data set.

29
00:01:43,515 --> 00:01:48,870
All of which are trying to be used for
this same purpose of looking at cost and

30
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,760
quality really can potentially result
in different answers to the same

31
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,340
questions because the populations
are a little bit different.

32
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:01,340
So for example, we're working on
a chlamydia screening analyses.

33
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:08,310
And I'll be presenting it, Amy,
in November of this year, in 2014, to

34
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,108
look at the differences in those rates
between those three population groups.

35
00:02:13,108 --> 00:02:17,430
So commercial payer will have
a different result than a Medicaid payer

36
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,730
which will have a different result
than what's coming out of the EMR and

37
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:21,560
the HIE.

38
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,790
So we're trying to understand those
differences before we report them

39
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:30,440
publicly from the perspective of
here's how you do a better job taking

40
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,140
good care of quality
docs in the community.

41
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:40,990
>> So, is it fair to assume that
the HIE does serve to help collect and

42
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:44,680
help aggregate the data so
that you can do this quality report?

43
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,760
>> I feel like we're really pretty
nascent in that regard, and so

44
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,980
these chlamydia screening rates
are our first entry into it, but I'm

45
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,160
pretty sensitive to the idea that we
need to understand those differences.

46
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,470
Is it that we as the HIE have
a sub-selective population which

47
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,270
might have a higher screening rate or a
lower screening rate than another group.

48
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,860
Are we including the uninsured,

49
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,310
which are not really represented
in anybody else's measures.

50
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,540
So until we sort of dig into that and

51
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,160
really are able to benchmark against
known metrics, I'm reticent to sort of

52
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,234
just say here's the real answer for
the population of Rhode Island.

53
00:03:24,234 --> 00:03:29,250
And I think that's the goal and I feel
confidant we're going to get there.

54
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,730
But, it's one that we
need to move cautiously

55
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:37,000
in that regard because
the worst possible thing to do

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,420
is to report data without really
understanding what it means.

57
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:46,570
I think that you can do that
in some situations where

58
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:52,170
it's sort of marketing, but quality and
cost analytics are not marketing.

59
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:57,060
And when you're presenting
information that would reflect how

60
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,240
a provider is performing.

61
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,580
You need to make sure you have their
full engagement and input in how that

62
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,760
measure is calculated, and they need to
be able to be very, very confident of

63
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,820
its accuracy before you report it
>> Half the students remember these

64
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,390
comments when we, later on in the
course, we get into quality reporting,

65
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:17,140
and I try to show that it sounds great,
but it isn't so easy to do.

66
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,360
>> Yes, it's really quite
challenging without a doubt.

67
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,570
>> But it sounds like your long
goal is to have a unified statewide

68
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:30,130
population in public health
electronic reporting system for

69
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,370
the whole state of Rhode Island.

70
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,540
Is that where you're heading?

71
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,100
>> It is absolutely where we're heading.

72
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:39,090
And I believe, I have utmost confidence
that we're going to be there,

73
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:44,480
and I feel like we talk internally
a lot about where we are today

74
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,130
is light years behind where we're
going to be in six months and

75
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:51,000
it's light years ahead of
where we were six months ago.

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,850
I feel like the progress
is really rapid, and

77
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:58,500
I think that's in large part due
to a high degree of interest.

78
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,860
As coming full circle to
the beginning of your question,

79
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,120
the provider community is
becoming more and more interested

80
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,510
in these data because they are being
held accountable for them.

81
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:14,010
The Accountable Care Organization

82
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:18,650
news releases that the cycle
moving very rapidly.

83
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:22,300
We've just seen in the last three weeks,
three or

84
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,190
four announcements in
the news of payer provider

85
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:30,240
arrangements that are outside of
Medicare so that's pretty interesting.

86
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,270
>> So, one quick final question.

87
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,090
We look in the course
at some of the public

88
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,600
quality metrics that the Indiana
Health Information Exchange posts

89
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,570
through their
Quality Health First Initiative.

90
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,160
Are you doing that sort of thing here,

91
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,610
and what's the reaction from providers
to that idea if you are doing it?

92
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,140
>> So, I think that we have not been so
public yet.

93
00:05:53,140 --> 00:06:00,250
I think that too is a progression coming
back to really needing provider buy in,

94
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:06,510
and so we're presenting that data
to providers on their groups.

95
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,960
Not at the provider level yet even.

96
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,511
And that's a real challenge
with regard to N anyway, but

97
00:06:15,511 --> 00:06:21,060
we are presenting that to the group
of practices that are participating

98
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:26,210
in the patient-centered medical home
initiative, where they can actually

99
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:31,540
see their performance relative to their
peers in other healthcare settings.

100
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:36,160
But that's what reported publicly
at this point is the aggregate

101
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,350
of all of those programs relative to

102
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:43,170
the non-patients center medical home
data that's available in the state.

103
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,460
So, it's a process.

104
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,240
>> Well thank you very much for
taking the time to be with us.

105
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,740
>> My pleasure.
