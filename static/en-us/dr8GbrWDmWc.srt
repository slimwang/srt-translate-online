1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:08,039
Let's talk about the terminologies identified by Saltzer in his seminal paper

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:14,210
from 1975, that talks about the issues in computer security. The first issue

3
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:20,110
that is identified is when to release information. In this day and age,

4
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:25,470
we all know the importance of privacy of information. And there is

5
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,960
a distinction between privacy of information and security. Privacy has to to

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,970
with when, as individuals, we expect

7
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,720
to release information or. Prevent information for

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,580
being released. That's the individual's right

9
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,470
and responsibility in terms of information that

10
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:50,520
they own. Security, on the other hand, is dealing with how to make

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,510
sure that the system is respecting the guarantees that the user needs

12
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:02,330
both in terms of. Privacy of information as well as when they want to

13
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:06,590
release information. Said differently, privacy is

14
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:10,260
more concerning the individual and the information

15
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,460
that they own, they possess, how

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:17,810
their information is protected and released when.

17
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,550
And if an individual wants to release information. Security on the other hand,

18
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,660
is a system function. The system

19
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,920
is guaranteeing certain properties about information that

20
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,470
it is preserving on behalf of the user community. And in particular, the

21
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,740
system has to protect information that belongs

22
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:43,475
to individuals. And ensure that those information

23
00:01:43,475 --> 00:01:46,800
is released only when the individual that

24
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,655
owns that information wants it to be released.

25
00:01:50,655 --> 00:01:56,001
So in this sense, there's an obligation for the system to ensure that users of

26
00:01:56,001 --> 00:01:59,373
the system are authenticated. Meaning, that if

27
00:01:59,373 --> 00:02:01,529
I go to the system and want to access

28
00:02:01,529 --> 00:02:06,385
some information. The system has to ensure that

29
00:02:06,385 --> 00:02:09,750
I am who I am. That's authentication, and

30
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:15,330
then, it also has to make sure that whatever information I have access to,

31
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:21,660
is something that is not violating any privacy of other individuals that may

32
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,310
have put information into the system. So,

33
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,150
protection and authentication go hand in hand.

34
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,020
And building a secure system. This also

35
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,130
identifies a comprehensive set of security concerns.

36
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:39,470
The first security concern is unauthorized information

37
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,390
release. If I have put some information

38
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:48,760
into the system, then it is a responsibility of the system to make sure that

39
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,120
the information that I've put in, is

40
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,140
not released without my authorization as the

41
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,450
owner of the information. So that is

42
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,690
the first concern. The second concern is unauthorized

43
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:06,490
modification of information. I may have released it for a certain set of

44
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:11,260
users to access information that I've put into the system. But, I may not have

45
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,640
given authority for them to modify the

46
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,800
information, so, unauthorized modification of information is

47
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,530
the second set of concerns. The third

48
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:26,690
security concern is unauthorized denial of use.

49
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:31,620
What that means is. If I've given authority

50
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,830
to a set of users that they can access my information, there should be nothing

51
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:41,660
that prevents that set of authorized users from being able to access

52
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:46,340
that information. So that is what unauthorized denial of

53
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:52,010
use is concerned about. And you may be much more familiar with the term

54
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:56,250
Denial Of Service. That's exactly what this

55
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,990
particular concern is all about. In fact, this

56
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:05,640
is the first mention in the literature of Denial of Service attacks on a server,

57
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:11,850
that prevents authorized users from being able to get service from the system.

58
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:17,720
So what should be the goal of a secure system? Well the goal of a secure system

59
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,980
should be to make sure that all such violations do not occur. That

60
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:28,370
is, preventing all violations is the concern of a

61
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:34,480
secure system. But unfortunately stated this way, it's a negative statement,

62
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,560
preventing all violations, that's insuring that

63
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,070
the system is somehow secure proof,

64
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:47,320
meaning that nobody can attack the system.

65
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,400
And because it's a negative statement it's hard

66
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,810
to achieve. It's sort of like saying there, are no bugs in my program. There

67
00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:00,710
is no way to prove that a program has no bugs. And in a similar manner there, is

68
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:08,840
no way to assure that the system prevents all violations. So what

69
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,650
Saltzer argues is, the goal of the secure system should

70
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:18,590
not be stated negatively, but positively. If the goal of the

71
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:23,580
secured system is stated in this negative manner that it

72
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:28,560
has to prevent all violations. At best, it can give a

73
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,220
false sense of security because there is no way to assure

74
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,950
that bad guys are not going to break into

75
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:40,430
the system. So, making a statement like my system

76
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:43,850
prevents all violation, is giving a false sense

77
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:47,670
of security because it is not achievable in practice.
