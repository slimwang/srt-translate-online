1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,800
Whenever we want to find
some information in

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,790
our database using SQLAlchemy,
we use the query command followed by

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,610
the name of the table that
we want to search through.

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,040
Using this enhanced for loop,

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,318
we declared employee as the variable
that we're going to iterate through.

6
00:00:13,318 --> 00:00:16,720
So, printing employee.name will print
out the name of every employee in

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,240
our database.
