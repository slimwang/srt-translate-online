When we think about the distance between two points, we want to picture a right

2
00:00:03,596 --> 00:00:08,562
triangle. The hypotenuse is the distance between them, and then we have the

3
00:00:08,562 --> 00:00:13,050
horizontal distance as one leg and the vertical distance between the points as

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:19,478
another leg. We can use this right triangle to solve for any distance D. So,

5
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:24,495
what do you think is the distance between these two points? Write that answer

6
00:00:24,495 --> 00:00:25,010
here.
