1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is obviously they are all about local constraints.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
That's the entire point.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Every motions ties together two locations,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and every measurement ties together one location with a landmark.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Multiplication is just the wrong thing here, so they're all about additions.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
These are the correct things to check.
