1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,229
Okay, so we can do A and B.

2
00:00:01,229 --> 00:00:03,510
So, let's pick another function.

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,162
What's your other favorite,
Boolean function of two variables?

4
00:00:07,162 --> 00:00:10,267
>> Well, if we're doing two attributes,
you know, or

5
00:00:10,267 --> 00:00:11,992
is the other really nice one.

6
00:00:11,992 --> 00:00:12,585
>> I like or.

7
00:00:12,585 --> 00:00:13,106
So, let's see.

8
00:00:13,106 --> 00:00:17,123
Do you think, now that we've shown that
we can do A and B, could we do A or B?

9
00:00:17,123 --> 00:00:19,781
>> I feel like we could do A or B.

10
00:00:19,781 --> 00:00:23,781
because there's that nice De Morgen's
Law relationship between them but but

11
00:00:23,781 --> 00:00:27,246
let's just, how about this,
can you erase the tags at the bottom?

12
00:00:27,246 --> 00:00:28,303
>> Like that?

13
00:00:28,303 --> 00:00:31,704
>> Oh, yeah but
that's not going to work, is it?

14
00:00:31,704 --> 00:00:34,140
So, so if B and A are both true, so

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,508
the left branch, then the,
the, the leaf should be plus?

16
00:00:38,508 --> 00:00:39,425
>> Yes.

17
00:00:39,425 --> 00:00:44,406
And if B is true and
A is false then the tag should be plus.

18
00:00:44,406 --> 00:00:46,169
>> Yes.

19
00:00:46,169 --> 00:00:50,900
>> And if B is false, I want to say
false but we don't know because A could

20
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:55,050
be true and A or B is true if
either of the two of them are true.

21
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:55,710
>> Oh okay, so

22
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,486
maybe the mistake here is just trying
to use exactly the same thing.

23
00:00:59,486 --> 00:01:00,728
So let's just erase it.

24
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:01,888
>> All right.

25
00:01:01,888 --> 00:01:02,945
>> And start from scratch.

26
00:01:02,945 --> 00:01:04,709
So what would you do
starting from scratch?

27
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,602
>> I'd split on B again.

28
00:01:06,602 --> 00:01:10,549
>> Okay.

29
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:11,862
>> True False or False True.

30
00:01:11,862 --> 00:01:12,501
>> True False.

31
00:01:12,501 --> 00:01:15,425
>> True False.

32
00:01:15,425 --> 00:01:17,505
>> All right, and now if B is true.

33
00:01:17,505 --> 00:01:20,580
We know that A or B is true, so
we can put a plus under the left side.

34
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,684
>> Right.

35
00:01:21,684 --> 00:01:23,146
>> But if B is false.

36
00:01:23,146 --> 00:01:24,063
>> Mm-hm.

37
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:24,980
>> Then we need to split on A.

38
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,360
>> Okay.

39
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,249
>> And if A is true, then we're golden,
we get the Or is true.

40
00:01:31,249 --> 00:01:34,942
And if A is false, then it is false.

41
00:01:34,942 --> 00:01:38,007
>> Very good, and
that represents A or B.

42
00:01:38,007 --> 00:01:41,941
>> That represents the function,
the logical function A or B, yeah.

43
00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:42,603
>> Right.

44
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:48,105
What happens if I swap A and
B around, does it still work?

45
00:01:48,105 --> 00:01:52,147
>> I mean, my, my, since they're
collaborative or commutative.

46
00:01:52,147 --> 00:01:55,115
Since they're commutative I want to say
it shouldn't make a difference, but

47
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,360
let's just double check that.

48
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,044
So if A is true then the output's true.

49
00:01:58,044 --> 00:02:01,143
If A is false and
B is true then the output's true.

50
00:02:01,143 --> 00:02:05,126
And if A and B are both false,
then the answer's false, yeah, totally.

51
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:06,065
>> Excellent.

52
00:02:06,065 --> 00:02:08,863
And, you know, if I hadn't erased
it you would see that the two trees

53
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:10,465
actually look very, very much alike.

54
00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:11,546
>> They're sort of mirror each,
of each other.

55
00:02:11,546 --> 00:02:12,417
>> If you just swapped around.

56
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:14,800
Yeah the, yeah exactly,
they're mirrors of one another.
