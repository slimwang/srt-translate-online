1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:07,370
An alternative is to achieve the same effect, but completely oblivious to the

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:14,660
guest operating system, and this is used in VMware ESX server. The idea is to

3
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:20,770
use content-based sharing. And in order to support that, VM Ware has a data

4
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:26,070
structure which is a hash table kept in the hypervisor. And this hash table data

5
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,140
structure contains a content hash of the machine

6
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,170
pages. So, for instance, this entry is saying that. For virtual

7
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:41,750
machine number three. For it's physical page which is at this address

8
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,530
43f8 there is a machine page that hosts this

9
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,270
physical page number of VM3 and that's contained in

10
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:57,020
machine page number 123b and the content hash that is... If you hash the

11
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:02,990
contents of this memory page, you get a signature. That signature is the content

12
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:08,520
hash. That content hash is stored in this data structure. Now let's see how this

13
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:16,310
data structure is used for doing VM-oblivious page sharing in the ESX Server.

14
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:21,450
We want to know if there is some page in VM2 which

15
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,220
is content wise the same as this page contained in

16
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:32,110
VM3. In particular we want to know if this physical page number.;

17
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:36,710
PPN 2868 of VM 2, which is mapped

18
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:42,030
to this machine page,1096 is content-wise the same

19
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:48,436
as this guy. So how do we find that out? What we do is we take the contents of

20
00:01:48,436 --> 00:01:54,950
this machine page 1096 Create a content hash. So that's the content hash

21
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,140
that you're going to generate, a particular algorithm

22
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,470
that the hypervisor is going to run to

23
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,410
create a content hash. So we create a

24
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:07,840
content hash for this page 1096, that corresponds

25
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:15,100
to PPN 2868 of VM 2. Now we take this content hash and look through hypervisor's

26
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:20,110
data structure to see if there is a match between this content hash that

27
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:27,040
I created for this page and any page currently in the machine memory.

28
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:34,020
Well we have a match. We have a match between the content hash for this page and

29
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,130
the content hash (no period) Of the page

30
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:40,660
comtained in VM 3, 43f8, which is mapped to

31
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:47,760
MPN 123b. So now we've got this match. Can we know that this page and this page

32
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,670
are exactly the same? Well, we cannot. It's

33
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,300
only a hint at this point that this pages

34
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,030
content hash is the same as this because this

35
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,210
content hash for 123b was taken at some point

36
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:03,100
of time. And we created this data structure to

37
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,410
represent this as a hint frame, which has a

38
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:10,060
particular content hash. Now, VM3 could have been using

39
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,320
this page actively and modified it, and if it has

40
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,450
modified it, then this content hash that we have

41
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,780
in this data structure may no longer be valid.

42
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,280
And therefore, even though we've got a match, it's

43
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,400
only a hint, not an absolute. It's only a hint.

44
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,930
So once we have a match, then we want to do a full comparison between these

45
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,270
two guys. Make sure that these two guys

46
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,540
are exactly the same, full comparison upon match.
