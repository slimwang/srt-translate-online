1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,200
Okay so where's the parallelism?

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,320
So one problem is F and this while loop.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,790
Notice that we pull out vertices and
we put vertices back in.

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,340
The vertex that we just put in depends
on the vertex that we pulled out.

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,916
So that appears to create a sequential
bottle neck and since they while loop

6
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:23,170
executes O of V times, then the span
would appear to be O of V, as well.

7
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,810
This makes the average available
parallelism, essentially,

8
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,450
a constant plus
the ratio E divided by V.

9
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:32,540
So, is that good or bad?

10
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,120
In real life, graphs are sparse, and

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,010
so what that means, is that we should
expect the size of E to be O of V.

12
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,770
That means the average available
parallelism will be a constant and

13
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:46,920
that's definitely bad.

14
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,750
So this concept of sparsity
is a fact of life.

15
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,190
Think about a social network.

16
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,220
The vast majority of people will
have some maximum number of friends.

17
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,240
Let's say, I don't know 1000,

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,140
independent of how many
people are in the network.

19
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,340
Or imagine a worse case,

20
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,940
which might be a linear graph
that's shown on the right.

21
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,940
This might represent, oh, I don't know,
a bunch of hermaphroditic anti-social

22
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,760
worms who only associate with
their immediate offspring.

23
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,920
Anyway, since sparsity's a fact of life,
we're going to have to live with it and

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,250
therefore the sequential
algorithm is bad.
