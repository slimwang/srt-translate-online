00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,700
Let's look at the solution
to our block number quiz.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,570
If we have a 32 B block size and
a 16-BIT ADDRESS like this,

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,550
the question is what is
the BLOCK OFFSET and the block number.

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:17,110
For a 32 B block the block offset will
determine where within the 32 B are we.

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:21,317
We need 5 bits to tell us that
because 2 to the 5 is 32.

6
00:00:21,317 --> 00:00:23,640
So we need 5 bits.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,660
To tell us which of the 32 bytes
are we interested in accessing.

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,100
That means that the least
significant 5 bits of this address,

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,630
are the block offset.

10
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,630
So the block offset is this.

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,250
The remaining bits of the address
are the block number.

12
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:44,510
They're telling us which of the 32
byte blocks contains this address.

13
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,990
So this is our block number.
