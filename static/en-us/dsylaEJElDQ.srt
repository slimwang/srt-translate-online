00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,900
Let's take a moment to add some
functionality to our code that lets us

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,610
check whether two vectors are parallel,
and whether two vectors are orthogonal.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,220
To check your work,
consider the following pairs of vectors.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,280
Compute whether each pair
of vectors is parallel or

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,390
orthogonal, and
then check the appropriate boxes.

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,210
Some of them might be both or neither.
