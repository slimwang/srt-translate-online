Hi, I'm Michael Littman.

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:06,150
You may remember me from such courses as
Machine Learning, Intro to Algorithms,

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,090
and well, this course.

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,340
>> Hi, I'm Chris Pryby.

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,190
I'm a course developer with Udacity,
and I worked with Charles and

6
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:13,440
Michael to build this course.

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,030
>> Where is Charles anyway?

8
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,270
>> You know what,
let's just add him in post.

9
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,080
>> The main goal of this course
is that you become prepared to

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,700
engage with the reinforcement
learning community.

11
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,830
One aspect of being engaged with
the community is becoming familiar with

12
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,590
software built specifically for
solving reinforcement learning problems.

13
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,430
To help you with this goal,
you will use a java framework called

14
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,990
the Brown UMBC Reinforcement Learning
and Planning library, or BURLAP.

15
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,970
>> In this tutorial lesson I
will introduce you to BURLAP and

16
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,520
help you write your first
programs using the library.

17
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,560
We'll talk about how to set up and
solve a basic MDP using BURLAP.

18
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,830
>> As you work through the course,

19
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,580
we encourage you to think
about the planning and

20
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,310
learning algorithms presented, and
try to implement them using BURLAP.

21
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,030
A great resource to consult
is the BURLAP documentation,

22
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,950
available at the URL listed
in the instructor notes.

23
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,600
>> All right, Michael,
ready to get started?

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,250
>> I'm ready.

25
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,310
>> Awesome, yeah!
