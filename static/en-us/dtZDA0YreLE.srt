00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,930
For the new Mad Libs generator
we're going to build,

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:07,280
we're going to have to turn the string
passed into our function into a list.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,380
Now, I won't get into the details
of why we need to do this just yet,

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,680
I'll explain why we'll need to make
the conversion in the next quiz

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,210
question video.

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,201
But, for now, I want to show you
a new function called split,

7
00:00:18,201 --> 00:00:22,020
which turns the words in a string
into a list of those words.

8
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,590
If you remember the function, randint,
from the last work session, you'll

9
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:30,280
see that split looks pretty similar,
but it's even easier to implement.

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,060
This is the basic structure
of the split function.

11
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,580
As you can see,
split takes in one argument,

12
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,185
separator, which is what your
string will be split on, and

13
00:00:41,185 --> 00:00:46,740
is preceded by this string_to_split
variable which is self-explanatory.

14
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,520
However, the separator argument is
optional and, if we leave it blank,

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,990
we'll split on single space characters,

16
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,540
which is actually what we'll
be using this function for.

17
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,540
Let's run through an example.

18
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:02,030
Let's say I have this string, and I call
the split function on it, and notice how

19
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,230
I left the inside of the parenthesis
blank, I'll be returned with this list.

20
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,920
"I", "am", "a", "Noun".

21
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,990
Simple enough.
In the following quiz you'll be asked to

22
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,750
use a split function on a couple other
strings so you can get a feel for it.

23
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,700
Feel free to experiment with what
you put in for the parenthesis, but

24
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,840
note that we just want the words to be
split on the single space character.
