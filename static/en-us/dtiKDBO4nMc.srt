Hi everybody. Welcome to Web Development. In this course, we're going to

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,730
learn how to build web applications together. Over the entire course,

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,675
we're going to be basically building a blog. A fully functional blog,

4
00:00:09,675 --> 00:00:12,140
that'll have user registration, submitting

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,980
links, viewing, everything together, just like

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,820
a real blog. And it'll be online on the real internet,

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,410
for you and anybody else to see. And by the end

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,070
of this class, in addition to that blog, I'll also get

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,630
you to build a wiki as your final exam. And I figure

10
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,890
if you can build a blog and a wiki and get those things online, you can build

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,920
just about anything. In this lesson, we're going to take

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,520
it from the very top. We'll start with the

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,760
internet and browsers, and how these things fit together.

14
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,610
We'll also talk about basic HTML. And we'll develop

15
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,190
a common vocabulary, so [INAUDIBLE] communicate through the rest

16
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,430
of this course. With that said, let's get started.
