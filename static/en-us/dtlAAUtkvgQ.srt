00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay. So we are going to build a Web site--

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
right now--called ASCII Chan.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And this is going to be a message board

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
for sharing ASCII Art.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's going to have this general structure

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
where we will have a form with--

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
you know--it'll take a title and some ASCII Art--

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
a little submit button--

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and the user can submit this and below this form,

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
they'll see ASCII Art that's been submitted by other people--things like that.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So it'll be a one-page Web site.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It'll have a form, and then the contents here.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So for those of you who don't know what ASCII Art is,

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
let me give you a few examples.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Here we are, on this Web site, Chris.com--

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
pretty awesome domain name.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
This Web site is dedicated to ASCII Art,

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and as you can see here--

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm just looking at a bunch of ASCII Art of cows.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
All ASCII Art is--it's just little pictures, drawn with keyboard characters.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
SO pretty cool; there's this huge--huge--encyclopedia of ASCII Art online

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and we are going to build a forum

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
for people to share their own ASCII Art.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Anyway, if you haven't seen it before, that's what it is.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's a fantastic way for people to

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
waste time in front of their keyboards.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Okay. Here we go.
