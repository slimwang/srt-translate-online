1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,650
I chose to create a new field
in the data called has_visited.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,370
Now there's a couple of choices for
where to add this field.

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,320
The latest I could possibly add it is
to this engagement_by_account data

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,170
since that's where I'll need it.

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,120
On the other hand, then that field won't
be available in all the other lists of

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,860
data that I have,
which could annoy me later.

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,760
Another option would be to add it at
the very beginning of the notebook

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,970
when I first load in the data and
then reevaluate all the cells.

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,700
But some of these cells take
a couple seconds to run and

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,900
I'm not really excited about doing that.

11
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,119
As a compromise I decided to add
it to the paid_engagement table

12
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,690
after I had removed
the free trial cancels but

13
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:37,720
before I had separated out just
the engagement data for the first week.

14
00:00:38,895 --> 00:00:43,105
To do this I looped over each engagement
in the paid_engagement table.

15
00:00:43,105 --> 00:00:45,875
Then if that engagement record
showed that more than zero

16
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:49,625
courses were visited,
I set the has_visited field to one.

17
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:52,955
Otherwise, I set
the has_visited field to zero.

18
00:00:52,955 --> 00:00:55,655
Remember the reason that I'm making
this field numeric, zeros and

19
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:58,165
ones, is so that I can add this field up

20
00:00:58,165 --> 00:01:02,010
to get the total number of days that
the student visited the classroom.

21
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,470
Now I'll need to run this cell, as well
as rerun all the cells below it, to make

22
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:08,670
sure that the has_visited field gets
added anywhere it needs to be added.

23
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,540
Then I can analyze the
days_visited_by_account using code very

24
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,920
similar to what I had previously.

25
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,130
Again, I'll start with the engagement
data grouped by account and

26
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,310
then I'll sum up the has_visited
field for each account.

27
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,530
And again, I'll describe my data.

28
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,290
And when I run this cell I
see that the mean number of

29
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,750
days visited in the first week
is a little less than three.

30
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,300
The standard deviation
is a bit more than two.

31
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,360
The minimum is 0 and the maximum is 7.

32
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,070
The minimum and maximum in particular
are exactly what I expected.

33
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,060
In fact, I would be pretty surprised if
there weren't at least one student who

34
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,020
visited 0 days in their first week and
at least one student who visited all 7.
