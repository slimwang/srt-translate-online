1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,927
For the first expression, we can switch the terms in the denominator, since

2
00:00:03,927 --> 00:00:08,588
addition is commutative. So we'll have x plus 7 divided by the quantity x plus

3
00:00:08,588 --> 00:00:13,587
7. These expressions are identical, so we're really left with positive 1. For

4
00:00:13,587 --> 00:00:17,986
the second rational expression, we know it equals negative 1. This b squared is

5
00:00:17,986 --> 00:00:23,938
positive and this b squared is negative, whereas this 5 is negative and this 5

6
00:00:23,938 --> 00:00:29,330
is positive. So, we definitely have opposite polynomials. We see that here, if

7
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,295
we just reverse the terms of the denominator and keep the signs in front of

8
00:00:33,295 --> 00:00:38,232
them. We factor a negative 1 from the denominator and then the b squared minus

9
00:00:38,232 --> 00:00:42,604
5s can cancel. This leaves us with negative 1. For this third one, you might

10
00:00:42,604 --> 00:00:46,768
have thought it was negative 1. You might have cancelled the terms which are a

11
00:00:46,768 --> 00:00:51,066
and then simplified negative 5 over positive 5. But, remember, we can't cancel

12
00:00:51,066 --> 00:00:55,998
terms. We can only cancel factors. A is positive in the numerator and positive

13
00:00:55,998 --> 00:01:00,288
in the denominator, so, these aren't opposite polynomials. The 5s have different

14
00:01:00,288 --> 00:01:05,242
signs which mean this polynomial can't equal positive 1. It must be something

15
00:01:05,242 --> 00:01:09,518
else. And for the last one, we could switch the terms in the denominator, and

16
00:01:09,518 --> 00:01:14,242
then, factor a negative 1 from the numerator. The common factors of 2x minus 9

17
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:19,060
simplify to 1, leaving us with negative 1 as our result. Great work if you even

18
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,983
got two of those correct. These were pretty tough.
