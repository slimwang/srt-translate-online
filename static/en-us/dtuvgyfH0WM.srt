00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,609
Finding the shortest path on a map
is a very useful ability and

2
00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:04,950
that heuristic is a nice trick.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,990
But it seems more like
an optimization problem to me.

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,804
I'm not sure if I'd consider
that a sign of intelligence.

5
00:00:10,804 --> 00:00:15,550
>> Mm, okay, how would you characterize
an intelligence system or agent?

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,540
>> Well,
unlike the route finding domain,

7
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,929
many real world problems require us to
react to changes to our environment.

8
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:24,689
Maybe, changes caused by
things like other drivers.

9
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:28,625
I would expect an intelligent agent to
be able to react to such changes and

10
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:30,245
maybe even anticipate them.

11
00:00:30,245 --> 00:00:34,755
>> Hm, what if we could adapt similar
search strategies to solve problems that

12
00:00:34,755 --> 00:00:36,810
involve other agents?

13
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,640
>> Like, playing games?

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,579
Yea.

15
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:43,039
>> I guess we've seen that before, and
there are lots of famous examples of AI

16
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,799
agents winning games
from Chess to Starcraft.

17
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:47,619
>> Let's try to figure out
a way to implement them.
