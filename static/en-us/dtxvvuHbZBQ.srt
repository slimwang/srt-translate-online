1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,246
Does it make sense?
>> Yeah, and

2
00:00:01,246 --> 00:00:05,436
I appreciate you giving me credit for
thinking of this idea, but

3
00:00:05,436 --> 00:00:09,250
the reality of it is you kind
of forced my hand by not.

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,700
I couldn't said right,
right, right, right, right,

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,280
down because I don't see
the low level grid positions.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,725
So I don't know if it's 100 or
1,000 or 60 or anything, but cool,

7
00:00:17,725 --> 00:00:21,140
I mean that gives me credit for
something that I don't really deserve.

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,100
>> Well, but I did tell you that
you could go up, down, left,

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,864
right if you'd said well,
I'd tell you to go right,

10
00:00:24,864 --> 00:00:26,102
I just would move right a little bit.

11
00:00:26,102 --> 00:00:27,340
And you would have seen where I was,
and you would have,

12
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,739
I gotta keeping going right,
keep going right, keep going right.

13
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:32,390
And yeah, I could have made that
as granular as I wanted to,

14
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,445
but it has to be fairly granular.

15
00:00:34,445 --> 00:00:37,936
There's no way to get from here
through one of the doorways,

16
00:00:37,936 --> 00:00:39,859
which you absolutely have to do.

17
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:41,774
So let's be a little bit more concrete.

18
00:00:41,774 --> 00:00:44,040
So let's write down exactly
what that action was.

19
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,760
I don't know what it is, but you created
a bunch of actions that I'm going to

20
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,720
say are things like goto doorway.

21
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,840
And we can even name those doorways.

22
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,340
Let's call therm x.

23
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,490
And so that would be one, two,
three, four more actions,

24
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,850
which are going to allow me to
save possibly many, many steps.

25
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,926
So let's think about that.

26
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:01,586
What if I had started here?

27
00:01:01,586 --> 00:01:03,188
What would you have told me?

28
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:07,270
>> Well, in principle, the plan
that I gave you could still work.

29
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:11,070
Just go to the doorway to the east and
then go to the doorway to the south.

30
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,480
>> Right, and by the way,
well, go ahead.

31
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:19,710
>> Well, it seems like the room layout
that you have makes it possible to go

32
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,040
kind of the southerly route as well.

33
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,120
>> Right,
there's some point where going east and

34
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,070
then south is not as good as
going south and then east.

35
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,230
And I don't know exactly where that
point is, but I'll make it easy for

36
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,645
you by drawing a dot there.

37
00:01:32,645 --> 00:01:34,570
[LAUGH] What would you
tell me to do there?

38
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,101
>> I would totally tell you
to go east and then south.

39
00:01:36,101 --> 00:01:37,010
>> Right.

40
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,230
>> So east to the doorway,
south to the doorway, then down.

41
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,720
>> Right, so for a whole bunch of states
inside of this room, no matter what I

42
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,460
do, the action is the same,
even though I'm in different states.

43
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,296
I should still just go here.

44
00:01:48,296 --> 00:01:50,131
I take one action for
one particular state.

45
00:01:50,131 --> 00:01:54,551
So the plan itself and sort of what I'm
searching over is actually much simpler,

46
00:01:54,551 --> 00:01:59,340
and that would be true for, I think,
probably any space inside of this room.

47
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,130
Your answer would be?

48
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,100
>> To go to the south door.

49
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,260
>> Right, and not to drive the point
home too much, but what about from here?

50
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,810
Well, I think it's obvious,
you tell me to go here, from here,

51
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,940
you tell me to go here, from here,
you tell me to go here.

52
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,197
At some point, there's a switch off
between whether going through this

53
00:02:14,197 --> 00:02:15,948
door or going through this
door is the right thing to do.

54
00:02:15,948 --> 00:02:17,440
But there you go.

55
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,640
And then once you're in the room,
well then,

56
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:25,200
you're going to have to take, I guess
sort of baby steps towards the goal.

57
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,870
But regardless, I'm going to claim that
this is an easier kind of space to

58
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,629
reason over than having to live
in the original action space.
