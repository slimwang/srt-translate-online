1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,332
Here we can see that the waves with the long wavelengths are what we perceive

2
00:00:04,332 --> 00:00:09,697
as red, and this wavelength be about 750 nanometers. The shortest wavelength

3
00:00:09,697 --> 00:00:13,935
that we can perceive corresponds to violet light. And it's about 400

4
00:00:13,935 --> 00:00:22,160
nanometers. Just longer than violet, is blue and then green, yellow and orange.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,976
>> So, when we perceive color our eyes are just taking in different wave lengths

6
00:00:24,976 --> 00:00:26,185
of light?

7
00:00:26,185 --> 00:00:29,820
>> Exactly, and this is where color vision comes in. We talked before about how at

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,700
the back of our eyes we have these different photoreceptors, the rods and the

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,927
cones.

10
00:00:33,927 --> 00:00:35,610
>> And the cones are the ones for color.

11
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,326
>> Right, and we have three of them.

12
00:00:38,326 --> 00:00:39,026
>> Why do we have three?

13
00:00:39,026 --> 00:00:42,731
>> Well, I think I mentioned this before, that ones for long wavelengths, red and

14
00:00:42,731 --> 00:00:47,181
oranges. Another type of cones is for these medium wavelengths, these greens

15
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:51,944
and yellows. And still another is for the short wavelengths. And in fact, the

16
00:00:51,944 --> 00:00:54,968
most common type of color blindness, actually makes it hard to distinguish

17
00:00:54,968 --> 00:00:56,919
between reds and greens.
