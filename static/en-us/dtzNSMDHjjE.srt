1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,700
Okay, so, good. We've got one, each person, we know how much they spent.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,360
>> Yup.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,490
>> Next we want to know, at the festival, how much money have we collected.

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:11,800
>> Yeah. So, in order to be able to display that, we need to create a report.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,990
>> Okay. So, I'm going to click Reports.

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,400
>> Yup.

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,850
>> Think I'm figuring this out, Sam.

8
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:15,850
>>

9
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:16,360
[LAUGH]

10
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,790
And we want to create a new report.

11
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:22,540
>> So, I'll click New Report. What do I do next?

12
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,340
>> So these are mainly all off of the

13
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,350
standard objects, but we want to use our attending object.

14
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:27,920
>> Makes sense.

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,670
>> So.

16
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:29,210
>> I'll quick find it?

17
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:29,810
>> Quick find it.

18
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,060
>> Activities with attendees.

19
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,490
>> So, those are part of the solution

20
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:34,800
>> Yeah.

21
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,750
>> package. So, definitely not those. I, I don't know if you

22
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,430
remember earlier when we were creating the attendee object, how those little

23
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,510
check boxes at the bottom of the edit screen.

24
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,850
>> It sounds vaguely familiar.

25
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,170
>> Yeah. So one of them was to be able to

26
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,670
report on that object, so we'd need to check that box.

27
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:55,790
>> okay. So I'm going to go to attendees, and view the object itself.

28
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,040
>> Yep. Now a little bit different from before, we're just

29
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,010
going to edit the object completely. So just click that little edit button.

30
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,910
>> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

31
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:03,820
>> This looks familiar, right?

32
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,239
>> It does.

33
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,520
>> Yeah, so right there, optional features,

34
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,290
allow reports.

35
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,960
>> Makes sense. Save. And then

36
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,250
>> Now

37
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,100
>> I think, yeah, I'm just going to go through and

38
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,950
do this for all the other stuff we might want to remember.

39
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:14,280
>> Sounds good.

40
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,180
>> So like what, festivals, bands?

41
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,150
>> Festivals, bands, stages, sounds good.
