Here's another challenging problem that uses the Pythagorean theorem. This time

2
00:00:04,634 --> 00:00:09,123
we'll have a ladder that 17 feet long, that leans against a building. The

3
00:00:09,123 --> 00:00:12,336
distance from the bottom of the ladder to the building is 7 feet less than the

4
00:00:12,336 --> 00:00:17,002
distance from the top of the ladder to the ground. What you need to find is the

5
00:00:17,002 --> 00:00:21,106
distance from the top of the ladder to the base of the building. Now, we'll

6
00:00:21,106 --> 00:00:25,440
walk through this problem just like one before. First, I want you to tell me

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,200
what are the expressions for each of these sides? Try to label the parts of the

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,100
diagram that you know, and then when you think that you have numbers or

9
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,940
expressions for each of these. Enter them in the corresponding box. If you use

10
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,710
a variable, make sure that you use the variable x. Good luck here.
