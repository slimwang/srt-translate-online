00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,100
It's time to update your weather app,
one last time.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,060
Here's what I want you to do.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,810
First, add a web app manifest file and
the relevant types for

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,860
Safari and Windows.

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:18,250
Be sure to include all the recommended
icons and set the appropriate colors.

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:23,320
Next, minify and inline the CSS and
perform any other optimizations.

7
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:28,580
Finally, deploy your site to
a secure hosting provider.

8
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,592
When you've completed this step,
try adding your weather app to the home

9
00:00:32,592 --> 00:00:35,840
screen and verify that the right
title and icons are shown.

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,968
Make sure you got the add to home
screen banner to appear on Android.

11
00:00:39,968 --> 00:00:46,530
And verify that app that works when
your online, offline or in life-like.

12
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,320
Be sure to compare your app to
the link in the instructor notes below

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,650
to make sure that it
works exactly the same.

14
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,920
And don't forget to test
it in other browsers.
