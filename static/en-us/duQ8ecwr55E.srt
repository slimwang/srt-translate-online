1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Over the course of this class and in the forums,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
a number of you have asked me about research

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
or what I do to nominally push forth the boundaries of human knowledge

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and make the world a better place.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And now I'd like to give you the chance, the opportunity,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
to participate in just such a project.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Oh, fellow travelers on this voyage of discovery,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I stand before you, hat in hand--well, metaphorically, at any rate--

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
asking for your help, for your participation.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Let me set the stage for you.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Imagine that you have a job as a computer scientist

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and you have a program that you'd like to work on.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It could be some Excel macros to make a better spreadsheet.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It could be a game you've always wanted.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It could be an assignment from your superior.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Probably you will think hard about the problem--

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
that's what we hope everyone does--find examples online, write your code,

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
debug it, and then, typically later, you may have to make some changes.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
All of these stages--except perhaps thinking about the problem--involve reading code.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It turns out that in industrial practice, more time is spent reading code

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
than on any other activity, especially writing it.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
By some estimates, up to 70% of time is spent just reading existing code.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And as a result, the readability of code has a huge impact on productivity.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Readable code doesn't just look good; it has an economic impact.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
That makes it unfortunate that we really do not understand code readability at all.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We have some intuitions for natural language readability--

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
when something is at the 3rd grade level versus the 7th grade level--

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
but we'd really like to understand code readability more.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I think that one way to do that is to ask people like you, ask people in the real world,

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
"What do you think? Is this code readable or not?"

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and from that build a formal mechanical model that we can use

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
to evaluate existing pieces of code and make representations.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The largest existing study on code readability--more than 70%

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
of the work of industrial software development--involves only 100 participants.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I think that we, free online education, can do better,

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and I'm going to need your help.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The survey we'd like you to participate in consists of a number of examples

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
of snippets of code from real-world programs.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The survey is completely voluntary and anonymous.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We're not going to store any identifying information.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Instead, we'll present you with a number of snippets of real-world programs

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
written in either Python, Java, or CUDA.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You're already familiar with Python, but you may be less familiar with Java or CUDA,

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
a language for programming graphics cards.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You don't need to be an expert. You don't need to be familiar with those languages.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
In fact, you don't even need to have heard of those languages.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We're very interested in gathering your intuitive notions of software readability.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So we'll show you a number of pieces of code,

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
and after looking over each snippet, you'll rate it on a scale of 1 to 5,

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
where 1 indicates less readable and 5 indicates more readable.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The exact notion of readability we are leaving up to you.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
For example, perhaps you'll see a snippet like this and decide that it's a little less readable.

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Perhaps you'll see a snippet like this and decide that it's a little more readable.

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
We're really interested in what you think about this subject.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So the survey takes about 15 to 30 minutes,

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and it's totally anonymous and confidential.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
We're not going to store any important information

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
that would help us trace these numbers back to you.

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's not related to this Udacity class in any way.

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
In fact, it's not worth extra credit. It doesn't influence your grade.

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's solely to try to make the world a better place by increasing human knowledge,

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
by helping us to understand when code is readable and when code isn't--

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
a really important part of software development.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I realize that many of you are quite busy; you've got other things to do.

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Not a problem at all.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But if you are interested, if you're not busy, if you have a few moments to spare,

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I would really personally appreciate it if you would take them and help us out.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Even if you're not particularly comfortable or an expert with these languages,

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
you're just as necessary.

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Those data points are critical.

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So if this isn't worth extra credit, why should you participate?

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
A number of people on the forums have suggested that,

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
based on my reasonable radio announcer voice, I should consider singing a bit more.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
These people are clearly doing their best to flatter me,

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
because my singing is not all that and a bag of chips.

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But the graduate student who is leading this project,

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
who is helping me out, is a pretty good singer.

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So what we have agreed to do or what I would be happy to do

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
is if we're able to get the required number of participants--

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
if 1000 people help us out--we will happily sing the song of your choice.

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We have no shame if it will help us push forth the boundaries of human knowledge.

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So if you like Irish music, [singing voice] "Oh, it is the biggest mix-up

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
"that you have ever seen. Holy mo, me father loves Nikita Kruschev. Holy moly me."

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
If you like Bollywood musicals, [singing voice] "Pretty woman, dekho dekho na."

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
If you like it un Francais, [singing in French].

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
If you prefer it in Spanish, [singing in Spanish].

87
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
If you like Japanese, [singing in Japanese].

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Or if you just like more English or American folk music,

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
[singing voice] "Lemon tree, very pretty."

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
We'll do anything you want.

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Whether it be the theme to The Muppet Show

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
or whether you'd like to hear me butcher romantic Mandarin songs,

93
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
[singing in Mandarin], we will do it.

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Start a thread in the forum and vote for your favorite.

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Participate in the survey, and I will happily do almost anything

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
in order to make the world a better place with future research.

97
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Please participate if you do have a few minutes,

98
00:06:04,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but it is by no means required. Thank you.
