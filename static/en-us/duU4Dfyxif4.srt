00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,820
With this lesson, we begin the second major unit of the course on software

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,750
architecture. Which is you recall, is the highest level of expression to

3
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:16,290
a design problem. In actual practice, software architecture and

4
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,230
industry usually amounts to the preparation of a slide for

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,000
display that contains some boxes and arrows depicting the major components of

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,110
a system, and how they're connected together. We want to take a more

7
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:33,200
principled look at what this essential aspect of software design is all about.

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,550
Here is such a diagram. The boxes depict major components of the system, and

9
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,928
the arrows indicate some form of dependency among the boxes. It might be

10
00:00:42,928 --> 00:00:47,900
the flow of control, it might be the flow of data. The point being is that the,

11
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,760
there's no actual semantics to the diagram that is universally accepted.
