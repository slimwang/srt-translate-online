Here are a few more things that you should know about masks.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,340
Interrupt masks are maintained on per CPU basis.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:11,360
What this means is that if the interrupt mask disables a particular interrupt,

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,230
the hardware support for

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,370
routing interrupts will just not deliver that interrupt to the CPU.

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:22,530
The signal mask, however, that depends on what exactly is the user-level

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:27,170
process, for instance, the user-level thread, doing at a particular moment, so

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,170
we say that the signal masks are per execution context.

9
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,760
If a signal mask is disabled, the kernel sees that, and in that case,

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,350
it will not interrupt the corresponding thread.

11
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,310
So it will not interrupt this execution context.
