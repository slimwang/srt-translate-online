00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,220
Suppose it were possible to formulate
the list ranking problem as a scan,

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,500
what values would you scan?

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,920
That is, imagine you have this list and

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,618
you're allowed to put any value
into each of these boxes.

5
00:00:13,618 --> 00:00:17,100
And you want to to choose those initial
values, so that if you were to do a scan

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,509
on the list,
you would get the ranks shown here.

7
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:26,040
So here's your mission, enter the values
as integers into each of these boxes.
