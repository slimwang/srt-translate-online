If I add the x terms together, I get 3x. And if I add positive y and negative y,

2
00:00:05,201 --> 00:00:10,399
those sum to 0, negative 11 plus 26 equals 15. If you have trouble thinking

3
00:00:10,399 --> 00:00:15,649
about that, try 26 minus 11, that would also b 15. Without even realizing it,

4
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:21,473
you've actually already performed elimination. We've eliminated the y variables,

5
00:00:21,473 --> 00:00:22,563
they added to 0.
