00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:06,000
It's often desirable to bring together
data from many sources and providers.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,050
But they may be cautious about
participating because of concerns

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,319
about how their data will be used and
whether their institution might

4
00:00:14,319 --> 00:00:17,721
be portrayed negatively or
look bad in some analyses.

5
00:00:17,721 --> 00:00:21,804
One solution, as depicted here for
PopMedNet, is for

6
00:00:21,804 --> 00:00:26,689
each contributing institution to
maintain control of its data in

7
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:31,659
what is often called a data locker,
but be capable of accepting and

8
00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:36,600
responding to queries that
might go to many data sources.

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,000
PopMedNet is intended to support
medical product safety analysis and

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,290
comparative effectiveness
research of alternate treatments,

11
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,610
both of which rest on obtaining data
from multiple sources and other studies.
