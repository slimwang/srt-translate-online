1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,980
This was a tough one.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,770
Media queries can get complex.

3
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,760
Especially when they start
overlapping like what we've got here.

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,840
But, let's go ahead and
set through each part step by step.

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,320
AA applies from zero to 300 and
also from 300 to 400.

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,949
Which makes its max width, 400 pixels.

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:25,770
BB starts at 301 pixels, so
we set its min-width to 301, and

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:31,930
it goes all the way to 600 pixels, so
we call that max-width, 600 pixels.

9
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:39,380
CC starts at 601 pixels, so
we say it has a min-width of 601 pixels.

10
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,670
And it doesn't have an end,
so there is no max width.

11
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:49,030
DD seems to be the same as CC,
except it starts at 961 pixels.

12
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:49,790
That wasn't too bad.
