As we just stated, Linux represents

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,320
the operations on those files have
some meaning that's device specific.

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,840
As a quiz, look at the following
three Linux commands

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,550

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,640
What operation do they perform?

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,540
Type your answer in the text box and

7
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,800
