00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,430
Doing design you need to be able to represent those designs and a very popular

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:10,440
way of doing that is with diagrams. This course focused on UML, using UML and

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,230
constructing those diagrams and the purpose of this lesson is to review for

4
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:19,380
you some of the different kinds of diagrams that are there. There's lots of

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,010
diagrams, we're not going to be using them all. But I'd like you to be at least

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,310
familiar with what ones are there. So lets step back a little bit in history.

7
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:32,229
Diagrams have been a popular part of software development from the beginning.

8
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:37,320
I still have a flow chart template that you use for

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,190
writing out the control logic of an algorithm. Over the years,

10
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,690
various sophisticated diagramming techniques have developed. Okay.

11
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:51,030
Among those are SADT, Jackson Design, Structure Design and so on.

12
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,770
Each with their own particular approach to diagramming. In the 1980s, object

13
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,356
oriented tech, techniques began to emerge, and with them. Various techniques for

14
00:01:00,356 --> 00:01:05,010
diagramming [UNKNOWN] solutions. The first one we want to look at is called OMT.
