1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,900
If you'd rather minimize the use
of any object all together,

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,280
you can provide information about
the contents of Objective C

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,322
collections when those arrays
are defined using lightweight generics.

4
00:00:11,322 --> 00:00:15,852
For example, let's say we added
a property to our BookClass to represent

5
00:00:15,852 --> 00:00:17,760
the awards that a book has one.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,564
Each item in the array is a pointer to
an NSString representing the name of

7
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:23,368
the award.

8
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:26,229
We indicate that by placing NSString in

9
00:00:26,229 --> 00:00:30,832
an asterisk between angle brackets
before the property name.

10
00:00:30,832 --> 00:00:34,442
And here's what it looks like
when it's translated to Swift.

11
00:00:34,442 --> 00:00:39,532
Notice that, instead of being an array
holding objects of type any object,

12
00:00:39,532 --> 00:00:42,961
awards is an array holding
objects of type String.

13
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:44,740
We can also do this with dictionaries.

14
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:49,326
For example, we might have a property
representing a dictionary of quotes

15
00:00:49,326 --> 00:00:52,688
about the book that are paired
with their source URLs.

16
00:00:52,688 --> 00:00:56,310
Again, we indicate the types
held by the dictionary here and

17
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,880
between angle brackets.

18
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,564
And then,

19
00:00:58,564 --> 00:01:03,507
if we look at the generated interface,
we can see that the swift version of our

20
00:01:03,507 --> 00:01:08,313
quotes dictionary is holding keys of
type string and values of type NSURL.

21
00:01:08,313 --> 00:01:13,007
Keep in mind that lightweight generics
are only supported for NS-array,

22
00:01:13,007 --> 00:01:15,174
NS-set and its NS-dictionary.

23
00:01:15,174 --> 00:01:17,490
They won't work with NS mutable arrays.
