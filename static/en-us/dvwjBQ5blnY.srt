We've talked about using 
intents within Sunshine

2
00:00:02,352 --> 00:00:04,976
to start activities 
and send data between apps.

3
00:00:05,696 --> 00:00:08,470
But what if you want to broadcast 
a message to many apps?

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,470
For example, the system will broadcast 
a message, saying that

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,450
the device is charging 
or that it's just finished rebooting.

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:21,080
To do that ourselves,
we use the SendBroadcast method

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,770
to broadcast an intent. 
And those broadcasts are recieved

8
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,760
by broadcast receivers, typically referred
to as, simply, receivers.

9
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,159
Using intent filters, 
like the ones we saw earlier,

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,770
they indicate which broadcast 
they're interested in.

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,090
So if we return to our envelope 
metaphor from earlier,

12
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,050
in the case of a broadcast intent, 
your envelope is basically addressed

13
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,230
to any broadcast receiver 
that's interested in knowing

14
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,970
that this event has happened.
And it does that using intent filter.

15
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,720
So intents, which are broadcast, 
are transmitted to every app

16
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,320
with a broadcast receiver 
that has an intent filter

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,159
telling the system 
your ideas are intriguing

18
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,801
to me and I wish 
to subscribe to your newsletter.
