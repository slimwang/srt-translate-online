00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,600
The answer, too big: If P has more threads than a thread block is allowed to have,

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,910
then we can't use shared memory to share data among all P threads,

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,504
because we have to distribute that tile across multiple thread blocks.

4
00:00:11,504 --> 00:00:15,534
Another consideration is making sure that we have at least as many thread blocks as SMs

5
00:00:15,534 --> 00:00:18,213
or else SMs will sit idle.
