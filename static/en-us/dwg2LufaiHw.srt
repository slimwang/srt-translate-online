1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,670
You can't replace for with parallel for,

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,270
because these iterations
are not independent.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:06,110
So what should you do?

4
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:10,090
Now you know that a single reduction
is parallelizable by using

5
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,750
a reduction tree.

6
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:12,990
So here's a thought.

7
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,000
What if we did n completely
independent parallel reductions?

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,080
Here's what the code might look like.

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,290
My question to you is, what is the work,
and what is the span for this algorithm?

10
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,610
Choose one option for each.
