00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let me close this section with my favorite story on bug reproduction.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In 2002, I went to a conference to give a laptop demonstration of a complex software system.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Before I left, we had taken every precaution

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
so that the software would run perfectly.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But then came the evening before the demonstration.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I would be sitting in my hotel room and try out,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
for the last time, so everything would be working fine.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Nothing worked. The software would run into timeout errors anytime, everywhere.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I phoned my department at home.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
They had the same software, on the same machine, and everything worked.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I debugged this for 3 hours in a row.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
My battery had even run out of power, so I had to recharge it.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That's when I decided to restart from scratch.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
To my amazement, the demo now ran just fine.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And so I wondered, why did the program work after restarting from scratch?

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Was this because of some caching problem?

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Did this have something to do with the battery?

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Was this because I reinstalled everything?

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Or because of cosmic radiation?

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hint: I gave you an indication right within the story.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Over to you.
