1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,762
So, how does Google give feedback for
new Google apps?

2
00:00:03,762 --> 00:00:07,730
Even before internal testing
among employees, or dogfooding,

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:11,960
each app goes to the Google
User Experience review process.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,230
The goal of this process is to get the
app in front of experienced Googlers to

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,980
focus on various parts of the user
experience, such as design,

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,070
interaction patterns,
accessibility, and more.

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,120
As we looked into productionizing
Sunshine, we wanted to get some expert

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,710
help with the UI that would
both leverage a broader set of

9
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,740
implementations skills than we were
able to present in the first course.

10
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,720
And begin to illustrate
a material design concepts.

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,320
Of course we turned to Android UX legend
Roman Nurik who has helped many Android

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,970
developers improve the UX of their
applications with direct feedback.

13
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,590
Develop design tools to make
constructing Android UX easier.

14
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,905
And who has contributed DashClock and
Muzei to the Android world.

15
00:00:48,905 --> 00:00:53,410
[SOUND] Roman, it's so
great to have you here with us.

16
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,793
Now, when you first looked at
Sunshine from Android Fundamentals,

17
00:00:56,793 --> 00:01:00,077
what are the things that you felt
worked really well in the design?

18
00:01:00,077 --> 00:01:03,815
>> So, let me take out my phone and
just point them out.

19
00:01:03,815 --> 00:01:07,701
So, I think that the first thing
that was done really well was just

20
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:11,980
the use of hierarchy, or
the overall hierarchy of the screen.

21
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,130
Yeah you have your branding on top and
then you have

22
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,240
the most important piece of information,
the current conditions and

23
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,100
weather, at the top as well in this
kind of nice, big display type.

24
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,290
And then below that you have the
secondary information, the forecast for

25
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,130
tomorrow and the next day and so on.

26
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:28,690
That was one.

27
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,862
I think another that was done
really well is the use of keylines.

28
00:01:31,862 --> 00:01:36,970
So keylines are essentially these
invisible vertical rules that

29
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:40,390
you can use to align
streams of information.

30
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,870
And it felt like specifically the use of
that second keyline, the one where you

31
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:50,684
have the brand name, the current
temperature, the dates of the kind

32
00:01:50,684 --> 00:01:55,060
of later forecast, those are kind of
left aligned to that second keyline.

33
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,940
And I feel like that is
really nice in helping

34
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,340
visually process the information very,
very quickly.

35
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,040
So I feel like those are probably
two of my favorite aspects of

36
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,230
the existing design.

37
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,199
>> Tell us a bit about what you designed
in the new production version of

38
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,560
Sunshine, and why.

39
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,320
>> Well,
I think I'll just talk about one,

40
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,700
I think that there's one that's
really important here, and

41
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,530
it's an essential part of material
design, and that's the use of surfaces.

42
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,710
So the first is I felt that, well, with
surfaces, I guess, in the existing app,

43
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:28,590
you kind of, I guess the use of
surfaces was all over the place.

44
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,390
On portrait phone screens,

45
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:34,860
on landscape tablet screens,
it wasn't really consistent.

46
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,760
It felt like information was being
presented in different ways.

47
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,480
And what's worse, on landscape tablets,

48
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,690
you actually had this kind of
massive sea of white space.

49
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,510
And the information was kind
of floating on top of that.

50
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,050
And it felt like the use
of surfaces can really help

51
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,410
both manage that white space,
and introduce consistency.

52
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:00,310
And so in the new design,
we use this single elevated white card

53
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:05,630
to present the current conditions of,
I guess the current temperature, right?

54
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:09,680
And we use that consistently
across phones and tablets.

55
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,720
And so, that does three things.

56
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,390
The first is that, again, it
introduces consistency across screens.

57
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,964
The second is it that actually
makes it easier to do motion to,

58
00:03:19,964 --> 00:03:22,980
another big part of
shell design is motion.

59
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,980
It helps you do things like
transition from list to detail.

60
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,670
When you can kind of have a single
object that appears in both and

61
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,530
transition them,
it's really nice and easy.

62
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:39,810
And I guess the third is it really
kind of helps you manage space.

63
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:44,090
On that landscape tablet screen, the
fact that you can have this kind of nice

64
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:48,960
big card to present one
major stream of information.

65
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,240
And kind of have everything else fall,
I guess, from outside of that.

66
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,640
It makes a nice use of space, I guess.

67
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,370
I mean just very bluntly,

68
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:02,330
it's a really nice use of that
massive screen real estate.

69
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,286
And so it does those three
things really well I think.

70
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:08,186
And that's one of the things that we
really focus on in this redesign for

71
00:04:08,186 --> 00:04:08,838
Sunshine.

72
00:04:08,838 --> 00:04:12,541
>> [SOUND] Wow, tons of great feedback.

73
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:15,003
Like we expected,
we have a really good start.

74
00:04:15,003 --> 00:04:18,154
But there are some rough edges to work
through before we have a production

75
00:04:18,154 --> 00:04:20,180
ready user experience.

76
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:25,120
So, how does that constructive feedback
map to our production quality goals?

77
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,010
Well, the design feedback we got
around consistency, white space, and

78
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,150
motion fall under [INAUDIBLE].

79
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,410
Those little details can really
make Sunshine stand out.

80
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,090
When you combine that with
the suggestions Team FixIT has made,

81
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,530
such as under Simplify My Life, having
Sunshine display useful information,

82
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,440
even when there's no network
connectivity or poor user input.

83
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,500
And under Make Me Amazing,
having Sunshine open up new,

84
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,630
extremely useful ways of getting
weather information front and center.

85
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,370
We had some pretty good ideas about
how to start getting us closer

86
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,590
to the production of Sunshine.
