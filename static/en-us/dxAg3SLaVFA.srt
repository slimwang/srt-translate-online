00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,043
Now let's go see all this in action with Dr.Zelicks and Callie the sea lion.

2
00:00:04,043 --> 00:00:09,496
>> This is Carlie. Callie, can you wave hi? Good! Can you wave with the other

3
00:00:09,496 --> 00:00:16,671
hand? Good, good. Here at Moss Landing Green Laboratories, we run a teaching

4
00:00:16,671 --> 00:00:25,550
aquarium for students, can we salute? Good. From all over the world. The

5
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,650
beginning of the foundation of the relationship that I have with Carlie is

6
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:37,842
basic obedience. Water. Good. So I put her in the water when I ask. Hold. I can

7
00:00:37,842 --> 00:00:43,270
ask her to wait there patiently for me. And the reason that she's willing to do

8
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,855
these things is because of the reinforcement history of

9
00:00:45,855 --> 00:00:46,460
[INAUDIBLE]

10
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,856
conditioning that I have used to form these basic behaviors. The second basic

11
00:00:51,856 --> 00:00:55,122
behavior that I have used all the time is one of the basic

12
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:55,903
[INAUDIBLE]

13
00:00:55,903 --> 00:01:05,482
training techniques and it's called targeting good. This is a nose target. And

14
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:09,900
Carlie is trained to put her nose to my hand. Wherever I put my hand, Carlie's

15
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,849
nose is going to go. Good. And she stops targeting when she hears that sound

16
00:01:15,849 --> 00:01:20,790
that I make which is called a bridge. A bridge is a stimulus that tells the

17
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,434
animal they've done something correctly, and reinforcement is coming. There's a

18
00:01:25,434 --> 00:01:29,320
type of secondary reinforcer, a conditioned reinforcer which helps the animal

19
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,916
understand the reinforcement is on its way, without having to deliver the

20
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:39,595
reinforcement at that very second. Carllie is receiving a variety of different

21
00:01:39,595 --> 00:01:43,382
types of reinforcers. That right there is an ice cube, which she's been

22
00:01:43,382 --> 00:01:47,395
conditioned to like. And we've conditioned her to like it by association with

23
00:01:47,395 --> 00:01:53,474
other things that she already likes. Including, the fish. And then there's also

24
00:01:53,474 --> 00:01:57,780
her relationship with me. This is tactile reinforcement that she has to be

25
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:06,746
trained to enjoy. Yes! Don't stop! Yes! Don't stop! One of the things that

26
00:02:06,746 --> 00:02:10,508
comes from being associated with reinforcement for a long period of time is the

27
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:16,137
relationship. Through classical conditioning by associating myself with all

28
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:20,421
good experiences for her, I have a strong value to her, I have more value than

29
00:02:20,421 --> 00:02:25,783
the food has. And we're demonstrating that right now because the food is over

30
00:02:25,783 --> 00:02:30,154
there and she and I are right here together. That's what can be formed with a

31
00:02:30,154 --> 00:02:34,628
long history of partnership. Yes? Good! Alright
