00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,537
Many times, when you have complicated conditions, you want to combine them. For

2
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:07,624
example, maybe you want to do something if one condition is true, or another

3
00:00:07,624 --> 00:00:12,490
one. In Java, there are three operators that you can use to combine conditions.

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:17,533
They look like this. The two ampersands are an and these two vertical bars are

5
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:25,262
on or. And the exclamation mark somewhat is a not. You might find it useful to

6
00:00:25,262 --> 00:00:29,806
remember that the not equal operator that you've seen a few units ago also has

7
00:00:29,806 --> 00:00:36,450
the exclamation mark. Let me show you a few examples for using these operators.

8
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,135
And once again, we'll be looking at flags where the visual appearance should

9
00:00:40,135 --> 00:00:45,858
help you. Let's start with this maritime flag for the letter d. Here, I made a

10
00:00:45,858 --> 00:00:50,369
sketch of this flag. When you're in the middle, the pixel should be blue. And

11
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:54,530
otherwise, it should be yellow. So how do we express when you're in the middle?

12
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:59,969
When the y-value is greater than this level. And less than this level, that's

13
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:03,750
where our and comes in, then we're in the middle. This here is 1 5th of the

14
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,112
total height. So, we have two conditions, namely y is at least height over 5,

15
00:01:08,112 --> 00:01:13,576
and the other condition is y is at most height times 4 over 5. Both conditions

16
00:01:13,576 --> 00:01:17,428
have to be fufilled for us to be in the middle, so we use the and operator.

17
00:01:17,428 --> 00:01:22,672
Here it is. Let's just try this out. Here is the condition that you just saw

18
00:01:22,672 --> 00:01:28,530
with the and operator here. And in this case, we return blue. Otherwise, we

19
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,044
return yellow. In this case, I will make a square flag and here it is. So, the

20
00:01:33,044 --> 00:01:37,434
and operator worked out for us. Because we wanted y to be at least here at

21
00:01:37,434 --> 00:01:42,597
most, here. Both conditions had to be true for the blue color. Now, let's look

22
00:01:42,597 --> 00:01:46,356
at another flag. I've sketched up the flag here. And the question is, when

23
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:50,940
should a pixel be blue. In this case, there are four conditions. The x-value

24
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:55,820
should be at least width over third. That means it's over here. The x-value

25
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:00,470
should be at most, width times two thirds. That makes it over here. The y-value

26
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:04,502
should be the height over 3, and the y-value should be at most the height times

27
00:02:04,502 --> 00:02:09,210
two third. All those four conditions need to be fulfilled for a pixel to be

28
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:13,582
built. Now, it's your turn. You'll get to write a program that draws this flag

29
00:02:13,582 --> 00:02:17,450
here with a bit of blue on the inside and white on the outside.
