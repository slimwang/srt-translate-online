1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,740
Now, so far, we've only worked with the decision variant of vertex cover.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:07,420
So, what about the optimization problem? Actually, that's not that difficult.

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:12,510
We just run through all values of K. So we will first start off assuming K=1.

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:24,500
Then our algorithm requires O(2.4¹*n³), then we'll increase K=2, algorithm requires o(2.4²*n³).

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,620
So each time we're solving the decision problem here,

6
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:31,500
and we increase K even further to K=3 and so on and so on and so on.

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:38,060
Until we hit some value k’ which is the size of the smallest vertex cover of the input graph.

8
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,010
Of course, we don't know what that size will be in advanced?

9
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,720
But once we have increased K enough, solving the decision variant will give us the answer, yes.

10
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,740
Now, how much running time is this in total?

11
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,250
Well, you need to know a bit of discrete mathematics for this,

12
00:00:50,250 --> 00:01:01,250
but running time O(2.4¹+2.4²+)...(2.4^k')*n²).

13
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,040
Now if you have a discrete math course and remember what you learned there,

14
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,400
you will recognize this part here as a geometric series

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:20,440
and this evaluates to (2.4^k'⁻¹-1/2.4-1) which is the same as 0(2.4^k'),

16
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:25,490
and k' is the size of the smallest vertex cover *n³. We forgot the n³ here which is right here.

17
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:31,240
And this is amazing because now it means that not only the decision variant of vertex cover

18
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:37,570
can be solved in (2.4^k' n³) time, but it means that the optimization variant of vertex cover

19
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:42,590
can also be solved in O(2.4^k'n³ )time,

20
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:46,330
where k is the minimum size of a vertex cover for the input graph.

21
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:50,990
And this again emphasizes the fact, small vertex covers are easy to find

22
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,950
even if we don't know that a graph has a small vertex cover as long as it is small,

23
00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:00,180
it will be easy to find and for any fixed k, so either in the decision variant, we fixed k

24
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:06,180
or we say we look at all graphs that say have a vertex cover of size 10 or 20 or 30,

25
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,000
we can solve this NP complete problem in polynomial time.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,510
And this is a concept known as Fixed Parameter Tractability.

27
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:19,360
Well, that means is that as long as the parameter that measures the hardness

28
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,920
and in this case, it's the size of a vertex cover for your graph,

29
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,190
as long as that parameter is small or fixed, then you can solve that problem in polynomial time

30
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,750
and that is what this here says, so as long as the parameter is fixed,

31
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,000
the problem is tractable, if the parameter is not fixed, so for example,

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,750
there's a function of n, then the problem is not tractable.

33
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,990
And this of course is a super neat technique for solving vertex cover

34
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:45,360
and actually 2.4^k is actually a very bad exponent here.

35
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,850
We only did that because of what's easier to explain the problem that way.

36
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:53,980
The currently best algorithms have an exponential factor of about 1.3^k.

37
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,880
Actually, a current state of the art is that you can solve vertex cover in

38
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,880
1.3^k times some polynomial time.

39
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,770
Now, the polynomial here that depends on certain analysis factors and so on

40
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:09,130
but the important thing here is to see, first of all, vertex cover is fixed parameter tractable

41
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:12,240
and second of all, the base of the exponent is actually really good.

42
00:03:12,240 --> 99:59:59,999
It's only 1.3^k.
