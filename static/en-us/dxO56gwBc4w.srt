1
00:00:00,102 --> 00:00:04,311
Now recall, we have looked at Image
Warping, which basically is an attempt

2
00:00:04,311 --> 00:00:07,795
of trying to figure out how to
transform one image to the other,

3
00:00:07,795 --> 00:00:11,476
which actually says that maybe now
we should be looking at as a way of

4
00:00:11,476 --> 00:00:15,923
actually doing a warping from Projection
Plane 1 to Projection Plane 2.

5
00:00:15,923 --> 00:00:19,417
Of course, we had looked at things
like translating an image, scaling, or

6
00:00:19,417 --> 00:00:22,694
Euclidean things like rotation,
which includes full translation and

7
00:00:22,694 --> 00:00:24,080
rotating the image.

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,360
But, we also looked at
things like rotation and

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,129
affine projective types of things.

10
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:32,494
If you recall, translation basically
required us to model two unknowns.

11
00:00:32,494 --> 00:00:37,001
Euclidean, which basically had
the true translations when one

12
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:42,014
rotation had three unknowns,
affine, which I counted from.

13
00:00:42,014 --> 00:00:45,060
I had six unknowns and
projective had eight unknowns.
