Pretty soon we're going to look at some even more interesting functions, ones

00:00:03,742 --> 00:00:08,050
that involve absolute value signs. But I think that before we do that, we

00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,100
should do a little refresher on absolute value itself, or absolute value

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,886
functions. I've written down several equations for you and also drawn several

5
00:00:15,886 --> 00:00:20,919
graphs. Please match the letter of each graph with the proper equation.
