00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,330
A picture is worth 1,000 words and

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,520
images play an integral
part of every website.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,960
The HTTP archive has it pegged
at near 1.2 megabytes per page,

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,400
which means images take
up 65% of every website.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,820
In order to do responsive web design,
we need to consider images.

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,590
If the rest of my page is changing
based on device characteristics.

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,210
Wouldn't it make sense that my
images should be changing too?

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,010
>> You're absolutely right, Cam.

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,940
Using the same image, but

10
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:32,150
changing the resolution is probably
one of the most common use cases.

11
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:36,610
Think providing a standard image for
a laptop, but a 2X image for

12
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,960
a high DPI display, like
a Chromebook Pixel, or a Retina iMac.

13
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:45,310
The best way to do this is using the
source set attribute on an image tag.

14
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,970
With source set, the browser will
choose which file it wants, and

15
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,180
then only download that one.

16
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,590
>> Well that might work for
logos and some other things, but

17
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,870
what about the case where I want
a different crop of an image?

18
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:01,840
It doesn't make sense to show a big,
wide image on a narrow portrait phone.

19
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,660
>> Exactly, and
that's what's called art direction, and

20
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,060
where the new picture element come in.

21
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:12,010
The picture element uses media
queries to select which image to use,

22
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,190
but responsive images could
be a course of their own.

23
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,990
Thankfully my good friend and

24
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,259
fellow developer advocate
Sam Dutton has you covered here.

25
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,460
Hey, Sam.

26
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,280
>> Thanks Pete, great stuff.

27
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,410
When you're finished with this course,
you'd like to find out more about

28
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:32,050
responsive images, stuff like
the picture element source set, come and

29
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,990
check out our course
on responsive images.

30
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,320
>> Thanks, Sam.

31
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,230
>> So Pete, it seems like we've
covered all the usual elements for

32
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,350
responsive design, what about tables?

33
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,510
>> That's a great question.

34
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,820
Let's take a look.

35
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,320
>> Cool.
