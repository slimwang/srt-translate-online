00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,166
At the end of our last lesson, I showed you an example of how to start with the

2
00:00:04,166 --> 00:00:08,588
equation for a parabola in standard form and then work through modifying it, so

3
00:00:08,588 --> 00:00:12,932
that it's in the form that we can just read off the coordinates of the vertex.

4
00:00:12,932 --> 00:00:17,161
Now you're going to get a chance to find this. But don't worry. I'll help you

5
00:00:17,161 --> 00:00:21,560
through it. Let's say we're dealing with the equation, y eqiuals x squared minus

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,070
8x plus 15. Remember our goal here is to get this in the form y minus k equals

7
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,637
the quantity x minus h squared. So the first thing that I notice about this form

8
00:00:30,637 --> 00:00:34,775
over here that we're aiming for is that we have y minus a constant. So one

9
00:00:34,775 --> 00:00:39,191
logical first step would be to get the constant that's on the right side, to be

10
00:00:39,191 --> 00:00:43,555
over on the left side instead. So the first thing I'd like you to do then is to

11
00:00:43,555 --> 00:00:48,210
make that change, getting the constant term to be on the left hand side instead.

12
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,357
And rewrite the equation in this box.
