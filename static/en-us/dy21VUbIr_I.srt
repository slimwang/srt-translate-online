00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,855
This equation represents a hyperbola that opens to the left and to the right. I

00:00:04,855 --> 00:00:09,425
hope you've got the hang of this. We'll start by moving 2 y squared to the left

3
00:00:09,425 --> 00:00:13,940
hand side. So we need to subtract 2 y squared here and subtract 2 y squared

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:19,128
here. This leaves us with this equation. We have subtraction between our x

5
00:00:19,128 --> 00:00:22,656
squared term an our y squared term, so we definitely know that the conic, is a

6
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:27,705
hyperbola. Now to determine which direction it opens, we look at which term is

7
00:00:27,705 --> 00:00:33,270
positive. Well the x squared term is positive. So that's why we know our

8
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,470
hyperbola opens left, an it opens to the right.
