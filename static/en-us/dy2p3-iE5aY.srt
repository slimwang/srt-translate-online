1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,110
So the idea of Potential-based Shaping
is going to be this.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,090
Instead of giving little bonuses for
good things happening,

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,320
what we're actually going to do is
put bonuses on states of the world.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,927
Then when you achieve a certain state
of the world you get that bonus.

5
00:00:13,927 --> 00:00:16,390
And if you unachieve that state
of the world you lose that bonus.

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,977
So everything kind of
balances out nicely.

7
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:21,620
So we'll write down an equation for
that in a moment but

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,066
let's see if we can think about what
state based rewards might look like

9
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:28,358
in the context of this little soccer
example we were talking about.

10
00:00:28,358 --> 00:00:29,372
>> Okay.

11
00:00:29,372 --> 00:00:34,153
>> So the official reward function has
us getting a +100 for scoring a goal but

12
00:00:34,153 --> 00:00:35,680
we wanted to give hints.

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,880
We wanted to give hints
to the system for

14
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,120
getting near the ball, hitting the ball,
getting the ball near the goal.

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:42,970
So we need to do that,

16
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,230
we need to define that now in
terms of the states of the world.

17
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:52,910
So what would be some appropriate
rewards that we could put in for that?

18
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:56,600
>> Well, I mean, I think they would be
very similar to the ones that we were

19
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,270
talking about before, right?

20
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:02,459
If you're talking about states, you want
to be in the state of the ball moving

21
00:01:02,459 --> 00:01:05,230
towards the goal, or
the ball being near the goal,

22
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,820
or you moving towards the ball,
or kicking the ball.

23
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,105
Those are all states you
would like to be in, right?

24
00:01:10,105 --> 00:01:11,455
>> Yeah, okay.

25
00:01:11,455 --> 00:01:15,862
All right, so yeah, and the way
that we were writing that before,

26
00:01:15,862 --> 00:01:21,530
I think, was something like 1 over
the distance between us and the ball.

27
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,300
And 1 over the distance
between the ball and the goal.

28
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,090
But now we think of these as being
bonuses that are tied to the state.

29
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:33,290
Not values that we're getting for
becoming close to the ball.

30
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,260
So there's always this value,

31
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,970
this potential that's keeping track
of how close we are to the ball.

32
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,904
And when we're close to the ball,
it's a big number.

33
00:01:40,904 --> 00:01:42,740
And when we're far from
the ball it's a small number.

34
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,430
And the reward that we're going to get,
is we change from state to state,

35
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,490
how much more potential
have we've gotten?
