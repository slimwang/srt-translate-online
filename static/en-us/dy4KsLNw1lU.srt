00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,333
First I'm going to talk about networks in general. The

2
00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:06,240
internet is just a special kind of network. There are lots

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,780
of different ways to define a network. We are going to

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,152
use quite a precise definition. So we are going to define

5
00:00:11,152 --> 00:00:13,680
a network as a group of entities. And entities could be

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,330
people, they could be computers, they could be organizations, they could

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,980
be governments, that can communicate, even though they're not all directly

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,930
connected. So here's an example to show what that definition means.

9
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,810
So we have Alice. And we have Bob.

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,060
And Alice and Bob know each other, and can

11
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,670
talk to each other. The way they talk, we can

12
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,540
call the channel. That could be just talking in

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,790
person. That could be talking over a telephone. We're going to

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,980
say that just this is not enough to be

15
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,370
a network. This is just two people having a conversation.

16
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,140
If we had the second scenario, we'll say we have

17
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:56,300
Alice, Bob and Charlie. And Alice can communicate with Bob.

18
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:03,160
Bob can communicate with Charlie. And Charlie can communicate

19
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,870
with Alice. But they can do all this directly. They're

20
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,540
all directly connected. If Alice wants to talk to

21
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,060
Charlie, well, she has a direct link to Charlie. She

22
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,180
doesn't need to use Bob. There's no way to

23
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,910
communicate other than across these direct links. So even in

24
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,880
this case where there are three people who can all

25
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,370
communicate we're still going to say that's not a network.

26
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,070
Many people would call both of these networks. We're going

27
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:29,830
to use a somewhat more precise definition where neither of these

28
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:33,860
will be considered a network. What will be considered a

29
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,080
network is this third example and in the third example we

30
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,400
have three nodes. We have Alice, Bob, and Charlie let's

31
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,400
say. They're the three people but now Alice is not directly

32
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,110
connected to Charlie. But there's a way that Alice can

33
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,880
send a message to Charlie. And she can send the message,

34
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,840
because Bob will forward the message for

35
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,390
her. Once the message goes through two hops,

36
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,780
to make it so two people are not

37
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,460
directly connected, can communicate. And maybe Charlie can

38
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:05,060
also send messages back to Alice. Then we call it a network. So that's going to

39
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:10,270
be our definition. There has to be at least three entities and there has to be

40
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,150
a way that entities that are not

41
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,100
directly connected can still communicate. So to see

42
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,640
that you understand that definition of a

43
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,830
network and maybe also know a little bit

44
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,320
of world history we're going to have a

45
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,350
quiz. So here are the possible answers. Ten

46
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:30,280
years old, 30 years old, 100 years old, 1000 years old, or over 3000 years old.
