1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Fortunately, this graph is small enough

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
that we can enumerate through all the possible Eulerian paths.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Starting at Javier, we can go through Christian to Sayo,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
over to Marcie to Tyrone to Hubert, back to Javier, Marcie--for one.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We can co Javier to Christian to Sayo to Marcie back to Javier

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
to Hubert to Tyrone finishing at Marcie for our second one.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We can go Javier to Hubert to Tyrone to Marcie to Javier to Christian

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
to Sayo to Marcie for our third one.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
There's a fourth path through, and there's a fifth path.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Finally, there's a sixth path.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
That is all the Eulerian paths through the graph starting with Javier.
