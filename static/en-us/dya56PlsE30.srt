1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,760
So have a festival, what do I want to do with it?

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,170
>> Well, think about it. What are, what are the things in

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,230
a festival that you care about most? What do you want to track?

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,690
>> I want to know, I mean, I want to

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,920
know when the festival is. I want to know, I

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,240
want to know a lot of things. What it is,

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,390
who's going, who, I mean, who's playing, tickets, everything.

8
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,820
>> Great. Well, what we did now was created our festival object. And

9
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,150
so, that's going to be the overall thing that we store our data into.

10
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:23,490
>> Okay.

11
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,540
>> But then on that object, you can create fields,

12
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,520
which are the characteristics about that object that we want to

13
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,770
track. So, the object being festival, those characteristics you named were.

14
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,300
>> Like start date, and date, that kind of thing?

15
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:35,790
>> Exactly.

16
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:36,000
>> Okay.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,800
>> So, in order to create those we can do that

18
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,030
by going to this little tab on the right hand side.

19
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,140
>> This little arrow guy?

20
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:45,130
>> Yeah. It's our quick access menu to toggle between the

21
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,700
app, and the administrative set up. So, let's add some fields.
