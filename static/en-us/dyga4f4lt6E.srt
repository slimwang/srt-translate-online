00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,170
Great job finishing lesson two stage one.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,110
Remember that in your terminal you may need to control C

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,760
in order to get your command prompt back.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,730
I like to clear my terminal to have a clean working space.

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,220
Now, similar to lesson one,

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,670
you will connect the random sentence spout to your topology.

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,630
However, now we are going to count sentences.

8
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:21,780
Here's a thought question.

9
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,720
When updating your topology what string grouping is

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,280
needed to insure sentence copies are sent to the same count bolt?

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,450
You'll be implementing this soon.

12
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:35,166
In part one, navigate in your favorite text editor, again I'm using Atom,

13
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:38,253
to lesson2 > stage2.

14
00:00:38,253 --> 00:00:42,620
Source > jvm > udacity > storm.

15
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,120
First, you will copy and

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,190
duplicate your word count topology to create a sentence count topology.

17
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,640
Following the Java convention you'll need to update the required class and

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,180
constructor names to match the file name.

19
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,300
In part two, in your new file SentenceCountTopology.java.

20
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,900
Write an import statement for

21
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,720
the spout random sentence spout that I've included here.

22
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,590
Notice that this is under udacity, storm, spout, random sentence spout.

23
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,660
In part thee in your topology builder, scroll down and

24
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:20,565
remove the word spout and connect the random sentence spout with an ID.

25
00:01:20,565 --> 00:01:23,330
Sentence-spout.

26
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:28,360
In Part 4 in your Topology Builder, connect the sentence spout to the CountBolt.

27
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,780
Here again, what connection is needed to count individual sentences.

28
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,760
Similar to the word count topology, what field does this require?

29
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:41,200
Remember that you must check the random sentence spout declaration for

30
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,670
the correct field.

31
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,420
Finally, in Part 5, using Maven, package your Storm program.

32
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,200
And submit your topology.

33
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,750
Notice that the visualization will run because the report bolt is

34
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,100
already connected to the count bolt.

35
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,460
Once you have a build success, you can submit your storm as usual.

36
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,060
Remember to use the dependencies jar.

37
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,640
And making sure that your flask server is running,

38
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,380
you'll see that the sentences now are being displayed.

39
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,190
And as the count increases, the sentences should increase in size.

40
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,500
And there it goes.

41
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,620
Remember after your visualization is running,

42
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,220
why don't you go into the random sentence spout and change the sentences so

43
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,200
that you either let us know what you're thinking about the class.

44
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,890
Or letting us know how you're feeling.

45
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,760
Or even just entering some of your favorite song lyrics.

46
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,520
After you get your visualization running, take a screen shot and

47
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,470
post it to the forum.

48
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,970
And comment on two other of your fellow learners' postings.

49
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,760
Lastly, if you already have a Twitter account,

50
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,330
why don't you tweet a screen shot to your followers.

51
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,240
Your code should now match lesson two, stage three.
