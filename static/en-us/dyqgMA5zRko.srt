1
00:00:00,234 --> 00:00:01,910
And, I hope you got this right as, of course,

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,951
1 because the surface area has to add up to 1.

3
00:00:03,951 --> 00:00:06,435
This was to cross-check over here, whereby

4
00:00:06,435 --> 00:00:13,160
1/18th times 12 is two-thirds and 1/36 times

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,493
12 is one-third, and two-thirds plus one-thirds

6
00:00:16,493 --> 00:00:20,428
equals 1. So, this was an example of a non-uniform

7
00:00:20,428 --> 00:00:23,662
density that you were able to compute. As you

8
00:00:23,662 --> 00:00:26,762
can tell, each specific birth time has exactly a

9
00:00:26,762 --> 00:00:30,762
probability of zero and this is just a density.
