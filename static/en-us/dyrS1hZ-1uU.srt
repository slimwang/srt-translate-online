1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:05,280
So we'll now build truth tables for conjunctions and disjunctions and

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,590
negations of sentences, so that we can find the truth of complex sentences

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,550
stated in logic. Now many of you probably are familiar with truth tables, and

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,310
if you are in fact familiar with truth tables, then you can skip this part and

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:23,852
go directly to implication elimination. If you're not familiar with this then

6
00:00:23,852 --> 00:00:28,084
please stay with me, but even so I'm going to go through this quite rapidly. So

7
00:00:28,084 --> 00:00:33,868
here is the truth table for A or B. If A is true, then B.

8
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:39,930
If A is true and B is true, then A or B is true. If A is true and

9
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:46,500
B is false, then A or B is still true, because A was true. If A is false and

10
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,354
B is true, then A or B is true, because B was true. One of them is true,

11
00:00:51,354 --> 00:00:56,550
makes this true. If A is false and B is false, than A or B is false.
