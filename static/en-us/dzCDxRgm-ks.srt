1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,190
That almost ends our lesson on frequency.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,170
There's just one more thing that I wanted to talk to you about today,

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:08,930
because it's so prevalent in the processing that you're going to be doing.

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,572
Some psycho physicists, Campbell and Robson studied a long time ago

5
00:00:12,572 --> 00:00:17,990
the contrast sensitivity of the human eye, human vision system not just the eye.

6
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:22,120
Now what you're looking at here is a curve where frequency goes up

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,570
to the right and contrast goes up down.

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:30,990
And probably, if you're like me, hopefully you're not like me,

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,200
one of me is way more than enough, as my children will tell you.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,350
But anyway, if you're like most humans,

11
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:42,020
you probably can see this stuff really well, but not so much up there.

12
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:48,010
And somewhere around there, that curve is where the fall off is.

13
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:53,160
That essentially, you know, lower contrast up here,

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,060
you can't really see the variations.

15
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,440
Same thing with this high contrast, okay?

16
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,520
Your eye is sensitive in different ways.

17
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,810
So what this means is that some frequencies

18
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:11,550
matter more in terms of the importance to you in an image, okay.

19
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,460
In particular, if I were to leave out a bunch of that freq,

20
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,210
you know, frequencies.

21
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:20,760
So that is, if there was low contrast at the high frequency,

22
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,230
you wouldn't even know, so you can use that to do image compression.
