00:00:03,564 --> 00:00:08,987
ourselves. Other times we may be tired, and not very aware. That is we're

awake, but we're not aware. Now it's important to understand, that our

00:00:12,674 --> 00:00:17,492
consciousness changes throughout the day. And this brings us to our two main

00:00:17,492 --> 00:00:21,757
