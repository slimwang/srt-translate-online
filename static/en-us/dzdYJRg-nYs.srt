1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,190
One of the things that's
important now to notice,

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,040
this these types of
transformations can be combined.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,420
To achieve a transformation we
are taking single image and

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,600
then of course use that to
generate a translated image.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,560
This has been translated.

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,000
Then of course I rotate
this image by amount theta.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,310
And then of course I actually
add to it things like shear.

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:24,700
So in essence, this basically shows
that to get these set of parameters here

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,290
which basically now show translation,
this is where this comes in.

10
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:32,000
This kind of rotates the image
theta that we looked at.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,460
And this of course,
also shears it by a certain amount and

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,330
shears it in this amount again
noted by these ratios here.

13
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:43,320
So of course x y w here can
be combined into this and

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,150
we can simplify this by looking at the
basically now there are nine parameters

15
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:52,130
here in this matrix and if we knew
these and combinations of these.

16
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:56,090
Of course, noting here that these
combinations can be done priory and

17
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,120
saved to and applied to imagery one.

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,640
Now one thing I may want to talk
about right here is most of the time

19
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,420
this i value would be 1.

20
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,940
Because remember, the current
condition we had with the ws.

21
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,660
W always wants to come out
to be a w on both sides.

22
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,540
And that would be the case here.

23
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:18,840
So most of the time,
we're looking for these 8 parameters.

24
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,400
Okay?

25
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,700
So let's look at what that means.
