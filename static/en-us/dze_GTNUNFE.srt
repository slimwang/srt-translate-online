How to start your targeted resume.

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:04,440
First, select the job
that interests you, and

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,330
a corresponding job description.

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,110
Before starting a targeted resume,
you want to make sure you have a strong

5
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,260
understanding of the position and
what the employer is looking for.

6
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,550
This requires looking at big and
small scale themes and

7
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,900
patterns within the job description.

8
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,130
When reading a posting,
I like to ask myself questions like,

9
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,310
what are the core features of this job?

10
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,780
What keywords are used?

11
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,430
Are any technical skills highlighted?

12
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,200
Any soft skills mention?

13
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,830
Finally, you'll want to
think about your audience.

14
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,580
To the best of your ability answer the
questions, who will be interviewing you?

15
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,980
What are they looking for that's
not written on the job description?

16
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,770
What do I need to consider about
the organizational culture to construct

17
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:40,280
my resume?

18
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,300
Did you come up with any
additional questions?

19
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,100
Add them to the forum.
