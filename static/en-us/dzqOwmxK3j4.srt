00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,620
The most important thing to keep in mind

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,370
about data cleaning, is that it's an iterative process.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,610
We iterate on first detecting, and then correcting bad

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,750
records. Let's look at some examples. We might have

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,580
text where we expect to find numeric data. So

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,900
the word two instead of the number two. Some

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,190
data items might not be designed according to our

8
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:25,160
specification. They might be missing entire fields. They might

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,450
have extra fields. Or, for example with JSON documents, fields

10
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,150
might not have the structure we expect at all. We

11
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,380
might have numbers that are out of range. How many

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,880
people do you know who are minus three years of age?

13
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,890
The mighty outliers compared to a standard distribution. We might

14
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,780
have an American expatriate in the London office who did

15
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,440
some data entry, and coded in a few dates using

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,970
the U.S. format when the system was expecting the European format.
