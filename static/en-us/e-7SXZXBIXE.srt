1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:05,570
So web.xml defines configurations for web apps.

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,375
Lots of web apps use web.xml, not just

3
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,840
App eEngine apps and not just Maven

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,217
projects. So pom.xml is for your Maven dependencies

5
00:00:15,217 --> 00:00:17,621
in your Maven project. In pom.xml you

6
00:00:17,621 --> 00:00:20,603
can list all the dependencies for your project,

7
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:25,510
like which version of JUnit, which version of App Engine SDK you want. And when

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,912
you compile your project, Maven will automatically

9
00:00:28,912 --> 00:00:31,410
get all the dependencies for it. And

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,420
appengine-web.xml is where you configure things specific

11
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,360
to App Engine. So App Engine configs

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,930
here. And there are more XML files specific to App Engine such as q.xml,

13
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,560
cron.xml and you're going to be learning about

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,170
those as you work through the course.
