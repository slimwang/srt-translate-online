1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,750
So, you might have noticed that
computers that are on the same network,

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,800
like an individual home or business or

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,880
school, usually have IP addresses
that are similar to each other.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,860
To be more specific about it,

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:18,370
all of the addresses on a specific
network block share a particular prefix.

6
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:22,970
They all start the same and only differ
after some particular bit position.

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,010
And computers that are on
the same network block,

8
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,280
can communicate with each other
without going through a router.

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,030
But not all networks are the same size.

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,020
So when we talk about a particular
network, we have to talk not only

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,555
about its network prefix but
the length of that prefix.

12
00:00:37,555 --> 00:00:41,145
A network with a longer
prefix has less of the 32-bit

13
00:00:41,145 --> 00:00:45,595
address left over to distinguish
particular hosts, and a network with

14
00:00:45,595 --> 00:00:49,685
a shorter prefix has more addresses for
hosts, so it's a larger network.

15
00:00:49,685 --> 00:00:52,345
The network prefix length is
something that has to be chosen when

16
00:00:52,345 --> 00:00:56,215
the network is set up, and it's usually
configured by whatever process assigns

17
00:00:56,215 --> 00:00:57,405
addresses to the computers.

18
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,200
For instance, if you have
a network with a 24-bit prefix,

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,505
that means there's eight bits left
over for the host part of addresses,

20
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:09,345
we would conventionally
write this as /24.

21
00:01:09,345 --> 00:01:15,551
For instance 198.51.100.0/24
network block.

22
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:20,480
But if the network prefix is shorter,
say 22-bits, then there will be 10-bits

23
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,190
left over for host addressing,
this would be a /22 network.

24
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:29,590
And you can't tell how long the prefix
is just by looking at the addresses.

25
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:34,700
For these addresses, either a 22 or
24 network would be a possibility.

26
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,432
So how many hosts can fit
on one of these networks?

27
00:01:37,432 --> 00:01:43,170
Well 10-bits of host address means
two to the tenth power addresses,

28
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,240
which would be a 1024, except that
the top and the bottom addresses of

29
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,390
a network block are reserved and
the first address is usually the router.

30
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,360
So 1021 addresses are available for
hosts.

31
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,770
Similarly in a /24 network,
there would be 256 addresses but

32
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,700
minus those three, they're usually about
253 addresses that remain for hosts.

33
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,580
And why does this matter?

34
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,950
Sometimes misconfiguration can cause
some pretty weird problems on a server

35
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,390
network especially.

36
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:18,580
Things like one machine thinks that it
can talk to another machine directly,

37
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,070
but the other thinks that it has
to talk back through a router.

38
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:24,550
And that can cause very strange
communications problems.

39
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,600
Getting a good grasp of how this stuff
works can save you a lot of trouble if

40
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,970
you're ever setting up a server network.
