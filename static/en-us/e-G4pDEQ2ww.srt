00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,980
Congratulations, if
you've made it this far.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,120
You've learned so
much about mapping, satellite views,

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,000
drawing on a map, markers, custom pins,
Street View, and a whole lot more.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,460
It's been a lot of material covering
a lot of territory, pun fully intended.

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,610
And, I hope you've been inspired to
think about how you could make your app

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,810
better by using Rich Mapping.

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,920
Or indeed, maybe you have an idea for an
app that could be built around Mapping.

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,700
Think about what you can do, if you
combine it with Location Services and

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,700
other Google APIs.

10
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,390
With that, I'll sign off in the hope
that you've really enjoyed this course.

11
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,120
I look forward to seeing
what you can do with Maps

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,830
in your future Android applications.
