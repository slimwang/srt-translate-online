1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,140
Some of these are shown in this
small example of an HL7 RIM example.

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,590
As you can see, each of these is
further specified in great detail, but

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,848
finding the explanations can be tedious.

4
00:00:12,848 --> 00:00:18,500
The FHIR, F-H-I-R,
Resources site is the best

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:23,550
source of explanations I'm aware of,
but it is intentionally not complete.

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,880
To get a feel for this,

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:31,100
let's focus on the special arrangements
code in the patient encounter box.

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,830
We see here that this is
a leaf of the act box.

9
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,970
Meaning, it's a particular example or
instance.

10
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,650
I picked it because most of
the detailed names are self evident so

11
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,708
you can easily see the level
of detail that is specified.

12
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:50,280
D set, indicates this is

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,470
a discreet set of possible values and in
fact, although they're not shown here.

14
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,950
These are wheel for wheelchair.

15
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,400
S-T-R-E-T for stretcher.

16
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,180
I-N-T for interpreter.

17
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:06,680
A-T-T for attendant and
D-O-G for guide dog.

18
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,230
All examples of things that
would be specially arranged for

19
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,770
were a patient to arrive at a hospital.

20
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:19,860
Here's another detailed example where
SBADM means substance administration.

21
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,190
And RQO means request.

22
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,380
Typically part of a medication
order by a physician.
