00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,450
Today, we'll talk about a very general method called generate and

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,810
test. We have looked at knowledge representations like semantic networks.

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,420
We'll shift our attention now to problem solving methods. Generate and

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,890
test is a problem solving method. This is another item in our

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:21,500
fundamental topics part of the course. The generate and test method in a way,

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,620
is very simple. Given a problem, generate potential solutions to it, and

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,460
then test the solutions for the efficiency for

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,060
addressing the problem. If you had complete knowledge of the world, complete and

9
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:39,480
correct knowledge of the world. If you had infinite computational resources. And

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,960
if you had a method of reasoning that was guaranteed to be correct,

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,600
then you can generate the correct, the optimal solution.

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,010
You don't need to test it. In general however, you do not have complete or

13
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,350
correct knowledge of the world. You do not have infinite computational

14
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,680
resources, and not all methods are guaranteed to be correct. In that case,

15
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,120
you can generate potential solutions. Plausible solutions,

16
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,618
and then test them. Estimates that will generate, and

17
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:12,040
test. We will use this method in conjunction with semantic networks, or

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,570
the prisoners and guards problem that we discussed last time.
