Hello, your watching
the UDusky Offline first course,

2
00:00:03,162 --> 00:00:05,817
I'm Jake Archibald
broadcasting from London.

3
00:00:05,817 --> 00:00:08,893
But we now go live to our US
correspondent Mike Wales.

4
00:00:08,893 --> 00:00:09,790
Hi, Mike.

5
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,293
How's the weather over there?

6
00:00:11,293 --> 00:00:17,664
[INAUDIBLE]
>> Mike, Mike, you're breaking up.

7
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:21,683
You some like two dialects
having a rap battle.

8
00:00:21,683 --> 00:00:23,185
>> Can you hear me now?

9
00:00:23,185 --> 00:00:25,583
>> Yep, yep, go ahead.

10
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:32,692
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Okay, I think he's gone.

11
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:39,233
We had this whole news reader thing
planned, it was going to be fun.

12
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:40,434
With home broadband and

13
00:00:40,434 --> 00:00:44,110
smart phones, the human race is
increasingly reliant on the internet.

14
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,223
But the internet isn't always with us.

15
00:00:46,223 --> 00:00:47,753
I'm sure you're familiar with this.

16
00:00:47,753 --> 00:00:50,035
[MUSIC]

17
00:00:50,035 --> 00:00:51,479
>> That kind of thing.

18
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:54,815
The sinking feeling of being
abandoned by connectivity.

19
00:00:54,815 --> 00:00:57,536
You're stuck outside while
the internet parties without you.

20
00:00:57,536 --> 00:00:59,970
You can only imagine what
you're missing out on.

21
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,105
It could be anything,
literally anything.

22
00:01:02,105 --> 00:01:06,177
A new video of a cat, a politician
saying something stupid, world peace

23
00:01:06,177 --> 00:01:10,404
could be solved in 140 characters,
but you don't get to hear about it.

24
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,770
All you get is.

25
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,624
[MUSIC].

26
00:01:13,624 --> 00:01:16,355
Total failure in the face of
connectivity issues is a worst case

27
00:01:16,355 --> 00:01:16,878
scenario.

28
00:01:16,878 --> 00:01:20,192
And it's all too common on the web,
but no longer.

29
00:01:20,192 --> 00:01:23,329
In this course we're going to
cover how you can build sites and

30
00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:26,174
apps that work great what
ever connection the user has.

31
00:01:26,174 --> 00:01:29,119
We're going to use service worker
to intercept network traffic,

32
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,252
explore the latest service
work at dev tools.

33
00:01:31,252 --> 00:01:35,511
We're going to tame IDB, the in browser
database, and explore user experience

34
00:01:35,511 --> 00:01:39,030
strategies to deal with varying
network conditions and updates.

35
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,010
Overall we want to make
[NOISE] a thing of the past.
