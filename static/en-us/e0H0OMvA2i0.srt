00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,560
Typically when we talk about
data transfer efficiency,

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,670
we're talking about limiting
the amount of data being transferred.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,703
That reduces the
bandwidth and the cost

4
00:00:07,703 --> 00:00:09,956
and is generally 
a pretty good idea.

5
00:00:09,956 --> 00:00:12,440
But on mobile there's an extra factor.

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,140
As you can see, it turns out
that the cell radio

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,830
is one of the biggest 
battery drainers on the device.

8
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,143
So making your data
transfers more efficient

9
00:00:20,143 --> 00:00:22,546
will also result in 
improved battery life.

10
00:00:22,546 --> 00:00:24,540
Now at a basic level,
being more efficient

11
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,473
means spending less time
transferring less data,

12
00:00:27,473 --> 00:00:29,646
reducing your payloads, 
and updating less often

13
00:00:29,646 --> 00:00:31,290
can take you some of the way there.

14
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,415
But then what?

15
00:00:32,415 --> 00:00:33,972
Can timing make a difference?

16
00:00:33,972 --> 00:00:36,400
It turns out that it can, 
and it's a situation

17
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,140
I like to think of as the
cookie Droid conundrum.

18
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,130
Do we perform fewer downloads
with larger payloads?

19
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,353
Or do we perform 
lots of small transfers

20
00:00:45,353 --> 00:00:47,486
just in time for when
we need them?

21
00:00:47,486 --> 00:00:50,580
One big cookie or lots of little cookies?

22
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,900
So, what do you think?

23
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,860
Should we have a smaller
number of large downloads

24
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,120
illustrated by this big cookie?

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,941
Or a large number
of small downloads,

26
00:00:58,941 --> 00:01:02,291
as illustrated by 
lots of little cookies?
