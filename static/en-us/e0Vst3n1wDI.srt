1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,880
Now you're going to install
the Java Development Kit, but

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,100
a few quick notes before we begin.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,160
So we've been calling
the Java Development Kit like a toolbox.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,950
And what we mean by that is that the
Java Development Kit is software that

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:16,420
allows your computer to read and
work with the Java programming language.

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,590
This is sort of fundamentally
different than a software program,

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,570
because it's more like an upgrade for
your computer.

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,700
So as you're installing
the Java development kit,

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,780
it might seem a little bit intimidating.

10
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,760
But what I want to tell you right
now is do not worry about it.

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,410
You're not going to break your computer.

12
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,510
And we're going to go super
slowly through the steps and

13
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,650
explain what you're doing very
explicitly as you do each step.

14
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,070
That said,
sometimes students run into problems.

15
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,670
So I want to give you some additional
tools to help you resolve those issues.

16
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:47,260
If you do run into a problem,
I've got three resources for you.

17
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,550
First is the troubleshooting document,
linked in the instructor notes.

18
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,340
Second, is the forums and chat, where
you can ask fellow students for help.

19
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,600
I'll be checking in once in a while to
see what problems students are finding

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,000
and update the first
document accordingly.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,560
So if you do happen to
solve your problem,

22
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,360
consider posting about your
experience in the forums.

23
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,930
When you're talking about an error,
it helps to copy the text of the error.

24
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,650
You can also take a screen shot of the
error by using the keys Ctrl+Cmd+Shift

25
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,920
on the Mac or
the screenshot key on a Windows machine.

26
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,160
Finally, when I run into errors,
I often Google them.

27
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,430
Nine times out of ten, you're going to
immediately find somebody who's run into

28
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,570
the exact same error that you have.

29
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:24,580
And by the power of the Internet,

30
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,470
a lot of people are going to
have come together and

31
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,020
help them resolve that error.

32
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,540
So you can follow the exact same
steps that they've followed

33
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,380
to resolve your problem.

34
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,500
Now if you're trying to figure
out what to actually search with.

35
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,480
My suggestion is to copy the error
message that you're getting and

36
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,860
add a word like Java or or
Android studio to the end of it.

37
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,720
Okay.
Let's dive in.
