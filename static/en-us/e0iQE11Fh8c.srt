1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answers are that there's no dominant strategy

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
because for each player, what's best depends on what the other player does.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
They do best if they match,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and so you can't figure out what your own best strategy is

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
unless you know what the other player is going to play.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
In terms of equilibrium, there's 2 equilibrium points,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
the +9/+9 and the +5/+5.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Both of them are equilibriums because neither of the players

9
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
can benefit from switching to the other strategy.
