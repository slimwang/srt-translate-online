00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,050
So far in this lesson, we've discussed sensory memory and working memory.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,944
Remember that our sensory memory is very short lasting, and our working memory

3
00:00:07,944 --> 00:00:12,798
is our day-to-day fluidity of our actions. But what about those questions we

4
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:15,857
asked in the beginning of the lesson? For example, what was the name of your

5
00:00:15,857 --> 00:00:19,664
first grade teacher? Well, the ability for you to remember the name of your

6
00:00:19,664 --> 00:00:24,184
first grade teacher, in my case was Ms. Peacock, is because of our long-term

7
00:00:24,184 --> 00:00:28,140
memory. So let's go to Susan and discuss some particular types of long term

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,160
memory.
