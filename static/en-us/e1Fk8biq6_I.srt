00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,121
So here are the graphs that match up with each of the functions. You might

2
00:00:03,121 --> 00:00:07,055
notice that two of these graphs actually didn't change at all. From the way

3
00:00:07,055 --> 00:00:10,712
they looked when their corresponding functions didn't have absolute value signs

4
00:00:10,712 --> 00:00:15,240
in them. Those two graphs are B and C. So what does this mean? Well, you'll

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,790
note that in both functions g and k, the absolute value signs appeared around x

6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:25,440
squares. Now we know that x squared on it's own is always going to be positive.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,512
So taking the absolute value sign of a positive number doesn't do anything to

8
00:00:28,512 --> 00:00:32,530
change it's value. That's why these two graphs don't change at all, compared to

9
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:37,183
the old versions. We put absolut value signs around the denominatro of the

10
00:00:37,183 --> 00:00:40,940
function 1 over x. We can see that the branch that used to be down here with

11
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:46,213
negative x and negative y values. Got flipped across the x axis. So now, it's y

12
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:49,650
values are positive. I think that graph d might actually be the most

13
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,360
interesting change of these four. Before, we just had a straight line. This is

14
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,760
basically just the function. F of x equals 1. A constant function. But now, our

15
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,226
numerator will always be positive. But, once we move over into the negative x

16
00:01:02,226 --> 00:01:06,311
values. The denominator will be negative. A positive divided by a negative

17
00:01:06,311 --> 00:01:09,703
makes a negative, which is why this half of the line got reflected across the x

18
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:13,699
axis to become negative. Pretty cool.
