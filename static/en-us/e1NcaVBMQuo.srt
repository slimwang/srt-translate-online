1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,469
So given that there are N processors participating

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:07,570
in a barrier algorithm, particularly dissemination barrier algorithm, how

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:11,460
many rounds do you think the dissemination barrier

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,030
algorithm needs to complete in order to know that

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,430
the barrier is done? So how many rounds

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,035
for the barrier completion? So the choices I'm giving

7
00:00:20,035 --> 00:00:25,950
you: it's N log N, a log N to the base 2, Or feeling of log and

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,080
base, to the base 2, or N where N is of course a

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,009
number of processors that are participating in

10
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,100
this barrier. A hint for you [LAUGH]

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,280
I told you already that N in a dissemination barrier need not be a

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,500
power of 2. So that's a hint for you to, to answer this question.
