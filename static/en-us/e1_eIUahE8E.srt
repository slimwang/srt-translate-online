1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,400
Actually, all of these are good things to do,.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,160
You should prefetch and cache data to front load the

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,420
requests as much as possible. You should also eliminate,

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,430
or at least reduce, periodic transfers like polling. Otherwise, you're

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,040
going to keep a continuous connection alive and you're

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,390
never going to let the cellular radio go into low

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,950
power idle mode. If you can, you should batch

8
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,700
those requests instead. Store up several requests and then grab

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,710
them as necessary.
