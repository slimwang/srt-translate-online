00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:05,130
Remember, we're hypothesizing about the population not our sample. Row is the

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,290
correlation in between variables in the population but r is the correlation

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:17,060
between samples. And we're hypothesizing that row is equal to 0 for the null/g.

4
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,314
and not equal to 0 for the alternative. Just like you've seen before, this is

5
00:00:21,314 --> 00:00:24,810
the nondirectional alternative. This is the positive directional alternative,

6
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,920
and this is the negative directional alternative.
