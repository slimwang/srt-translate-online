00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's see if we can modify this to make a vector of length n

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
where I can vary the value of n and get a resulting vector with n elements.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,977
So if n equals 5, we'd get the same result as before,

4
00:00:14,127 --> 00:00:17,759
but for n equals 10, I should get a vector of length 10,

5
00:00:17,759 --> 00:00:22,469
each of which would have value zero point one.
