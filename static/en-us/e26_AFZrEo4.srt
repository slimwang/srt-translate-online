00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,846
You may have stereotypes that you're not even aware of. Have you ever heard of

2
00:00:03,846 --> 00:00:08,555
these stereotypes? Athletes are dumb. Blondes are ditzy. Or even, professors

3
00:00:08,555 --> 00:00:12,210
are absent-minded. Now, we don't endorse these stereotypes, but they are, in

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,274
fact, stereotypes. And as we'll see, stereotypes can help us save time, and

5
00:00:16,274 --> 00:00:21,610
they allow us to make an impression of somebody that we don't know very well.

6
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:26,600
However, even though stereotypes can save time, they can have negative results.

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,813
So what we'll see in this lesson is that stereotypes can be inaccurate, they

8
00:00:29,813 --> 00:00:35,440
can be self-perpetuating, they can be overused and they can be automatic. Let's

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,040
look at the idea of a stereotyping self-perpetuating in a little more detail.

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,274
For example, let's say you have a stereotype that professors are older men, who

11
00:00:43,274 --> 00:00:48,162
listen to classical music, and drink fine wine. Now if you meet somebody who

12
00:00:48,162 --> 00:00:50,846
doesn't fall into that stereotype, we're actually likely to ignore that

13
00:00:50,846 --> 00:00:55,390
information. For example, you meet a professor who's a young woman, who listens

14
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:59,970
to rock and roll, and drinks beer. In this situation, we may modify our

15
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,876
stereotype, and then women would be the exception to the rule. However, the

16
00:01:04,876 --> 00:01:08,628
stereotype that professors are men who listen to classical music and drink wine

17
00:01:08,628 --> 00:01:10,160
will remain.
