00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,210
In order to solve for x, we'll subtract 6 x from both sides. Then we'll add 96

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:11,416
to both sides, and finally we'll divide by 2 to get x alone. So one x is equal

3
00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:16,320
to 84. Great solving if you found 84 miles per hour for the speed of the boat.
