00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,930
Let's bring up the t table. The degrees of freedom is 14 plus 18 minus 2 which

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:12,451
is 30. Since this is a two tailed test and our alpha level is 0.05, we'll have

3
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:19,622
0.025 in each tail. Therefore, at 30 degrees of freedom and 0.025, our

4
00:00:19,622 --> 00:00:26,115
t-critical values will be positive and negative 2.042.
