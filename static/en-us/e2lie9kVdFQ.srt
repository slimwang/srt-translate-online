1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,130
I could also write a slightly
different variation of the function

2
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:05,299
reverseAndPrint like this.

3
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:09,230
Here, forwardString is a second name for
the parameter being passed in.

4
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:14,800
Now, you might be wondering,
why does this parameter need two names?

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,789
String is the local parameter name.

6
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:23,329
You can see here that it's used
locally inside the function itself.

7
00:00:23,329 --> 00:00:26,399
This other parameter name,
forwardString,

8
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:28,559
is the external parameter name.

9
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:29,989
It's used externally.

10
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:34,729
In other words, when the function
is called in the function call,

11
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:38,409
the external parameter name
would be used like this.

12
00:00:38,409 --> 00:00:40,799
And here's where
the underscore comes in.

13
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,809
If I use the underscore as in
the first version of reverseAndPrint,

14
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,490
then I don't have to include
a parameter name in the function call.

15
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:53,000
The underscore specifies no
external parameter name needed.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,609
Down here, you can see that this
first call to reverseAndPrint

17
00:00:56,609 --> 00:00:59,229
is taking advantage of the underscore.

18
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:02,759
We'll see more external parameters in
a minute when we talk about how to call

19
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:03,460
functions.

20
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:09,469
So, to update our model, functions
can take the general form when you

21
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:14,400
see a name on the left with no colon,
that's the externalParameterName and

22
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,320
the localParameterName is here.
