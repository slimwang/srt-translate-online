1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now let's look at the solution to the first problem.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We know that we already used the forward Euler method

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
for both the populations of fish one and fish two.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We need to know how each population changes with time.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I've written out expressions for ḟ₁ and ḟ₂ showing the time derivatives of each population.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Now on each equation, we can see that this first term is in the form of the logistic growth function

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
that I showed you in the question introduction video.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We have a growth rate and then 1 minus the population over the carrying capacity

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
times the population again and the same thing up here.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
These first terms show the positive rate of change of the population.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
However, each equation also has a second part tacked onto it that shows a negative rate of change.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This expresses how each population is harvested by the fisherman.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
As I said earlier, p is the fraction of the fish that we catch that are fish type two or the green fish.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We know then that the rate of harvesting

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
of the green type of fish is going to be p times our total harvest rate.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We can maintain the same total harvest rate if we make the coefficient in front of the harvest rate

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
a new equation for the red fish 1-p.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Remember we're trying to prevent the green fish from going extinct.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This means that we need to create a situation in which the rate of change

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
of population two is greater than or equal to zero.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If we rearrange the equation for ḟ2, which should adapt with this term,

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
which is showing how the population can gain fish,

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
should be greater than or equal to this term, which is showing how the population can lose fish.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The value of p that we're trying to calculate, however, is the exact threshold of extinction.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
This is going to happen where growth exactly equals harvesting.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
In other words if there are anymore harvesting or any less growth,

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
population two will become extinct eventually.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This graph over here like you've seen before has a blue pair of fish that shows

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
how the growth rate changes in population, and it also has a red curve that represents harvesting rate.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This first red line is just an example of a harvest rate, but the one that we're interested in

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
is this dotted red line up here, which just touches the maximum of the growth curve.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You might remember that this point on the growth curve

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
is also known as the maximum sustainable yield.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You can see that if we move the red line any higher, then the harvesting rate would always

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
succeed the growth rate and we would definitely end up with an extinct fish two population.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Similarly, if we move anywhere else on the blue line, the growth rate would again

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
be below this harvest rate and we will begin to deplete the population of fish two.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Right in the center, however, we have a point of semi-stable equilibrium

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
just like we're going to talk about in the Unit.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Any tiny bit that the population moves to the left side of the curve

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
will result in it eventually falling all the way down to zero,

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
which clearly means that fish two has become extinct.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Instead, we have slightly larger population than 5x10⁵ tons,

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
we will again start to see a decrease in population, and if by chance the population

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
has not stopped at exactly this maximum point--it will fall to the other side

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
of the curve and also become extinct.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Remember all this is assuming that the harvest rate is exactly at this dotted line.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Now we need to find what value of p would place the dotted line right at this position.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Again at this point we have growth rate exactly equal to harvesting rate.

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I've taken the two parts of the equation for ḟ2 and written them as equal to each other right here.

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We plug in the proper value for f2, which we know is 5x10⁵ ton

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
and we can solve using simple algebra for the threshold value of p, which equals to 0.375.

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Finally looking at our code, we can see that first we've plugged in the value for p that we just calculated,

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
0.375, and down here in the for loop, we have a very simple translation of the equations

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
that we created for the growth rates of both fish one and fish two

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
in this box for the rate of change of either population.

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So for fish one we have this and for fish two we have this.

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
As always, these rates of change are multiplied by h, the step size,

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
and added to the initial values for either fish population.

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Now it's our new program and see what we get.

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Here is our plots, the blue line plots the population fish that we are interested in harvesting

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
measured in tons and the green line plots the population of the second type of fish,

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
which we're trying to prevent from going extinct.

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You could see that we have maintained a high level of population of the fish that we're interested in

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and we've also prevented the green line from going down to zero.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You can see that as time increases, the slope of this line is approaching zero,

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
which means that if we plotted time going even farther out, no matter how far out

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
in time we decided to to plot these curves, this green line would never approach zero.

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Just for fun, let's see what happens if we set p=0.5.

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Well this graph looks very different from the last one that we had.

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
By just increasing p by the third of its former value,

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
we've made fish population two go extinct in just over 20 years.

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Since we're harvesting more of fish two and less of fish one,

74
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
the fish one population has actually risen to a value that is higher than it was in the last part,

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
but we've violated our first main objective, which was to prevent fish two from going extinct.

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I hope this problem has helped you submit your understanding of logistic growth,

77
00:04:56,000 --> 99:59:59,999
harvesting, and equilibria.
