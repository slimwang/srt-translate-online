00:00:00,075 --> 00:00:02,620
Alright, with just a couple more definitions we'll be able

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:06,890
to nail down what PAC Learning is. So let's consider a,

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,610
concept class C. That is to say that the set

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,510
from which the concept that we're trying to learn comes from.

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,510
L is our learner. H is the hypothesis space, so

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,400
it's the set of, of mappings that the learner is going to

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,820
consider. N is going to be the size of that space.

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,650
So kind of the space of the hypotheses that are being considered.

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,580
D is that distribution of inputs like we looked at

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,640
before. Then we got Greek letters epsilon and delta, where epsilon

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,880
is our error goal. Which is to say we would

12
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,230
like the error in the hypothesis that we. Produce to be

13
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,330
no bigger than epsilon. It could be smaller, that'd be

14
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,110
great. It could be zero, that'd be awesome. But it can't

15
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,590
be bigger than epsilon. But, we could get really unlucky and

16
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,770
actually not meet our error goal. And so delta is what

17
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:54,940
allows us to set a, a kind of uncertainty goal or certainty goal, which

18
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:59,330
is to say, that with probability one minus delta, the algorithm has to work.

19
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,910
>> And by work, you mean has to. Be able

20
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,930
to produce a true error, less than or equal to epsilon.

21
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:05,960
>> Exactly.

22
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,320
>> So why can't we always force epsilon to

23
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,050
be zero, and, you know, delta to be zero?

24
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,610
>> Right, to be absolutely sure that we get zero

25
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,110
error. So the, part of it is because we are sampling

26
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,290
training examples from this distribution D. and it's always

27
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,370
possible that we, for example, unless well, as long as

28
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:27,320
there's probability mass on more than one example, there's always

29
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,760
a probability that we draw a fine sample that only

30
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,690
ever gives up one example over and over again. That's

31
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,320
fair. So we just have to be really careful about

32
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,930
that. So, so if we're that unlucky it's very unlikely

33
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,130
to happen but when that happens our error is going to

34
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,900
be very high. But that's okay because it won't happen very often.

35
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,740
>> Okay sure,sure. So basically you can't force it

36
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,600
to be zero under all circumstances either epsilon or

37
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,180
delta you can't force them to be zero under

38
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,550
all circumstances. So you have to allow somewhere to. Exactly,

39
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,410
it gives us the wiggle room we need. Thats

40
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,930
actually where this name PAC comes from. It stands

41
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:04,330
for probably appoximatly correct. I see. So we would

42
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,190
like to be correct, but then we are just going

43
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,940
to keep adding weasel words until we can actually achieve it.

44
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,320
We would like to be correct, but we cant be exactly

45
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,180
correct, so lets be approxiiamtly correct. But we can't be approximately

46
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,540
correct all the time, so let's only probably be approximately correct.

47
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,210
>> So using your, your, your words here you

48
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,150
could have called that one minus delta epsilon correct.

49
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,770
>> Yes, right. That's exactly right. That's what the Greek

50
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,010
letters are playing, and correct is the, this you know,

51
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:35,200
error Sub D of H equals 0.

52
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,160
>> Yeah, so 1 9 is delta upsilon error sub D of H

53
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,630
equals 0 doesn't roll off the tongue

54
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,590
quite as well as probably approximately correct.

55
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,600
>> I would agree with that.

56
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,500
>> Okay fair enough.
