>> Here my inputs are 4, 1, 4 and 5. So I list this here. I don't need to list

2
00:00:06,203 --> 00:00:12,133
this 4 twice so I'm going to erase this one. My outputs are 3, 2, 5 and negative

3
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:18,399
1. I draw my arrows to represent the ordered pairs. 4 is with 3, 1 is with 2, 4

4
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:23,602
is with 5, and 5 is with negative 1. Notice that I have an input leading to two

5
00:00:23,602 --> 00:00:28,498
outputs. So this first one is definitely not a function. We can see this more

6
00:00:28,498 --> 00:00:33,322
easily because the input repeats. If the input repeats, then that means it

7
00:00:33,322 --> 00:00:38,580
produces two different outputs which we know can't be true. So, if we have one

8
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:44,487
x-value producing two different y-values, we know it's not a function. Here's a

9
00:00:44,487 --> 00:00:50,423
mapping diagram for the second set. The arrows indicate the ordered pairs, and I

10
00:00:50,423 --> 00:00:55,714
see that each input corresponds to exactly one output. So yes, this is a

11
00:00:55,714 --> 00:00:56,545
function.
