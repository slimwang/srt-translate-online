00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,130
All right suppose you like that
whole idea that I told you about

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:04,400
Bollinger bands.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,390
Let's see now how well you might use it.

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:12,860
So I've identified four different times
here where the actual price crosses and

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,690
upper or lower Bollinger band.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,260
I want you to look at each one of those,
and

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:22,870
identify here whether it's a buy signal,
a sell signal or no signal at all.
