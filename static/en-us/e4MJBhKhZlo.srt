1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,680
So let's look at an example.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,350
Again, Einstein meets Tigger.

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,630
Now, our goal is to blend them that half of the image comes from here and

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,360
half, the other half comes from here.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,560
And of course, just to doing a sharp blend like this,

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,290
if we were just to put them next to each other, we would get a sharp line.

7
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,620
What happens if we actually went through the process I discussed earlier?

8
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,475
Notice there is no sharp line anymore.

9
00:00:21,475 --> 00:00:25,132
Because what we did was, we actually deconstructed into different pyramids.

10
00:00:25,132 --> 00:00:30,860
We blended, again, with this 90 this kind of half cut between both the images.

11
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,490
Took pixels from both of them.

12
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:37,530
Well when we reconstructed it, this frequency mixing going on, and kind of see

13
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,690
the Tigger skin merging with with the Einstein skin, the eyebrows and

14
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,699
all of that kind of stuff are merged at least at these boundary lines.

15
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,180
Now, this is, of course, a simple case.

16
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,060
What happens if we wanted to do this kind of blending for

17
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,800
a specific case where you wanted to actually have the blend happen just for

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,170
specific regions of the image.
