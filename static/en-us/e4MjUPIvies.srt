00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,200
Content routing concerns how to direct clients to a

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,720
particular server. One might do this in a number

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,320
of ways. One could use the routing system, for

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,800
example, Anycast. So one could number all of the replicas

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,080
with the same IP address and then rely on

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,580
routing to take the client to the closest replica

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,645
based on the routes, that the internet routers choose.

8
00:00:21,645 --> 00:00:25,660
Routing-based redirection is simple but it provides the service providers

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,770
with very little control over which servers the

10
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,159
clients ultimately get redirected to, because the redirection is

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,010
at the whims, of internet routing. Another way to

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,100
do redirection is application based. For example, by using

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,520
an HTTP redirect. This is effective but it requires

14
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,320
the client to first go to the origin server

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,990
to get the redirect in the first place, increasing

16
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,960
latency. The third, and most common way that service

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,020
selection is performed is as part of

18
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,270
the naming system, using DNS. In this approach,

19
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,370
a client looks up a particular domain

20
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:03,110
name, such as Google.com, and the response contains

21
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,970
an IP address of a nearby cache.

22
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,790
Naming base redirection provides significant flexibility in directing

23
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,050
different clients to different server replicas. So in

24
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,320
summary routing based redirection is simple but its

25
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,070
very coarse. Application based routing is also fairly

26
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,740
simple but it incurs significant delays which operators

27
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,400
really care about as well as users. Naming

28
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,660
based redirection provides fine-grained control and its also fast.
