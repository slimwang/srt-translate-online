1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,320
So the whole idea of security
planning and security management

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,170
is to be better prepared when
it comes to cyber security.

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,900
So, if your enterprise, your company,

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:16,053
if your ask how well prepared you are,
how good is the state of cyber security?

5
00:00:16,053 --> 00:00:18,890
Really, that's what the cyber
security posture is.

6
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:23,389
So, cyber security posture,how do we
address our security, how do we prepare

7
00:00:23,389 --> 00:00:27,910
ourselves for cyber security, how do
we handle when something goes wrong.

8
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,870
The posture can either be reactive,
unfortunately,

9
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,760
in many cases, this is what it is.

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,160
What does reactive mean?

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,020
Well, we worry about it,
because we're sort of forced to do it.

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,790
Because there's a regulation compliance
requirements they say you must do so.

13
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:49,110
And we react to that regulation
that comes down our throats.

14
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,660
All it's customer's demands,

15
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,365
customer's saying I will not do
business with you unless you have that.

16
00:00:54,365 --> 00:00:58,175
Lot of companies these days,
especially business to business,

17
00:00:58,175 --> 00:01:02,515
b to b, they don't want to business
with someone who has lax cyber security.

18
00:01:02,515 --> 00:01:03,715
So again,

19
00:01:03,715 --> 00:01:08,320
we react to this demand that comes from
somebody we want to do business with.

20
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,430
It could be in response to something
bad that happens to us, okay.

21
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:18,100
So breach for example, the target, Home
Depot examples, everybody talks about.

22
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:23,170
So, we react to the adverse
event that we suffered, so

23
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,750
that's another example of what
reactive security posture is.

24
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,860
And, finally, it may be in
response to events that occur,

25
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,120
our competition may have suffered.

26
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,440
One bank, for example,
suffers a bridge and

27
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,420
other banks may react to
that by making sure that

28
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,800
the vulnerabilities that were exploited
don't exist in their IT systems.

29
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,643
So all these are examples of, so
this is a reactive posture, I said,

30
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:54,210
unfortunately security is event driven
when something something bad happens.

31
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,380
People say, we need it and so
we need to do something about.

32
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,990
But this is what is called a reactive
posture to cyber security.

33
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,630
Of course,

34
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:05,730
it's better to have what is called
a pro active approach to security.

35
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,169
You plan for it, that's what
security planning is talking about.

36
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:13,930
You work hard to assess your risk, you
do things to reduce it, look at the cost

37
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,290
and do that before either you're
forced because of regulation or

38
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:23,070
forced because something bad happens to
you and you respond to it reactively.

39
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:27,620
So what are some examples of proactive
things that companies should be doing?

40
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,770
Well first of all, it should be
somebody's job to worry about cyber

41
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:34,300
securities and assets,
how they protect it,

42
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:39,200
how people are educated, cyber security
insurance, having a good policy.

43
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,930
Making sure people are held responsible
and empowered to do things, and all

44
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,260
the things we talked about when it comes
to security planning and management.

45
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,120
So having a champion whose
job it is to worry about it,

46
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,098
a champion should have influence.

47
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:55,650
If is doesn't, he or
she doesn't have influence of

48
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,130
course you're not going to
get anything meaningful done.

49
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,650
So one thing people talk about,
for example, is well,

50
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:07,140
is this proactively addressed at
the highest level in an organization?

51
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,530
Talk about the board level conversation.

52
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:13,980
The board addresses various kind of
risks an enterprise has to deal with.

53
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:18,620
Is cyber security risk one of those,
or is there a conversation about it?

54
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,110
Is there a conversation about what
needs to be done to reduce that risk?

55
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:26,830
Is there an investment made in cyber
security controlled in solutions and

56
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,360
personnel and things like that?

57
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,000
If that's done before bad things happen,
that would be a proactive approach.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,770
It's again unfortunately not aware
this is happening in every company.

59
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:42,400
In fact, one of the things that
happened we said target hired a CSO,

60
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,280
who does the CSO report to?

61
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,920
Does the CSO report to CIO?

62
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,840
Well when it's not talking about
the highest level it doesn't

63
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,370
report to the CEO.

64
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,890
The CEO maybe doesn't bring it up at
the board level and things like that.

65
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:59,460
So proactive means somebody,
the champion, looks ahead,

66
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:04,490
has the influence that's necessary and
has support at the highest levels and

67
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,740
that would be a proactive posture for
cyber security.
