1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,840
Remember that merging creates a new commit, so we'll have to add a node here.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,510
Merge commits have multiple parents.

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,200
And in this case, those parents will be the current tip of the master branch and

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,990
the current tip of the easy branch.

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,870
We're trying to update easy mode, so

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,020
we'll want to move the label to the new commit.

7
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,560
Next, Caroline will walk through the process of actually creating the merge node

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,330
on the command line.
