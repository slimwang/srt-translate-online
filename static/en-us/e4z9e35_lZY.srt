00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,346
Only two of these are true. All real numbers are complex and all imaginary

2
00:00:04,346 --> 00:00:08,742
numbers are complex. Let's look at our diagram. We can see that the complex

3
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:13,402
number rectangle contains all of the other rectangles inside it. So that means

4
00:00:13,402 --> 00:00:18,302
that every rectangle that's inside the complex number rectangle Contains numbers

5
00:00:18,302 --> 00:00:22,668
all of which are complex numbers. Since the imaginary numbers and the real

6
00:00:22,668 --> 00:00:27,196
numbers are all inside of the complex numbers they are all complex. However the

7
00:00:27,196 --> 00:00:31,809
complex number rectangle is not contained inside any of these other rectangles.

8
00:00:31,809 --> 00:00:36,315
All of those categories are subsets of it. So there is no other category that we

9
00:00:36,315 --> 00:00:40,704
can group all complex numbers into on this diagram. Since the real numbers and

10
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:44,400
the imaginary numbers are completely separate rectangles, they are separate

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,635
groups. Neither one is a subset of the other.
