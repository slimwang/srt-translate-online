00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,290
All right.

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,190
You've got some fundamental
Objective-C skills under your belt,

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,160
it's time to put those skills to work.

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,680
When you enter the workforce
as an iOS developer,

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,150
you'll likely encounter a code
base written in Objective-C.

6
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,382
As a Swift expert,

7
00:00:12,382 --> 00:00:16,850
you'll be called upon to port
features from Objective-C to Swift.

00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,167

00:00:18,167 --> 00:00:21,410
That's what we're going to
do with the App, GIF maker.

10
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,340
We've written the app in Objective-C,
and

11
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,460
it's your job to migrate
the entire app to Swift.

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,630
Let's take a closer look
at how GIF maker works.
