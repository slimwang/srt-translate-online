00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,510
The lines visible association indicates that the contents of the viewport

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:08,600
must come from the file manager, but it doesn't really say what lines.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,190
These, those lines are determined by the position of the scroll bar handle.

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,500
See if you can state in English what this relationship must be.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,070
And, and here's a couple of hints for you.

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,585
We already know how many lines, we just, we just got that.

7
00:00:19,585 --> 00:00:20,340

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,365
>> And so if we can come up with the first line that's displayed, okay?

9
00:00:24,365 --> 00:00:27,110
>> Mm-hm. >> Then we can determine the rest of the lines that are displayed by

10
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,500
just adding in the number of lines.

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,170
Okay? >> Right. >> So how would you, how would you say this?
