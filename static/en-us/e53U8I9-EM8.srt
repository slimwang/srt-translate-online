00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,896
Now finally lets fill in this table. For each quantity up here please testify

2
00:00:04,896 --> 00:00:09,760
you at either in the interval in the left or the value itself if its inequality

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,548
and then stay in each box whether the quantity is positive, negative or zero

4
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:19,692
when that x value is put in. One other note, in this far right column if any of

5
00:00:19,692 --> 00:00:25,068
the values over here makes the denominator equal to 0, then I want you to write

6
00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:28,034
the word undefined in that box over here.
