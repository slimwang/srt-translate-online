1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,079
The answer is red.

2
00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:04,364
In addition to the two parameters being passed between parentheses,

3
00:00:04,364 --> 00:00:07,870
which of course get bound to the input parameters, one and two.

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,900
I'm now passing a third parameter by calling that function on the right side of

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,280
a dot access for property look up.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,270
The value that appears on the left of that dot will automatically be

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,190
given the name, this, inside of that function invocation.

8
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:25,320
This behavior is useful if we plan on doing much object oriented programming,

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,430
since there will usually be a relevant focal object for any given method call.

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,570
And that object generally appears to the left of

11
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:32,870
the dot when the method gets called.
