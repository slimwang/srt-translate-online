1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,817
Let's start by just looking at the first entry in each of the xy tables and

2
00:00:04,829 --> 00:00:09,537
seeing which graph it matches to. Brand number 1 should have a line that has the

3
00:00:09,671 --> 00:00:14,479
0.0100 in it. So, we go over to our graph, the 0.0100 is this line. Let's follow

4
00:00:14,491 --> 00:00:19,296
that up. So, brand 1 should go along with this line that comes in second here.

5
00:00:19,405 --> 00:00:25,176
Brand 2 has a 0.0200, which starts out highest and then ends up with this third

6
00:00:25,188 --> 00:00:30,931
arrow over here. That means brand 3 should be this graph. But let's just double

7
00:00:30,943 --> 00:00:36,843
check to make sure. This line should contain the 0.0150. And if we follow it

8
00:00:36,855 --> 00:00:39,610
down, sure enough, that's on the line.
