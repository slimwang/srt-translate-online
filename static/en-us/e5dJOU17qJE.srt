00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,775
We often use extrinsic rewards not only in the workplace, but also in our daily

2
00:00:03,775 --> 00:00:08,646
life. We see that extrinsic rewards can be used outside of the workplace as

3
00:00:08,646 --> 00:00:12,416
well, for example, we can use extrinsic rewards to get children to brush their

4
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:18,046
teeth, do their homework, or even make their bed. This is no different than

5
00:00:18,046 --> 00:00:22,990
employers using rewards to increase worker productivity as well as accuracy.

6
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:26,565
Although extrinsic rewards have been shown to be effective in the workplace,

7
00:00:26,565 --> 00:00:30,085
there are some circumstances where extrinsic rewards can have the opposite

8
00:00:30,085 --> 00:00:35,050
effect. How does this work? Let's say that you enjoy cooking, and you do so

9
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,854
often. You're always trying out new recipes. If your mom starts to pay you for

10
00:00:39,854 --> 00:00:45,010
cooking, it turns out that you may start to cook in order to get paid. Rather

11
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:49,850
than for pleasure. So what was once intrinsic enjoyment, your cooking, is no

12
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:55,510
longer so because it has been rewarded by an external source, which is money.
