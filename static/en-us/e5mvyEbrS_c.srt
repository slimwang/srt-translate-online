1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,550
A nanodegree is an exciting commitment.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:03,450
It can help you prepare for

3
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,080
an entirely new stage of your
career in a matter of months.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,930
>> But it's also a big commitment, and

5
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:10,920
we want to make sure
that you're ready for it.

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,330
>> So we've designed
a readiness assessment for

7
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,830
you to take to help you figure out
if right now is a good time for

8
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:15,590
you to start the program.

9
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,110
You'll see some questions
about time commitment and

10
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,910
some about your existing knowledge.

11
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:20,770
>> Right.
And

12
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,910
respond honestly to each
of these questions.

13
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,910
After you submit each response,
you'll see some feedback show up.

14
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,290
And remember, you're never going to
be evaluated based on your responses.

15
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:32,270
We just want to help you figure
out if now is the right time.

16
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,550
So, if any of that feedback suggests
that now is not the right time,

17
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,900
go ahead, listen to the advice,
and come back when you're ready.

18
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,160
>> And otherwise, you are ready.

19
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,010
You can get started right now.

20
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,430
However, that doesn't mean that this
program will be a total breeze,

21
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,050
it just means that your prepared for
the challenge ahead.

22
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,560
>> So go ahead, get started and we will
see you after the readiness assessment.
