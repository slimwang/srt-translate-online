00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,540
As we've seen,
Xcode provides great tools for

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,350
stepping through our code and
fixing issues.

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,420
With features like quick looks and
view hierarchies,

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,420
we can even examine our
applications visually.

5
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,200
But remember,
regardless of what tool you're using,

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,280
debugging always involves
the same basic steps.

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,470
You have to reproduce the problem,
gather any debugging information,

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,940
determine the fix, make the change, and
then try to reproduce the problem again.

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,100
If everything goes well,
the problem will be fixed.

10
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,050
In closing, none of us will
ever write perfect code, but

11
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,440
by becoming better debuggers, we'll know
how to fix problems when they arise.
