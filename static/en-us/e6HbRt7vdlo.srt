1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,370
What is the Gittins index?

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:03,050
>> What is the Gittins index?

3
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,440
I think it comes down to if I gave
you the choice between this arm and

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,430
something with a known payoff, how high
would that known payoff have to be for

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,620
you to forego ever trying
the uncertain arm?

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,580
So if I could pay you off and

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,730
say you're never allowed to
choose this bandit again.

8
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,995
How much money would you expect for
me to do that?

9
00:00:21,995 --> 00:00:27,090
What expected value of
a pay off would you need so

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,010
that you don't even ever
need to try this again?

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,840
And so it ends up being greater than the
expected value of the arm itself right?

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,310
So the arm has paid off 0.2 on average,
but we've only tried it 20 times

13
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:43,450
then this index value is
going to be bigger than 0.2.

14
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,480
because I wouldn't be willing
to just take a sure thing

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,230
of 0.2 instead of this one because
I could pull this a couple times,

16
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,566
discover that it's actually higher
paying and do better than the 0.2.

17
00:00:53,566 --> 00:00:56,660
>> So, somehow the index has to
compute some kind of confidence on

18
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,420
the probability that this is higher or
lower than the expected value or

19
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,400
something by some amount?

20
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,108
>> Yeah, so it actually, ultimately
combines this notion of the maximum

21
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:09,820
likelihood and
the low confidence, right?

22
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:14,370
So if you have low confidence
then you get an extra bonus for

23
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,440
pulling this arm because it may
reveal something really valuable.

24
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,260
>> Right, okay, so there's magic you can
do that computes this and stuff happens.

25
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,437
>> Right, and so

26
00:01:22,437 --> 00:01:28,430
I want to caution you though is the
Gittins index is extremely seductive.

27
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,173
>> Yeah.

28
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:33,163
>> In that it's just this beautiful
idea that works incredibly well for

29
00:01:33,163 --> 00:01:37,130
bandit problems and
feels like it should generalize.

30
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,500
And people have not been
able to generalize it, but

31
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,620
they've wasted a lot of time trying to.

32
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:46,540
So I would caution you
don't go down this road.

33
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,020
>> Unless you think you
have a fundamentally new

34
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,790
way of doing the analysis,

35
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,070
the Gittins index thing seems to be
pretty specific to bandits and therefore

36
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,790
won't be helpful to us when we're doing
more general reinforcement learning.

37
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,810
>> Okay,
I've gotta say that's very meta.

38
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,795
>> Oh.

39
00:02:00,795 --> 00:02:02,409
I see what you did there.

40
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:07,009
because I'm talking about thinking about
different research topics as if they

41
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:10,002
were bandit arms and
trying to argue about well,

42
00:02:10,002 --> 00:02:12,720
this one has been tried an awful lot.

43
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,490
And so the payoff seems high but once
you know that it's been tried over and

44
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,438
over again, the expected
value is actually quite low.

45
00:02:19,438 --> 00:02:21,400
>> Uh-huh.
>> And so, I'm just trying to help you,

46
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,051
give you experience so
you don't have to pull this arm.

47
00:02:24,051 --> 00:02:25,526
>> Yeah, very meta.

48
00:02:25,526 --> 00:02:27,580
>> That's cute,
I wasn't thinking that way.

49
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,740
>> I'm about helping others.
