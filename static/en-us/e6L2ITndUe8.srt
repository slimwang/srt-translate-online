1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:02,930
So now GiggaGal can fall forever, but

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,830
it's a bit harsh to have a permanent
game over after one missed fall.

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,930
Let's check to see when GiggaGal
has fallen below the level and

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,050
then reset her to our starting
location when she has.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,180
This kind of mechanic is
also known as a kill plane.

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,041
Check out the to do in the course
code to add a kill-plane and

7
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:21,190
respond GiggaGal when
she falls off the level.
