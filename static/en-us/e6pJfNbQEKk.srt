1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,341
Let's calculate the average and standard deviation in this spreadsheet. After

2
00:00:04,341 --> 00:00:12,974
you Copy and Paste the engagement data into your own spreadsheet. Then in any

3
00:00:12,974 --> 00:00:22,200
blank cell, we'll type equals average, and in this case, B2 column B236. And if

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,740
we go to the bottom, we see that there are 236 rows, but the first row has a

5
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:37,334
header. So there are 235 values. Now we have the mean in cell E1. Now in cell

6
00:00:37,334 --> 00:00:48,148
D2, we can type equals parentheses B2 minus $E$1, and parentheses.

7
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:49,611
^

8
00:00:49,611 --> 00:00:57,240
2, for squared. So that's the first squared deviation from the mean. We'll Copy

9
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:03,712
that cell. I'll go to cell C2, hit Cmd, Down Arrow. Go to cell D236, Cmd

10
00:01:03,712 --> 00:01:12,496
,Shift, Up arrow key. Highlighting column D, Cmd V. Now we have all our squared

11
00:01:12,496 --> 00:01:20,868
deviations. The average squared deviation is the variance, equals average D2

12
00:01:20,868 --> 00:01:28,410
column D2, 36. There's our variance, and now the standard devation is the

13
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:34,280
square root of cell E2. There you have it. Let's round to the 100th place. We

14
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,500
get the mean is 7.47 and the standard deviation is 2.41, if we round two

15
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,303
decimal places.
