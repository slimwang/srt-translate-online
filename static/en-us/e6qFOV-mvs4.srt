00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,020
Here's a picture of what the visitor pattern looks like, there of

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:08,060
course is a client class, which is going to lead the operations to be applied.

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,820
And then two categories of other classes.

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,640
One is a category having to do with the data structure itself and

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,710
the other is a category of classes having to do with the visitors.

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,870
As far as the data structure is concerned,

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,590
there will be some kind of abstract element and then

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,180
concrete elements corresponding to the different parts of the data structure.

9
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,170
The abstract element provides an abstract method called

10
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,500
accept with an argument visitor.

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,840
That is, as you are navigating through the data structure and

12
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,600
you want to apply the operations you send the visitor,

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,440
as an object, to each of the elements you come to.

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,330
And it must accept that visitor, and

15
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,160
essentially call back to the visitor to perform the operations.
