00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,210
This lesson is about distributed memory
algorithms for multiplying matrices.

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,480
Matrix multiply appears in lots
of applications, from simulations

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,292
in quantum computational chemistry,
to backpropagation in neural networks.

4
00:00:12,292 --> 00:00:16,420
And when the HPC community ranks
the worlds supercomputers for

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,260
its top 500 list, it does so
using a benchmark that, to first order,

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,390
is basically a really
big matrix multiply.

7
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,760
Now that's not the only
reason to study it.

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,520
The other one is that it's not so hard
to analyze and that makes it a great

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,540
starting point for practicing
some basic analysis techniques.
