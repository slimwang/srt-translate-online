1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,719
The correct answer is P. There's nothing fancy

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:05,570
going on where, you know, p equals foo

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,450
and then, you know, because z equals p,

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,750
z also equals foo. There's not that level

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,810
of computation. Now, if the server wants to

6
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,070
do that down the road, that's fine. But

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,990
in the general, in the general case, z just equals the letter p, and that's it.
