00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,235
So, how did you do on your first absolute value inequality? Did you get negative

2
00:00:04,247 --> 00:00:08,148
7 to 9? If so, great work. Let's see how we got that answer. When I see an

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,709
absolute value with a less than, I know that we're going to have an

4
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:15,801
intersection, which is going to leave us one region. To solve this absolute

5
00:00:15,813 --> 00:00:21,557
value inequality, I can set it up as a compound inequality. Negative 2 is less

6
00:00:21,569 --> 00:00:27,842
than or equal to x minus 1 over 4, which is less than or equal to 2. So, here's

7
00:00:27,854 --> 00:00:34,198
our two cases. We have negative 2 is less than or equal to x minus 1 over 4 and

8
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:39,005
we have x minus 1 over 4 is less than or equal to 2. We can solve this compound

9
00:00:39,017 --> 00:00:43,485
inequality all at one time. First thing I want to do is clear my fraction. To

10
00:00:43,497 --> 00:00:48,010
clear my fraction, I'm going to multiply through by the least common denominator

11
00:00:48,022 --> 00:00:52,295
which is 4. When I multiply through by 4, I have to multiply 4 by negative 2

12
00:00:52,307 --> 00:00:57,471
which gives me negative 8. And I multiply 4 by x minus 1 over 4, which gives me

13
00:00:57,483 --> 00:01:02,965
x minus 1. And I have to multiply 4 times 2, which is 8. The next thing I need

14
00:01:02,977 --> 00:01:09,432
to do is isolate the x in the middle, so I have to add 1 to all three parts, and

15
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:15,865
I get negative 7 is less than or equal to x, which is less than or equal to 9.

16
00:01:15,877 --> 00:01:21,634
And I can draw this on a number line. If this is 0 and this is 9 and this is

17
00:01:21,646 --> 00:01:27,604
negative 7, we know that x has to be greater than or equal to negative 7 and x

18
00:01:27,616 --> 00:01:33,705
has to be less than or equal to 9. So, I fill in the region in the middle. And

19
00:01:33,717 --> 00:01:39,410
that gives me the interval from negative 7 to 9 with closed brackets. Remember,

20
00:01:39,422 --> 00:01:44,812
we use closed brackets when we have less than or equal to or greater than or

21
00:01:44,824 --> 00:01:47,119
equal to. Let's try another one.
