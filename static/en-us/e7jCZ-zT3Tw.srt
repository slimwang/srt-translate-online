00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,830
So, here is what your completed
code should look like.

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,510
As you can see here, I've code for
the Button Map object,

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,180
the Button Satellite object,
and the Button Hybrid object.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,760
For each of these,
the process is the same.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,969
So, for the btnMap object,
I findViewById,

6
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:17,532
the button that I had called btnMap.

7
00:00:17,532 --> 00:00:20,560
And once I found that,
I set its OnClickListener.

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,939
And within its onClickListener,
if the map is ready,

9
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,310
then I am going to set the map type
to be GoogleMap.MAP_TYPE_NORMAL.

10
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,230
As I mentioned earlier on, you'll
find the types within the GoogleMap

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,780
object itself, and here you can see I am
just saying GoogleMap.MAP_TYPE_NORMAL.

12
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,880
Similarly for the satellite,
I find the btnSatellite object.

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,366
I set its OnClickListener, and
within its OnClickListener,

14
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:46,760
I set the MapType to be
GoogleMap.MAP_TYPE_SATELLITE.

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,470
And for the hybrid,
I do the same thing, findViewById.

16
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,170
I get the btnHybrid.

17
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,770
I load it into this
button called btnHybrid.

18
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,420
And then I set its OnClickListener.

19
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,421
And if the map is ready, then it
will set it to be a MAP_TYPE_HYBRID.

20
00:01:01,421 --> 00:01:03,477
It's as simple as that.

21
00:01:03,477 --> 00:01:06,780
And then one final thing to add is,
just remember, mapFragment.

22
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,910
You're going to get the actual fragment.

23
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,400
And you're going to get an Async map for
this mapFragment.

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,090
And this is all the code that
you need to be able to create

25
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,540
the application that we've just seen.
