1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
And What we'll find is

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:04,292
that party A got 7/12 of the vote,

3
00:00:04,292 --> 00:00:07,117
which is the majority, whereas the other ones

4
00:00:07,117 --> 00:00:11,285
only received 2/12, 1/12, and 2/12.

5
00:00:11,285 --> 00:00:15,135
So if we go forward 7 pieces in this diagram

6
00:00:15,135 --> 00:00:20,265
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7-- we check mark this box.

7
00:00:20,265 --> 00:00:22,991
Another 2 gives us this box.

8
00:00:22,991 --> 00:00:25,315
Another 1 gives us this box.

9
00:00:25,315 --> 00:00:27,200
and these are the final two.

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,771
So hereâ€™s how this chart will look like,

11
00:00:29,771 --> 00:00:33,219
Obviously A takes the majority outcome,

12
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:36,585
B reaps this slice over here,

13
00:00:36,585 --> 00:00:39,748
C is the smallest party,

14
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:42,447
and D is the one over here.
