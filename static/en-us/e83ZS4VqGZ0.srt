1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,460
And the answer, very counterintuitively, is that by this metric of

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,260
height plus weight, he should be wearing a small like Sarah.

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,520
Now remember, using our intuition,

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:14,110
we said he should be wearing a large like Cameron, so what went wrong here?
