1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,890
So now we need our observation model,
okay?

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:07,222
So we're going to use, it's, it's
referred to as probabilistic PCA but

3
00:00:07,222 --> 00:00:09,830
we're basically going to use PCA.

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:16,000
And given some possible location,
we have to evaluate that

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,300
observation as saying, well, how likely
is it that that's the right place?

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,100
And what it's going to mean is,
how well can I generate that?

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,340
And the math that was done here, this
is the math that sort of justifies this

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,450
idea of distance from face space,
all right?

9
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:32,900
So, here's the idea.

10
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,970
Let's suppose I have some
eigen vector subspace.

11
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:37,800
This is face space.

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,710
And that's written as B here.

13
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:40,460
Okay?

14
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,585
And so
that's just shown as this plane in 3D.

15
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:44,965
So the idea being I'm only using
two dimensions, let's say.

16
00:00:44,965 --> 00:00:46,904
So I'm assuming everything's in a plane.

17
00:00:46,904 --> 00:00:50,003
And furthermore,
it's got some mean value there.

18
00:00:50,003 --> 00:00:53,590
And in this plane is in face space.

19
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:54,485
All right?

20
00:00:54,485 --> 00:00:59,125
And what this little ellipse shows you
is, this is sort of the probabilistic

21
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:02,762
distribution of how the faces
fall within that space.

22
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:05,583
And now I have some observation z here.

23
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:10,498
What this equation is saying here,
is that the probability

24
00:01:10,498 --> 00:01:15,137
of getting some point z,
our observation, all right?

25
00:01:15,137 --> 00:01:18,794
Is distributed about the mean, okay?

26
00:01:18,794 --> 00:01:20,895
So then what's the most likely face?

27
00:01:20,895 --> 00:01:24,524
The most likely face is the mean face.

28
00:01:24,524 --> 00:01:26,648
The mean is the average, right?

29
00:01:26,648 --> 00:01:29,446
That's the most like, that's
the center of the normal distribution.

30
00:01:29,446 --> 00:01:31,777
And what this equation says is that,

31
00:01:31,777 --> 00:01:35,620
the probability sort of
breaks down into two parts.

32
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,803
There is a distance that has
to do with sort of your,

33
00:01:38,803 --> 00:01:42,505
your co-variance or
your variances in the face space, and

34
00:01:42,505 --> 00:01:46,220
then there's a distance that's
sort of out of face space.

35
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,740
The amount of difference
from the reconstruction.

36
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,786
So that's written like this, where the
idea is that this BB transpose, that's

37
00:01:53,786 --> 00:01:58,682
the co-variance matrix sort of within
face space, and then we're going to just

38
00:01:58,682 --> 00:02:03,453
say some epsilon I, I is an identity
matrix, epsilon is some small number.

39
00:02:03,453 --> 00:02:07,730
So things get to come out
of that plane a little bit.

40
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,070
Okay?
So faces are mostly in face space and

41
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,140
they move away a little bit.

42
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:17,190
Now what happens is,
as epsilon goes to zero, or

43
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,360
just as epsilon becomes small, or
another way of saying that is,

44
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,600
that the variance within face space
covers most of the faces, and

45
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,220
there's only a little
bit of variance left.

46
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,962
What this says is that really,

47
00:02:29,962 --> 00:02:33,647
you can think of that as this
variance becomes bigger and bigger,

48
00:02:33,647 --> 00:02:37,474
that the only thing that matters is
how far you are out of face space.

49
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:42,334
So it's mostly a function between
the point z that you've observed and

50
00:02:42,334 --> 00:02:46,470
the face space that's
spanned by these vectors.

51
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,333
So the math behind this can be
written in the following way.

52
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:52,048
What this says is, that p of z given B.

53
00:02:52,048 --> 00:02:57,575
So the probability of some observation
given face space, is an exponential, so

54
00:02:57,575 --> 00:03:02,962
it's going to be decreasing, as
a function of the square of this term.

55
00:03:02,962 --> 00:03:07,883
And what this term is,
is it's the difference,

56
00:03:07,883 --> 00:03:10,891
so z minus mew is this, okay?

57
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:13,666
Subtract off the reconstructions.

58
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,547
So this little blue thing
is the reconstruction.

59
00:03:15,547 --> 00:03:21,027
So if I subtract that off, all I
get is this distance to face space.

60
00:03:21,027 --> 00:03:22,795
And so what I'm going to do is,

61
00:03:22,795 --> 00:03:27,730
I'm going to evaluate the distance to
face space for the reconstruction.

62
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,577
And later when we're
tracking something else,

63
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:31,794
it's going to be the distance
to whatever my eigen space is.

64
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:35,834
So a question is,
why is that term the reconstruction?

65
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:40,396
Why is that term the projection
of z onto that plane.

66
00:03:40,396 --> 00:03:43,238
Well, it's actually
pretty straightforward.

67
00:03:43,238 --> 00:03:49,400
So if B is D by K, all right?

68
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,680
B transpose is just K by K by D,
all right?

69
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,700
So what is z minus u?

70
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,461
Z minus u is just the vector of
the new observation minus the mean.

71
00:03:58,461 --> 00:03:59,553
Okay?

72
00:03:59,553 --> 00:04:04,615
So B transpose times z minus u,
that's just the dot

73
00:04:04,615 --> 00:04:10,190
product of all the eigen
vectors with z minus u.

74
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,640
That's just the co-efficient vector.

75
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,680
So this thing right there,

76
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,480
the transpose z minus u,
that's the co-efficient vector.

77
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,332
And we can call that gamma.

78
00:04:19,332 --> 00:04:21,490
All right?

79
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,470
Well, given the coefficient
vector I can reconstruct.

80
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,460
How do I do that?

81
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:29,190
I just multiply that, I multiply
B times the coefficient vector,

82
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:33,910
that will be the, each coefficient times
each of the eigen vectors summed up.

83
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,930
So that's the reconstruction.

84
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:40,070
So when I'm all done,
this z minus mew minus the total

85
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:44,820
reconstruction gives me just the amount
that you're out of that plane.

86
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,510
That you're out of the face space or
the eigen space.

87
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:51,237
Another way of saying it is,
that's how much of the signal you cannot

88
00:04:51,237 --> 00:04:54,860
reconstruct, using the vectors
that are just in that basis set.
