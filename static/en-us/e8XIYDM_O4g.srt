1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,019
In an experiment,
we also have an experimental variable,

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,210
sometimes called a treatment variable,
or an independent variable.

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,990
This is the variable that you change to
see how it affects the target variable.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,300
In the new product introduction
experiment that we're setting up,

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,930
the experimental variable is
the sale of the new candy.

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,130
The other variables or

7
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,940
data that we have about the units
are called control variables.

8
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,450
These are now just the predictor
variables in modeling.

9
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,030
They are the variables that
are most influential on

10
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,369
the outcome of the target variable.

11
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,270
In our experiment there could
be other information about

12
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,709
the stores that are available
to us as an analyst.

13
00:00:39,798 --> 00:00:44,700
The other variables or data that we have
about each such as sales, customers,

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,540
demographics or location would
be known as control variables.

15
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,490
Control variables are treated a little
differently then predictor variables.

16
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,710
They're not going to be used to build
an equation to make a prediction

17
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,080
on a future value.

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,400
We already know we don't have
enough information to do that.

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,550
Instead, control variables are used to
make sure that the treatment units and

20
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,230
control units are as similar
to each other as possible.

21
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:09,930
This allows for

22
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,230
the comparison of the target variable
to be as accurate as possible.

23
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,460
For instance, in our experiment, we
want to know the effect of adding a new

24
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,580
product to the set of products
that our brand sells at a store.

25
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,780
We look at the effect and

26
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,170
adding the product to the whole set
of products that the brand has.

27
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,060
Because if people buy the new product
instead of the one they would

28
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:30,700
have bought anyway,

29
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:35,980
then the new product could have more
sales because loses in other products.

30
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,070
In order to compare a store that
is going to sell the new product

31
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,810
to one that is not we need to make
sure they're similar as possible.

32
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,260
For example,
we want stores of similar sales levels,

33
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:51,020
geographies, customer demographics etc.

34
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,960
This is super important because we want
to measure the impact of the product

35
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,970
launch independent of other factors.
