1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,432
The answers are, first, yes, it is a problem that it's easy to emit good parses.

2
00:00:05,433 --> 00:00:12,799
So for example, in the small grammar we had, we only had one rule for a noun phrase starting with a determiner,

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,766
and so we missed some perfectly good parses.

4
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:22,066
Secondly, it is easy to include bad parses as well. We want to allow the possibility, say,

5
00:00:22,067 --> 00:00:32,131
of having a verb have both one direct object or an indirect and an indirect object, or be intransitive and have no objects whatsoever.

6
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:36,732
But if we aren't careful, then every verb will have that possibility, even when it shouldn't.

7
00:00:36,733 --> 00:00:42,499
And we have to go back in and be careful to take away some of those possibilities.

8
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:48,566
I don't think it's a good idea, or I don't think it's a problem that the trees are unobservable.

9
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:55,132
Yes, it is true that they are unobservable, but we can still reason with them, even though we don't see them.

10
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:59,066
For the solutions, it is a good idea to add probabilities to the trees.

11
00:00:59,067 --> 00:01:05,699
It's very difficult to make a call whether something absolutely should be part of the language or not.

12
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:14,399
And easier to make a probabilistic call. That way we just have to enumerate all the possible parses,

13
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,466
and we can choose among them using probability to help us, and we don't mind if we throw in an extra rule

14
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:26,599
which will generate some additional parses, as long as they get generated with low probability.

15
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,099
Secondly, it is also a good idea to bring back the word associations.

16
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:39,099
I mentioned the problem with verbs being transitive or intransitive. We want to know which verbs go with what,

17
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:47,566
both syntactically--do they take a direct object or not?--and semantically--what types of things do these verbs operate on?

18
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:53,232
And finally, it would be great if we could make grammars for natural language unambiguous,

19
00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:58,166
but it just isn't going to happen because natural languages inherently are ambiguous.

20
00:01:58,167 --> 00:02:06,866
When we have a perfectly normal sentence, like say, "They are flying planes," "they" can refer either to the planes

21
00:02:06,867 --> 00:02:15,266
or to the pilots, depending on how you interpret the sentence. And either one of those interpretations is good in a particular context.

22
00:02:15,267 --> 00:02:19,266
So we can't rule one out and arbitrarily choose between them.

23
00:02:19,267 --> 00:02:24,267
We have to be able to deal with the ambiguity, not make it go away.
