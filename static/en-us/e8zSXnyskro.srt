00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,810
In a relational database, we store
all our data in the form of tables.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,700
So, here's a table with some data in it.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,800
You probably already know how to
answer a lot of questions using data

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,960
and tables.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,370
Database tables aren't all that
different from tables you might find in

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,120
an infographic or reference book.

7
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,120
Looking at a table like this,
you can tell things like,

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,490
say, the population of Brazil or
the literacy rate in Argentina.

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:29,060
So, even before we get into
databases in any kind of detail,

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,460
you can probably already answer some
questions about how tables work.

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,360
Don't worry about getting
these questions right or

12
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,680
wrong, but take a moment to think
about your answers before we go on.

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,570
So first,
when we look across a row like this one,

14
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,020
what do these values have in common?

15
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,000
And second, when we look
down a column like this one,

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,440
what do the values there have in common?
