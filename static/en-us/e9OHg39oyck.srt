1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,200
So we've talked about how to make our
game easy to play and very engaging.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,340
But the best games also need to
reach as many people as possible.

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,690
>> For example, our game where we
bounce a ball through a ring of fire

4
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,880
is obviously brilliant, but it's so
new that no one knows about it yet.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,290
And you can't get someone interested in
your game if they haven't heard of it.

6
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:22,500
You need fans.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,040
So what makes a player a fan?

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,080
>> Fans of players that help
spread the word about your game

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,740
by telling their friends about it.

10
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:33,270
And then those friends tell
their friends and on and on.

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,110
>> And how can we get fans like that?

12
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:39,040
>> Well, word of mouth is one
simple way to grow your fan base.

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,090
Many developers also do outreach on
social media to reach a wider audience.

14
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,330
But they keep their fans
by creating ways for

15
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:50,320
them to influence the content of
that very game and improve it.

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,010
>> And by making your game better and

17
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,640
promoting it,
fans can help your game make money.
