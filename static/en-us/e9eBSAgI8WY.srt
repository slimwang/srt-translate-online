1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,270
Here is an example solution.

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:06,070
We take the exponential of
the scores and we divide by the sum

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:10,070
of the exponential of the scores
across the other categories.

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,310
Let's see the drawing.

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,710
Here is the result.

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,680
Notice that the probabilities
do sum to one.

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,300
Let's add some legends to make
this a little bit more clear.

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:26,540
As you can see, the probability of the
class one increases with the score x.

9
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,780
It starts near zero and
it ends close to one.

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:35,450
At the same time, the probabilities of
the other classes start pretty high, but

11
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:38,160
then go vanishingly down to 0.

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,890
Feel free to go back and
play with the softmax function.

13
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,400
For example you could draw a bar
chart to convince yourself

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,000
that the probabilities do sum to one for
every value of X.
