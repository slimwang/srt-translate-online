00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,110
Let's take a minute to check if we

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:05,926
understood the relationship between latency and throughput. Suppose

3
00:00:05,926 --> 00:00:09,120
we are running a website for ordering penguin-shaped

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,960
USB drives. Our website has two servers and

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,960
it works as follows. An order request will

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,940
be assigned to one of the servers very

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,090
quickly. A server takes one millisecond to process

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,210
a single order and a server cannot do anything

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,180
else while processing an order. So the question for

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:34,450
you is, what does this website have for throughput in

11
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:38,010
orders per second, so how many orders per second, and

12
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,630
what's the latency for orders in this website in milliseconds?
