1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now let's return to fishing but look at it from a different perspective--

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
the perspective of optimization.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We could run our simulation with different but constant harvest rates

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and check what the total amount of harvest in 10 years would be.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If we are using to a high a harvest rate, we are over fishing

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and hence lose from the total amount that would be possible.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If we harvest too little, we are under fishing which is also not optimal.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Optimization aims at finding the right value for the harvest rate--

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
the value that would maximize a total amount of harvest.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
In technical terms, the function that we are optimizing is called the objective function,

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and the harvest rate is a parameter it depends on.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The optimization should find the best value of that harvest rate,

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
meaning the value for which the objective function is maximum.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The same would have to happen for instance if we look at the numbers of units sold in some simulation

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
or the money earned in some simulation.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Most probably, we want to maximize that value, but there's also a large number of optimization problems

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
in which we want to minimize the objective function.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
For instance, we particularly want to minimize the duration of a trip or the money spent.
