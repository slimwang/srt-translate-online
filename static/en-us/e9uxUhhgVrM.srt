1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,260
So if we just plug in our values into Chebyshev's inequality,

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:07,880
we see that x bar should deviate from the true beta star by no more than 0.01,

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:12,730
and the probability of it doing that should be less than or equal to .1.

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,110
So if you solve this for n, you get 25,000.

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:20,680
Now this is troubling because we only have about 3,200 points.

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,590
So what can we say with 3,200 points?

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,920
Well, if all the other parameters are the same.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,790
And we just replace n with 3,200.

9
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:33,656
The probability that deviation from the true data star is greater than 0.01,

10
00:00:33,656 --> 00:00:36,590
is 0.78 which is pretty high.

11
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,190
However, we can decrease this probability to a more manageable 5%,

12
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:46,460
if we drop our accuracy bound from 0.01 to 0.0395.

13
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,540
So, just to summarize what we found out.

14
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:54,402
For our 3,200 data points, if we accept a deviation from the true beta star

15
00:00:54,402 --> 00:01:00,719
of .0395, we can be sure we'll deviate from it with a probability of 5% or less
