1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,300
Devices interface with the rest of
the system via controller that's

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,210
typically integrated as part
of the device packaging,

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:12,750
that's used to connect the device
with the rest of the CPU complex

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,010
via some CPU device interconnect.

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,320
Whatever off-chip interconnect
is supported by the CPU

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,010
that different devices can connect to.

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,220
This figure that's adapted
from the Silver Sheds book

8
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,440
shows a number of different
devices that are interconnected

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,470
to the CPU complex via PCI bus.

10
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,460
PCI stands for
peripheral component interconnect and

11
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,700
it's one of the standard methods for
connecting devices to the CPU.

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,300
Today's platforms typically
support PCI Express interconnect,

13
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,750
which are technologically more advanced
than the original PCI or PCI-X bus.

14
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,110
So, PCI Express has more bandwidth and
it's faster, has lower access latency,

15
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,540
supports more devices.

16
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,500
In all aspects,

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:59,720
it is better than PCI-X which was the
follow on on the original PCI standard.

18
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,847
For compatibility reasons, though,

19
00:01:01,847 --> 00:01:05,780
today's platform will also include
some of these older technologies,

20
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,970
typically PCI-X because it's compatible
with PCI, PCI-X stands for PCI extended.

21
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,140
Note that the PCI bus is not
the only interconnect that's

22
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,140
shown in this figure alone.

23
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,730
There is also a SCSI bus
that connect SCSI disks,

24
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:23,230
there's a peripheral bus here shown
that connects devices like keyboards,

25
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,570
and there may be other types of buses.

26
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,970
The controllers that are part
of the device hardware,

27
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:33,440
they determine what type of interconnect
can a device directly attach to.

28
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,370
And, there are also bridge and
controllers that can handle

29
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,930
any differences between
different types of interconnects
