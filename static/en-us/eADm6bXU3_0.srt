00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,263
Good job. Let's do one more. You have a sample of size 24, and you get a t

2
00:00:05,263 --> 00:00:12,660
statistic of 2.45. So remember, this is just like the z score. So here's your t

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,510
statistic. The area to the right of the t statistic is between what and what?

4
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,310
Enter these values exactly as shown in the t table, and as precise as possible.

5
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,230
This one might be kind of tricky but just remember what the t statistic means.

6
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,433
And remember that the values in the column headers are the probabilities.
