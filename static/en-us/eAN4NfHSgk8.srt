1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,845
Let's round these values to the nearest 100's for the rest of this example, now

2
00:00:04,845 --> 00:00:09,176
let's calculate the T statistic, remember that the T statistic is x bar or

3
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:16,116
sample mean minus meu the population mean. And really we can compare x bar to

4
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:20,456
anything, but we are choosing to compare it to the population mean to see if

5
00:00:20,456 --> 00:00:24,936
things have changed and then we divide by the standard error as divided by the

6
00:00:24,936 --> 00:00:28,933
square root of n.
