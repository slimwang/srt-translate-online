The best way to learn about classical conditioning is by starting with its

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,228
discovery by Ivan Pavlov, who was looking at digestion in dogs. Actually Pavlov

3
00:00:09,228 --> 00:00:13,584
learned about classical conditioning by accident. Here's what happened. Pavlov

4
00:00:13,584 --> 00:00:17,094
was actually a physiologist who was interested in studying digestion, and he

5
00:00:17,094 --> 00:00:21,857
used dogs to do so. Every day he would come into his laboratory, put a little

6
00:00:21,857 --> 00:00:24,866
bit of meat powder on the dog's tongue, and the dog would automatically

7
00:00:24,866 --> 00:00:30,148
salivate, and Pavlov collected that salivation and analyzed it. However, one

8
00:00:30,148 --> 00:00:34,306
day when Pavlov came into the lab, he saw that the dog salivated automatically,

9
00:00:34,306 --> 00:00:39,835
even though it didn't have any meat powder. Pavlov wondered if perhaps he could

10
00:00:39,835 --> 00:00:44,310
be the reason the dog was salivating, and it turns out he was correct.
