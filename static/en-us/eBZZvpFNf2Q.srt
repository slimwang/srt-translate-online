1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm going to draw a tree that's already mostly filled out.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This tree uses numbers like 5 and 3 and 1, 6 and 8 and 13,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
but it follows the same principle we talked about before.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
For any particular node like 5, all of the children I can reach on the left are less than 5,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and all of the children I can reach on the right--6, 8, and 13--are greater than 5.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Now I want to add 7 to this tree,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and you're going to help me out by telling me where it might go.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I've drawn 7 boxes with sort of dotted edges,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and these represent possible new nodes that I could add.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What I'd like you to do is check all of the boxes where I could legitimately add a node for 7

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
to the sorts of trees that we've been talking about.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Check all the boxes that apply.
