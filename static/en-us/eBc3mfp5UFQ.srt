00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's talk a bit about planning.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
One of the key problems is that these robots have to decide what to do next.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'll address the planning problem at multiple levels of abstraction.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The easiest happens to be to look at a city level of abstraction.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Suppose we have a road like this over here,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and my car is located down here in the beginning.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I wish to get to this point up here.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Let me draw in an abstraction of the state space,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and discretize the states as shown with these red lines over here.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So you see a maze with lots of discrete states.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm going to ask you given that you traversing from grid cell to grid cell costs you 1,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
or -1 using the definition of the MDP lecture before.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Suppose the goal state has a value of 100.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What's the value of the start state assuming deterministic actions?
