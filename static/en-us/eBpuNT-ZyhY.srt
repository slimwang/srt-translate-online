00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,668
We have two major areas of mental illness to cover, and those are personality

2
00:00:03,668 --> 00:00:08,890
disorders and schizophrenia. So, let's start with personality disorders.

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,616
Personality disorders are another area where psychologists disagree, and their

4
00:00:12,616 --> 00:00:17,704
classification in the DSM has been controversial. For example, some have

5
00:00:17,704 --> 00:00:21,232
suggested that we look at these personality problems as extreme values on a

6
00:00:21,232 --> 00:00:24,648
trait dimension such as the big five that we learned about in our lesson on

7
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:31,518
personality, and not call them a disorder. Approximately 15% of the general

8
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:36,995
population of people over the age of 18 have a personality disorder. But if you

9
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:41,195
look at the age range from 18 to 25, approximately 20% have a personality

10
00:00:41,195 --> 00:00:46,710
disorder. Now let's go back to Lauren and learn a little bit more about this.
