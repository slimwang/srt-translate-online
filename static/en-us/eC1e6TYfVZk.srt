00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,270
In this lesson, we will talk just briefly

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,689
about buffer bloat. We saw an example of

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:09,260
buffer bloat in the last lesson where we

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,840
explored the latency effects of power boost. In the

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,730
example we explored, the sender could send at

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,540
a rate R that was bigger than the sustained

7
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,140
rate R without seeing packet loss. Now if

8
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,540
there's a buffer in the network that can support

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,710
this higher rate, what we'll see is that buffer

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,330
will start filling up with packets. But this buffer

11
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:36,470
can still only drain at the sustained rate R.

12
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,730
So even though the sender might be able to

13
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,840
send at a faster rate for a brief period

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,380
of time in terms of throughput, all of those

15
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,080
packets that the sender sent at that faster rate

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,100
are queued up in line waiting to be sent.

17
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,470
As these packets are waiting in this buffer,

18
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,830
they'll see higher delays than they would see

19
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,200
if they simply arrived at the front of

20
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,470
the queue and could be sent immediately. The delay

21
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:09,040
that the packet will see in the buffer is the amount of data in the buffer

22
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,610
divided by the rate that the buffer can

23
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,410
drain. These large buffers can introduce delays that ruin

24
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,690
the performance for time-critical applications such as

25
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,110
voice and video. These large buffers actually show

26
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:29,600
up all over the place. In home routers, in home WiFi devices or access points,

27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,640
in hosts on device drivers, and also

28
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,410
in switches and routers. Let's take an example

29
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:41,680
of buffer bloat that we observed in home routers as part of the Bismarck study

30
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,300
that I described in the last lesson.
