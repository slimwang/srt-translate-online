1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,300
So, you are looking at the project for
this course.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,630
Notice how it's not responsive at all.

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,030
At the ends of lessons 2, 4, and 5,

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,312
you'll be challenged to improve
this site's responsiveness.

5
00:00:14,312 --> 00:00:16,010
I want to make it super,

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:21,560
super clear that there is no
right solution to this challenge.

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,490
You'll hear us repeat throughout the
course that responsive design is an art,

8
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,680
not a science.

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,310
To improve your responsive design
skills, you'll just have to practice.

10
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,509
I'll be talking through
the decisions we made, and

11
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:35,580
the steps we took to make
this site responsive.

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:40,880
And I really don't expect your
answers to look anything like ours.

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,190
This course is all about
thinking responsively.

14
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,720
Sure, we want you to walk away with
a few new CSS tricks up your sleeves.

15
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,490
But more importantly, I want you to
walk away approaching responsive design,

16
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,300
from the right mind set.

17
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,220
I'm recording this video now after
having spent several months working with

18
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,890
Pete on this course.

19
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,920
Over this time I have
actually learned quite a bit.

20
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,190
I'd done some responsive work before,
but

21
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:09,870
I hadn't approached my sites the way
you'll be learning in a few minutes.

22
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:14,900
A few weeks since filming I decided
to revamp my personal site.

23
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,950
And this is what I came up with.

24
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,480
Now I know it isn't the prettiest
thing in the world,

25
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,170
but it's nicely responsive.

26
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,190
And believe it or not this website
actually only took a few hours to

27
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,760
build over a weekend that wasn't to bad.

28
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,320
What helped is that I approached
responsiveness systematically from

29
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,480
the start instead of
just as an afterthought.

30
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,660
All this is to say, that thinking
responsively is a huge help for

31
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,750
your development.

32
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,720
So, are you ready to get started?

33
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,430
Are you excited to get responsive?

34
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:45,970
Let's get started.
