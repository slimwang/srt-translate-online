00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,528
What we eat is clearly not just based on biological influence, but culture

2
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:09,708
plays a factor as well. The psychology of what we eat has to do with external

3
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:13,800
factors, such as the sight of food, the smell of food, and importantly, the

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:19,655
culture in which we were raised. That is, when one person may find delicious,

5
00:00:19,655 --> 00:00:24,420
another person may find inedible. Children, for example, who are exposed to

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,016
spicy foods early in life quickly develop a taste and even cravings for the

7
00:00:28,016 --> 00:00:34,086
spicy foods later in life. Likewise, people who were not exposed to spicy foods

8
00:00:34,086 --> 00:00:39,856
find them too overpowering for them. Similarly, brains and intestines are

9
00:00:39,856 --> 00:00:45,610
delicious in some cultures. Yet beef is disgusting, or even sacrilegious in

10
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:50,680
others. In most cases, except for sweets, food preferences are acquired, and

11
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,978
learned tastes. It's safe to say that food and cuisine are key traits of any

12
00:00:55,978 --> 00:01:00,890
culture, with each culture having it's own unique cuisine and food.
