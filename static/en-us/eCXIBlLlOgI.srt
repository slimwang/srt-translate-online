This is an algorithm, although this is maybe up for debate. And when it works,

2
00:00:04,399 --> 00:00:09,270
it makes a doorway. You might have felt like my instructions were ambiguous.

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,380
I'm going to pretend they were perfect, though. If you can write clearer

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,085
instructions, post them on the forum. I'd like to read them. And now, I'm going

5
00:00:15,085 --> 00:00:19,533
to do my best impersonation of a robot and follow this algorithm. So, first I'm

6
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:23,678
going to place an 8 by 2 block horizontally. I'll do it this way, so you can

7
00:00:23,678 --> 00:00:26,983
see what I'm doing. And I'm going to stick a 2 by 2 block on the top of the

8
00:00:26,983 --> 00:00:31,600
left end of the 8 by 2 block, so right here. Now, 3 times, I'm going to stick a

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,510
2 by 2 block on top of the previous block. So, this was the previous block,

10
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,700
one, two three. And now, I'm going to stick a two by two block on top of the

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:45,586
right end of the 8 by 2 block. And I'll repeat three times, putting a 2 by 2

12
00:00:45,586 --> 00:00:49,642
block on top of the previous block. And now, I put an 8 by 2 block on the

13
00:00:49,642 --> 00:00:52,030
highest two. And we have a doorway.
