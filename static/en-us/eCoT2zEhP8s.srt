1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,510
The idea for Sharp ratio is
to consider our return, or

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,390
our rewards in the context of risk.

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,400
As we mentioned before,

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,940
most finance folks consider risk to
be standard deviation or volatility.

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,080
We're looking for

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,740
a measure that essentially
adjusts our return for that risk.

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,965
So, here are a couple of examples
that I want you to think about,

8
00:00:27,965 --> 00:00:30,460
and we'll have a little
quiz associated with it.

9
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,160
But we have three example charts here,

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,630
where we're comparing two
stocks against one another.

11
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:43,120
So in this first one we've got ABC and
XYZ and both of them have about

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,550
the same volatility, except one returns
a little bit more than the other.

13
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:49,760
In this next question,

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,370
question two, they both return
exactly the same amount.

15
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,610
But one of them is more
volatile than the other.

16
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,560
And finally,
we have again these two stocks.

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:11,710
One, ABC, returns 11%, XYZ returns 9%,
but ABC is much more volatile than XYZ.

18
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:17,060
So I want you to think about this and
mark which portfolio or

19
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,090
stock you think is better in
each one of these examples.
