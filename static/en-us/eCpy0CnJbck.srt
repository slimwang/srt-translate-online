1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's go over the solution to this problem starting with the definition of the acceleration function.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We know the acceleration due to gravity points downward.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So let's put this factor into two components.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We have one component right here that is parallel to the string of the pendulum

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and another component that is perpendicular to this green one.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Now we know that the acceleration in this direction is going to be exactly cancelled out

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
by the acceleration due to the tension in the rope.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So that means that the acceleration we're looking for is really just this pink component,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
which any point along the path is going to be tangent to the trajectory.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Now if we call this angle θ right here, we can figure out the length of this pink component

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
by just saying that it is equal to length of the resultant vector times the sine of θ.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The θ down here is actually exactly equal to θ in the diagram of the pendulum itself.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So that means to figure out the length of this component,

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
we can use information that we already know about this larger diagram.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Since position is just the arc link right here of this imaginary circle,

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
then the measure of that angle in radiant is going to be equal to the length of the arc

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
that it corresponds to divided by the radius of that circle.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So that means that in our case, θ is equal to arc length over radius or position over length.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So since θ equals position over length and we want the sine of θ,

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
we fill in our definition for acceleration as -g or negative

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity times sine of the position over length.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Okay, moving on towards symplectic Euler function.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We have to fill in this for loop with the input num_initial conditions.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
As I said in the InterVideo of the problem, we wanted the initial x to vary from 1.75 to 2.25

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and the initial v to vary from -2 to 2

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
corresponding to the coordinates of every point along that green circle that I'd showed you.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Now a convenient way to make a variable cycle through values that are symmetric

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
about an equilibrium value is to use sine or cosine.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So we're going to keep that in mind.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Now as you learn from the circular orbit problem of Unit 1, if we consider any point

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
along the circumference of the circle, then we can define an angle that corresponds to that point.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
These are coming from right here as a zero radian mark.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You can write the coordinates of this point then as the radius of the circle times the cosine of the angle.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That's for the horizontal component and for the vertical component,

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
we get the radius times the sine of the angle.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
In the phase based plot that I showed you in the InterVideo, we saw that position lying along

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
the horizontal axis and velocity lying along the vertical axis.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So we wanted to plot the coordinates of the points on that green circle--the initial condition circle

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
where the position is going to correspond to cosine and the velocity is going to use sine.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Now I created a variable called phi. You could pick any name you want I guess.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And phi effectively split the circle into 49 segments

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
by marking out 50 different points along the circumference.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So every time I increases by one, we're going to step to the next point along the circumference.

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Since as we saw in the phase base plot, we have a complete circle of green points.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The x values of those green points vary like this with 2 as the middle value

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and the v coordinates vary like that.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You noticed that the amplitude in either case corresponds to the

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
half link of the green shape in that direction.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So actually we have in a phase base plot is an ellipse for that set of initial conditions.

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Now that we have our starting additions figured out, we can finally use the symplectic Euler method

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
to proximate the values with x and v at later sets.

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
This code right here is just a direct transition pretty much of the equations that I showed you earlier.

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Now let's go back to looking at the plot that we get things plugged in

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
but first let's look at our top two plots.

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The horizontal axis in both of them represents time measured in seconds.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The vertical axis in the top one is x measured in meters

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and here it is v measured in meters per second.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So you can see that our initial values of x go from 1.5 to 2.25 and v from -2 to 2.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So that corresponds to this green ellipse right here.

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The most important thing to notice about this bottom graph, which like I said earlier represents

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
phase base is that if we look closely at each one of these ellipses they all have the same area.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Now let's look at the shapes that we have down here in this bottom graph.

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
If you look closely and do a bit of calculating, you'll notice that all these different color shapes

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
have the same exact area even though they are well shaped very differently.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
This is a great example of how phase base is conserve in the system where energy is conserve.

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Now the fact that its conservation principle holds in this diagram

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
shows how the symplectic Euler method improve upon the accuracy of the forward Euler method.

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
When the forward Euler method is used, it often result in the energy suddenly increasing.

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So it means that the area of each of these shapes down here will get progressively bigger.

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Symplectic Euler method, however, confirms much better the equations of motion in physics,

71
00:04:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It never reflects exactly radical predictions more accurately. Great job with the first problem in Unit 2.
