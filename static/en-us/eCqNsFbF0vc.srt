1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,407
If we try to fold any of the curves on this graph across the y-axis,

2
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:09,764
none of them are going to map over to themselves. 
So, they must not have symmetry across the y-axis.

3
00:00:09,764 --> 00:00:14,680
The same is true of the x-axis when we try it there.

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,160
Folding them in half along this line is not going to make points up here match points down here,

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,432
because they're on opposite sides of the y-axis.

6
00:00:23,432 --> 00:00:28,115
So, it looks like neither of these 2 symmetries applies in the case of odd functions.

7
00:00:28,115 --> 00:00:32,631
However, let's look at these last 2 choices.
Maybe one of them works.

8
00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:36,909
We know that this is a property of even functions, that points equidistant from the y-axis have the same y value.

9
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:41,974
But it doesn't look like this is true of odd functions.

10
00:00:41,974 --> 00:00:46,990
If I pick some x coordinate like 5,
and I find the given y coordinate,

11
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:51,650
then finding the opposite x coordinate,
negative 5 does not give me the same y coordinate.

12
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:56,352
It's all the way down here, instead of up here.
However, these y coordinates are related.

13
00:00:56,352 --> 00:01:01,379
This one is the negative version of this one.
So that means this last rule is true.
