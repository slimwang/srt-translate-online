00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,030
As great as those points we found are, I'd still like for us to find the

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,230
equation of f inverse. How about we take this through step-by-step, since this

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,980
is our first time really doing this. We know that we need to start out with

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,190
this equation, the equation for f. As we've seen from graphs and points in

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:20,840
equations before, we know that to find the inverse, we need to switch x and y

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,330
in our equation. However, we don't even have a y in our equation right now.

7
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:30,580
Let's get that straight right now. Please replace f of x in this equation with

8
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,399
y, and then rewrite the equation down here.
