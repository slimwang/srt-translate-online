00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,733
So, here's a summary of what we learned over the last two quizzes. We found a

2
00:00:04,733 --> 00:00:09,521
general expression for the sum of two cubes and a general expression for the

3
00:00:09,521 --> 00:00:14,447
difference of two cubes. We can see here that each of these factorized forms has

4
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:19,199
a binomial, a polynomial with 2 terms, multiplied by a trinomial, a polynomial

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,993
with 3 terms. The binomial that's involved in the factorization of each

6
00:00:23,993 --> 00:00:29,353
expression, has the same sign between its two terms, as the original expression

7
00:00:29,353 --> 00:00:34,355
did between its two terms. So, y cubed plus z cubed has a factor of y plus z and

8
00:00:34,355 --> 00:00:38,566
y cubed minus z cubed as a factor of y minus z. The middle term of each

9
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:43,384
trinomial, each quadratic expression, has a sign opposite that original sign

10
00:00:43,384 --> 00:00:48,297
between the terms. See we have a minus yc in the adding up the cubes and plus yc

11
00:00:48,297 --> 00:00:53,215
in the subtracting. Other than that, these factorizations are the same. So, now

12
00:00:53,215 --> 00:00:57,679
that we have this wonderful general framework for dealing with the sum and

13
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,407
differences of cubes, let's put it into action. Let's look at the expression x

14
00:01:02,407 --> 00:01:07,168
cubed minus 8. Now, compared with the general equations that we were looking at

15
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:11,776
before, what in this case is playing the role of y, and what is playing the role

16
00:01:11,776 --> 00:01:12,080
of z?
