00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,862
That does it for optionals.

00:00:01,862 --> 00:00:05,596
As you can see, by making the use
of nill values more explicit,

3
00:00:05,596 --> 00:00:08,910
optionals can lead to safer and
cleaner code.

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,520
Mastering them now is well
worth your while, and

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,310
sure to cut down on
debugging in the future.
