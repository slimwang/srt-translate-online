1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
>> Hey Catherine, do you think Tommy likes
our mock-ups? >> I don't know he's being

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,150
really quiet.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,620
>> Yeah, he's usually really a tough critic.
>> Yeah, how about I just ask him.

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,619
Hey Tommy, do you like our mock-ups? You think
they're user-friendly? I'm gonna take

5
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:18,509
that snap as a yes.

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,810
It comes with that. I'm going to catch up
with the organ and we did some

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,229
brainstorming with our designer here at
Udacity, and came up with these mock-ups.

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,730
So we'll be making an app that the pet shelter
can use to keep track of their pets.

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,790
And we'll walk you through the designs now.
Hey actually, Tommy do you wanna help

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:39,300
take the lead? Alright, so when you open up the

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,468
app, you'll see a list of existing pets,
and if a new pet arrives at the shelter,

12
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:47,399
you can add it by clicking the big red
button on the bottom right corner. So

13
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,730
clicking that button takes us to the
editor activity we can fill out

14
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:56,610
attributes about a new pet, including its
name breed gender & weight. There will also be

15
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,640
a different version of the interactivity
that will build, which allows us to

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,490
update an existing pet. For example, if
Garfield already exists in our database,

17
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:08,729
and gain a little bit of weight, we can
go ahead and update his weight here.

18
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:12,810
Styo note that we're starting out with a
minimum viable product that has only a

19
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,530
couple of pet attributes. And we're doing
this so that you can focus on understanding

20
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,670
the key concepts of data storage. Moving
forward, you can imagine extending the

21
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,479
app to support many more data fields
about each pet and even adding photos

22
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,530
for each pet that you insert. In this
course, we will be building this pet app

23
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,000
across four lessons, in Lesson one we'll
focus on what data persistence is all

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,340
about, as well as how we can sort text
data in a database. Then, in lesson 2, we'll

25
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,119
begin to add the databases inside an
Android app, and get to start interacting

26
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:47,939
with it by inserting and reading data
from that database. Next, lesson 3, we'll learn

27
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,508
about something called a content
provider, and learn how to use it to help

28
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,860
us insert and read data from our
database. And lastly, in lesson four, we'll

29
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,829
close out finishing the app by
implementing the UPDATE and DELETE

30
00:01:58,829 --> 00:01:59,369
functionality.
