1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,210
So now it's your turn to run the Hello

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:06,050
World Endpoints application. Go ahead and import the Hello

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,310
World Endpoints project into Eclipse. And then you run

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,780
your app on localhost. Then try your app in

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,220
the web UI. And remember, you get to it

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:20,210
by going to localhost: and then your port number.

7
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,700
Also go ahead and try your app in the

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,688
APIs Explorer. And remember, you get to that by going

9
00:00:25,688 --> 00:00:29,809
to localhost:8080 or whatever your port number

10
00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:34,131
is, _ah/api/explorer. We've tested it out on localhost,

11
00:00:34,131 --> 00:00:38,080
then go ahead and run it on appspot. Go to your app on appspot you

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,900
go to your-app-id.appspot.com. When you've done all

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,100
those things and your app's running on appspot,

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,080
go ahead and enter your app ID here so that you can check that it's running.
