For this quiz, I want to see how much you already know about types. For each of

2
00:00:03,539 --> 00:00:08,885
the values listed here, select from the choices here what the type of that value

3
00:00:08,885 --> 00:00:12,270
is. Note that there are more choices than there are values, so not all of these

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,567
are used. And you can use the type operator to check your answers. But I think

5
00:00:16,567 --> 00:00:19,749
you probably know enough to get most of these correct without using it.
