1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,590
So one of the ways of doing this is of course cross fading

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:05,040
between the two images.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,920
As I go from one side of one image,

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,400
let's say from here to there, and on this image I go from here to there.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,380
So this is left image and the right image.

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,900
I would basically cross fade this direction on the left image and

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,089
this direction for the right image.

8
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:23,230
So, in that, in essence what that means is, we will cross fade this way here,

9
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,350
and cross fade this way here, and generate a new image.

10
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:30,850
So to help us do this, let's imagine that now I can create a small ramp.

11
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,080
This ramp has a value of 1 here, and 0 there.

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,060
And then the other one, the value of 1 here, and 0 there.

13
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,620
And what Iâ€™m interested in really is being able to now go and

14
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:46,010
take information, all of the information, from this part here, from this image,

15
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,860
but reduce it as a go and traverse down this way.

16
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,600
And similarly, take all of the value from here, and

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,300
reduce it as I go down there.

18
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,070
And if you notice, the mixture of these two basically would kind of start having

19
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:01,120
blended values in the middle all over here starting from the first.

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,340
Our first column here and the last column here.

21
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,800
Of course one of the ways of doing this,

22
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,950
if you remember our approaches of trying to do this with simple point

23
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,660
arithmetic, is creating a ramp image like this, all whites, all blacks.

24
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,590
And similarly the transpose of the opposite of this where all white here and

25
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,620
black here, just doing this multiplication plus some operations will

26
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,480
give us an image like this.

27
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,260
Again, notice this is cross-fading.

28
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,060
All of the information for this image is going down to 0.

29
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:32,355
And this one from 1 to 0 and here of course we see a little bit of blend here.

30
00:01:32,355 --> 00:01:34,540
50/50 is showing up here.

31
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,580
So this is basically a simple technique of cross-fading between two

32
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,980
images along this direction.

33
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,310
This direction for this one, this direction for that one.

34
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,750
And we get a blended image.

35
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,600
On this side, of course, you see more of this image.

36
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,570
And on this side you see more of this image.

37
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,410
Now of course, there is no reason for

38
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:55,190
us to have just ramps that are linear in this manner.

39
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,890
We could actually also play around with this,

40
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:01,550
and have them have different types of, of functions perhaps even step

41
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:05,830
functions to give it more emphasis in one region, less emphasis in the other.

42
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,440
So what does it mean for these two images?

43
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,380
Again the left and right image can generate our target.

44
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,320
But now I want to play around with how I do the blending, or

45
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,220
the cross-fading between those two.

46
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,270
Again, lets look at our ramp functions.

47
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:20,270
And this time around, I have one, but when I get to this point is when I

48
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:26,890
actually start giving it less values from this one, basically the opposite here,

49
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:31,670
up to here, and then all of sudden I can use a step function or a ramp that

50
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:36,120
starts off a little later to actually do the blending from one to the other.

51
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,590
So, in essence, now what we will see is the entire effect of this blending will

52
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:46,320
only be restricted to this region of the image or to this region of this image.

53
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,830
So this would be what I would refer to again as the window,

54
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,540
the size of the window where I would actually do the blending.

55
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,840
I don't want to do any here and I don't want to do any here, but

56
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,680
I just want to do it in this small window between these two left and

57
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,050
right images to generate a target.

58
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,270
Of course, in this case,

59
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:07,580
I could simply create again the simple ramp images to a simple point arithmetic,

60
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,290
between those two, and again, this ramp is basically exactly.

61
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,780
On this profile here, this ramp is based on this profile here.

62
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,790
The output of this one is this image.

63
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,900
Again, if you notice, and look at it carefully here,

64
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,990
that these are the lines where most of the blending is.

65
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,990
This is originally the same image here.

66
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,460
This is originally this image here.

67
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,840
Most of the blending is in this region.

68
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,400
So in essence, we've created now a ramp function or

69
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,480
a cross fade here where the value of blue from here on this side of

70
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,130
the left image is exactly the same, crosses over and becomes 0 here.

71
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:46,880
And similarly on the other side the green which is representing the right image,

72
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,820
goes up in here, crosses over and

73
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,480
becomes 0, so most of the blending is right there.

74
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,930
We can play around with these types of how big the window size would be.

75
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,340
So the same process, except now my window is much narrower.

76
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,550
So this would be the size of my window that I actually have that I

77
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,140
want to do the cross-fading in.

78
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,910
And again, look at the same examples as previously,

79
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:11,190
we've just done a ramp with a little bit of change in the middle.

80
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,530
And this one you'll notice, this,

81
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:16,230
this is exactly what the ground functions look like, black, all zeros here.

82
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,209
Quick jump from 0 with a little bit of gradation and

83
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:23,170
colors to white and that's what we see here, and that's what we see here.

84
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,730
Doing the same arithmetic, we get this image.

85
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,940
And here you notice, again, most of this image is like this one,

86
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,830
most of this image is like this one.

87
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,040
And here there's a little bit better example of blending.

88
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,610
Now, you can still see a little bit of sharp edges here.

89
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,900
So the question now comes up as, what's the right size of this window?

90
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,720
So one of the things now we need to start looking at is how do

91
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,470
we best determine the size of this window to give us the best results of

92
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,010
doing these cross faded or blended images.
