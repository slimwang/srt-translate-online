1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,310
Believe it or not, the way you perceive taste is

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,780
in fact determined genetically a lot of times because it

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,600
has to do with your taste bud receptors. But not

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,050
all traits can easily be distinguished as visible or hidden.

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,300
>> That's true, and sometimes it can be really

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,050
hard to tell. Let's take Andy here for example.

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:18,610
>> Hi Andy.

8
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:18,880
>> Hi.

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,395
>> You see these beautiful big blue eyes?

10
00:00:21,395 --> 00:00:23,270
[INAUDIBLE]

11
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,850
So the presence of these big blue eyes are obviously a visible trait.

12
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,010
>> But there's something about Andy that you

13
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,030
may not suspect, and we can't see on

14
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,770
the outside. If we had an x-ray machine,

15
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,660
and we looked inside the mid-section of his body,

16
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,290
we would be able to see that his

17
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,580
organs are actually flipped the opposite direction from most

18
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,340
people. This is a syndrome called Situs Inversus,

19
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,330
where all of the organs are flipped, left-right to

20
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,610
be the opposite symmetry.

21
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,100
>> Now you'd never know this about Andy because this

22
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,130
is a trait that's not easily visible by the unaided eye.

23
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,240
>> So why don't you actually think about two

24
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,750
traits you have, one that's visible and one that's

25
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,420
hidden, and enter them text boxes here. And if

26
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,950
you can, try to limit your respnses to one word.
