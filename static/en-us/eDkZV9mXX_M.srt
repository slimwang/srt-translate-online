1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,130
There is a second notion of vector
multiplication that is common especially

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:08,430
in the context of engineering,
physics, and computer graphics.

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,690
This product is the cross product.

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,530
The cross product is very useful in
three dimensional linear algebra but

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,748
it does not have a generalization
to higher dimensions.

6
00:00:17,748 --> 00:00:22,362
Geometrically, the cross product
of two vectors, v and w,

7
00:00:22,362 --> 00:00:25,811
is a vector that is
orthogonal to both v and w.

8
00:00:25,811 --> 00:00:30,514
And has magnitude of v times
magnitude of w times sine of

9
00:00:30,514 --> 00:00:35,150
theta where theta is
the angle between v and w.

10
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:40,230
Note that unlike the dot product the
output of a cross product is a vector,

11
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,430
not a number.

12
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,088
Let's look at this definition
a bit more closely.

13
00:00:44,088 --> 00:00:47,310
Notice that if theta is 0 or
pi that is 0 or

14
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,540
180 degrees, then the cross
product will have magnitude 0.

15
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,540
So in other words, the cross product of
two parallel vectors is the 0 vector.

16
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,980
Also if either v or

17
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,420
w is the 0 vector, then the cross
product will be the 0 vector as well.

18
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,130
Assuming we're not in one of these
degenerate cases, notice that there

19
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:10,330
were, in fact, two vectors that meet
the geometric description given so far.

20
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,050
These vectors are negatives
of each other.

21
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:17,880
In order to determine which vector to
use, we proceed by the right-hand rule.

22
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,160
Here's how the right-hand rule works.

23
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:26,280
If the cross product is v cross w,
imagine your right thumb pointing

24
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,710
in the direction of v and your right
index finger in the direction of w.

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,280
Then extend your right middle finger,
and

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,830
then the direction it points will
be the direction of the cross w.

27
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,670
So, in this case,
it will be pointing up.

28
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,130
Notice that if we switch the order
of the cross product to w cross v,

29
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,850
then using the right-hand rule will
give us the downward pointing vector.

30
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:58,240
This gives us the equation v cross
w equals the negative of w cross v

31
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,250
because switching the order of
multiplication negates the product.

32
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,780
We call the cross-product
anticommutative

33
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,370
as opposed to
the commutative dot product

34
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:10,479
in which switching the order
does not affect the product.

35
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,300
A consequence of this geometric formula

36
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,540
can be seen in the parallelogram
spanned by v and w.

37
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:22,520
Take the length of the v arrow to
be the base of the parallelogram.

38
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,430
Then the height of the parallelogram
is the length of this segment

39
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:31,920
from the head of the w arrow to the line
spanned by v perpendicular to v.

40
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,750
Using the trigonometric identity, sine
of theta equals opposite over hypotenuse

41
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,850
which is the SOH from SOH-cah-toa.

42
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:46,490
We have that sine of theta equals
the height divided by the length of w.

43
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,356
In other words,

44
00:02:47,356 --> 00:02:53,180
the length of w times sine of theta
equals the height of the parallelogram.

45
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,810
Remembering that the area of
a parallelogram is base times height,

46
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,610
this means that the area of this
parallelogram is the magnitude of v

47
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,710
times the magnitude of
w times sine of theta.

48
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,930
In other words,
it's the length of v cross w.

49
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:13,250
Another geometric note is that the area
of this triangle spanned by v and

50
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:18,210
w is exactly one half of the area
of the full parallelogram.

51
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:22,030
That means the area of the triangle
will be one-half times

52
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,260
the magnitude of the cross product.

53
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,900
Again, all this is great, but

54
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,180
it's of little use to us without a
practical formula for the cross product.

55
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,250
So given vectors v with coordinates x1,
y1,z1,

56
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:39,800
and w with coordinates x2, y2,
z2, here's such a formula.

57
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,153
The cross product of v and
w is the vector.

58
00:03:43,153 --> 00:03:49,573
First coordinate, y1z2- y2z1.

59
00:03:49,573 --> 00:03:57,513
Second coordinate, it's the negative
of the quantity (x1z2- x2z1).

60
00:03:57,513 --> 00:04:03,053
And the third coordinate is x1y2- x2y1.

61
00:04:03,053 --> 00:04:08,678
So for an example, if we wanted to
find the cross product of the vectors,

62
00:04:08,678 --> 00:04:15,059
v, which is 5, 3- 2, and w, which is- 1,
0, 3, then we would compute.

63
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:19,500
First coordinate, 3 x 3- 0 x -2.

64
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:26,440
Second coordinate, negative,
quantity of, 5 x 3- (-1) times (-2).

65
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,967
Third coordinate, 5 x 0- (-1) x 3.

66
00:04:30,967 --> 00:04:35,770
And that would give us the vector 9,
-13, 3.

67
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:40,519
One way to help confirm that we did our
arithmetic correctly is by checking

68
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:44,437
that our outcome is orthogonal
to both of our vectors v and w.

69
00:04:44,437 --> 00:04:49,462
The dot product of v with
the cross product will be

70
00:04:49,462 --> 00:04:54,609
45- 39 + 6 = 0, and
then the dot product of

71
00:04:54,609 --> 00:05:00,021
w with the cross product
will be -9 + 0 + 9 = 0.

72
00:05:00,021 --> 00:05:03,990
So our result is orthogonal
to both v and w.

73
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,510
We can also use our cross product to
find the area of the parallelogram

74
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,590
spanned by v and w.

75
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,410
To do this we would take
the magnitude of our cross product,

76
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:18,440
which would be the square root of 9
squared + -13 squared + 3 squared.

77
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,354
Computing this gives us
approximately 16.093.
