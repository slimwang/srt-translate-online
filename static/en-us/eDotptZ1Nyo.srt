00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I want to add a new attribute to our form, and this one is going to be called "method."

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I go up here.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Let's add method and make it equal post.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Now, the default method has been get.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We've talked about this in Unit 1, the difference between a couple methods,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
so we mentioned that a couple methods exist,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and the most important ones are going to be using our get and post.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
If you don't specify method at all, it defaults to get, and that's what we've been seeing.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We've been doing get requests, and the parameters in the URL

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
are called get parameters.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Now we're going to use a new method called "post,"

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
so make this change, and let's go to our browser.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Okay, here we are at our familiar form again.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Let's type in some text and hit submit.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
When you clicked submit, what happened?

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Was the text that we entered displayed?

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
An error message was displayed?

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The request headers were displayed, or we ran a Google search with our text request?
