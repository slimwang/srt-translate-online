00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,578
My name's Molly Mackinlay, I'm from Belleview Washington and I'm a senior here

2
00:00:03,578 --> 00:00:07,663
at Stanford. And I first got into computer science when I was doing a first

3
00:00:07,663 --> 00:00:12,161
robotics program at my high school. I didn't take any coding classes until I

4
00:00:12,161 --> 00:00:17,239
got to Sanford and I took CS106A, my freshman year, fall quarter. And I loved

5
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:20,777
it, but before that I thought I was interested in math, science, maybe

6
00:00:20,777 --> 00:00:25,108
engineering. And so I took an engineering course in the summer at Cornell

7
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:29,712
University, trying to figure out if that's something I was interested in. And

8
00:00:29,712 --> 00:00:33,060
there I got to tour their HCI lab, which is Human Computer Interaction, and

9
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:38,381
that studies how people interact with technology. And I was really interested

10
00:00:38,381 --> 00:00:42,718
in how to design technology for people. And make it something that was going to

11
00:00:42,718 --> 00:00:46,195
be both effective and really useful for them and that's what really got me

12
00:00:46,195 --> 00:00:51,686
excited about exploring CS. Because computer science is all about designing and

13
00:00:51,686 --> 00:00:55,407
solving problems that are going to be useful for the people that are using

14
00:00:55,407 --> 00:01:00,421
these programs. And so from there I took a lot of really amazing CS classes

15
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:05,525
here. And from there I was sold. And I took the rest of the CS classes and had

16
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:07,550
a really great time with it.
