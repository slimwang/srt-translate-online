Three y plus two divided by y plus eight is correct. Great effort if you got

2
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:10,270
this one correct. Here, the L-C-D is y plus two. These are the only factors that

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:15,243
appear in the denominators inside of our complex fraction. We know we need to

4
00:00:15,243 --> 00:00:20,500
multiply by the L-C-D divided by the L-C-D. So we really just distribute this to

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:27,310
each of our terms and our complex fraction. Next we simplify the common factors

6
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:33,810
from a numerator and denominator. This leaves us with 1 times y plus 2 here, 2y

7
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:38,655
here, 4 times y plus 2 in our denominator, and a negative 3y also in our

8
00:00:38,655 --> 00:00:43,672
denominator. We can clean up this fraction by adding our light terms here to get

9
00:00:43,672 --> 00:00:48,565
3y plus 2. We can also distribute this 4 and our denominator. Giving us 4y plus

10
00:00:48,565 --> 00:00:54,208
8 minus 3y. We add like terms one more time to get our final fraction. You're a

11
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:56,336
pro. Way to go.
