1
00:00:00,085 --> 00:00:01,620
>> We've created our action, but it's not

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,430
going to actually show up on the page yet.

3
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:03,980
>> Got you.

4
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,440
>> So, if we scroll down to the Page

5
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,560
Layout section from the Objects That are Detailed page, this

6
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,330
is exactly the same thing. You know how we

7
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,580
click on the Edit the Page Layout from the record.

8
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,031
>> Mm-hm.

9
00:00:13,031 --> 00:00:14,870
>> This is the other way to get to it, but from the set.

10
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:15,350
>> Edit.

11
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,910
>> So, we click Edit here. So, over here

12
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,933
we have Actions. There, you're way ahead of me, man.

13
00:00:19,933 --> 00:00:20,140
[LAUGH]

14
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,580
>> I'm staying there, I think, figure this out.

15
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,290
>> Yeah.

16
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,470
>> Okay, so, oh, Add a Set Time.

17
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,770
>> So, this Publisher Actions area is where you

18
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,159
want to drag it, so let's put it in there. Oh.

19
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:32,920
>> It doesn't like it.

20
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,470
>> So we have to override the Global Publisher layout

21
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,680
first. There's, right now, you know we saw those actions already.

22
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,011
>> Mm-hm.

23
00:00:39,011 --> 00:00:41,600
>> Those are the, that's the global layout. That's just what everything

24
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,150
automatically has. But if we override that layout, we can add in our

25
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:45,880
own custom actions.

26
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,430
>> All right. Layout overridden. Adding Set Time.

27
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,570
>> And, put it closer to the left, so we see it.

28
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,030
>> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

29
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,640
>> Maybe after Post.

30
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,890
Awesome. So, now that we have that in the layout, let's check it out.

31
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,645
>> So, I'm visiting the Udacity Stage, and it says, Add a Set Time.

32
00:01:07,645 --> 00:01:08,381
>> All right, yep.

33
00:01:08,381 --> 00:01:12,240
>> That's it. Oh, that's cool. Okay, so,

34
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,440
I forget when our festival was, November 29th?

35
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,030
>> Yeah.

36
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,000
>> So, we'll have it set on the 30th. It's New, and

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,630
the time will be, let's make it 7:00, and the band, right?

38
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:23,990
>> Let's pick someone new.

39
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,010
>> Yeah. I've had it with these, these three boring bands.

40
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:31,265
>> What's the word? Try the Main Ten Ants.

41
00:01:31,265 --> 00:01:38,510
>> oh yeah, I love them. Okay, and Create, and it worked. Very cool.

42
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:42,170
>> Awesome, so now, the Set Time record's created, and

43
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,290
people will know, hey, Andy created this at 6:16 p.m.

44
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,070
>> Mm-hm, cool.
