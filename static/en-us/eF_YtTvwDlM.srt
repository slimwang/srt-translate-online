00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,860
These two cute koalas
are a background image inside a div.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,740
And right now,
the background size it set to cover.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,306
I want you to compare the difference
between background size cover and

4
00:00:11,306 --> 00:00:12,705
background size contain.

5
00:00:12,705 --> 00:00:14,918
It might help if you
resize the page a bit,

6
00:00:14,918 --> 00:00:17,392
to figure out the difference
between the two.

7
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:20,304
Once you think you know the difference
between cover and contain,

8
00:00:20,304 --> 00:00:21,930
I have two statements for you.

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,150
The first one says that
the image is sized so

10
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,100
that it is as small as possible while
still completely filling its container.

11
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,370
Is that describing contain or cover?

12
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:31,970
Pick one of the two.

13
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:36,140
And the second statement says, the image
is sized so that it is as large as

14
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,170
possible while still being completely
visible inside its container.

15
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,730
Is this statement describing contain or
cover?

16
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:43,580
Pick one of these two.
