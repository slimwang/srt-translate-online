00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,930
Welcome to the mini project on decision trees.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,820
In this project we'll be tackling the same project that we've done with our

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,240
last two supervised classification algorithms.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,670
We're trying to understand who wrote an email based on the word

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,200
content of that email.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,730
This time we'll be using a decision tree.

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,285
We'll also dig into the features that we use a little bit more.

8
00:00:20,285 --> 00:00:22,790
This'll be a dedicated topic in the latter part of the class.

9
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,720
What features give you the most effective,

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,380
the most accurate supervised classification algorithm?

11
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,020
But you'll get a little sneak piece of this in the second part of the lesson.

12
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:31,830
So get ready to code.
