1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,950
Now, of course, using the scaling process here, we kind of allow the algorithm to make errors

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:11,790
and what I would now like you to think about is what kind of error are we introducing

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,620
by using this scaling method.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 99:59:59,999
So dividing by that quantity here and then rounding down.
