00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,480
One of the best things about doing the critical memory path analysis is you

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,810
can get a pretty good estimate for how long the page will take to render.

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,870
>> Yeah, it's pretty awesome. Once I have

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,770
my critical rendering path diagram I don't even

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,330
have to profile my page. Well, I do

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,860
need to profile my page for other bottlenecks, but

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,610
what I mean is that I can see all the dependencies in my critical rendering path

8
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,620
diagram and get a good idea of how long my page is going to take to render.

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,810
>> Exactly. With a little bit of practice you

10
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,730
can just take a look at the SML and figure out what the critical

11
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,100
rendering path is. And you know what,

12
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,770
that's actually a great exercise. I'm going to

13
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,360
give you a couple of files which you can find in the instructor notes, and

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,450
why don't you analyze those, draw the

15
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,890
diagrams, and come up with the CRP metrics.

16
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,160
>> So should I draw a diagram like the ones we've been seeing in the examples?

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,250
>> Yep, exactly. And don't worry about making it pretty. Use whatever tools

18
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,350
you like. Pen and paper is good, and then post it on the forum.

19
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,540
>> Alright, so I'll make sure I've

20
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,950
got the three critical rendering path metrics too.

21
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,850
The critical path length the number of

22
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,820
critical resources, and the number of critical bytes.

23
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,110
>> Yep. Exactly.

24
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,890
>> Cool, so I'll go ahead and post it on the forums.
