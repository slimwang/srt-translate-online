00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,750
The answer is, it replaces the bottom half with the rotation of the top half.

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,822
This question should have been really hard. You have to think about the order

3
00:00:07,822 --> 00:00:11,835
of the numbering of all of the pixels. And imagine everything that happens in

4
00:00:11,835 --> 00:00:15,838
the right order. You haven't seen a problem like this before. If these were all

5
00:00:15,838 --> 00:00:21,572
the pixels of the image. This one would be 0. This would be 1. This would be

6
00:00:21,572 --> 00:00:26,770
picked up pixels minus 1. And this would be picked up pixels minus 2. Now, in

7
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,670
the first iteration of this loop, we would get color c from the ith pixel,

8
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:36,630
which would be the 0th pixel. Then we would find picked up pixels minus 1 minus

9
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:43,410
i which in this case would be picked up pixels minus 1. Minus zero, so the last

10
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:49,654
pixel, and set its color to the color saved in c. So we just copied the color

11
00:00:49,654 --> 00:00:54,310
from here into here. Now, on the next iteration, we'll get the color from one,

12
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:59,955
right here. Find the pixel at pic.pixels minus 1, minus 1, so right here, and

13
00:00:59,955 --> 00:01:05,038
copy the color into here. It's starting to look like we're just going to rotate

14
00:01:05,038 --> 00:01:10,008
the whole image. But not quite. Imagine that I gets to this second to last

15
00:01:10,008 --> 00:01:14,414
spot. We'll get the color at the second to last spot, and then we'll get the

16
00:01:14,414 --> 00:01:19,347
pixel at the second spot. And we'll copy the color from the second to last spot

17
00:01:19,347 --> 00:01:24,230
back into the second spot. But this is the color the second spot already had.

18
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:28,738
So the first half of the image won't change. Only the second half of the image

19
00:01:28,738 --> 00:01:29,279
will.
