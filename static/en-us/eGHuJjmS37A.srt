1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:04,880
Fact, there are a lot of apps in the Play store.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,270
>> I know and most of them are probably made by really awesome developers.

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,680
>> But it's not enough anymore just to be an awesome developer.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,910
>> Unfortunately, a lot of these apps get really low ratings. And

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,730
low ratings are almost always a sign of bad user experience design.

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:18,380
>> With that in mind.

7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,390
>> Welcome to UX Design For Mobile Developers.

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:27,000
>> This class will teach you, developers how to design amazing apps

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,830
that get five stars.

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,070
>> My name is Nazmul.

11
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,500
>> I am a Developer Advocate at Google and I specialize in Android and

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,900
User Experience Design. Hi and I'm Izabel,

13
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,560
I'm an Android Interaction Designer and Prototyper.

14
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,240
>> Awesome.

15
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,150
>> So Izabel, why are we teaching this class? Well,

16
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,850
currently today the world of design and development are largely siloed.

17
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,950
And this is crazy because we all have the same

18
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,430
goal which is to make amazing applications that our users love.

19
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,640
And the goal of this course is to help bring these

20
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,960
two worlds together and help you become a design minded developer.

21
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,440
>> So you know, to make amazing apps you

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,840
really have to know a little bit of both.

23
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,390
>> As a developer you have to think a little bit like a designer.

24
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,430
>> I actually consider myself to be a design minded developer.

25
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,900
>> So if I were to place myself on a scale of design and

26
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,990
development skills, I would say I'm a ten on develop and maybe like a seven

27
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:19,820
on design.

28
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,070
>> So Izabel, where do you see yourself on this

29
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,710
scale? For designer, I would put myself at a ten.

30
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,740
>> Cool. And for development, since I'm a prototyper

31
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,610
I would put myself at a bout a four.

32
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:29,160
>> Oh nice.

33
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,590
>> So, where do you see yourself on this scale?

34
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,860
>> I want you to really think about this because at the

35
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,210
end of this class we will ask you to take this quiz again.

36
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,210
>> And hopefully you'll have moved way higher on the design scale.
