>> Thanks, Isuke so right now, my wife and I are actually building a house and

2
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,830
as part of that, we need to configure the basement for

3
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,500
the house. I've taken a list of some of the requirements for this basement and

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,920
listed them over here on the left. And on the right, I have the variables that

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,690
we need to assign values to, we have things like the width of the utility

6
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,880
closet, the length of the stairwell, we also had two additional rooms,

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,590
each must have their own length and width. So try to configure our basement,

8
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,790
such that we meet all the different requirements listed over here on the left,

9
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,222
write a number in each of these blanks.
