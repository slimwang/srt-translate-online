Let's do another calculation with the Day object. Astronaut Sally Ride was born

2
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:13,890
on May 26th, 1951. She died on July 23rd, 2012. How many days was she alive?

3
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,840
You should put your answer in this box. You should use BlueJ for this. Open up

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,230
the Days2 project, and here are a couple of hints. You'll want to make

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,235
variables for birthday and lastDay. And then you'll want to call

6
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:32,820
lastDay.daysFrom(birthday) and print the result. Don't worry too much if BlueJ

7
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,290
isn't working for you. Just look around the video, and you'll find a link to

8
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,285
the Udacity Java editor that you can use.
