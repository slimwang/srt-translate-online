00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:01,240
Here is the answer.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,180
In fact, all three options will
reduce the diameter by half.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,060
The longest paths connect the corners.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,870
So, anything that shortcuts
the corners will reduce the diameter.

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,230
Now, the last option is special.

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,520
It turns our 2-D mesh into a 2-D torus.

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,490
Oops.
Wrong torus.
