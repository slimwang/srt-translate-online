00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,820
It's good to not only monitor patients
but to provide them with help

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,170
to manage their health and
diseases more effectively.

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:12,210
This is an area where PHR apps
may have a role in part because

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,440
they have access to information about
the patient that is stored in the PHR.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,840
The American Heart Association's
heart360 is an example that provides

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,720
a suite of capabilities including a
physician dashboard that brings together

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,710
data for all the patients using
the app and who are under their care.
