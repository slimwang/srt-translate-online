1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
In this case since we don't know that there's only three missionaries,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
we need to have both sets of numbers.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We can't just say there's two missionaries on the left;

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
therefore, there's one on the right. We don't know how many are going to be on the right.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So this six-element tuple would do the job where these two wouldn't.
