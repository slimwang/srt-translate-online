1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,640
So you want to help us
through what this could be?

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,120
>> Yeah so I think I know the answer
because I think I know how to get the

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,400
answer because I think it's like other
times we've done this sort of trick.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,470
And the key part is noticing
that we are adding and

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,480
then subtracting off
the things that we just added.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,130
And then adding the thing we just got
and then subtracting that off and so

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,180
every time we go through
a state action reward,

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,970
state action reward, we're going to
end up adding a potential and

9
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,160
then subtracting the same
potential on the next step.

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,790
>> So
here's a useful way to visualize that.

11
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,460
So we're going to go through some
sequence of states, S, S prime,

12
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:39,168
S double prime, S triple prime,S
quadruple prime, and so on.

13
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:44,850
And in this Q version of the Q function,

14
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,980
we're getting the sum of the rewards for
those states.

15
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,300
So we have like a reward
that happens here, and

16
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,160
a reward that happens here and
a reward that happens here, but

17
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,830
these are going to be discounted and
summed up to get our Q.

18
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,430
And now we're wondering well what
happens if we replace this R with this

19
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,093
new R prime.

20
00:01:02,093 --> 00:01:06,798
It still has R in it but now it's
going to have this take away psi,

21
00:01:06,798 --> 00:01:09,390
give me some gamma psi prime.

22
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,170
>> Give me some psi, give me some psi.

23
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:11,950
Yeah exactly.

24
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,260
High, low, on the side.

25
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,430
All right.

26
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,730
So, this first reward in addition to the
R part we're also going to get the minus

27
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:23,350
side and the plus gamma side, so
let's just add that in here for

28
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,250
the transition from S to S prime, but
we'll also have to add it in there for

29
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,970
the transition from S
prime to S double prime.

30
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,330
So, the second reward Is gamma
times whatever that reward is,

31
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:37,610
which is what it used to be,
minus the psi S prime plus the gamma psi

32
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,280
S double prime, and so on for
each of these rewards,

33
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,360
is going to get replaced by what it was
plus the discounted psi minus the psi.

34
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,470
>> Right.
So if we look at that, so good, so

35
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,950
writing that down
confirmed my thought so.

36
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,970
First thing you notice is that things
start cancelling each other out.

37
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,000
>> Right.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,310
So in particular this
gamma psi S prime and

39
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:06,810
this gamma times negative
psi S prime disappear.

40
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,710
>> Right and
then that's going to happen again.

41
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,030
>> It's going to happen
again on the double prime.

42
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,324
Right.
[SOUND] [SOUND] And

43
00:02:11,324 --> 00:02:15,910
the triple prime [SOUND] [SOUND],
and the quadruple prime, [SOUND].

44
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,991
And so forth, and then all we're
going to be left with are the R's

45
00:02:18,991 --> 00:02:21,850
themselves, which we are writing as Q.

46
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,720
And this weird little extra-
psi(s) in the very beginning.

47
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,255
>> Right, so
then I think that we can write

48
00:02:30,255 --> 00:02:34,960
Q'(s,a) = Q(s,a)-Psi(s).

49
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,460
>> Nice.

50
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,190
>> And there's only one little
bit of bookkeeping we have to

51
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,400
argue our way out of.

52
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,740
And that's the fact that we are getting
rid of everything in the middle

53
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,560
except the things at the beginning and

54
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,400
the things at the very end,
the thing at the very, very end.

55
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,390
>> Right, so there's some
kind of gamma to the infinity

56
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,090
psi of S infinity kind
of thing at the end.

57
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:00,660
>> Right.

58
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,070
But, if gamma's less than one,

59
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,470
then something less than one
to the infinity is just 0.

60
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,810
>> Right, as long as our psi guess
is bounded, which we didn't say,

61
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:10,820
but it's true.

62
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,080
>> It better be bounded, so then it's 0,
so we can ignore it [SOUND].

63
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,919
And that's cool,

64
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:18,870
because that's what always happens
whenever you have a telescoping sum.

65
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,700
>> Yes.

66
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,330
Even though this was
an infinite telescoping sum.

67
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,380
Very cool.

68
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,450
Does this make some intuitive
sense at the end of the day?

69
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,850
Are New Q function is just like our
old Q function except it shifted

70
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,560
downward by psi s.

71
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,650
Like this downward kind of
bothers me a little bit.

72
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,290
>> Well, it's bothering me too, but

73
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,620
actually I think it
doesn't bother me now.

74
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:44,550
So what your saying is the true value of
being in a state and taking an action is

75
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:50,360
actually whatever the value is minus
the potential you're going to lose.

76
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,840
Because you need to account for
everything.

77
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,640
You need to account for not just the
reward you get for being in a state and

78
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,150
all the discounted reward you're
going to get thereafter, but for

79
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,160
any potential that you're
going to lose along the way.

80
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,760
So psi is that potential that you're
going to lose by leaving this state.

81
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,720
So Q basically captures what you're
getting for being in a state and

82
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,560
then what you're going to
get from that point on.

83
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,540
Right?
Assuming you behave in a particular way.

84
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,000
Well what's going to
happen from this point on?

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,959
Well you're going to get the reward
that you got in the state, like before.

86
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,940
But then you're going to lose
whatever magic psi we gave you for

87
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,260
entering into the state.

88
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,380
So we have to account for not just
the present, but also the future.

89
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:26,920
>> Right.

90
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,390
>> So the future requires getting rid of
the potential, so I think that's fine.

91
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,950
It kind of makes sense to me,
I kind of wish it weren't that way but

92
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,970
it does makes sense if
the reward is actually,

93
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,510
you're going to get a little
bit of extra bump in bonus.

94
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:47,542
Another way of thinking about
it is you got R' (s,a,s')

95
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:51,960
= R(s,s)- psi(s) + gamma psi(S').

96
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,990
Well if you were to write
down what R'(s,a) was,

97
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:01,480
it would just be R(s,a)- psi(S) if
you were to ignore the S prime part.

98
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,560
because the S prime part only
matters with the discounted future.

99
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,880
So then Q prime is just
the rewards that you would get,

100
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,540
minus the potential that
you're about to lose.

101
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,968
So I think it works out just fine.

102
00:05:10,968 --> 00:05:12,760
It makes
>> I guess so.

103
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,565
I guess I just wondered,
why wouldn't it be plus?

104
00:05:16,565 --> 00:05:21,060
[LAUGH] Why wouldn't it be
the case that the Q value for

105
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,660
being in a state is what it used to be?

106
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,100
But we got this extra bonus for
having gotten to s in the first place.

107
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,690
>> Because we're
going to lose the bonus.

108
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,260
We're going to lose the bonus,
and so we have to pre-lose it?

109
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,530
>> Well I don't think you're
really pre-losing it.

110
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,180
I mean what's really kind of
happening I think is that you've

111
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,430
kind of got a new R of s of a.

112
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,920
And that R is including the psi, and so

113
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,820
you've gotta subtract it off to
get back the original R you had.

114
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,220
>> All right, so let's just,

115
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,280
just to be certain that we're
comfortable with this, maybe we should

116
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,160
do the algebra to make sure that
this all really does balance out.
