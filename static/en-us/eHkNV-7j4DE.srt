1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,860
So for talking about online education,
I can think of few people more

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,740
interesting and qualified to talk
about than Dr. Sebastian Thrun.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,730
So thank you so much for
talking to us for a few minutes today.

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:08,490
>> It's a pleasure.

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,550
>> So the first thing I wanted
to ask is Udacity's mission

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,310
is democratizing education.

7
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,590
For those students that we have that
aren't too familiar with what that

8
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,150
means, can you give a rundown
of what that means in practice?

9
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,470
>> Well, I would say today we live
in a world that good education

10
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,300
is extremely locked up and inaccessible.

11
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,010
It's expensive.

12
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,520
It's hard to get in.

13
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,850
And it's not geographically distributed,

14
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:32,450
which means the institutions aren't
in Africa or places like these.

15
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,570
Democratization means
everybody should have access.

16
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,750
We should have access to clean
drinking water, to security, and

17
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,810
to good education.

18
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,620
I think education is fundamental
in giving people a chance to

19
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,240
play in this world.

20
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,820
>> I think that's very, very relevant
to what we do in the LMS program,

21
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,750
as you know, because it's so low cost,
it's so flexible, so distributed that we

22
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,130
have people, especially people in this
class who could never take a class or

23
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,900
do a program like this, traditionally,
because they can't take a couple years

24
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,240
off work or they can't, pay six
figures just to get a Master's degree.

25
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,709
And one fo the reasons, especially since
this is an educational technology class,

26
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,840
is technology a necessary part of that?

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,960
Does it enable us to do something now
that we couldn't do before or are we

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,010
just the only ones who are finally
coming around and say let's do this?

29
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:14,670
>> Absolutely.

30
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,060
It's a necessary but
not a sufficient component.

31
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,430
I don't think alone will be a education.

32
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,190
But I think we live in a world with
the knowledge that we have now

33
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,768
more better devices.

34
00:01:23,768 --> 00:01:28,190
We have ability to record video, to do
interactive things like video games.

35
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,920
And those ought to play a role.

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,610
We've done this quite a bit and

37
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,780
we're exploring what's the best
way to deliver education.

38
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,800
And to have interaction with
students and foster interactions but

39
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,910
technology plays a huge part in this.

40
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:44,030
>> Is technology mostly about getting
the access to the education, or is

41
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,690
there other things that technology does
for us that we couldn't do in the past?

42
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:51,070
>> Every time you move to a different
medium I think everything changes.

43
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,580
So the way we do lectures today,
a single professor speaking to many,

44
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:59,410
many students Is because the technology
they're using is a natural human voice.

45
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,390
As we change this into a more
recorded technology and

46
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,980
digital technology, we can really
change the entire idea of lectures.

47
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,690
We don't need lectures anymore.

48
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,000
We can do it much more interactive,
it turns out.

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,780
In technology, you can actually make
class as much fun as a video game.

50
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,500
And a video game is clearly
enough to select to us.

51
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,128
A student can do something to
exercise their own skills.

52
00:02:19,128 --> 00:02:22,210
>> I would like to think that that kind
of technology is something what allows

53
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,060
this class to happen.

54
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,890
It allows us to have the kind of
communication between instructors and

55
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,570
TAs and students that we really can't
have in person where everything is very

56
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:32,380
guarded in terms of how much
time you have to give to it.

57
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,810
So we have a lot of
people in the class and

58
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,430
I bet that there are some out there
who are wondering do I want to go into

59
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,190
research or
do I want to go into business?

60
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,910
And the class project we have for this
class is very much built around either

61
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,800
doing something that could become
a research project or doing something

62
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,770
that could become a start up or
a tool that we use in the program.

63
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,210
You're one of the only people I
know that succeeded in both realms.

64
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,020
So do you have any thoughts for
anyone who might be struggling with

65
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,180
whether they want to go the research
route or the business route?

66
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,150
>> I wouldn't struggle about
research versus business.

67
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,170
I think it's kind of very much the same,
to be honest.

68
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,410
I would struggle about impact and about
willingness to experiment and to learn.

69
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,360
I think so
much has not been discovered yet.

70
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,240
I think we would look back
a hundred years from now and

71
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,270
ask what did we [INAUDIBLE] at the time,

72
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,560
we probably concluded was probably
gutsy to do what we're doing.

73
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,260
But it wasn't that good.

74
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,740
It think it's going to get much better.

75
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,700
And it's going to get much better by you
students doing great experiments and

76
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,740
trying things out even
non-conventional things.

77
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,540
And if you're able to make a dent
in people's ability to learn using

78
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,370
digital technology, and do it in
a way that it's, financially viable.

79
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,810
Doesn't require having a thousand
professors sit there and

80
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,590
watch your hand.

81
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:37,140
Then you might turn to research paper or
you might also turn to start up company.

82
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,490
Or you might join Udacity and work with
us to make the world a better place.

83
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,900
>> Sounds fantastic to me.

84
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,880
That's really guiding principle
behind why we started this class.

85
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,560
So, do you have any final thoughts for

86
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,449
students taking a masters level
educational technology class?

87
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,690
>> I think the key thing
is really experimentation.

88
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,320
I have this very deep belief in my heart
that we can make the world a better

89
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,150
place by democratizing education and
that with fire-stick technology.

90
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,220
Otherwise we couldn't afford doing it.

91
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,250
And what you can do as students,
the students in your class can do,

92
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,610
is to really kind of do crazy things.

93
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,220
Do something that looks
like it's going to fail.

94
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,330
Do something that's audacious.

95
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,550
Do something that is really out of
the world no one has tried before.

96
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,290
Go to Twitter, go to Facebook.

97
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,680
Make something crazy happen.

98
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,399
And make it happen in
a short amount of time so

99
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,130
you don't waste too
much of your own time.

100
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,980
And look at the data coming back.

101
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,060
I think there is a lot
of surprises in there.

102
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,250
You can discover a lot of good stuff.

103
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,130
And when you find something great come
back to us and send us the application.

104
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,510
We'd love to hire you.

105
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,000
>> Sounds great.
Well thank you again so much for

106
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,880
talking with us and yeah, thank you.

107
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,380
>> Pleasure.
