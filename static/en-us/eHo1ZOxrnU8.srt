00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,097
We know the boat travels upstream for 6 miles so here this is 6. The boat is

2
00:00:05,097 --> 00:00:08,330
going to travel the same distance to return back from where it started, so we

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:13,908
know the downstream distance must also equal 6. We know the boat travels 12

4
00:00:13,908 --> 00:00:17,762
miles per hour in still water. So that means with the current, we would add x

5
00:00:17,762 --> 00:00:22,585
going downstream and that means going against the current. We would subtract x,

6
00:00:22,585 --> 00:00:27,142
that would be moving upstream. The key idea is that for the boat's rate, we let

7
00:00:27,142 --> 00:00:32,164
the speed of the current equal x. So the boat would be traveling faster going

8
00:00:32,164 --> 00:00:36,210
downstream, and slower going upstream. And finally, for our time column, we

9
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,513
know that we just need to take the distance, and divide it by the rate. So,

10
00:00:40,513 --> 00:00:45,850
going upstream, the boat would take 6 divided by 12 minus x hours. And going

11
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:51,475
downstream, the boat would take 6 divided by 12 plus x hours. Fantastic work if

12
00:00:51,475 --> 00:00:54,960
you've done all these expressions, this is pretty tricky.
