00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here's one way to define it.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,754
We'll call the inputs a and b,

3
00:00:04,754 --> 00:00:08,000
and all we need to do is produce a string concatenating them all.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,769
We can do that with one return statement.

5
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:15,000
We're going to put a + b + b + a as the result.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,738
Now let's check that it works, passing in a and b.

7
00:00:20,738 --> 00:00:23,000
We run, and we get the result 'abba'.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We can try the other example, passing in 'dog' and 'cat'.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and now we get 'dogcatcatdog'.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So far all of the procedures we've defined have been pretty simple.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,500
They've only required 1 line, maybe 2 lines of code.

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,000
For the final quiz of this section, we're going to ask a much more challenging question.
