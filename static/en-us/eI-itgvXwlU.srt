00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,180
The key to finishing this equation is that it takes Javier one hour longer than

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:10,630
Lucy. So let's let Lucy's time equal t. We'll use that for our first fraction.

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:15,459
This fraction would represent one job completed in t hours. This means that

4
00:00:15,459 --> 00:00:21,657
Javier can do the same job in t plus 1 hours. So his fraction would be one job

5
00:00:21,657 --> 00:00:28,449
divided by t plus 1 hours. His time is simply 1 hour more than Lucy's. So t

6
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:30,103
plus 1.
