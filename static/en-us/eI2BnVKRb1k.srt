1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,500
So let's see if we understood
how DRAM is built.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,640
So what is the reason for
not using a normal transistor and

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,620
a real capacitor when making DRAM?

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,860
Is it because trench cell is easier
to make than a normal capacitor and

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,260
transistor?

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,800
Is it because the trench
cell is more reliable?

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,260
Or is it because the trench cell
lets us make cheaper DRAM chips?
