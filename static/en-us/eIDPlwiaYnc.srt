taking precious resources, for example, CPU cycles

00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,430
or available physical memory, away from an application?

00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:20,916
And I'm giving you three choices here. Yes it is, taking resources away.

00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:25,720
No it's not. Maybe. So these are the three choices I'm giving you, and I want

00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,900
you think about what would be the right choice, and

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,550
I think you will know what the right choice is.
