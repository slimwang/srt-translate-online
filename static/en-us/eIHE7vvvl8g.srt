1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,500
Alright, here I am in
the downloads section.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,880
So I'll click on this madlibs_generator
link, which will open up a new tab and

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:12,320
I'll highlight all this text right here,
by scrolling or I can also do command a.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,760
Now I'll open up Sublime or
your text editor that you choose.

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,062
Now I'll paste it all in by doing
command v, or I can also right click and

6
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:21,798
hit paste.

7
00:00:21,798 --> 00:00:25,607
Now you can see all this raw
text in the Sublime window.

8
00:00:25,607 --> 00:00:29,812
And so what I want to do is
I want to save this now so

9
00:00:29,812 --> 00:00:34,560
I'll go to file, save,
I'll type in madlibs.py.

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,032
All right, so now I'm going to
save this on the desk top, and

11
00:00:37,032 --> 00:00:38,876
it's important to use
this .py extension,

12
00:00:38,876 --> 00:00:42,295
because it tells the computer that this
is a python file that we want to run.

13
00:00:42,295 --> 00:00:42,855
Okay.
So

14
00:00:42,855 --> 00:00:45,435
I'll save this onto
the desktop by clicking save.

15
00:00:45,435 --> 00:00:47,505
And now all this highlighting comes up,
so

16
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,375
we know this file is
saved as a Python file.

17
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:52,547
So now that we have our Python
file saved on our desktop,

18
00:00:52,547 --> 00:00:53,887
let's run it locally.

19
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:57,087
To do that, I’m going to open up my
terminal which I’ll do by going to,

20
00:00:57,087 --> 00:00:59,237
click on the terminal.

21
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:02,817
Since my madlibs file is on my desktop,

22
00:01:02,817 --> 00:01:06,910
I’m just going to type in
cd Desktop to find it.

23
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,500
Now that I'm in my desktop,
I'll type LS,

24
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,300
which means list all the current files
inside this folder, which is desktop.

25
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,810
And there we have our mad_libs.py file,
so

26
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:20,240
to run it, all I have to do is type
Python and the name of the file.

27
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,860
So I'll do python mad_libs.py,
there we go.

28
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,480
We now have our mad libs generator
running on our local machine.

29
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,760
So let me play a quick round so,
an adjective, let's try blue.

30
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:38,138
Run, occupation, let's do teacher,
verb skateboard.

31
00:01:38,138 --> 00:01:43,833
Place, San Francisco.

32
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:45,505
There we go, what a blue day.

33
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,078
I can run the day off
from being a teacher, and

34
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:48,250
go skateboard in San Francisco.
