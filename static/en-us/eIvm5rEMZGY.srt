1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,110
So after having looped through,

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:07,010
after having iterated through the entire
dataset, millions and millions of tags.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:07,700
Okay?

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,560
Then what I'm going to do is print out
the data that I found for my audit.

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,480
Okay?
So it actually takes a little while for

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,415
that to run.

7
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,085
So I've run it already.

8
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:17,675
Okay.

9
00:00:17,675 --> 00:00:19,505
And here's what the output looks like.

10
00:00:19,505 --> 00:00:24,365
Okay so there actually aren't
really that many unusual values.

11
00:00:24,365 --> 00:00:26,219
What I find is, so
in the United States, and

12
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:29,279
this is going to vary from one country
to another, in the United States,

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,755
we number certain types of roads.

14
00:00:30,755 --> 00:00:32,555
So this would be a US highway.

15
00:00:32,555 --> 00:00:33,879
United States highway.

16
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:37,210
Same thing with 53, 59,
and so on, all right?

17
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,840
So that's why I'm seeing these as keys,
all right?

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,350
Now this is odd.

19
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,750
My guess is, these look like zip codes
to me, or postal codes, all right?

20
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,570
Another road number.

21
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,440
And then I'm seeing
different forms of avenue.

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,950
And as I move through this,
here's a good example of a set for

23
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,220
this particular key value here for
court.

24
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,680
Okay, so these are all of the different
uses of CT as an abbreviation for

25
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,910
court in this particular dataset.

26
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,290
Okay, and

27
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:10,480
as I scroll through this, I see
the rest of the unusual street types.

28
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,410
Okay, now what I have to decide,
and basically this

29
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,580
is the process that you're going to
follow through the next few exercises,

30
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,520
is, which of these are okay and which of
them do I need to do something about?

31
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,730
South Avenue L,

32
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:25,960
that's actually a correct way of
representing a street name, there's

33
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,870
nothing wrong with that it's just
that it wasn't expected in my audit.

34
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:30,600
It's okay though,

35
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,660
I would probably not want to do anything
to change how this is represented.

36
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:40,550
On the other hand, I don't really
like all caps abbreviations.

37
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,760
So I would probably transform
all of the abbreviations

38
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,786
into the specific word
that that represents.

39
00:01:47,786 --> 00:01:53,015
So, for example,
PKWY is an abbreviation for

40
00:01:53,015 --> 00:01:57,055
Parkway okay, so
that's what I would probably use there.

41
00:01:57,055 --> 00:02:02,612
All right and the same with other
abbreviations that we find here, street,

42
00:02:02,612 --> 00:02:04,032
terrace, and so on.

43
00:02:04,032 --> 00:02:06,822
Okay, so your general process for

44
00:02:06,822 --> 00:02:12,002
the exercises that follow is going to be
to write some code, to audit the data,

45
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:16,752
and then decide what type of fixes
you want to apply to that data.

46
00:02:16,752 --> 00:02:19,382
And then write the code that
actually performs the fix.
