>> Thanks, Chris, for telling us all about how to solve absolute value

2
00:00:03,548 --> 00:00:07,482
equations. >> For the first practice problem I want you to try, we're going to

3
00:00:07,482 --> 00:00:11,384
have the absolute value of 2x minus 5 equals 3. >> You can put your two answers

4
00:00:11,384 --> 00:00:15,433
in these two boxes, because we know absolute value equations have two answers.
