00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,880
The sample size in each group is 3, and we'll multiply this by the group mean

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,605
in food A, minus the grand mean squared, plus the group mean for food B, minus

3
00:00:09,605 --> 00:00:14,180
the grand mean squared, plus the group mean for food C minus the grand mean

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:26,820
squared. This gives us 3 times 9 plus 0 plus 9, which is 54.
