00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,852
We want to end up with an equation for the total weight of the suitcase. And we

2
00:00:03,864 --> 00:00:07,679
know that, that is y. So, I'll start by writing y equals something, something

3
00:00:07,691 --> 00:00:11,585
that we need to figure out. Well, the total weight needs to equal the weight of

4
00:00:11,597 --> 00:00:15,391
the suitcase itself, and then also the weight of the glasses wipers that Grant

5
00:00:15,403 --> 00:00:19,135
puts in it. However, we know that the weight of the empty suitcase is just 7

6
00:00:19,147 --> 00:00:24,206
pounds. So, we can just substitute in 7 in that slot in the equation. The total

7
00:00:24,218 --> 00:00:28,891
weight of all the wiper sets will just be equal to the weight of one wiper set,

8
00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:33,672
which is 0.5 pounds, times the number of wiper sets packed, which is x. So, we

9
00:00:33,684 --> 00:00:38,666
can substitute that into our equation as well. And in the end, we have y equals

10
00:00:38,678 --> 00:00:39,380
7 plus 0.5 x.
