My answer would be data lockers.

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:08,060
Centralize the data, but allow each
provider to control their own data and

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,030
decide what queries they
will respond to and

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,010
even possibly review their
results before releasing them.
