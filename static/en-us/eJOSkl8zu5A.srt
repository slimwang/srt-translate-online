00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,858
So we can also talk about near, total unconsciousness, coma for instance. In

2
00:00:05,858 --> 00:00:10,594
fact, a coma is brain activity so you're not dead.but its just one step up from

3
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:17,376
being dead. For instance, my brother back in the 90s was involved in a very

4
00:00:17,376 --> 00:00:22,617
serious accident. He was riding his bike home from work. And the woman who was

5
00:00:22,617 --> 00:00:26,033
driving the car turned right into him, didn't see him, and he hit the

6
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:33,375
windshield. He went into a serious coma, very deep coma, for two weeks. And

7
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:37,297
then for about six months, he was vegetative. His eyes were open but he was

8
00:00:37,297 --> 00:00:42,734
still really quite non-responsive. So during this time, he went from near death

9
00:00:42,734 --> 00:00:48,285
to a very gradual awakening in consciousness. In fact, I kept wondering what

10
00:00:48,285 --> 00:00:53,025
was he aware of? Was he aware of anything? Could he hear us? Could he think?

11
00:00:53,025 --> 00:00:56,140
Could he remember? We just didn't know.
