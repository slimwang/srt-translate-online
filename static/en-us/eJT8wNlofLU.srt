1
00:00:00,137 --> 00:00:03,637
Assume this application is strongly memory bandwidth bound,

2
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:08,712
whereas memory bandwidth is the performance bottleneck for this problem.

3
00:00:08,712 --> 00:00:16,353
If we run the same application on a different GPU with half as many SMs,

4
00:00:16,353 --> 00:00:20,630
which curve best represents the performance that you might see?
