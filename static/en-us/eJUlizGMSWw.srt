1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,780
In order to think about starting to
understand color in a standard way,

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,060
experiments were done and

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,250
they started quite a long time ago,
where you'd do the following, right?

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,840
You would, you would make some
light coming into the observer, and

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,625
that would be some light
along that spectrum.

6
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:19,000
So, the red, the green, the blue, etc.,
you'd have some pure spectral light.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,140
All right.

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,350
And the observers job and here the
observers one great big eyeball which is

9
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,820
kind of creepy, but
there's actually a person sitting there,

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,840
would be to just adjust the amount
of red, green and blue light.

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,440
And they were given a particular
type of red, green, and blue,

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,930
particular wavelength of light, and they
could put more or less of it, of each of

13
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,970
them to try to get it to match the test
light that was being produced.

14
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,570
And most of the spectral
colors could be done this way.

15
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,980
You could just add a certain amount of,
of that light.

16
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:57,010
But, it turned out that some of
the colors couldn't be matched,

17
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:03,730
unless you actually added, a little bit
of red to the original test light, okay.

18
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,250
That is, in some sense, in the mixture,
you had to sort of like have negative

19
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,083
red light and of course we
couldn't make negative red light.

20
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:14,092
So what you would do is you would
sort of add some positive red light to

21
00:01:14,092 --> 00:01:14,958
the testing.

22
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:18,706
So that's the first thing to
realize is that certain color,

23
00:01:18,706 --> 00:01:21,870
certain wavelengths in the spectrum.

24
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:26,330
You would look at it and, you know,
for those particular three lights they

25
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:31,640
gave you, there was no blending of them
at all that would equal this color.

26
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,990
And the way that gets expressed
is the following, right?

27
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,790
So here you were giving
a certain type of blue, green,

28
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,630
and red light and then depending upon
where you are in the wavelength, where

29
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:48,460
you are in the spectrum, depending upon
what single light I put out, all right?

30
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,950
You would have, this is how much red,
green, and blue you would need to add,

31
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,520
and you'll notice this
area here is the negative.

32
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,930
These were the colors, okay?

33
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:00,050
These were the spectra that for
those particular red, green, and

34
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,820
blue lights that they gave you,
you couldn't make them match.

35
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,780
So they represent that as
being sort of negative red.
