00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,910
Let's suppose that when I list the current directory,

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,090
I see the following - a directory dir, owned

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,590
by me with these permissions and a file foo.txt

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,010
owned by some other user with these permissions. And

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,120
if I look inside this dir. director, I see

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,030
that there's a file bar, owned by me, and

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,040
having these permissions. Notice that I used the super

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,270
user privileges to list the files in this directory.

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,570
Access to this metadata requires passing through the

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,840
directory in a way that is only allowed if

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,509
we have execute permissions on. So my question to

12
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:34,800
you is, which of the follwing Unix commands will

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,250
result in a permissions error. Cat I should

14
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,640
say is just reading the file and printing it

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,000
to a standard app. And touch is trying to

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,720
create a new, empty file. Check all that apply.
