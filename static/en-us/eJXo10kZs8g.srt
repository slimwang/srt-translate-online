00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,521
a times the nth root of b is written in simplest radical form, as long as b

2
00:00:04,533 --> 00:00:09,381
doesn't have any factors that can be written as powers greater than or equal to

3
00:00:09,393 --> 00:00:14,065
n, the number that tells us what kind of root this is. The reason for this is,

4
00:00:14,171 --> 00:00:19,234
if we have something like the 4th root of 7 to the 6 power, we can rewrite that

5
00:00:19,246 --> 00:00:24,248
as the 4th root of 7 to the 4th times 7 to the 2nd. This first factor will just

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:29,361
reduce as a result of the radical to be 7 on its own, and all that will be left

7
00:00:29,373 --> 00:00:34,597
under the radical sign, or rather the 4th root sign will be 7 squared. And of

8
00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:38,598
course, we can also rewrite this as 7 times the 4th root of 49.
