00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,660
Okay. So here's my implementation of the function. It's

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,080
pretty simple. We just return, you know, we take s

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,630
and we include it in a string with a

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,030
comma, with the hash version of s using our hash_str

5
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:16,429
function. So you know, %s,%s and we include s and the function

6
00:00:16,429 --> 00:00:21,910
hash_str(s). And here we go. And, and our output is the string cool and then.

7
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:26,500
And then the hash alright pretty neat. Let's make this a

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,620
little bit more complex.
