00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,120
The answer is, that we start off knowing

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,880
nothing. So we're in this belief state here, where

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,590
any of the eight possible states are possibilities.

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,490
Then, our path to the goal is to move

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,670
right, and we arrive in this belief state,

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,730
and then suck up the dirt there. Then move

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:26,600
left and then suck up the dirt there. And we end up in a belief state with only

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,640
a single world state and that's one that reaches the goal. Where we're on the

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,330
left and both squares are clean. And yes, that is guaranteed to reach the goal.
