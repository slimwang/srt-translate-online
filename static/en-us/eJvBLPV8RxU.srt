00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,828
Thinking about the numbers we have in our lovely chart over here. And about

2
00:00:03,828 --> 00:00:09,515
what kind of functions p and q are, linear ones. What kind of curve do you

3
00:00:09,515 --> 00:00:14,680
think pq of x is? Is it a vertical line, a horizontal line, a straight line

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,979
with a nonzero slope, a parabola or a cubic curve?
