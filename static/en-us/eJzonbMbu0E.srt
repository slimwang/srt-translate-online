1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
All of these strategies come from a chapter named "The Devil's Guide To Debugging,"

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
which was written by a guy named Steve McConnell.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The book is being called Code Complete in 1993 and it encompass all the wisdom

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
about programming that Steve McConnell had at that time.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What we've seen so far is just three of these rules.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The first one is to scatter output statements everywhere in the code.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Output whatever you want, where you want it, just put it in there such that

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
you will always be able to figure out what was going on or not.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The second one is to debug the program into existence.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Just keep on adding statements and removing statements until it works.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Never ever backup earlier versions of your code.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I mean who can't remember what he or she has done just 7 minutes ago.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Rule number 4, don't bother understanding what the program should do.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I mean, it's obvious isn't it. If it's not obvious, make it obvious.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
My all time favorite though is number 5, use the most obvious fix.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That means fix the symptom instead of the problem.
