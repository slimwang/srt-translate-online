00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,016
So now that we've talked about integers
quite a bit, let's talk about which

2
00:00:04,016 --> 00:00:08,924
numbers actually are integers. We already
know a bunch of examples of integers since

3
00:00:08,924 --> 00:00:13,471
we know that all whole numbers and
therefore all natural numbers are

4
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:19,605
integers. So any number that we could get
to by starting at 0 and counting up by 1s

5
00:00:19,617 --> 00:00:24,977
is an integer. These numbers however are
just the positive integers plus 0 of

6
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:30,695
course. But there are also a ton of other
numbers that are integers and these are

7
00:00:30,707 --> 00:00:36,313
the negative integers. The negative
integers are just negative versions of all

8
00:00:36,325 --> 00:00:42,081
of the positive integers. So, since 3 is
an integer, negative 3 is also an integer.

9
00:00:42,197 --> 00:00:48,156
The integers are all numbers from negative
infinity, to positive infinity that can be

10
00:00:48,168 --> 00:00:51,107
written without any fractions or decimals.
