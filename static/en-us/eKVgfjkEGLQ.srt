Congratulations to solving the first challenge. That's really, really great. Now

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:06,430
it's going to get a little bit more difficult. This time

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,960
we're going to introduce noise in your measurements, which means you

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,830
can't really see the X Y coordinates exactly anymore. You see

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,200
them approximately. Now this is a challenging problem, and the reason

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,090
is, everything in class that we've talked about so far was

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,360
linear, but here the motion model is non linear. So when

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,400
you apply a thing like a common filter or a particle

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,700
filter, you will be in for a surprise. So give it a try. It

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,910
might take longer than you think, but I hope you can solve this challenge.
