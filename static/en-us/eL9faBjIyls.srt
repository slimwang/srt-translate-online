1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,671
The midpoint between 3,15 and 10, negative 2 is the point 6.5, 6.5. Of course,

2
00:00:04,775 --> 00:00:09,342
you could write this as a fraction instead of a decimal too, if you wanted to.

3
00:00:09,446 --> 00:00:14,180
But how do we get that? Well, in order to get halfway from here to here, we know

4
00:00:14,192 --> 00:00:18,780
that we need to go half as far both horizontally and vertically. Let's once

5
00:00:18,792 --> 00:00:23,715
again start with the horizontal distance, or the distance in x. Our x

6
00:00:23,727 --> 00:00:29,020
coordinates or our given points are 3 and 10. So halfway between 3 and 10 is

7
00:00:29,032 --> 00:00:34,215
what? Well, the distance from 3 to 10 is just 10 minus 3. So that means that

8
00:00:34,227 --> 00:00:39,566
halfway between 10 and 3 is just 10 minus 3 over 2. And simplifying that gives

9
00:00:39,578 --> 00:00:44,652
us 7 halfs, or 3 and a half. This, however, is not our coordinate. This is just

10
00:00:44,664 --> 00:00:49,613
the distance that we need to move from one point toward the other point. So to

11
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:54,815
figure out our actual coordinate, we need to start at one of our points and walk

12
00:00:54,827 --> 00:01:00,328
toward the other point this far. So our x coordinate is just equal to 3 plus 7

13
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:05,642
halves, which is just 13 over 2, or 6.5. Let's do the same thing for the y

14
00:01:05,654 --> 00:01:11,379
coordinate. Our y coordinates are 15 and negative 2. If we use our handy dandy

15
00:01:11,391 --> 00:01:16,892
grid here to count how far this distance actually is, we can see that it is 2,

16
00:01:17,012 --> 00:01:23,495
4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, plus 1 more to be even with this point, 17. So we each

17
00:01:23,507 --> 00:01:29,010
move 17 boxes vertically to get from negative 2 to 15. Half of that is just 17

18
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:34,365
over 2 or 8 and a half. But again, this is not actually our Y coordinate. This

19
00:01:34,377 --> 00:01:39,859
is just the distance vertically between these 2 points. To find the coordinate,

20
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:44,828
we need to start at one of these points, and then move this vertical distance

21
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,780
toward the other. So if we start at 15, we need to move down 8 and a half, since

22
00:01:49,792 --> 00:01:54,515
negative 2 is below 15. And this gives us a y coordinate of 13 over 2. Let's

23
00:01:54,527 --> 00:01:59,225
graph this point just as a sanity check. 6 point 5 6 point 5 should be right

24
00:01:59,237 --> 00:02:03,890
about here. And if we draw a line from our first point to our second point, we

25
00:02:03,902 --> 00:02:08,280
see that this point does in fact lie on the line, and looks half way between

26
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:08,565
them.
