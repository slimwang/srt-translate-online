00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,019
We've just completed the lesson
randomized design experiments.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:05,689
Let's review what we've
covered in this lesson.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,410
First, we provided an overview
of randomized design.

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,490
Second, we discussed
the selection of variables for

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,049
the experiment, and then we covered
the design and setup of the experiment.

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,030
Using the data that was gathered in
the experiment, we prepared the data for

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,030
analysis, and
then performed the analysis.

8
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,100
And lastly, we discussed
the meaning of the analysis, and

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,994
created a sample presentation for
communicating the results.

10
00:00:34,185 --> 00:00:37,505
Even though this was a shorter lesson,
we covered a lot.

11
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:40,025
You're now able to set up
randomized experiments, and

12
00:00:40,025 --> 00:00:42,125
analyze the results to
determine business impact.

13
00:00:43,195 --> 00:00:46,095
We're now ready to move on to
matched pair design experiments.
