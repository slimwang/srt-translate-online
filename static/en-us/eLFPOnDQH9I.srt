1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
I've mentioned before, there are two ways

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,170
to add constraints to our Record button.

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,470
This is just another way to show you how

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,750
to accomplish the same AutoLayout task.

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,550
And you're not required to do this step.

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,769
First I’m going to delete the two

7
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:15,630
constraints on our button by selecting

8
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,770
them and pressing the Delete key.

9
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,240
Then with the Record button selected in the

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,390
document outline, I’m going to hold down

11
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,460
the control key and click drag to the View.

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,830
so I click and I'm holding down the

13
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,990
control key and I can drag my mouse

14
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,300
around and I want to drag from the

15
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,880
Record button to the View and then

16
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,420
let go.

17
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,850
This shows me a dialogue that allows me

18
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,559
to select for different options for

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,350
setting constraints. If I hold down the

20
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,420
shift key I can select multiple of these options.

21
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,790
So I'll hold down shift and I’m

22
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:50,879
going to select Center Horizontally in Container

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,520
and Center Vertically in Container.

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,390
And then we'll Add Constraints.

25
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,930
This adds the exact same constraints we

26
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,800
did earlier with the align button. Now I

27
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,939
know this may seem like a bit of work to

28
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,189
just start understanding AutoLayout and

29
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:09,689
to get our button to be in the center of

30
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:11,909
the screen. But as the saying goes, you

31
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:13,409
have to learn to crawl before you can walk.

32
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,200
Next we're going to wire up the

33
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,670
button to our code in the

34
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,619
ViewController.swift file and make the

35
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:26,270
Record button actually do something.
