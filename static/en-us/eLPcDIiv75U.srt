00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,200
For show restaurants,

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,040
I'm only going to differentiate
whether a user is logged in or

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,990
not logged in, since the only option on
this page is to create a new restaurant.

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,940
So, using the same logic to see if
there is a username value inside

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,950
the login session,
I'll render one template or the other.

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,590
For the show menu item,
it's a little bit more complex,

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,070
since now I need to protect each menu,
based on whoever created it.

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,920
So if the user isn't logged in, or

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,800
isn't the original creator,
let's render the public menu.

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,920
Otherwise they are logged in and
are the creator.

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,090
So we can go ahead and
render the original menu.html.

12
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:33,020
I also added alert messages to
protect my create, edit and

13
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,580
delete functions, just in case the user
tries to visit a url that they

14
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,140
aren't authorized to access.

15
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,360
All of my code additions can be
found in the instructor notes.
