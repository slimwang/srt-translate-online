00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,860
Okay, let's do step two now, which is to

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,010
rename files. Now, I provided the link to the

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:10,750
documentation for the module OS in the instructor notes.

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,500
I want you to scan that documentation and find

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,960
out which function we can use to rename files.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,130
By the way, this sort of a search is

7
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,860
done quite commonly by Software Engineers. Once you've found

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,560
that function Enter the name of that function in

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,320
the box provided.
