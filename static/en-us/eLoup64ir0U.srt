1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,140
Now it's time to start working on
the Conference Central application.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:07,150
Hopefully you've already cloned or
downloaded the code from our repository

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,250
but if not just follow the link in
the instructor notes and do so now.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,455
We provide starting code for
each lesson.

5
00:00:13,455 --> 00:00:15,575
You can start with the code for
this lesson and

6
00:00:15,575 --> 00:00:19,155
keep working on it throughout the
course, or, at any point, if you need,

7
00:00:19,155 --> 00:00:21,765
you can download the starting code for
the lesson that you're in.

8
00:00:21,765 --> 00:00:23,015
You might want to do that, for example,

9
00:00:23,015 --> 00:00:26,427
if you don't finish all the coding
exercises for a previous lesson.

10
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:30,325
As you can see the project layout is
similar to the hello endpoints project.

11
00:00:30,325 --> 00:00:31,817
There are some more static files for

12
00:00:31,817 --> 00:00:35,272
the front end however and the backend
is split up into several files.

13
00:00:35,272 --> 00:00:39,153
Settings.py for the project specific
configuration to web client idea.

14
00:00:39,153 --> 00:00:44,248
Models.py for the ndb model, and
protorpc message definitions.

15
00:00:44,248 --> 00:00:48,415
Conference.py for the main application
logic, and app.yaml provides

16
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:52,057
the application settings,
same as in the hello endpoints app.
