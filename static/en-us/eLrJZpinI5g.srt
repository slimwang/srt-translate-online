00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,602
If you browse the kthread.H header file,

2
00:00:03,602 --> 00:00:09,022
you will see in line 66 that there is a structure ktread_worker.

3
00:00:09,022 --> 00:00:13,100
This data structure, as well as the various functions that are defined in

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:18,460
this file, provide a simple interface for creating and stopping kernel threads.

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,980
You can see that within the kthread_worker data structure,

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,740
there are four members.

7
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,630
The stem lock data structure is definitely not the one that's used to describe

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,930
a process, nor is the list head that points to a list of kthread_workers.

9
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:37,330
If you click on the next one, task_struct, you will see that

10
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:42,140
it's a holding place for tons of important information regarding a process.

11
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,979
So our answer now is at task_struct.
