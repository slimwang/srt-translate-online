00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,052
>> So with this distribution do you think the first quartile will be here at

2
00:00:05,052 --> 00:00:10,409
25000? Or will it be to the left or to the right? This might be a kind of tough

3
00:00:10,409 --> 00:00:15,793
question. But try your best. And keep in mind that we're trying to divide the

4
00:00:15,793 --> 00:00:21,337
data into four equal groups.And the first quartile divdes the first group from

5
00:00:21,337 --> 00:00:22,581
the other three.
