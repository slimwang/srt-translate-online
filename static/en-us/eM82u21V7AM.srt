00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,719
Now I want you to calculate some
metrics you're interested in for

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:03,870
both groups of students.

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,210
Students who pass the subway project and
students who don't.

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,450
For example, a good starting point would
be the three that we looked at earlier.

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,310
The number of minutes students spend
in the classroom, the number of lessons

6
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:17,090
they complete, and the number of
days that they visit the classroom.

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,790
Try to think of some other things
to look at as well, though.

8
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,660
You might look at whether these students
are more likely to go on to complete

9
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,370
other projects.

10
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,865
Or you might try looking at some
of the more granular data in

11
00:00:26,865 --> 00:00:30,170
daily_engagement_full.csv, and see if
there's anything you can do with that.

12
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,259
Be creative here.

13
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,450
There's a lot available in this
data that you could explore.

14
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,080
Do the results surprise you?

15
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,430
Do you notice anything
interesting about them?

16
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,800
Choose the metric where you think the
difference is the most interesting, and

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,250
share what you found on the forums.

18
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,515
Also select which metric you shared here
and enter the mean for students who pass

19
00:00:49,515 --> 00:00:52,075
in this box and the mean for
students who don't pass in this box.

20
00:00:53,175 --> 00:00:55,445
If your most interesting
finding was non-numerical,

21
00:00:55,445 --> 00:00:57,645
you can leave these boxes blank.

22
00:00:57,645 --> 00:01:00,612
I'm hoping you came up with your own
idea for something to explore and

23
00:01:00,612 --> 00:01:04,501
that you'll check the other box, but you
might also want to enter your value for

24
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:08,112
say minutes spent to check that
your code is working correctly.

25
00:01:08,112 --> 00:01:10,632
Also check this box once
you've posted on the forums.
