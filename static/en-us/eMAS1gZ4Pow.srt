1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,170
So as I said earlier, what we're dealing with here is two equations this one and

2
00:00:05,182 --> 00:00:10,121
this one that have one common term which is money spent. We just said that we

3
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:14,972
can substitute money spent with money spent each month times the number of

4
00:00:14,984 --> 00:00:20,010
months whenever we want to. So that means that this quantity down here On the

5
00:00:20,022 --> 00:00:24,719
right side of the second equation, can be moved up into this slot in the first

6
00:00:24,731 --> 00:00:29,675
equation. Having done that substitution now, we can see that the amount of money

7
00:00:29,687 --> 00:00:34,291
that Grant has left is equal to the money from the founders - the money spent

8
00:00:34,303 --> 00:00:39,025
each month * the number of months. If we look down at our answer choices, that

9
00:00:39,037 --> 00:00:42,945
is The third choice, so great job on this quiz whether you got it right or you

10
00:00:42,957 --> 00:00:46,855
didn't. Like I said earlier, I know that this is a lot of writing to look at on

11
00:00:46,867 --> 00:00:50,640
the screen at one time, we're actually going to address that problem in just a

12
00:00:50,652 --> 00:00:50,995
second.
