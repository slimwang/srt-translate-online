1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,230
Alright so, now that we have a handle on what it means

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:06,110
to compute a best response against some finite state strategy. Let's actually

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,100
take a look at these. So, so this is a quiz. Imagine

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,310
that we have a gamma that is large, so greater than a six.

5
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,163
>> Mm-hm.

6
00:00:13,163 --> 00:00:14,900
>> What is the best response to each of these

7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,795
strategies? So this will be a quiz, but let me just

8
00:00:17,795 --> 00:00:19,470
make it clear what the, the goal of the quiz

9
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:25,150
is. So, if you're, if you are playing against, always cooperate.

10
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,490
Which of these is the best response to it, which of these is

11
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,130
going to actually have maximum reward?

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,880
If we're playing against always defect which

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,070
is going to have maximum reward? And if we're playing against tit for tat

14
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,980
which are going to have maximum reward? Any

15
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,670
questions about that, does that make sense?

16
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,180
>> I'm just making certain I have the rows and

17
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,640
the columns right. So my opponent is playing on the rows.

18
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,440
>> Yep.

19
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,480
>> And so I'm choosing among the columns for each one of those rows. Yes?

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,240
>> Yeah. So I labelled it best

21
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,730
possible response for the columns. And these

22
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,600
are the opponent's strategies on the rows.

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,260
>> Okay.

24
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,480
>> Okay, go.
