1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,640
So, you've added find
location to your app.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,490
But what if you just use
the coarse permission?

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,030
What sensors would you
have access to then?

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,863
Would you only have access to the cell?

5
00:00:11,863 --> 00:00:14,625
Would you only have access to WiFi?

6
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:17,960
Do you think you'd have access to cell,
WiFi and GPS?

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,820
Maybe you could only access just
the cell and GPS, but not WiFi.

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,800
Or maybe you have cell and WiFi only.

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,540
Check the box that you think applies.
