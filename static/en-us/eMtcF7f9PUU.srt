1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,650
CSS also supports background images and

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,570
this feature can be used to achieve
a number of responsive effects.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:11,880
You can use CSS to add a background
pattern to an element or

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,900
the page itself.

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,870
And you can combine that with
gradients and other CSS effects.

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,280
It's possible to get some
incredible effects with pure CSS.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,330
Check out the examples on the website
linked to below the video.

8
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,560
With the background size cover property,
CSS can also be

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,610
used to add a background image that
resizes without squashing or stretching.

10
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,240
And again, this can be really handy for

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,000
using images when you don't
know the size of the viewport.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,010
The details in a photo can
get lost when it's shrunk, so

13
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,340
this example displays the whole
image if the viewport is

14
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,490
more than 500 pixels wide,
or a smaller crop otherwise.

15
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,320
I've added a CSS transition, so

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,934
there's not too much of a jolt
if you resize the window.

17
00:00:56,934 --> 00:01:01,020
You'll see that in the DefTools,

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,340
the smaller koala crop is displayed,
downloaded when the window is small.

19
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,200
And then,
if you resize the window larger,

20
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,410
the larger crop is downloaded and
displayed.

21
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:17,890
CSS background images can be used for
conditional display of images

22
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,970
depending on the viewport size,
using CSS like this.

23
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:27,700
As you can see from the dev tools, the
background image file is not downloaded

24
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,660
if the viewpoint width
is less than 500 pixels.

25
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,720
Now, you'll find out more
about media queries later.

26
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,287
And a much less hacky and, and

27
00:01:36,287 --> 00:01:39,840
a much more efficient way to
accomplish alternative image loading

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,830
when we look at the source set attribute
and the picture element in lesson three.

29
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:49,360
With background images, you can
also use the CSS Image Set function

30
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,800
to choose a background image
depending on screen resolution.

31
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,450
This example displays a 2x color
image on a high resolution display,

32
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,240
like my phone, and
a 1x monochrome image, otherwise.

33
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,150
For the devices that
don't support Image Set,

34
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,330
the CSS falls back to the 1x version.

35
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:09,650
If you check the dev tools,

36
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,140
you'll see that only the appropriate
image is downloaded.

37
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,030
You'll learn a lot more about responding
to screen resolution in lesson three.
