1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,670
The answer, meaning the plain text,
is information security.

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:08,029
As you can see,
this cipher is not difficult to solve,

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:12,020
because the Caesar cipher
shifted letters by three.

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:16,820
On the other hand, this code was
secure for Caesar, because most of his

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:21,440
enemies at the time, were either
illiterate, or would make the assumption

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,770
that it was in a different language,
that they do not understand anyway.

7
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,030
So in this case,

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:31,130
social engineering worked to
the advantage of information security.
