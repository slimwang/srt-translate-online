1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,859
What did you write, David?

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:02,920
>> So we start with a verb, and

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,050
the verb here is went, which is
the past tense of the action go.

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,180
Our agent here is David, myself,
because I'm the one doing the action,

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,730
I'm the one going.

6
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,079
The coagent is Ashok,
because I'm going with Ashok.

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,750
The destination is to the meeting,
and the conveyance here is by car, so

8
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,270
car is the conveyance.

9
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:23,680
>> That's right, David.

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,550
But how did we know that
David was the agent?

11
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,300
How did we know that
the destination was the meeting?

12
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,710
How did we know that
car was the conveyance?

13
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:33,910
That's what we'll look at next.
