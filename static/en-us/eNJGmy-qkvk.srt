00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's test this again, and this time we study the weight of people.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'll give you a data set of weight, I ask you to do the histogram

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and answer a question about the most common weight category.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Here's a data set called the weight that you can look at,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and I want you to do a histogram for the weight that will look as follows.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please go ahead to tell the computer to make this graph and hit the run button.
