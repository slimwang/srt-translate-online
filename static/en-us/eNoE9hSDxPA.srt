00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,564
>> You've done a lot so far and let's just summarize what happened when we added

2
00:00:06,564 --> 00:00:13,456
this outlier to the dataset. The mean changed from 47,718 when we just looked at

3
00:00:13,456 --> 00:00:20,225
these to 123,098 when we looked at all of them. However, the median only changed

4
00:00:20,225 --> 00:00:26,366
from 48,670 for that, to 50,915. This tendency of the median is called robust.

5
00:00:26,366 --> 00:00:32,335
In everyday language, robust means strong and sturdy, which makes sense for its

6
00:00:32,335 --> 00:00:38,441
statistical definition. It's not affected much by departures from the norm. So

7
00:00:38,441 --> 00:00:43,730
now, you've learned about the mean, the median, and the mode. These are all

8
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:48,138
measures of center because they typically describe the center of the

9
00:00:48,138 --> 00:00:53,120
distribution. As you've seen though sometimes, the mean doesn't describe the

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,761
center because of an outlier. Sometimes, the mode doesn't describe the center

11
00:00:57,761 --> 00:01:02,162
and the median doesn't take every data point into account. However, in the case

12
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:06,718
of the starting salaries from the University of North Carolina, the median might

13
00:01:06,718 --> 00:01:11,073
have been a better statistic to determine what starting salary you would have

14
00:01:11,073 --> 00:01:15,851
made as a Geography major in the 1980s. The median is always the best measure of

15
00:01:15,851 --> 00:01:19,996
central tendency when dealing with highly skewed distributions.
