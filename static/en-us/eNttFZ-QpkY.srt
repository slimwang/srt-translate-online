00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,810
The answer is we want to make our discrening bear a subtype of the grizzly bear.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,470
This allows us to reuse the grizzly bear code for knocking down a tree and

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,782
chasing a victim. The problem is inside chase when we eat the victim, we don't

4
00:00:11,782 --> 00:00:14,850
want the bear eat behavior. We want the discerning bear to do something

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,870
different. So what this means is we need to define a new eat method inside

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,804
Discerning Bear, give it the behavior we want. So here's what the code for

7
00:00:22,804 --> 00:00:26,754
discerning bear class looks like. The only method we need to define is eat,

8
00:00:26,754 --> 00:00:30,914
everything else is inherited from Grizzly Bear or from Bear and what we do and

9
00:00:30,914 --> 00:00:34,949
eat is check if the name if the victim is Dave. If it's not, we print something

10
00:00:34,949 --> 00:00:36,973
and happy otherwise we eat the victim.
