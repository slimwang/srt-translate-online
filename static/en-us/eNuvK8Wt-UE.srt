1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,380
There's still a lot of details on the page that you're going to need to

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,790
tweak before it looks exactly like the design mock up.

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,740
And you should continue to tweak to make this portfolio page your own.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,950
At this point, it makes sense to get into the Code, Test, Refine process for

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,420
building your portfolio.

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,190
Code part of the portfolio.

7
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,540
Test your code by opening the page in the browser.

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,470
And then refine your code once you see what's right and what's wrong.

9
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,230
Then keep coding, keep testing, and keep refining.

10
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,760
My suggestion is to start off by making the layout look as much like the mock up

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,000
as possible, and once you're happy with the layout, start customizing it.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,720
You can change the CSS or really, whatever you want.

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,860
Because this is your portfolio and it should show off you.

14
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,730
When you finish customizing, check this box to let us know that

15
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,200
you're happy with the way your portfolio looks.

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,350
Then, think back to the process of building the portfolio.

17
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,880
What was the hardest part for you?

18
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,120
Type your answer in here.

19
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:48,970
Good luck.

20
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,860
Jessica and I really can't wait to see your portfolios when you finish.
