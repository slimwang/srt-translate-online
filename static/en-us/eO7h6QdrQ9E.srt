1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,055
The first statement,

2
00:00:01,055 --> 00:00:06,010
set the IDS level to the highest
sensitivity to detect every attack.

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,210
This may appear to be a good idea, but

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:12,120
in practice, this may lead to
a large number of false alarms.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,480
Second, monitor both outbound and
inbound traffic.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,200
This is a good idea.

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,700
Because there will be a tech
traffic in both directions.

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,480
Third, use a shared network
resource to gather NIDS data.

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,890
This is not a good idea, because
an attacker can disable the IDS or

10
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,890
modify the alerts that sent.

11
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,660
Fourth, NIDS sensors
are not turnkey solutions.

12
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,140
System admins must interpret alerts.

13
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:43,400
This is true, because network
IDS can produce false positives.

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,030
Therefore, the system admins
must interpret the alerts and

15
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,470
take the appropriate actions.
