The solutions for x are 3 plus or minus 4 root 3, all divided by 2 great

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:10,563
algebra work for getting that one correct. First we want to isolate the square

3
00:00:10,563 --> 00:00:14,778
by adding 48 to both sides of our equation. So, we'll keep this squared

4
00:00:14,778 --> 00:00:19,328
quantity on the left and we'll have positive 48 on the right. Next we take the

5
00:00:19,328 --> 00:00:23,920
square root of both sides and indicate the plus or minus root here. This square

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,995
root undoes our square so we're left with the quantity 2x minus three. On the

7
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:33,482
right we still just have plus or minus root 48. We add three to both sides to

8
00:00:33,482 --> 00:00:38,830
isolate our 2x, and then we divide both sides by 2, this coefficient. When we

9
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,795
divide both sides by 2 we're left with 1x on the left and 3 plus or minus root

10
00:00:42,795 --> 00:00:48,314
48 divided by 2 on the right. Next we just simplify the square root of 48 to

11
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:54,514
get this answer. Keep in mind you could divide 2 into each of these terms. This

12
00:00:54,514 --> 00:00:59,095
would give us x equal to 3 halves plus or minus 2 root 3. If you list your

13
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:03,730
answers like this, or if you list your answers like this, they're both correct.
