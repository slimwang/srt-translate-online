1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,090
Some delay at the beginning of a packet

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,240
stream is acceptable. And similarly, some small amount

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,060
of missing data is okay. We can tolerate

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:14,120
small amounts of missing data that result in

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,350
slightly reduced quality of the audio or video

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,640
stream. On the other hand, a receiver is

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,450
not very good at tolerating variability in packet

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,460
delay in the packet stream, particularly if the client

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,790
buffer is starved.
