1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,250
Let's take a step back here and

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,700
talk about why we even care
whether we have outliers.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,500
Remember that what we're working through
here is not just some academic exercise,

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,310
but typically we're analyzing our data
to help us answer a business question.

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,710
Maybe why a certain
behavior is happening or

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:22,350
maybe even to be able to predict
what might happen in the future.

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,880
To do that we want to have our data
as close to reality as possible.

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,000
And that's where the identification
of outliers comes into play.

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,925
Lots of times data that is unusual or

10
00:00:33,925 --> 00:00:37,345
extreme can be that way for
one of two reasons.

11
00:00:37,345 --> 00:00:41,645
One, incorrect data, or two,
abnormal but correct data.

12
00:00:43,195 --> 00:00:47,390
Data can be incorrect for any number
of reasons, from system issues

13
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:52,380
to bad data collection methods to
just plain typos when entering data.

14
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,480
The critical thing to understand
is that this incorrect data

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,460
can mess with our answers
to our business questions,

16
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,950
whether we're trying to explain why
something happened a certain way.

17
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,510
Or what might happened in the future.

18
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,050
Abnormal, but correct outliers
despite being accurate data can

19
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:16,020
also impact your analysis and you may
have to make adjustments accordingly.

20
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:21,140
So by identifying those data
values that might be incorrect,

21
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,840
we have the means to possibly
correct them if they're wrong.

22
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,420
Or understand the exceptions
that are real.

23
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,110
Actually, by the nature of data,

24
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,430
we can expect to find extreme
data in almost any data.

25
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,520
So, the fact that they are outliers,

26
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,160
doesn't necessarily mean
they're invalid or incorrect.

27
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,130
But we should know that they're there so

28
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,290
we can adjust our
analysis appropriately.

29
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,500
An example of this would be in our
income data that we just went over.

30
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,520
Say we're trying to analyze some
behavior of our customers...

31
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,750
Based on their level of income.

32
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,060
Our data shows that most of our
customers make under $100,000.

33
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:07,690
So if we see in our data that there's
a single customer that makes $1 million,

34
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:11,750
we might want to try to confirm
that this is truly the case.

35
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,830
Or we might not want to consider
that customer in our analysis.

36
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,130
Since it may skew our
thinking away from reality.

37
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,640
This leads us to the question of
what effect outliers can have on

38
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,620
our analysis.
