00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
[Male narrator] Here are the truth tables for all the logical connectives.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What a truth table does is list all the possibilities for the propositional symbols,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
so P and Q can be false and false, false and true, true and false, or true and true.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Those are the only 4 possibilities,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and then for each of those possibilities, the truth table lists the truth value

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
of the compound sentence.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So the sentence not P is true when P is false and false when P is true.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The sentence P and Q is true only when both P and Q are true and false otherwise.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The sentence P or Q is true when either P or Q is true

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and false when both are false.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Now, so far, those mostly correspond to the English meaning of those sentences

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
with one exception, which is that in English, the word "or" is somewhat ambiguous

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
between the inclusive and exclusive or,

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and this "or" means either or both.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We translate this mark into English P implies Q; or as if P, then Q,

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
but the meaning in logic is not quite the same as the meaning in ordinary English.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The meaning in logic is defined explicitly by this truth table

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and by nothing else, but let's look at some examples in ordinary English.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:44,000
If we have the proposition O and have that mean 5 is an odd number

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and P meaning Paris is the capital of France,

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
then under the ordinary model of the truth in the real world,

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
what could we say about the sentence O implies P?

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That is, 5 is an odd number implies Paris is the capital of France.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Would that be true or false?

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And let's look at one more example.

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
If E is the proposition that 5 is an even number

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and M is the proposition that Moscow is the capital of France,

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
what about E implies M?

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
5 is an even number implies Moscow is the capital of France.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Is that true or false?
