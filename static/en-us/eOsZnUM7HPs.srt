1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,719
Let's take a look at beta first just because it has smaller numbers,

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:05,010
so maybe that's a bit easier to reason about.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:09,760
Now, as we grow the input size, notice that we're going the input size the linear way.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,750
And as we grow linearly, the time it takes beta also grows relatively linearly.

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:22,610
So we double from 100 to 200, we roughly double as we triple from 100 to 300,

6
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:26,340
and we get roughly triple of the initial input size.

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,760
16 is pretty close to 18, so I'm going to go ahead and say that beta is linear.

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:38,220
Now, alpha just explodes--at 100, it doesn't take a whole lot of timing,

9
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:43,460
that takes quite a bit less time in gamma but at N=200,

10
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,780
alpha is already in the hundreds of thousands and then

11
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,950
it gets even bigger and bigger very very quickly.

12
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:57,110
So I think it's reasonable to say that alpha has an exponential running time.

13
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:01,350
Now, gamma might be a little trickier to see, by I think,

14
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,560
if you look at the input sizes relative to the running times in gamma,

15
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,080
we can see that it looks to be polynomial.

16
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,460
To see this, let's take a look at N² for this input sizes.

17
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:24,590
N² for 100 is 10⁴ which is quite a bit bigger than gamma's running time.

18
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:30,270
N² for 200 is similarly much bigger than gamma's running time and on and on.

19
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:39,720
N² is really the lowest polynomial running time you are probably going to get that it is linear?

20
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,090
And it definitely dominates gamma at least for the instances that we are looking at.

21
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:48,090
So, I will definitely say that gamma is polynomial in running time.

22
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,790
For more visual representation of this, let's draw a few graphs.

23
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,680
Let's take a look at alpha first.

24
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:01,550
Now alpha is still very tiny at N=100 and relative to this graph it is still very tiny here.

25
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:05,720
Here it's quite a bit bigger but still compared to the 10¹³,

26
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:13,790
10⁹ is actually pretty small and then it's way up here for any of this, 400.

27
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,600
Let's just kind of draw an approximation to that.

28
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:22,300
This is not a scale but it'll give you an idea for the shape of the graph

29
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,300
which is really what we're going for.

30
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,800
But in gamma, we really just can't see them on this graph.

31
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,430
They are so close to the x axis here that they might as well just be right on top of it.

32
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,510
So that doesn't really help us.

33
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:42,550
So clearly alpha is growing just unbelievably faster than both beta and gamma.

34
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:46,240
So let's zoom in a bit and look at this again.

35
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:51,670
All right, so now I'm only going up to 10⁴, so that makes gamma fairly easier to draw

36
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:58,260
and if this on 100 still, pretty small. At 200, it's closer.

37
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:05,750
At 300, it is about half way there and then it gets about here. So let's go ahead and draw it up.

38
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:14,880
If we try to draw beta, it's still right about here, so it still grows much much slower than gamma does.

39
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:20,750
As we can see that they're really in different classes because they're both just growing so much slower

40
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:26,740
than alpha is, but beta similarly is growing just so much slower than gamma is.

41
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:32,850
So they're definitely in different classes and this is kind of a visual intuitive representation

42
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:39,810
of why alpha is exponential, gamma is polynomial, and beta is linear.
