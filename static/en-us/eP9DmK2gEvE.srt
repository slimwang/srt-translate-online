00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,388
The x intercepts would be 2,0 and negative 2, 0. Great solving if you found

2
00:00:06,388 --> 00:00:11,858
those two. Remember for an x intercept, we're somewhere along our x axis, which

3
00:00:11,858 --> 00:00:18,080
means the y value must equal 0. So we plug in zero for the value of y, and then

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,300
we can continue solving for x. Here we have x squared divided by 4 equals 1. So

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,450
we're multiplying both sides by 4 to clear the fraction and then we'll have x

6
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:32,619
squared equals 4. We'll take the square root of both sides, indicating plus or

7
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:38,215
minus, so x can equal positive 2 or negative 2. Keep in mind that x intercepts

8
00:00:38,215 --> 00:00:43,693
are points, so we need to write the coordinates of the x intercepts. We'll have

9
00:00:43,693 --> 00:00:48,920
positive 2,0 and negative 2,0. Both the coordinates written in parentheses.
