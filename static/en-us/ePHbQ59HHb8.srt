00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,510
Here's an example of the more
complex FHIR Condition Resource,

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,980
in this case for Marla's diabetes.

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:14,540
Note here the reference to Marla's ID
number from the patient resource.

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,060
Note here a reference to
the SNOMED-CT code for

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,600
Type 2 Diabetes,
the adult onset version that Marla has.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,140
This illustrates an important
characteristic of FHIR.

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,690
It isn't being build from scratch.

8
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:35,038
Rather it builds upon the key existing
standards we discussed earlier,

9
00:00:35,038 --> 00:00:36,624
such as SNOMED-CT.
