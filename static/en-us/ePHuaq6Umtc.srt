1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,510
Now all of this is well and good.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:06,930
We need to also remember, at least in my opinion, what is the ultimate camera.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,020
The ultimate camera does remain to be the human vision system, and

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,910
all of the work we've done with photography, or

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,110
computational photography, attempts, to some extent, recreate it.

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,790
Now, of course, we are also generating newer and novel forms of

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:24,930
images that the human vision system does not actually capture or relate to.

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,490
That's also true, but we're trying to build cameras that can help us

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,710
see more information in the environment.

10
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,240
So, in essence, if you look at it, the relationship between a human eye,

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,480
which is aimed at capturing the rays of light onto a retina.

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,850
Is not much different than that of a camera.

13
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,450
Basically, again has a lens and it either goes onto a film or a sensor.

14
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:50,590
So computational photography in my opinion, also does yield us to

15
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,770
understand more about how we actually will be doing things,

16
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,520
like building sensors to capture the environment we're in.
