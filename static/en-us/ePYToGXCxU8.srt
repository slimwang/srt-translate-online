00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,390
Here's the completed app for
looking at activities.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,810
I've started to show all the possible
activities it detects and

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,450
you can see that it has a percentage for
each one.

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,283
For example, when I was testing this
earlier, it determined there was a 45%

5
00:00:14,283 --> 00:00:18,780
chance I was on foot, 45% chance
walking, 25% in a vehicle, etc.

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,966
Now it can't be 100% sure for
some activities, so

7
00:00:21,966 --> 00:00:25,442
it's up to you as a developer
to figure out what works best.

8
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:29,273
When you start a car for example,
you're driving really slowly.

9
00:00:29,273 --> 00:00:32,475
And it might think you're biking or
running for example.

10
00:00:32,475 --> 00:00:36,205
This app will just show you how to get
the data, its up to you to figure out

11
00:00:36,205 --> 00:00:39,115
how to use it in the best
possible way for your app.

12
00:00:39,115 --> 00:00:40,445
You're going to build this from scratch.
