1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,870
What do you think are some of the best qualities of, good data visualization.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,880
>> So for me, it definitely depends on the purpose of the data visualization.

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:12,166
I tend to draw a distinction between the exploratory and the explanatory.

4
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:15,962
>> Hm. >> Where exploratory you're really trying to get a sense of wh,

5
00:00:15,962 --> 00:00:19,930
what the data is, what it can tell you and, it's a process of turning over

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:24,488
maybe 100 different rocks to try to find those, one or two interesting nuggets.

7
00:00:24,488 --> 00:00:27,869
Then once you've found the interesting nuggets you're in the explanatory space

8
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:31,150
of wanting to then communicate those things to somebody else.

9
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:35,340
So when it comes to effective data visualization on the exploratory side,

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,260
it's about allowing your users to be able to connect things

11
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,710
in interesting ways and look at data from different angles.

12
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:46,550
In an unbiased and unleading way.

13
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,040
On the explanatory side which is where I spend most of the time

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:55,085
in my work teaching and writing, I typically cover five key lessons for success.

15
00:00:55,085 --> 00:01:00,060
>> Hm. >> So the first is having a really robust understanding of the context.

16
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,640
Who your audience is and what they need to know or do before you

17
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,282
really even start thinking about how you're going to show the data.

18
00:01:06,282 --> 00:01:08,110
>> Hm. >> Then when it comes to showing the data,

19
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,870
the second lesson is around choosing an appropriate type of visual.

20
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,810
So you want to think really about what is it you want your audience to do

21
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:19,290
with the information, and what sort of graph or other visual types are going to

22
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,970
allow them to do that in the most easy, straightforward fashion?

23
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,640
Third lesson, is getting around clutter.

24
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,530
Getting comfortable identifying and

25
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:32,120
eliminating those things that aren't adding informative value to our visuals.

26
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,118
And cutting those.

27
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:35,334
Doing so decreases cognitive load, and

28
00:01:35,334 --> 00:01:37,754
also causes our data to just stand out more.

29
00:01:37,754 --> 00:01:41,004
And when it comes to our data standing out more, the fourth lesson is around,

30
00:01:41,004 --> 00:01:44,270
drawing your audience's attention to where you want them to pay it.

31
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,660
So using color, and size, and placement on page.

32
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,020
Strategically as indicators to your audience that say hey,

33
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,960
this is most important, look here first.

34
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,080
Or this is next most important.

35
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,460
Pay attention here next.

36
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,500
And so on and so forth.

37
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,920
And the final lesson is around story.

38
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,660
For me the most successful explanatory data visualizations,

39
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,820
make themselves a pivotal point in a story or a narrative that's being told.

40
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,320
>> Hm.
