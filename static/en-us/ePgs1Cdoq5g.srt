00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,634
How are the graphs of this exponential growth function and this exponential

2
00:00:03,634 --> 00:00:09,720
decay function related to one another? I bet you can figure it out. Once again,

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:15,103
here we have y equals two the x, and y equals one half to the x. How do we

4
00:00:15,103 --> 00:00:19,282
transform one of these into the other? Do we need a horizontal shift, a

5
00:00:19,282 --> 00:00:25,830
vertical shift? A reflection in the x-axis, a reflection in the y-axis, or a

6
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,034
reflection in the line y equals x?
