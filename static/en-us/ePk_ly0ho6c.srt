1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So this is where we draw the line, any outcome over here is critical.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That means so any of those outcomes, you'll be so surprised that we reject the null hypothesis.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Whereas any outcome in the region over here is okay, so we accept it.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Notice subtlety here. Even outcome 11 is okay.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Despite the fact that 11 is very surprising, it comes to the probability less than 5%,

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
but that's not the way to look at this.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The more frequently your sample, the more unlikely each individual outcome is.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Look at the outcome as blocks.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
When you implement hypothesis testing, there'll be something like a most likely outcome.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Somewhere between 13 and 14, I guess it's 14. That outcome has to be okay obviously.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
If you see that, you'll be happy and then you push this in one direction towards H₁,

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
the alternate hypothesis until all the probabilities remaining

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
cover 5% or less and that's the critical region.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So let's give this another try. Last Saturday, I went to the magic store and bought a loaded coin.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I paid a lot of money for it and the wizard that sold me the coin told me

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
the probability of head is equals 0.3.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
In fact, there are many buckets of coins, the fair ones

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
the slightly loaded, all the way to the fully loaded, and those guys are cheap and those guys are cheap

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
but this one over here was really expensive.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So I wanted to make sure that I really got a loaded coin.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Let's first ask, what's our null hypothesis. Here are our choices for the probability of heads.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Pick the one that's best describes the null hypothesis.
