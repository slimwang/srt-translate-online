1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's go through it together.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Starting from sentence, I can get to subject verb.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
One possible subject is students.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
One possible verb is think.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We saw this one before. This is definitely in the language of the grammar.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
However, students teachers is not.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That's 2 subjects in a row, and there's just no way to get there

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
starting from sentence.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We can turn sentence.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We can rewrite it into subject followed by verb,

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
so we can match students at the beginning, but teachers is not a verb.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
There's just no way to make this happen.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Students write, this is one of our subjects, this is one of our verbs.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That looks good. Teachers think.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Teachers think, that's a subject followed by a verb.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That looks good. Teachers write.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That also looks good. Think write.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
These are 2 verbs, and our rules up here say a sentence

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
has to be a subject followed by a verb.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
This just doesn't match the pattern.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And in fact, in this particular grammar, these 4 are all of the strings in the grammar.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
There are only 4 possibilities.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This grammar is perhaps not super exciting,

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
but we're going to get to something, many things,

25
00:01:01,000 --> 99:59:59,999
much more exciting than this in just a bit.
