00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,760
And the answer is, none of them. This is more than

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,250
just a trick question. The point I'm trying to make, is

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,039
that all of these browsers are a little different. And if

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,290
you've used more than one of them, you'll know that, that's

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,020
obviously true. However, none of these browsers are perfect. And in

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,670
fact, it's not even clear when we're doing web development what

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,680
perfect is. It, it's a very imperfect art the web design

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,220
is. And so, while you may have a preference for one

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,640
of these browsers, it is not necessarily true that your

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,990
users agree. You know, you may like Chrome, and your

11
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,180
users may prefer Internet Explorer. Or more realist, realistically, you

12
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,750
may like Chrome, and your users are forced to use Internet

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,880
Explorer. So you need to have in mind that all

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,220
of these browsers are different. They all behave differently. And

15
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,950
you need to keep that in mind as you as

16
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,240
you develop and test in as many browsers as you can.
