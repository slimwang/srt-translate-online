00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,550
Okay, so let's look at the different
components of an email.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,070
First we have our subject line,
this should be short and

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,310
draw attention to your email.

4
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:10,760
You're trying to engage the customer
enough that they want to open the email.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,750
This is setting the expectation for
the contents of the email.

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,129
If you're promoting a new feature,
say something like that.

7
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:19,300
If you're telling everyone
that things are going on sale,

8
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,880
probably should mention it there.

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,320
Next we have the content, the content
is the main piece of the email.

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,300
It's likely to contain some
combination of text and

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,660
images depending on your chosen layout.

12
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,490
You're going to want to
find the right layout and

13
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,430
the right type of content to achieve
your goals for each particular email,

14
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,930
and this is where your
messaging is showcased.

15
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,920
So be sure to use a consistent tone.

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,720
Then we have our call to action.

17
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,060
This should mirror
the goal of the email.

18
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:49,150
All of your email components should lead
to this call to action that you want

19
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,520
your readers to take.

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,020
So what is it that you really
want your readers to do, or

21
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,710
to get out of this email?

22
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,150
We have the from name so
who is this email from?

23
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:02,313
Is it Ebarkment support, or
is it the Ebarkment team, or

24
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:05,330
is it Lauren the Ebarkment COO?

25
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,910
What do you think is going to
connect with you users, and

26
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,120
what supports the goal of the email?

27
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,550
For example, if this is an email about
a new feature or business channel we're

28
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,120
going into, maybe the email should come
from the CEO or the director of product.

29
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,050
If it's about some type of customer
support, maybe it should come from

30
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,360
the support team, or
a particular member at the support team.

31
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,050
And finally, the from address.

32
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,870
This is the email that's displayed
to the receiver when they

33
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,050
receive the email.

34
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,430
You'll want to send your emails
from a consistent address,

35
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,480
that aligns with
the purpose of the email.

36
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,830
Before you choose your from address,
make sure to take into account the goals

37
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,710
of the email, and the general tone,
you're trying to set.

38
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,839
If this is a more personal email,

39
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:49,796
maybe it should come from
lauren@ebarkment.com instead of

40
00:01:49,796 --> 00:01:53,620
ebarkment.support.donotrespond@ebarkmen-
t.com.

41
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,170
You have options.

42
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,760
Now when sending your emails, you can
send a regular old email from Gmail or

43
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,100
something like that, or

44
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,830
you can choose an email platform, which
most growing companies choose to do.

45
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,930
These platforms will vary depending
on the needs of the company.

46
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,410
So, when deciding on an email platform,

47
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,550
you'll want to consider the volume of
emails you're sending, the cost, and

48
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,730
features, like automation and
segmentation.

49
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,280
There are a few different platforms out
there that are great if you're just

50
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,940
getting started that are pretty
cost effective, like SinGrid,

51
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,380
HubSpot, MailChimp.

52
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:31,090
And there are also more robust platforms
that have built in automation, advanced

53
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:37,550
segmentation, and life cycle emails like
Marketo, Responses, and Exact Target.

54
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,930
Let's go to Greg and see what he
has to say about email marketing.
