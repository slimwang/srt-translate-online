1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,350
Yeah, so, so we'd certainly need to do some

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:05,200
stuff in the HTML file and the CSS file to

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,510
make the button itself. But as for how it

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:12,190
actually works, most of that's going to go in, in the

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:12,760
>> In the JavaScript.

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,760
>> JavaScript files.

7
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,930
>> Because this is more substantial than just changing how it looks. It's-

8
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:17,160
>> Right.

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:17,360
>> Really.

10
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,950
>> because, because the button has to actually do something.

11
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,875
>> Okay and that's what we'll do and listen two.

12
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:21,590
>> Mm-hm.

13
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,470
>> Okay,but for now we'll stick with more of the HTML and CSS.

14
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:25,120
>> Yeah.

15
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,250
>> Cool.
