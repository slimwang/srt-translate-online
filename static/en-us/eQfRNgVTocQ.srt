00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,245
You're doing a great job with this so let's just 
keep going.

2
00:00:03,245 --> 00:00:05,742
Here's another expression for us to play with.

3
00:00:05,742 --> 00:00:11,853
3 log of x plus 2 log of y minus one half log of z

4
00:00:11,853 --> 00:00:15,362
Now I'd like you to use all three log properties 
that we've learned

5
00:00:15,362 --> 00:00:19,000
to condense this expression as much as you can.
