1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,610
Earlier we talked about the potential
applications of analytics

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,808
to the determination
of optimal treatment.

3
00:00:06,808 --> 00:00:11,700
That often now means the best
results at the lowest costs.

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:17,530
These are of course not precisely
defined terms and there is serious

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:22,860
debate about issues such as the value of
spending substantial sums on treatments

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:28,050
that only prolong the life of terminal
patients by small increments in time.

7
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,040
The research shown here
illustrates the potential to help

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,530
with less controversial
clinical contexts.

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,830
A partially observable Markov decision
process, a variation that introduces

10
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:44,295
memory, was developed and compared
to the actual treatment of nearly

11
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:49,480
6,000 depressed patients, abstracted
from their electronic records.

12
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,030
I leave it to you to read this section
in the text for the details, but

13
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,860
as shown here, under certain assumptions
the model delivered improvements

14
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,910
that were better than or
almost as good as real physicians, but

15
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,140
at a better cost per
unit of improvement.

16
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,215
As we seek to re-engineer the health
care system, technologies like this may

17
00:01:11,215 --> 00:01:14,015
become a routine part of
clinical decision support.

18
00:01:15,095 --> 00:01:17,045
Some would even speculate that,

19
00:01:17,045 --> 00:01:21,915
at least in certain circumstances,
they may replace physicians.

20
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,375
But I leave it to you to consider that.
