00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
In your Pitch Perfect Xcode project,

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,609
select the Main.storyboard file.

3
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:07,560
This is your storyboard file where you’ll place

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,630
and set up your entire user interface.

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,630
Right now the interface looks pretty

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,670
bare, but eventually you'll see the

7
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,100
entire interface, all of the elements and

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,990
the view controllers associated with

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,390
this particular project. Right now this

10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,580
app only has one interface called the

11
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,519
View Controller. A couple of key things to

12
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,670
notice. The first is this gray arrow and

13
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,529
I selected it, so it's blue. But if I

14
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:34,739
deselect it, it goes back to gray. That's on

15
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:37,860
the left side of the view. This signifies

16
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,570
that it is the initial view controller

17
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,670
for this storyboard and in fact for the

18
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,340
entire application. When a user starts

19
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,809
the app, this is the first view

20
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:49,200
controller and view that will load. Want

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,640
to drag out to give us some more space.

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,899
And here in the bottom right hand corner,

23
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:57,590
we see the library selector with the

24
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,980
different types of UI elements that we

25
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,609
can drag in. If you don't see the library,

26
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:04,110
make sure this third icon from the left

27
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,939
is selected, the one that looks like a

28
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:11,790
square surrounded by a circle. We can

29
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,340
also hide the debug and navigator panels

30
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,200
to give ourself some more room while

31
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,439
we're working on the interface. Before we

32
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,600
drag a button in, this view needs to be a

33
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,909
hundred percent zoomed in. So if you're

34
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:25,890
zoomed out, double click on the view to

35
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,700
zoom in.

36
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,829
Let's start by dragging in a button to

37
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:34,920
this UI interface element. In the filter

38
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,990
at the bottom of the library, start

39
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:45,120
typing “UIButton”

40
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,780
Drag the button to the center of the

41
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,120
screen and use the two blue guidelines

42
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,130
to Center it horizontally and vertically.

43
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,660
And let go to place it. Now we've come to

44
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,370
the first problem most beginning iOS

45
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,890
developers face. The background of this

46
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,140
button is white and the UI view behind

47
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,230
it is also white. If you click away,

48
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,970
how can you tell how big the button is.

49
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,670
So we've clicked away from the button

50
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,580
and now I have no idea how big it is.

51
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,230
One trick that I can use is to temporarily

52
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,510
change the background of the button, so I

53
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,100
can easily determine how big it is

54
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,250
compared to the rest of view. This is also

55
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,810
a great chance for you to play around a

56
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,280
little bit with the attributes inspector.

57
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,340
with the button selected in the document

58
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,470
outline, click on the attributes

59
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,100
inspector in the inspector panel.

60
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,240
It's the one that looks like a downward

61
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,210
facing arrow. Scroll down until you see

62
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,990
the Background option. Select the

63
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,600
drop-down and then go down to Other，

64
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,990
So we can set our own custom color.

65
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,730
I’ll pick this bright green color for the

66
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,330
background. The more visible the better.

67
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,610
You're not going for aesthetics just yet.

68
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,950
Now we can see that our button is pretty

69
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,900
small and we can easily see what would

70
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,730
happen if we resized it.

71
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,480
Let's click on the button again and then

72
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,220
in the inspector panel, scroll up to the top,

73
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,340
and we're still in the attributes

74
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,410
inspector by the way. And let's change

75
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:19,260
the button’s text. Let's set it to the

76
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,700
word “Record”. And here we have the button.

77
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,720
Let’s drag it out, so it displays the

78
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,959
entire word. The next step is to set up

79
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,700
the layout for the button. And for that,

80
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,440
we need to talk briefly about

81
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,620
AutoLayout.
