1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,730
The last coding task that we did for
the mewalk app involved

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,190
releasing the media player resources
as soon as we didn't need them anymore.

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:10,020
But we can't always assume that the
audio file will be played to completion.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,605
Because if it's interrupted by the user
switching away to a different activity

5
00:00:13,605 --> 00:00:16,935
then we still need to make sure
to clean up everything properly.

6
00:00:16,935 --> 00:00:19,995
So my question to you is that
if the user leaves the activity,

7
00:00:19,995 --> 00:00:24,055
during which activity lifecycle
stage should we release resources

8
00:00:24,055 --> 00:00:25,785
used by the MediaPlayer?

9
00:00:25,785 --> 00:00:30,870
So is it during onResume,
onCreate OnStop or onDestroy?

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,930
So once you've made your selection,
modify your app so

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,110
that we can actually release resources
during that lifecycle stage.

12
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,250
So let me show you what your
app should look like before and

13
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,490
after making this code change.

14
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,730
So your app currently behaves like this.

15
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,027
If I click on a word,
it'll start speaking the word aloud, and

16
00:00:50,027 --> 00:00:52,703
if I leave the activity
without letting it finish,

17
00:00:52,703 --> 00:00:55,649
the app will still continue
to play the full audio file.

18
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:57,530
[BLANK_AUDIO]

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,680
>> So, here's the version of the code
where we cleaned up media resources

20
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,500
properly according to
the activity lifecycle.

21
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,820
So, in this case,
when we hit the device home button.

22
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,820
The app should immediately
stop playing the audio file,

23
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,290
even in the middle of a word.

24
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,290
This reinforces the fact that
we should only play audio

25
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,180
when the user is within our app.

26
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,780
Because in our case,
we are a music or podcast player app.

27
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,054
So let me demonstrate.

28
00:01:24,054 --> 00:01:25,471
[SOUND].

29
00:01:25,471 --> 00:01:28,140
All right so go ahead and
make those code changes now.

30
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,650
And remember to update all
four of our activities.
