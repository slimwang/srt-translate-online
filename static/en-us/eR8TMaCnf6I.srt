1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,290
So here we are in our swift extension to
UI view controller, and you'll need to

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,350
import mobile core services at the top
of the file like I've done here, and

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,870
this is where we're going to write
our launch video camera method.

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,670
Let's look back at the objective
C launch camera method, and

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,010
see what we need to include here.

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,492
Okay, I think I'm just going to make
a list of what this method is doing.

7
00:00:20,492 --> 00:00:23,680
Create imagePicker,

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,260
set the properties of the image picker,
what properties are we setting?

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:34,640
Source type, media types,
allows editing,

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,090
and then set the delegate, and
then present the controller.

11
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,970
I think that's pretty much
all this method does, cool.

12
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,807
Now we'll copy these notes
over to the swift project, so

13
00:00:47,807 --> 00:00:49,174
we can fill in that method.

14
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:55,801
Let's see what should we call
it recordVideoController,

15
00:00:55,801 --> 00:01:00,978
set the source type which
is of course camera.

16
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:06,430
Media types is a little bit tricky,
because it has to be in array, and

17
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:12,258
also has to be a string, for now we're
going to set allows editing to false,

18
00:01:12,258 --> 00:01:15,172
but we're going to change that later,

19
00:01:15,172 --> 00:01:19,498
we set the delegate to self,
and we're almost ready.

20
00:01:19,498 --> 00:01:22,157
Present, what's going on there,

21
00:01:22,157 --> 00:01:26,840
cannot assign value of
type UIViewController to.

22
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,280
We need to conform to
the protocol of course, and

23
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,350
also the navigationController delegate.

24
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,290
Okay, cool, so that error went away.

25
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,590
And then we present it.

26
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:44,910
Probably don't really
need these comments now.

27
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,280
That I do it for
presenting the camera, and

28
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,670
now we also need to write the methods
to retrieve the video that we record.

29
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,950
Remember there are two methods that
we need to implement that are part

30
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,160
of the image picker control,
or delegate protocol

31
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,800
did finish picking media with info,
and imagePickerController did cancel.

32
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,190
So let's look back again at
the Objective C version, and

33
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,220
see how these methods
are implemented there.

34
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,240
Here we are in the Objective C project,
and

35
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:16,090
we're at the pragma mark for
ImagePickerControllerDelegate Methods.

36
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,140
If we look here in the method
didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo,

37
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,930
we can see that first,
we need to check the media type.

38
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:29,730
Then, if the media type is a movie,
we need to save this raw video URL.

39
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:36,215
And then here, the comments say get
start, and end points for a trim video.

40
00:02:36,215 --> 00:02:41,025
Well we're not trimming the video yet,
so we can skip that part, and then here,

41
00:02:41,025 --> 00:02:46,640
it's gotta call to crop video to square,
we're not cropping the video yet either.

42
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,470
I'll tell you what, for now, we'll just
save this video to the photos album

43
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,900
that way we'll know the recording
functionality is working.

44
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,730
So we're back in the Swift version of
our UI view controller extension, and

45
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,600
to make this file a little more
readable, I went ahead, and moved

46
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,410
to the image picker controller delegate
methods into an additional extension.

47
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,460
Here in the method did finish
picking media with info

48
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,550
is where we want to save our
video to the photo album.

49
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,790
So we'll call the method
UISaveVideoAtPath to save

50
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:20,360
to photos album, and we'll remember to
dismiss this view controller the image

51
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,290
picker controller,
this has to be a path.

52
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,780
And, if we scroll up to our launch video
camera method you can see that it's been

53
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,600
connected to storyboard,
it's connected to the record button.

54
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,510
So our launch video camera method is
ready, our image picker controller

55
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,779
delegate methods are ready, so
let's run it, and see how it looks.

56
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,950
Okay, now keep in mind that when I show
you these representations of the phone

57
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,020
on the screen.

58
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,870
I'm actually showing you a movie that
I recorded of me running the app on my

59
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,630
phone, because of course you're going to
need to be running the app on device,

60
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,340
if you're testing anything
involving the camera,

61
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,020
you won't be able to use the simulator.

62
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,930
Here you can see I can launch the
camera, I took a video of my teammate,

63
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:10,020
the cameras dismissed, and here you can
see that when I go out of the app, and

64
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,092
then I go into my photo library
my video is there, fantastic.
