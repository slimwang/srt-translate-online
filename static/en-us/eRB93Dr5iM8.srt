00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,690
Here's the answer.

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:04,629
We'll start at the bottom and
propagate the values up.

3
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:06,320
The first level from
the bottom is the max level.

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,650
So we'll take the max in
each of our leaf notes.

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,179
Next we have a min level.

6
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:14,050
So we take the min of each
of the values we just found.

7
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,740
Finally, the top was the max level.
