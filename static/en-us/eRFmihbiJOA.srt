00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,890
Congratulations. You have now learned some very fundamental concepts

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,530
of computer science, and you understand the issue of P vs NP.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,200
We've also shown that the problems that Alice, Bob, and Carol

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,920
were working on are among the hardest problems in NP.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,710
They are NP-complete; so nobody knows if

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,860
there's a polynomial-time algorithm for those problems,

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,110
and actually finding 1 would be a sensation.

8
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,240
Now, the question, of course, is what does that mean for Alice, Bob, and Carol?

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,240
Should they just give up?

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,960
Should they ask their bosses to give them a new problem?

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,189
Or should they make their bosses watch this Udacity course?

12
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,130
In the next unit, we'll be looking at 2 things:

13
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,560
The first 1 is how to recognize that a problem is NP-complete.

14
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:44,990
And we'll then turn our attention to what to do when you encounter an NP-complete problem.

15
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:49,090
Because, well, there will not only be good news, but as it turns out,

16
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,090
there's still some options available.

17
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,590
It is possible to poke loopholes into the laws of NP-completeness.

18
00:00:55,590 --> 99:59:59,999
So there's still hope for Alice, Bob and Carol. So see you next time.
