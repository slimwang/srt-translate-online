Lets try answering an easier form of the problem. This might help us think about

2
00:00:04,174 --> 00:00:07,982
what we should do. How many batches of brownies could you bake if a recipe

3
00:00:07,994 --> 00:00:12,301
requires 1/2 of a cup of sugar and you have one cup of sugar at home? This seems

4
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:16,026
a little bit easier. This square is going to represent my one cup of sugar. I

5
00:00:16,108 --> 00:00:20,276
know 1/2 of a cup of sugar will make one batch of brownies. So I'm going to fill

6
00:00:20,288 --> 00:00:24,855
up 1/2 of my cup and make one batch of brownies. So here's a half cup of sugar

7
00:00:24,867 --> 00:00:29,015
and I know I made one batch of brownies. If I use another half cup of sugar, I

8
00:00:29,027 --> 00:00:33,075
know I'll make another batch of brownies. Now I've used my one whole cup of

9
00:00:33,087 --> 00:00:37,065
sugar and I don't have any sugar left at home. Well, I made two batches of

10
00:00:37,077 --> 00:00:41,533
brownies. Let's try this with some math. I have one cup of sugar. And I wondered

11
00:00:41,545 --> 00:00:45,592
how many times did 1/2 go into it? I knew I was able to make 2 batches of

12
00:00:45,604 --> 00:00:50,124
brownies. So 1 divided by a 1/2 must be 2. Remember, when we divide by a number,

13
00:00:50,225 --> 00:00:54,773
we can actually multiply by the reciporical. We learned that from before. So I

14
00:00:54,785 --> 00:00:59,216
could change this to look like 1 times 2 over 1. Well, remember, I could just

15
00:00:59,228 --> 00:01:04,041
put any number over 1. And then, multiply fractions like before. 1 times 2 is 2,

16
00:01:04,144 --> 00:01:08,551
and 1 times 1 is 1. 2 for 1 is just 2. Let's change this problem a little bit

17
00:01:08,563 --> 00:01:13,143
and see what we can find out. What if instead a recipe called for 1/3 a cup of

18
00:01:13,155 --> 00:01:17,704
sugar? I know if I use a 3rd cup of sugar I'll make one batch of brownies. If I

19
00:01:17,716 --> 00:01:22,413
use another 1/3 cup of sugar, I'll make another batch of brownies and if I use

20
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:27,215
my last 1/3 cup of sugar I'll make one more batch of brownies. So let's put this

21
00:01:27,227 --> 00:01:31,702
with some math. I was wondering how many times does 1/3 go into 1 so I did 1

22
00:01:31,714 --> 00:01:36,028
divided by 1/3. I know that for every 1/3 cup of sugar I get one batch of

23
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,166
brownies so I should get three batches. Remember when I divide by a number it's

24
00:01:41,178 --> 00:01:45,604
the same thing as multiply by the reciprocal. I could change this to

25
00:01:45,616 --> 00:01:50,094
multiplication 1 times 3 over 1. I know 1 is just 1 over 1 and now I can

26
00:01:50,106 --> 00:01:54,974
multiply these fractions together. 1 times 3 is 3 and 1 times 1 is 1, I get 3

27
00:01:54,986 --> 00:01:58,938
over 1, 3 divided by 1 is 3 batches. I hope you're starting to see a pattern.

28
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:00,640
Let's see if you can figure this one out.
