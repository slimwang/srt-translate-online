00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,160
These last two practice problems bring together a lot of what we learned in unit

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,073
3. To start the first problem, we have to know the slope of the given line and

3
00:00:10,073 --> 00:00:15,004
then find the slope of a line that is parallel to that line. So let's find the

4
00:00:15,004 --> 00:00:20,021
slope of the line 3x plus y equals 7. In order to find the equation of a line

5
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:26,266
that's parallel to this line. I first have to find the slope of this line. If I

6
00:00:26,266 --> 00:00:33,091
simply subtract 3x from both sides I get that y equals negative 3x plus 7, which

7
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:40,497
means the slope of this given line is negative 3. I know that parallel line if I

8
00:00:40,497 --> 00:00:46,651
want to find the slope of a line that's parallel to the given line. I know that

9
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:52,652
parallel lines have the same slope. So, what I write is m parallel equals the

10
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:58,839
original slope, which equals negative 3. This is just a shorthand notation to

11
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:04,917
indicate parallel. So, the slope of the parallel line is equal to the slope of

12
00:01:04,917 --> 00:01:10,706
the original line which is equal to negative 3. To find the equation of the

13
00:01:10,706 --> 00:01:16,668
line, I want to label my points x1 and y1. And I can use the formula m equals y

14
00:01:16,668 --> 00:01:22,926
minus y1 over x minus x1. Since I know my slope is negative 3, I can write

15
00:01:22,926 --> 00:01:29,753
negative 3 over 1. Any whole number can be written as a fraction with 1 as the

16
00:01:29,753 --> 00:01:36,398
denominator. And that's going to equal y minus y1 is 4 over x minus x1 is 2.

17
00:01:36,398 --> 00:01:42,893
When I cross multiply, I have negative 3 times x minus 2 equals 1 times y minus

18
00:01:42,893 --> 00:01:49,682
4. Now, I need to distribute. So when I distribute, I have negative 3 times x,

19
00:01:49,682 --> 00:01:56,527
negative 3 times negative 2 is positive 6 equals y minus 4. Since I want the

20
00:01:56,527 --> 00:02:04,368
answer in slope intercept form. If I just add 4 to both sides, I get negative 3x

21
00:02:04,368 --> 00:02:11,930
plus 10 equals y. And we know that's the same as y equals negative 3x plus 10.

22
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:17,184
And, one quick check, we know that the slope of the parallel line is the same as

23
00:02:17,184 --> 00:02:22,651
the slope of the original line. And, since we put the answer in slope intercept

24
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:27,982
form I can verify that it has the same slope. Now what about the perpendicular

25
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:33,919
line? Since we want to find the equation of the perpendicular line. To 3x plus y

26
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:40,281
equals 7. Once again, I start with the original slope which is negative 3, but I

27
00:02:40,281 --> 00:02:46,261
want the perpendicular slope. So the perpendicular slope is the negative

28
00:02:46,261 --> 00:02:52,178
reciplical of the original slope, which is going to be negative 1 over the

29
00:02:52,178 --> 00:02:58,932
original slope was negative 3. So a negative time a negative is a positive, so

30
00:02:58,932 --> 00:03:05,794
the slope of the perpendicular line is positive 1 3rd. Now that I know the

31
00:03:05,794 --> 00:03:13,234
slope, I can use my equation m, y minus y1, over x minus x1, which gives us 1

32
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:21,040
3rd equals y minus y 1 is 4, over x minus x 1 is 2. When I cross multiply I have

33
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:29,549
1 times x minus 2 equals 3 times y minus 4. At this point I need to distribute

34
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:35,974
again. When I multiply x minus 2 times 1, I'm just left with x minus 2 and I

35
00:03:35,974 --> 00:03:43,112
have 3 times y and 3 times negative 4 is negative 12. Since I want the equation

36
00:03:43,112 --> 00:03:50,920
in slope intercept form I need y equals, so I'm going to add 12 to both sides

37
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:58,856
and I get x plus 10 equals 3y and when I divide everything through by 3, I get y

38
00:03:58,856 --> 00:04:06,420
equals x over 3 or 1 3rd x plus 10 over 3. And that's the same as y equals 1 3rd

39
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:13,567
x plus 10 3rd. And again, I can verify my slope is supposed to be 1 3rd, because

40
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:19,623
it's the negative reciprocal of negative 3. And since we put it in slope

41
00:04:19,623 --> 00:04:25,288
intercept form, the slope is 1 3rd. If you got both these answers right, I would

42
00:04:25,288 --> 00:04:28,021
say you've learned a lot about lines.
