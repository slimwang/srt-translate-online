00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Debugging statements left in the code may even come up with a security problem.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:13,000
In Mac OS versions 10.7.2/10.7.3, there was a security issue because a programmer

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
had left debugging print statements in the code.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This would result in the following situation--you as a user would enter your password into the Mac

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
the Mac would then let you in or not let you in but at the same time would store your password

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
in the clear in, a log that would be visible for anyone--

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
anyone with access to the machine of course, and this again would require a password.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
On a multi-user machine, for instance, or somebody having physical access to a hard drive,

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
a mean checker could not go and retrieve your password in the clear,

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and that's simply because of some left debugging statement in there.
