1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,410
We're already displaying the correct
image, which is this Android party

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,790
image, so there's no need to
change the source attribute.

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,790
Similarly, the position
isn't really incorrect.

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,920
The image just needs to be larger, so

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,710
all of these layout aligned parent
attributes, we're not going to use them.

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,450
Using the id attribute in and

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,000
of itself doesn't actually make
any changes to the layout.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,750
It just give the view a name so
that you can refer to it later.

9
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,250
Now there's actually a way to use
the background attribute to achieve

10
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,980
the effect we're trying to achieve.

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,300
But it doesn't involve an image view.

12
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,140
So if you chose background,
you're technically correct, but

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,010
we're going to go about
it in a different way.

14
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,060
The way that we learned
about in the lesson.

15
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,400
This leaves us with layout_height,
layout_width, and ScaleType.

16
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,340
ScaleType will change the size of
the image within the view box that

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,380
surrounds it.

18
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,546
While layout_width and

19
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,940
layout_height will actually
change the size of that view box.

20
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,530
In this case, the image is large enough
that the view box expands to fill

21
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,740
the entire screen no matter if it's
wrapped content or matched parent.

22
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,430
Because it doesn't matter
in this particular case

23
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:01,790
whether we put matched parent or

24
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:06,220
wrapped content you don't strictly
need to change these, in this case.

25
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,530
That said, because we are trying to get
the view to expand to the entire screen,

26
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:13,350
it would probably be good to set
these explicitly as match parent.

27
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,820
Then, if we end up
using a smaller image,

28
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,260
it will still expand to
fill the entire screen.

29
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,940
But while layout height and layout width
are sort of optional in this case,

30
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,660
scale type is the actual attribute that
you're absolutely going to need to use

31
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,330
to make the image fill
the entire screen.

32
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,930
The question is,
we've chosen the attribute, but

33
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,900
we don't know the value
to set scale type to.

34
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,710
And that's what I want you to
figure out in the next question.
