00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,110
Before we move on, let's get
another perspective on AI problems

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,970
by looking at how Sebastian Thrun
describes them in his artificial

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,180
intelligence class at Udacity.

4
00:00:08,222 --> 00:00:12,380
>> I'm going to briefly talk of
AI as something else which is

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,580
AI as the technique of uncertainty
management in computer software.

6
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:23,010
Put it differently, AI is the discipline
that you apply when you want to

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,440
know what to do,
when you don't know what to do.

8
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,320
Now, there are many reasons why
there might be uncertainty

9
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,300
in a computer program.

10
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,420
It could be a sensor limit.

11
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:42,930
That is, your sensors are unable to
tell me what exactly is the case

12
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,720
outside the AI system.

13
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,050
There could be adversaries,
who act in a way that makes it hard for

14
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,130
you to understand what is the case.

15
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:57,300
It could be stochastic environments
every time you roll the dice

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,240
in a dice game, the stochasticity of
the dice will make it important and

17
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,610
impossible for you to be absolute
certain of what the situation.

18
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,210
There could be laziness.

19
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:12,140
So perhaps you can actually
compute what the situation is.

20
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,470
But your computer program
is just too lazy to do it.

21
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,070
And here's my favorite.

22
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,150
Ignorance.

23
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,700
Plain ignorance.

24
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,340
Many people are just
ignorant of what's going on.

25
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,470
They could know it, but
they just don't care.

26
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,460
All of these things are cause for
uncertainty.

27
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,590
AI is the discipline that
deals with uncertainty and

28
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,070
manages it in decision making.

29
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:39,180
>> What's interesting here, is that
Sebastian's description suggest that AI

30
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,280
is specifically about
dealing with uncertainty, and

31
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,300
to a large extent that's exactly what
artificial intelligence and machine

32
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,350
learning are about, designing programs
that can deal with uncertain input.

33
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,220
Now let's go back to our course and talk
about what AI problems actually are.
