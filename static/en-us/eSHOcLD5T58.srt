1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,150
So, we just saw what an outsourcing
conversation might look

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,300
like when it includes the entrepreneur,
a designer, and a developer.

3
00:00:07,422 --> 00:00:11,230
I want to pull out a couple of parts of
that conversation for us to focus on.

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,780
The first is a tendency
towards scope creep.

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,620
Scope creep is whenever
the first version of your app

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,840
isn't the minimum viable product.

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,730
Scope creep is bad.

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,710
It gets in the way of launching and
iterating, which means that you're

9
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,270
spending a lot more time building
things than building the right things.

10
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:27,890
As an entrepreneur,

11
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,170
you have to make sure that your
team isn't introducing scope creep.

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,310
But you also have to make sure that
you aren't introducing scope creep.

13
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:38,010
Scope creep affects both time and
budget.

14
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,460
In the consultation we just saw,

15
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,930
Carl did a very good job of
managing the scope creep.

16
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:46,030
And he was the one who suggested
that we pare down our V1 of the app.

17
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,540
In real life, that job will fall on you.

18
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,390
This idea of scope creep is especially
noticeable in the poll between

19
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,200
the developer and the designer,
James wanted to spend some time at first

20
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,230
working on the overview page,
making it gorgeous.

21
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,680
Carl noted that was actually a waste of
time for this minimum viable product.

22
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,390
Another tension you may experience, is a
designer wanting to build things custom

23
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,720
without thinking about how long it
will actually take to build them.

24
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,810
As an entrepreneur,

25
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,904
you need to be balancing budget with
the time spent by your contractors.

26
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,590
A good rule of thumb is to
launch your minimum viable

27
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,930
product without anything custom or
fancy if you can avoid it.

28
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,170
Once your app has started
getting feedback from customers,

29
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,060
you can make it as fancy and
beautiful as your designer wants.

30
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,270
Until then,
stick to the default components.
