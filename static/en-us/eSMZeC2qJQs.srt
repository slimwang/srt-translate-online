00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,364
This time, it's our x coordinate that changes. The y coordinate stays the same,

2
00:00:04,364 --> 00:00:08,900
but the x coordinate becomes negative x instead of x. We can see this happening

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,764
in our graph. All the y values of these corresponding points are the same, but

4
00:00:12,764 --> 00:00:17,050
their x values have been made negative, since we flipped across the y axis.
