1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And the answer is surprisingly high. It's 25/26, or 0.9615.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
To see if we apply Bayes rule, which multiples the prior for spam-ness

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
with the conditional probability of each word given spam.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
"Secret" carries 1/3, "is" 1/9, and "secret" 1/3 again.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We normalize this by the same expression plus the probability for

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
the non-spam case.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
5/8 is a prior.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
"Secret" is 1/15.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
"Is" is 1/15,

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and "secret" again.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This resolves to 1/216 over this expression plus 1/5400,

12
00:00:57,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and when you work it all out is 25/26.
