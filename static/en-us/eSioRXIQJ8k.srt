1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,440
So I'm going to say it's true and
the reason is an attacker who is able to

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,600
login as you is the one who is going to
cause a false positives in it.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,450
Somebody else logs in as you,
that's a false positive.

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,870
For them to succeed
in logging in as you,

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,870
now they have to successfully
attack two different factors.

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,270
They have to guess your password.

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,310
They have to steal your card.

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,410
If they have to work harder,
you increasing the complexity for

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,200
them, reducing the likelihood
they succeed at it, so

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,070
you're going to have
fewer false positives.
