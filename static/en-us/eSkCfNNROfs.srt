When answering the last quiz, i called these points very different letter names.

2
00:00:04,535 --> 00:00:08,693
But when we look at this formula for slope, it's not really clear how d and b,

3
00:00:08,792 --> 00:00:13,098
or c and a are related to one another. I think that one thing that might help us

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:18,347
is if we renamed the coordinates of these points, so that they indicated what

5
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:24,377
each coordinate actually is . Instead of A,B I'm going to call this coordinate

6
00:00:24,389 --> 00:00:30,085
x1, y1, and this point is going to become x2,y2. Using this new notation, we can

7
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:34,375
change our formula for slope. I like this form much better. To me it's way more

8
00:00:34,387 --> 00:00:38,685
clear now that this quantity on top is the difference between two y coordinates,

9
00:00:38,782 --> 00:00:43,080
and this one in the denominator is the difference between our two x coordinates.

10
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:47,295
Now note that the y coordinate of the second point comes first in the numerator,

11
00:00:47,392 --> 00:00:51,746
and the x coordinate, the second point, comes first in the denominator. The

12
00:00:51,758 --> 00:00:57,097
question I have for you now, is, does it matter which point, when I find in the

13
00:00:57,109 --> 00:01:02,267
slope between points I call x1, y1, and which one, I call x2, y2. In other

14
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:07,620
words, if I switch the position of the ones and twos in this equation for slope,

15
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,334
would I get the same slope as my answer?
