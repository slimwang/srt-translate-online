I did want to mention something very specific, here.

You should always wrap label elements around your input elements,

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,980
and their associated labeling texts, because it increases the touchable

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,760
area of the control. The only difference between these two

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,250
controls is that one of them has a label

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,480
element around it. But you'll notice, it's much easier to

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,930
touch the one with the label. The one without a

8
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,380
label, you have to actually touch the check box itself,

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,020
in order to activate the control.
