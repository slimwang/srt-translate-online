00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,590
Here are the steps we'll employ for Phase 2 in the TextBrowser example. First

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:09,030
we're going to choose an architectural style. For the check, tech, TextBrowser,

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:13,340
we're going to choose a layered, implicit invocation architectural style.

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,340
We're then going to assign the components to layers in the layered architecture.

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,000
Typically users events are at the bottom and percepts are at the top.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,300
Now we're going to determine dependencies among the layers, and

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,340
we're going to update the OCL into a, an equivalent, but what's called

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,380
a constructive format in which there's a single variable on the left hand side.
