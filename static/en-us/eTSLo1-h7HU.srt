00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,760
Here's a quiz that's very similar to
the one that you recently took on

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,520
XDR data types except this time,
we're concerned with the data

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,290
being transmitted over the network and
the encoding cost of such transmissions.

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:17,080
Let's again assume that an RPC
routine uses a variable-length array

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,930
of integers and that the array is full.

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,220
For that situation,
answer the following.

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,940
How many bytes are needed to
encode this five element array so

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,700
that it can be sent from a client to
a server where both the client and

9
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,790
the server are 32-bit machines?

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,340
In your answer, please do not
include any bytes for the headers or

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,640
the protocol related information.

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,690
And provide your final answer concerning
this encoding of this data structure

13
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:44,220
in bytes.
