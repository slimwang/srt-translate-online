1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,950
As we mentioned so far we've only done
flow estimations and pairs of images.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,950
Now one way of thinking
about doing tracking is if

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:12,670
you had more than two images you could
do some form of optical flow or, or

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:17,740
some sort motion between one image and
the next and then you could just do it

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,270
between the second image and the third,
and the third image and the fourth.

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,490
Basically you would just sort of
follow the arrows, connect the dots.

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,600
So there are a couple of
challenges to just doing that.

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,259
One as we saw, it's hard to
compute optical flow everywhere.

9
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,610
You have to have just kind of
the right types of behavior for

10
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,090
the gradient, in terms of being
able to track these features.

11
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,070
Second, there might be
large displacement so

12
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,860
between one frame and the next
something may have moved a lot and so

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,740
there's a lot of search
that has to be done.

14
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,050
And so one way of doing that is you
might want to take the dynamics

15
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:50,680
into account.

16
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,660
How is this thing moving?

17
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,430
Make a prediction.

18
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,670
And in fact that's what we're going to
spend a lot of time talking about

19
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,690
over the next couple of lessons.

20
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,820
The other problem with sort of
connecting the dots is things

21
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,840
will drift.

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,520
That is, you know, I make a little
mistake, and then a little more mistake,

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,940
a little, and eventually,

24
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,570
I'm no longer tracking the thing that I
had started wanting to keep track of.

25
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:09,710
And then finally,

26
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,792
another problem is what are called
occlusions or disocclusions, right?

27
00:01:12,792 --> 00:01:14,900
Occlusion is when
something gets occluded.

28
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,250
Disocclusion, maybe
unocclusion's a better word,

29
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,990
basically it appears from something.

30
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,840
So something appears, was it
something that had I lost before or

31
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,529
is it something new and
how do I do that kind of tracking?
