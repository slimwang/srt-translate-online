00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,518
Well, these are the 4 powers of 10 that are to be using or simplifying. Adding

2
00:00:04,518 --> 00:00:08,467
the exponents, I get 10 squared divided by 10 to the negative one. Now we

3
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:12,831
subtract these exponents and I get 10 to the 3rd. Our 10 should have a power of

4
00:00:12,831 --> 00:00:14,355
3. Great work if you got it.
