00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,940
Let's look at this whole concept a bit
more in detail with real camera paths

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,050
and stuff like that.

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,450
Let's first look at four degrees
of freedom in the image itself.

4
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,580
Here basically we're going to
look at the same video here and

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,440
let's look at translation
just the changes in x.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,250
So this is the path
that changes in x and

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,560
I'm basically traversing it over here,
and you saw happened.

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,370
Also, we can do this for y.

9
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,870
We can look for translations in y.

10
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,210
Again, y is changing as I move from
number of frames down this way.

11
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,060
We can do the same for scale.

12
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,760
This basically says the scale is getting
you know, smaller and getting bigger.

13
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,180
It was much bigger here,
and then, finally,

14
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,460
we can also look at
things like rotation.

15
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,320
So, this basically starts saying is that
these are the four parameters that now

16
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,360
we can model purely by looking at the
whole region and going into a degree of

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,520
freedom calculations, and being able to
model the transformations of the image.

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,830
This gives us the path
that we are interested in.
