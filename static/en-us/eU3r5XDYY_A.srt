1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,385
But what can we do for an equation like this? Notice that these two bases are

2
00:00:04,385 --> 00:00:11,222
different. We have 16 raised to the x power. And 4 raised to the 3rd power. The

3
00:00:11,222 --> 00:00:16,254
16 and the 4 are different bases. So, for an equation like this, we want to try

4
00:00:16,254 --> 00:00:21,390
and get the bases to match. We want them to be equal. So, we can rewrite 16

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:28,526
with a base of 4. We'll have 4 squared which is 16 raised to the x. And the

6
00:00:28,526 --> 00:00:32,398
right hand side will stay the same. We know by the properties of exponents when

7
00:00:32,398 --> 00:00:36,661
we raise a power to a power, we multiply these powers together. This means

8
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:42,962
we'll have four raised to the 2 x, equal to 4 cubed. Now, since both of the

9
00:00:42,962 --> 00:00:48,705
bases are equal, we can set 2x equal to 3. These exponents must be equal to one

10
00:00:48,705 --> 00:00:54,148
another. And finally, we divide both sides by 2 to get one x is equal to three

11
00:00:54,148 --> 00:01:01,290
halves. Now, this value for x should make sense in our original equation. We'll

12
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:05,648
have 16 raised to the three halves here. And we'll have 4 cubed on the right

13
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:10,740
hand side of our equation. We know that a fractional exponent really represents

14
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,635
a root. So, this really says that we have the square root of 16 raised to the

15
00:01:15,635 --> 00:01:22,195
3rd power. We know the square root of 16 equals 4. So we'll have four cubed

16
00:01:22,195 --> 00:01:28,846
equal to 4 cubed, so yes, this checks. You try solving this equation. Try

17
00:01:28,846 --> 00:01:32,628
rewriting these bases so that way they're the same, and then see if you can

18
00:01:32,628 --> 00:01:34,440
solve for x.
