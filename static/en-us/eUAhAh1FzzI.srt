1
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:13,332
In the first case, the answer is 0.2. And the way I got there is the property of measuring white for A is 0.6, which is the number over here.

2
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:24,632
But we have to normalize. And we find out that two particles get the white value, which is 1.2, two times 0.6.

3
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:37,899
And all the other six particles have to get a non-normalized importance weight that is 0.3, which is one minus 0.7.

4
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:47,699
So six times 0.3 is 1.8. So the normalizer in total will be three.

5
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,599
And 0.6 divided by three equals 0.2.

6
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,466
In the second question the answer is 0.08.

7
00:00:55,467 --> 00:01:05,399
Because you measure black, A gets a non-normalized importance weight of 0.4, which is one minus 0.6.

8
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,932
There are two particles that get 0.4, which adds up to 0.8.

9
00:01:10,933 --> 00:01:16,899
And six particles that get 0.7, which adds up to 4.2.

10
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:24,000
If you add this together, it's 0.4 divided by five, which is 0.08.
