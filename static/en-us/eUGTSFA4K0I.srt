00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,770
In object orientated analysis we saw that nouns could give us a good lead into

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:10,580
what the classes are going to be. Similarly verbs can be used for

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:15,160
several purposes one of which is to describe what the relationships are between

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,540
the classes. In UML there are three kinds of relationships.

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:25,550
There are associations. For example, association between people and

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,900
vehicles, people drive vehicles.

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:36,580
There's generalization, that is a car is a kind of vehicle. And

8
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:41,800
there's dependencies. There might be a dependency between cars and

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,270
pollution laws. If a pollution law changes, cars might have to be adapted.

10
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:51,370
For example, putting on some kind of pollution control device.
