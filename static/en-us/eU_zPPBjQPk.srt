1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,250
So the Boolean formula here is almost always satisfied.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:06,140
It's satisfied in this case over here.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,740
It's satisfied in this case over here and this one.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,610
The only one where it's not satisfied is this one here,

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,550
and of course that's easy to evaluate,

6
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:17,000
so if x1 and x2 and x3 evaluates to true,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,120
then we have the big not, which will make it go to 0

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,470
and 0 or 1 is equal to 1,

9
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,690
so the Boolean formula is satisfied, but 0 or 0

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,690
evaluates to 0,

11
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,520
so here the Boolean formula is not satisfied.

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,330
For these 2 cases, the Boolean formula is simply satisfied,

13
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:38,480
because if this goes to 0, then we have the big not over here,

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,060
so it will go to 1 and 1 over 1,

15
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,220
and 1 or 0 that also evaluates to 1.

16
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,540
What is this have to do with an if-then?

17
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,150
Well, it's actually quite simple.

18
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:54,200
If this part here, x1 and x2 and x3

19
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,210
evaluates to 1,

20
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,420
then this part over here

21
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,360
must also be 1 in order to satisfied the Boolean formula.

22
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,129
It does not work if this part over here is 0.

23
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,500
In the other case where x1 and x2 and x3 evaluates to 0,

24
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,210
then as you can see, we basically don't care

25
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,950
what the other variables are doing, because the Boolean formula is already satisfied,

26
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,950
and that is exactly how an if-then behaves.

27
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,520
If the condition is satisfied,

28
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,190
then we want something specific to happen.

29
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,550
If the conditions are not satisfied, we don't really care what happens,

30
00:01:26,550 --> 99:59:59,999
or at least we're not really going to force anything to happen.
