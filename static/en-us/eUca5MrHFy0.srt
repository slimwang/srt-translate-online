1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,692
So now we have an expression for the y intercept of a line with slope m that

2
00:00:04,692 --> 00:00:09,646
goes through the point s, t. What happens if we plug this expression for b into

3
00:00:09,646 --> 00:00:14,656
the general equation for slope intercept form? Write the equation that, that

4
00:00:14,656 --> 00:00:16,309
would give us in this box.
