1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,020
Okay Michael. So, let's, let's write down a few equations.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,290
Let's try to be a little bit more formal. A

3
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,340
little bit more mathematical about this idea. So, I'm going to

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,420
try to encapsulate, what we just talked about, to the

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,320
line of least commitment. By drawing another line. So, if

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,270
we think, of this top gray line, here. As sort

7
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:20,090
of the line, that gets as close to the plus

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:24,800
points as possible, without crossing over, to them, and mis-classifying them.

9
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,390
And we think of the bottom gray line, as

10
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,400
the one that gets as close as possible, to

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,180
the minus signs, without crossing over them and, and

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,650
giving mis-classification. And then the middle line, is sort

13
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:40,020
of in the happy medium. Okay? So, what you

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,450
really want from the lines, all the lines that

15
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,170
are possible, between ,these two boundary lines. If I

16
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,990
can use that language. Is that, somehow, this distance

17
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:55,340
here, is as big as possible. Can you see that?

18
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,910
>> Yeah, though it seems like the gray line, could

19
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,170
be pushed out a little more, right? because ,the minuses

20
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,270
don't bump into it. That's a good point Michael and

21
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,129
I'm going to fix that, by putting a minus sign here.

22
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:06,047
>> [LAUGH]

23
00:01:06,047 --> 00:01:07,780
>> Okay [CROSSTALK]

24
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,839
>> I see, this is [CROSSTALK]

25
00:01:08,839 --> 00:01:10,660
>> I did the best I could under the circumstances.

26
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,170
>> Data, revisionist history.

27
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:16,400
>> No, there's just an invisible point, and I just made it more visible.

28
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,110
For the sake of the reader. Okay, so, I've got these two

29
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,590
lines, these are sort of as far as I can go, without stating

30
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,290
to do mis-classification with my, my separating line, and the line in

31
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,260
the middle, we've already argued is the sort of the best one because

32
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,670
it provides the least commitment. So, that means, you want to have

33
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:36,570
a line, such that, it leaves as much space as possible, from the

34
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,590
boundaries. Alright, Michael. So let's see if we can figure out exactly,

35
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,510
what that line is like. So, the first thing, that I want to

36
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,370
do is, is introduce a little bit of notation.

37
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,580
Right? So we all remember what the equation, of

38
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,230
a line is. It's Y equals MX plus B,

39
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:52,230
that's just a general equation for a line. But,

40
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,640
here even though we're going to be drawing with lines,

41
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,590
we really want to deal with the general case,

42
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:00,750
where we're talking about hyperplanes. And generally ,when we

43
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,085
write about hyperplanes, we describe them as some output,

44
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:08,607
let's just call it y is equal to

45
00:02:08,607 --> 00:02:12,890
w transpose plus b. here, because of what we're,

46
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,200
what we're trying to do with classification, the output

47
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,090
y is going to be some value that indicates,

48
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,770
whether, you're in the positive class or you're in

49
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:23,970
the negative class. W are the parameters ,or W,

50
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,520
represents the parameters for our plane. Along with b,

51
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,890
which is what moves it out of the origin.

52
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,120
Okay, are you with me.

53
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,975
>> I think so, but that's, so may be we should get rid of that top

54
00:02:34,975 --> 00:02:37,350
,Y, because, that Y is different kind of

55
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,790
Y. Alright so the top Y is talking about

56
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,780
the Y dimension of the plane and in

57
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,360
the second equation, that Y is kind of folded

58
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,040
into the X. And we have a new

59
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,990
y, which is actually, the output of the classifier.

60
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,730
>> Right. I like it, so let's get rid

61
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,400
of that first y which is just an equation

62
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,340
for a line and let's ask what each of

63
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,120
these things are. So, let's just say that again

64
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,000
for clarity's sake. I think, you make a good point, Michael.

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,200
Y here, is going to be our classification label ,right, whenever we're

66
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,420
talking about using a linear separator, effectively, what we've been talking

67
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,470
about, which I realize now we never ever actually said explicitly, is

68
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,140
that you are taking some new point, projecting it onto the

69
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,770
line, and then looking at the value that comes out from projecting

70
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,660
it. And in this case, in particular, we want positive values

71
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,150
to mean yes, you are part of the class, and negative values

72
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,395
to mean that you aren't a part of the class. Okay?

73
00:03:23,395 --> 00:03:24,375
>> Yeap.

74
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:27,680
>> This is our classification label y.

75
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,430
W represents again, the parameters of the plane.

76
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,680
Along with b, which is what moves it in and out of the origin. So, this is

77
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,100
now, effectively, what our linear classifiers actually look

78
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:47,966
like. Even in multiple dimensions, with hyperpoints. Okay? Cool.

79
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:52,560
So, let's take that, and and, and push it, to, to sort of the next level. Let,

80
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,270
let's figure out exactly, what we would expect the

81
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:58,690
output, of our hyperplane ,to be in this example,

82
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,390
that I, I've drawn on the screen here. So,

83
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,640
we know we want to find this orange line in

84
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,930
the middle ,which has the property, that, it is your

85
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,270
decision boundary, it tells you whether you are in the

86
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:12,010
positive class or negative class, on the one hand,

87
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,990
but also, that it has the property of being, as

88
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,140
far away, from the data as possible, while still being

89
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:24,510
consistent with it. So, if you're on the decision boundary,

90
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,300
for this particular line, which again,

91
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:34,355
is w transpose x plus b. What would be, the output

92
00:04:34,355 --> 00:04:39,229
,of this classifier for any point that lies along the line?

93
00:04:41,242 --> 00:04:46,440
>> so, right. If that's decision boundary, that's where it's kind of

94
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,310
not sure ,if it's positive or negative so that should be zero.

95
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:54,510
>> Right, so the equation of this line or this hyperplane, is w transpose x

96
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:59,610
plus b equals zero. For, some set of parameters w and b, we don't

97
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,710
yet know what they are. But, what we do know, that this is the definition

98
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,410
of a hyperplane. Where the equation for

99
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,610
a hyperplane, and since it's at the decision

100
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,780
boundary ,it should give me neither a positive nor a negative output. Okay?

101
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,740
>> Yep.

102
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,710
>> Okay now, one question we can ask

103
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,500
ourselves then, if we look at these other

104
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,200
lines is well what's the equation for the

105
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,160
other grey lines? That are right at our positive

106
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,220
or negative examples. So to help you answer, that, I want to talk about what the

107
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,610
labels themselves ought to be. So ,just like

108
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,150
we did with boosting, let's say that our labels

109
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,090
are always going to be, from the set minus

110
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,836
one and plus one. We know ,that our labels

111
00:05:38,836 --> 00:05:41,310
,are minus 1 and plus 1. And so we're

112
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,470
going to take advantage of that fact, by saying well.

113
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:47,710
The line that brushes up, against ,the positive example.

114
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,680
We want it to be the case ,since, we

115
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,106
know those labels are going to be plus 1.

116
00:05:52,106 --> 00:05:57,330
That, the output ,of that particular line, that particular linear

117
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,980
separator, would be plus 1, on the very

118
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,390
first point, that it encounters. Does that make sense?

119
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,050
>> Yeah

120
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:04,580
>> Okay

121
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,250
>> That way the things, that are, that it's you

122
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,330
know that are kind of past the line are going to be above

123
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,470
1 and the things are before the line, in that

124
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,614
kind of demilitarized zone, are going to be between zero and 1.

125
00:06:13,614 --> 00:06:15,250
>> Right, so in fact given what you

126
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,580
just said, what is the equation of that line?

127
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,610
>> Oh I see. So, it should, be the W transpose x plus b equals,

128
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,340
1 for the top gray line.

129
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,970
>> That's exactly right. And by a similar argument,

130
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,140
where would you say the, the line of the

131
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,570
hyperplane should be for the bottom gray line? Analogously,

132
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,130
it seems like that one should be minus one.

133
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:39,720
>> Right. So, we, we have the decision boundary,

134
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,290
we're looking at, and we know that the equation of

135
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,380
the line is w transposed x plus b is zero.

136
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,640
We know that if we slid that line, towards the

137
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,470
positive values, we would end up with w transposed

138
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,460
x plus b equals one. And if we slid it

139
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,410
towards the negative values, we'd end up with, equals

140
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:59,610
minus one, now we can ask ourselves, how this helps

141
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,320
us. And it helps us in a very a

142
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,580
simple way. We know that we want the boundary condition

143
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:10,090
line, the one that is actually our decision boundary, to

144
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:13,080
be as far as possible from both our positive and

145
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,220
negative examples, so that would mean then, and

146
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,544
I hope you buy this Michael, that the

147
00:07:18,544 --> 00:07:22,950
distance ,between the two gray lines, which are

148
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:26,160
parallel, to that line, needs to also be maximum.

149
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,950
>> Yeah, that's exactly what we want.

150
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:33,470
>> Right, so we want this vector here, to have, the maximum link that we

151
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:36,000
can have. Okay, so, how are we going to

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,880
figure out how long, that particular line is?

153
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,500
So, here is a simple idea. Well, the

154
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,590
lines are parallel to one another. We can pick

155
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:48,810
points on that line ,to define, that particular distance

156
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,410
there. So, just because, it's really easy to do

157
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:54,500
the math, I'm going to chose a point here

158
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,250
and a point here. Those points have the property,

159
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,940
that ,if I draw the line between them, you

160
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,530
get a line ,that is, perpendicular, to the two

161
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:08,980
gray lines. Okay?And I don't know what those x values are, but

162
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,020
I do, I'm just going to call, them x1 and x2. That seem fair?

163
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,560
>> Hm, I guess that seems as good a name as any.

164
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,600
>> And that is going to define the two points that

165
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,510
I have, and the distance between them, is in fact going to

166
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:26,340
be or the, the vector, that is defined by their difference

167
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,630
is in fact going to have the length that tells you how far

168
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,150
apart those two lines are. Which in turn

169
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,650
because of the way that we've constructed them Tells

170
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:38,520
you how far apart your boundary decision line is

171
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,409
from the data and we ant that to be

172
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:42,669
maximal ,because then we made the least commitment to

173
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:46,120
the data. So, let's write that down as algebra.

174
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,414
The equation for our positive line so to speak

175
00:08:50,414 --> 00:08:55,760
,is ,therefore w transpose x1 plus b equals 1.

176
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,540
And all I've done there is substitute, some point, I don't have to know what is,

177
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:04,930
it's going to turn out, that gives me some point on that line, okay? It

178
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:10,460
gives me, puts me in some particular place, on that line. And similarly, I

179
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:16,460
can do the same thing, for my negative line. And get w transpose x2,

180
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:21,250
plus b equals minus 1. Now, we want the distance between,

181
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,220
these two, hyperplanes or these two lines, in this

182
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,160
example, to be maximal. And in order to figure

183
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,510
out what, that means, we need to know exactly,

184
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,400
what that line is. So, it's, it's the difference between

185
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,090
the two. So, we can just use our, our

186
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:39,370
favorite trick, when we're doing systems of linear equations.

187
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,010
And, just subtract the two lines. We basically have,

188
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:46,160
two equations and two unknowns. And, we simply subtract them,

189
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,220
from one another. So, that we can get

190
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,240
a single equation. That happens to represent, the

191
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,740
distance, between them. So, if I subtract the

192
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,830
two from one another, what do I get?

193
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:55,180
>> Quiz.

194
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,530
>> Oh, I like that, we get a quiz. That is the correct answer. Even

195
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,260
though it seems like a tightness match,

196
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,829
in fact quiz, is the correct answer [LAUGH]
