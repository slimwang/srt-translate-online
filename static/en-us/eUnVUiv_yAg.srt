1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:07,950
The inverse of this function would be negative 1,5, 3, negative 2, and 2,6.

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,238
Great thinking if you found these three coordinates. Now, what you want to

3
00:00:12,238 --> 00:00:17,694
notice is that the inputs and the outputs switch for the inverse function. In

4
00:00:17,694 --> 00:00:21,513
other words, notice how a, b, and c were always the input for the first

5
00:00:21,513 --> 00:00:27,539
function we looked at. Whereas in the inverse function, a, b and c were all

6
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:33,284
outputs. Another way of thinking about it is that the x and y coordinate always

7
00:00:33,284 --> 00:00:40,060
switched. So, here for x I had a, and for y I had 2. In the inverse function

8
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:46,750
the x value is 2 and the y value is a. This is also true for these other two

9
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:53,655
points. The x value and the y value switched. The same was true for this last

10
00:00:53,655 --> 00:00:58,270
point. So, to find this inverse function we simply switch the x and the y

11
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:04,444
values for each coordinate pair. That's how we wind up with this function. Keep

12
00:01:04,444 --> 00:01:09,994
in mind that inverse functions undo the original function. So, if I put in 5, I

13
00:01:09,994 --> 00:01:15,369
get an output of negative 1. So, to undo that, when I put in my negative 1 to

14
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:20,480
my inverse, I want to get out the output of 5, the original input.
