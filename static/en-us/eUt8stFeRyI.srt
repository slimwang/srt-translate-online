1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,060
So, as Dr.Rosenberg just described, it was Charles Darwin who first, conducted

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:10,371
research on emotion expression. He argued that emotions were expressed

3
00:00:10,371 --> 00:00:15,674
similarly in humans, and in even non-human animals sometimes. And this is the

4
00:00:15,674 --> 00:00:20,075
idea of universality. Emotions are universally expressed, in similar ways, all

5
00:00:20,075 --> 00:00:23,916
over the world. So a smile, for instance, is a smile regardless of who

6
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:28,926
expresses it. But Darwin's work was not systematic. So in the 1960's, Paul

7
00:00:28,926 --> 00:00:35,287
Ekman and his colleague Wallace Friesen took up Darwin's work. And became more

8
00:00:35,287 --> 00:00:40,068
systematic and more scientific. They conducted research on universality in

9
00:00:40,068 --> 00:00:45,010
western cultures, and found universality. That is, people expressed emotions

10
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:50,377
very much the same way, and interpreted them very much the same way. But this

11
00:00:50,377 --> 00:00:55,136
was just in the west. It wasn't a true test of universality. So, in the late

12
00:00:55,136 --> 00:00:59,735
1960s, Paul Ekman and an anthropologist went to Papua New Guinea to conduct

13
00:00:59,735 --> 00:01:04,929
research. And they went to Papua New Guinea because it was a preliterate

14
00:01:04,929 --> 00:01:10,250
culture that had no contact whatsoever at that time to the west. And he found

15
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:15,353
evidence for universality, anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and

16
00:01:15,353 --> 00:01:21,158
surprise. And later on, he and his colleagues, found universal evidence for

17
00:01:21,158 --> 00:01:22,679
contempt.
