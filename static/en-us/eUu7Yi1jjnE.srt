1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,521
it turns out the value of X would be 84 when Y is &amp; and Z is 1. Nice work if you

2
00:00:05,521 --> 00:00:10,378
figured that one out. We know the values for X1, Y1, and Z1 so we plug those in

3
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:15,690
here. We are looking for the X value when Y is 7 and Z is 1, so we plug in 7 and

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:21,278
1 in these positions. We can think of these numbers as being the second case

5
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:26,768
We're looking for x 2, which is x, and we know the second y value is 7, and the

6
00:00:26,768 --> 00:00:32,030
second z value is 1. We use these lists to make our substitution. We simplify

7
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:37,474
this right hand side to get 5 42nds. Next we multiply both sides of the equation

8
00:00:37,474 --> 00:00:42,378
by the LCD, 42x. Essentially, this is the same as cross-multiplying. So we get

9
00:00:42,378 --> 00:00:48,972
5x on the right and 420 on the left. We divide both sides by 5 to get x is equal

10
00:00:48,972 --> 00:00:49,492
to 84.
