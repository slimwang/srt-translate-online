1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,240
So here's my getGeofencingRequest method

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,580
that returns
a GeofencingRequest objects.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,081
I'm going to create
a GeofencingRequest.Builder called

4
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:10,700
builder.

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,530
And to this I call two methods.

6
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,870
First is to set the initial trigger.

7
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,990
And I'm going to set that my initial
trigger is an INITIAL_TRIGGER_ENTER,

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,710
which is a notification when
the Geofence is added and

9
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,280
if the device is already
inside that Geofence.

10
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,820
Then I'm going to add the Geofences
that I want to monitor and

11
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,090
that's just my mGeofenceList.

12
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,570
I call addGeofences to add them to it,
and

13
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,870
then I returned builder.build to get my
GeofencingRequest back to the caller.

14
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,680
It's as simple as that.
