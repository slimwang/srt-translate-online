00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,730
The journey in this lesson should have given you a good idea of how it is

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:12,710
possible to innovate under the covers. Externally, Sun was still

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,030
peddling UNIX boxes, but internally they

4
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,940
had completely revolutionized the structure of the

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,250
network operating system through the use

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,490
of object technology. If fact, the subcontract

7
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:30,850
mechanism that Sun invented as part of the Spring system forms the

8
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:35,400
basis for something that many of you who are Java programmers are using

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:41,210
a lot, namely Java RMI. In this lesson that you're

10
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:46,580
going to look at, we are going to study Java RMI and also Enterprise JavaBeans.
