Now I'm going to show you a little bit of APA style for confidence intervals.

2
00:00:03,502 --> 00:00:07,942
Usually you put them in parentheses. But we often start by saying what kind of

3
00:00:07,942 --> 00:00:11,748
interval is this? So, it may some, say something like, here's the confidence

4
00:00:11,748 --> 00:00:15,574
interval on the mean difference and we present it this way. We'd state the

5
00:00:15,574 --> 00:00:19,846
level of confidence. Say that we're using a confidence interval which we can

6
00:00:19,846 --> 00:00:25,090
abbreviate CI, equals, and then in parentheses the lower limit. Comma upper

7
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,240
limit. An alternative way of presenting this is as follows. We could put 4,

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,822
with a dash 6. Another alternative way is actually writing the word to in there

9
00:00:33,822 --> 00:00:34,559
to.
