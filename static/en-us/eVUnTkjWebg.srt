1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,170
Email marketing goes under
the umbrella of inbound marketing.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,420
Email is the workhorse of marketing.

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,400
However, you need to learn how
to use it right, and well, so

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,620
you can actually add
value to your users.

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,650
Otherwise, you're just
another spam in the inbox.

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,820
Now there are a ton of platforms out
there that can help you manage your

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:16,680
email marketing.

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,550
Most have some basic free features,

9
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,330
so, you can consider email marketing
as a free marketing channel.

10
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,820
You can break email
into two main purposes.

11
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,230
Both engagement and acquisition.

12
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,670
Email can be use as a way
to keep people engaged.

13
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,031
Whether it's about a new
feature announcement or

14
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:34,310
continue engaging in your product.

15
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:39,030
On the other hand, emails also used by
many e-commerce sites to drive sales

16
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,330
in acquire new customers.

17
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:41,900
So what's important in an email?

18
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,140
Well first,
you need to establish a goal and

19
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,130
you need to develop the right
messaging for your audience.

20
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,780
Now based on your knowledge of
your audience, and how you're

21
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,400
positioning yourself, you should know
the tone of voice for your company.

22
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,500
You should use the same tone of voice in
your social posts, your blog posts, and

23
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,890
in your emails.

24
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,390
And just like in the rest of marketing,
you should be testing your message and

25
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,400
adapting to what works best for
your audience.

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,450
With email marketing and
the different messaging platforms,

27
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,210
you're going to want to make sure
you're tracking some important things.

28
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:15,630
Like opens, clicks, unsubscribes and
click through rates.

29
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,000
Now, depending on the metric your
optimizing for, which is, of course,

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,440
determined by your goal, you'll test
different components of the email.

31
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,940
For example, if your goal is
to increase the open rate.

32
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,950
Then you're going to want to test your
subject line to get more people to

33
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,770
actually open that email.

34
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:34,460
If your overall goal for
your email is to increase sales,

35
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,900
then the subject line
isn't going to be enough.

36
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,400
The body of the email is going to have
to drive those sales, so using a clear

37
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,780
call to action and those hooks that
really attract your customers.
