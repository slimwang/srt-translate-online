00:00:00,602 --> 00:00:03,330
So would you use commonsense reasoning to design an agent that could answer

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,760
Raven's progressive matrices? Here you might make two connections. First you

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,320
could connect primitive actions of agents, to primitive transformations in

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,800
these matrices. Different problems could be composed out of a finite set of

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,190
possible transformations. What would those primitive transformations be?

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,470
And what would the action frames involved in each transformation look like?

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,390
Second, you might connect those individual primitive actions to

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,090
higher level transformations. What would your primitive transformations be?

9
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,000
And what common higher level transformations are possible?

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,930
What primitive actions would result in those higher level transformations? And

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,640
how would composing these like this, actually help you

12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,040
solve Raven's progressive matrices? In a way that you couldn't do otherwise?
