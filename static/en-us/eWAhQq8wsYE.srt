00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,450
Great job on creating your hello server.

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,440
Now that we have a working web server,

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,290
let's see if we can add some
CRUD operations to our site.

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,180
This will be a fun activity, where
you'll finally bring together all of

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,540
the major aspects you've learned
about creating data-driven websites.

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,700
In this next section, you are going
to modify our web server code,

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,190
such that we can create,
read, update, and

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,900
delete restaurants from our
restaurant menu database.

9
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,490
I will be adding these features
in the next five sections,

10
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,190
divided up into objectives.

11
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,900
I highly encourage you to read through
the objective's descriptions that I'll

12
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,380
be presenting in a moment, and

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,500
attempt to solve them before
seeing the solution videos.

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,820
Up until now,
we've been moving pretty quickly.

15
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,660
But this is an opportunity to slow down,
and

16
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,940
get messy,
figuring out these challenges.

17
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,840
I'll be sharing my answers with you,
but through this process you

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,610
might even create more elegant
solutions than my own.

19
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:47,930
Before we get started coding,

20
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,980
let me list off the objectives I
want to complete for this project.

21
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,460
Listing objectives helps me to
understand the scope of my project and

22
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,920
create identifiable
milestones along the way.

23
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,550
These objectives should also serve
as guidelines you should follow to

24
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,110
complete this project.

25
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,870
The goal of objective one is to
modify the webserver.py file,

26
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,230
so that opening local hosts or
8080/restaurants,

27
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:11,180
the user sees a list of all
the restaurant names in the database.

28
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,940
To complete objective two,
after the name of each restaurant,

29
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,680
there should be a link to edit and
delete each restaurant.

30
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,400
These links don't have to work for now.

31
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,800
They should just be visible.

32
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,930
The third objective goal is to add
code such that there is a page to

33
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,850
create new restaurants, with a form for
writing the new restaurant name.

34
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,350
The form should create a post request
that creates a new restaurant menu item

35
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,610
in the database.

36
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,270
To complete objective four, we enhance
the web server such that users can

37
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:39,560
rename a restaurant and persist
this edit to the database via post.

38
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,580
And the last objective
creates a feature,

39
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,280
such that by clicking Delete,
takes the user to a confirmation page.

40
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,540
That then sends a post command to

41
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,370
the database to delete
the selected restaurant.

42
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,840
If you don't get it on the first attempt
or have to spend some time debugging or

43
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,090
looking things up online, that's okay.

44
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,450
Even the best of programmers
have to debug code.

45
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,800
Try to spend about three hours working
on each of the objectives before viewing

46
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,670
the solutions if you're still
relatively new to programming.

47
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,900
Don't forget to use your resources
like the Python documentation, and

48
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,520
tools like the source code inspector in
Chrome to help you debug your program,

49
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,870
and don't hesitate to ask
questions in the forum.

50
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,690
I'll be going over the solution
to this challenge piece by piece,

51
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,980
solving each objective in order,
once you're finished with an object,

52
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,900
continue to the next video to see
my implementation of the solution.
