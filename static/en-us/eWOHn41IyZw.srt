00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,873
Try multiplying these radicals out. Keep in mind that you have a cubed root

2
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:08,541
here. Now when we multiply it we don't change the index of the root. We just

3
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:12,476
multiply by what's underneath. Then when we simplify, since we have a cubed

4
00:00:12,476 --> 00:00:15,638
root we only want to take out factors that appear three times underneath the

5
00:00:15,638 --> 00:00:20,182
radical. Use your knowledge of power divided by roots. And your knowledge of

6
00:00:20,182 --> 00:00:22,299
factors, to get to the simplified form.
