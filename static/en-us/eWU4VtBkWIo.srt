1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The first real solution to this problem,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
and one that is frequently still used today,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
is called Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It was first published by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
in a very famous 1976 paper.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It was actually discovered a few years earlier than that

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
by Malcolm Williamson, who was working at the

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
British government communication headquarters.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This is the successor to Bletchley Park.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It was kept classified, so Williamson didn't get credit for this,

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and it wasn't known that it had been discovered earlier there until quite recently.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And this idea came from a paper that Diffie and Hellman published in 1976.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I mentioned Shannon's paper as one of the 3 most important papers in cryptography.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This is one of the other 3.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The third one--and I'm not trying to put these 3 in order, just chronologically--

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
is the RSA paper that we'll talk about a little later.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But this paper really introduced the idea of public-key cryptography.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It didn't provide a solution.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It provided a solution to part of the problem.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
They started with this introduction about we're on the brink

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
of a revolution in cryptography and posed the question of

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
can we build cryptographic tools that are the equivalent

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
to a written signature?

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
There are lots of other kinds of applications

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
they talked about in the paper as well as the idea of

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
basing crypto systems on known hard problems

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
or believed to be hard problems.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The one solution that is in the paper that we're going to talk about today

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
is this Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol,

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and it's actually quite a simple protocol.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's still very widely used, and it allows 2 parties

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
without any prior agreement to be able to establish a shared secret key.
