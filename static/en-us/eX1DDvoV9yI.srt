When a is 0, all f of x ends up being is 0 to the x. And that actually just

2
00:00:06,292 --> 00:00:10,100
equals 0 for every value of x except for 0, since 0 to the 0 power is not

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:18,840
defined. When a equals 1, f of x just equals 1 to the x. And that simplifies to

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,540
1. Since both of these are constant functions, they're just horizontal lines.

5
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,860
That's not very interesting. Horizontal lines are definitely not exponential

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,959
functions. That's why a can't equal 0 or 1 for this general form of our

7
00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:33,029
exponential function.
