1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,450
Here the example was this is my smaller images and

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,440
I want to generate a larger images like this.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,550
Now, here we do a couple of additional things.

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,020
The idea here is you want to generate a larger image,

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,600
but we also want to capture the perspective.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,060
There are only two flowers in this image which you can see them replicated here.

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,750
Replicated different ways here, but this allows us to

8
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,030
just like the strawberry image, we can actually do this across the thing.

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,090
But how do you make them smaller?

10
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,620
Well, what you can do is you can actually make smaller images of this.

11
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,880
Remember the pyramid representation that allowed us to look at different

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,070
aspects of different scales of an image.

13
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,730
Here we can actually now find smaller images and

14
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,110
add them into the representation and basically add a function that says,

15
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,940
as you go away on top, make the shorter one show up there,

16
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,300
because the four short mingle perspective is visible in that axis.

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,820
And that way now I can generate a much larger image, and

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,890
as I go further into the scene, the flowers get smaller.

19
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,280
And of course, you do see they are the same flowers, just merged differently.
