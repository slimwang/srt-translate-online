00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,490
So now that we have
a functioning Flask application,

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,220
let's bring our CRUD
functionality into it.

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,720
I will import the code for
SQLAlchemy and

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,130
the database engine in sessionmaker
like in Lessons 1 and 2.

5
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,780
Now I'm going to change my
HelloWorld function such that it

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,720
performs this following query to grab
the first restaurant out of my database.

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,578
And list out all of the menu items and
stored in a string called output.

8
00:00:20,578 --> 00:00:23,670
I'll also add a break line tag to
make my output a bit easier to read.

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,690
I will return this output string so
that my user sees it from the browser.

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,720
When I save my Python file my flask
server instantly refreshes itself.

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,840
So when I refresh the page I now
see all of my menu items listed
