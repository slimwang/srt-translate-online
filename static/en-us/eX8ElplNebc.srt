1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,460
There are two options.

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:05,680
One is we look at cost and
risk reduction.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,000
So one is $100K.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,751
That is reducing the risk by 150.

5
00:00:10,751 --> 00:00:14,600
The other one is 250 and
reducing the risk by 500.

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,920
So, the question is,
which solution would you recommend?
