1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,730
Let's play with this Softmax
function for a little bit.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:09,220
Let's say you have a classifier which
outputs three scores for three classes.

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,810
My question is, what probability
does the Softmax function give you?

4
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:18,300
Define the function softmax(x) to
compute the softmax probability values

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,920
given this set of scores.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,650
Let's plot how the probabilities
vary as we modify the scores,

7
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,940
for example, of the first class.

8
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,000
Note that the scores that
are passed through the softmax here

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,090
can be an numpy array with one row for
each score, three in this case.

10
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:38,300
And some arbitrary number of columns,
one for each sample.

11
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,000
Your function should be able
to handle such input and

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,150
return a numpy array of the same shape.
