00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,800
We just plug these into our regression formula. Our predicted number of days

00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:14,170
then will be 2.763 minus 0.149, times 5 plus 0.093 times 7, the self-esteem

3
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:23,467
score. We get about 2.7. So, we predict that a person with these scores would

00:00:23,467 --> 00:00:28,040
have drunk alcohol almost three days in the last month.
