00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,390
Before we start, this is important. Save your code away for this exercise.

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,778
You'll use it as the basis for the next exercise. We don't start the next

3
00:00:07,778 --> 00:00:11,358
exercise with the solution for this one. At this point, you should be using a

4
00:00:11,358 --> 00:00:15,910
text editor for these exercises. I like Notepad ++. Others like SublimeText, and

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,320
there's plenty of others out there. By saving code snippets around, you can look

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,930
these over in future exercises and see what you did. In this exercise you'll

7
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,529
make a flower, you'll start with this a stem and stamen of a flower with the

8
00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:30,380
single petal part, a comb sort of stuck in the stem. I start you off with this

9
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:34,327
cone which is a child of the petal which is a child of the flower as a whole.

10
00:00:34,328 --> 00:00:37,938
Your job is to make 24 instances of this petal and form a flower. You'll need to

11
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:41,920
use rotational [unknown] angles applied in the proper order. And translations.

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,312
And you'll need to apply these to the cone object and to the petal object which

13
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:48,514
is its parent. Note that all the tips of the cones meet in the middle of the

14
00:00:48,514 --> 00:00:49,424
sphere, the stamen.
