00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,644
What other information can we learn about this function? Well how about this?

2
00:00:04,644 --> 00:00:09,333
Is it even, is it odd, or is it neither one of those? Remember that for an even

3
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:14,389
function, f of x will be equal to f of negative x. And for an odd function, f

4
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:18,722
of x is equal to negative f of negative x. So, you can try plugging in

5
00:00:18,722 --> 00:00:21,712
different positive and negative values and see if it fits into either of these

6
00:00:21,712 --> 00:00:23,370
two categories.
