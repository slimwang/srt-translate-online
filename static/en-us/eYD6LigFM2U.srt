00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,380
Now, one thing I'll be doing throughout all my lessons,

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:06,410
is I'm going to start off each lesson with a list of objectives for that lesson.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,320
And then we'll try to see if we can match and

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,420
have you learn about those specific things in that specific lesson.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,010
The four specific objectives for this lesson are, is one again, for

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,260
you to start thinking about a digital image and look at representations of

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,440
an image with, in terms of pixels, and at the resolution of that image.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,850
I will cover basics of how we would actually represent that image as in

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:32,479
a discrete form using a matrix, or in a continuous form as a function.

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,630
We will be looking at the other foundations of grayscale and color images.

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,640
And I'll also be touching on how digital images and the file formats and

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,940
stuff like that are used.

13
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,850
What is actually in those files that you've gotten used to

14
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,560
seeing on your cameras and your computers?
