1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,460
Now it's time to dive in and

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:04,250
start exploring how to
create our own watch faces.

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,950
The best way to start is to look at
some of the existing samples and

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,240
see how they work.

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,120
So go to File, Import Sample,
and type in Watchface.

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,310
You can create this with
all the default values.

7
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,870
If you expand the Wearable Project,

8
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,970
you'll see there are many
services defined here.

9
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,880
The sample actually includes
more than one watch face.

10
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,550
And we'll see how their defined
shortly and what they do.

11
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,395
So now, you should build and install
the application side to the phone.

12
00:00:27,395 --> 00:00:30,300
Include the green play button.

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,220
And then also, build and
install the wearable side as well.

14
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,950
Note that you won't be able
to select a default activity

15
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,860
because neither of these contain one.

16
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,760
So let's run this and
see what it looks like now on the watch.

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,560
On the watch we can select
a watch face by pressing and

18
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,220
holding on the current watch face.

19
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,600
You'll then see a selector appear.

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,980
If you scroll to the right,
you'll see sample analog.

21
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,060
Select that.

22
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,315
You'll see it shows the time with
hands and to ticking seconds.

23
00:00:55,315 --> 00:00:57,285
Now let's select sample sweep.

24
00:00:57,285 --> 00:00:59,825
This one is very similar
to the sample analog

25
00:00:59,825 --> 00:01:03,395
except you'll notice the second
hand has a smooth sweeping motion.

26
00:01:03,395 --> 00:01:07,695
This refreshes much faster than once per
second to achieve this smooth motion.

27
00:01:07,695 --> 00:01:09,905
Now let's select sample card balance.

28
00:01:09,905 --> 00:01:13,045
This one's not meant to be used as a
watch face, but it's meant to be used to

29
00:01:13,045 --> 00:01:16,290
help you visualize
the dimensions of the beat card.

30
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,990
Now let's select sample tilt.

31
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,950
This is implemented using Open GL and

32
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,600
shows how you can apply arbitrary
3D rotations to a watch face.

33
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,380
Now let's select sample calendar.

34
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,500
This is interesting because it actually
looks at the calendar on your phone and

35
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,610
determines how many meetings
you have coming up and

36
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,130
presents this in a watch face.

37
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,081
So this is an example of how you
can implement awareness about your

38
00:01:35,081 --> 00:01:36,860
users schedule as part of a watch face.

39
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,060
Let's go to sample digital.

40
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,870
You'll notice this one has
a little gear icon underneath.

41
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,550
This allows you to actually configure
the watch face locally from an activity.

42
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,850
So let's select a red background.

43
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:48,880
Now, interestingly,

44
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,500
we can also go to the phone and
start up the Android Wear companion app.

45
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,610
You'll see that Sample Digital
is selected here, too,

46
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,760
and there's also a little gear icon.

47
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,840
You can click on that and

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,820
there are more configuration
options available for the watch.

49
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,240
You'll see how the red background that
we selected earlier is shown here.

50
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,700
This sample actually uses the data API
to synchronize the selections between

51
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,130
the phone and the wearable.

52
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,920
So you can make changes on either side
like adjusting the text color here or

53
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,650
the background here.
