1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,460
As an exploratory quiz,

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:04,760
try running the following
command in a Linux environment.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,080
This command lists the contents
off a directory, in this case,

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,650
the /dev directory.

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:12,980
The question to you, then,

6
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:17,440
is what are some of the device names
that you see when you run this command?

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,040
Enter at least five of those
device names in a comma separated

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,910
list in this text box.

9
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,930
And, if you don't have access
to some other Linux environment,

10
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,890
you may use the Ubuntu VMs
that are provided this course.

11
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,920
The instructor notes
have a download link.
