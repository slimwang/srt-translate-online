1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,600
Quantitive research is effectively
research with numbers.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,480
Those numbers could be test grades.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,580
They could be scores on
some attitude inventory.

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,100
They could really be any kind
of objective measure of reality.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,080
The really nice thing about quantitive
research is it gives us a toolbox of

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,130
analyses we can use with our data to
understand the conclusions of it.

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,760
We could, for example, compare the means
of two different groups to see if one

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,820
outperformed another on some task.

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,060
We could analyze how a group of
students performed after getting

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,760
some intervention from us to see if some
measure of their performance improved.

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,960
So the nice thing about quantitative
research is it has a suite of

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,656
tools we can use to create
easy-to-understand,

13
00:00:36,656 --> 00:00:39,910
easy-to-defend conclusions
about our research.

14
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:42,180
Now two places we get a lot
of quantitative data for

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,410
quantitative research are controlled
experiments and survey results.

16
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,090
But those aren't the only two places.

17
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,300
So here we'll talk about the different
places we can get quantitative data for

18
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,680
this kind of research and

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,230
some of the different analyses we
can use to process this research.
