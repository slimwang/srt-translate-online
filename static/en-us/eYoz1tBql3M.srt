So reflecting on the long division problem we just did in the last quiz, how

2
00:00:03,816 --> 00:00:07,470
can the results of this problem give us a new way to rewrite the polynomial we

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:13,492
started out with? 4x squared minus 4x plus 1. Can you write this instead as the

4
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:17,712
product of two polynomials? Now just so you know I would like you not to write

5
00:00:17,712 --> 00:00:22,830
1 and then this expression as the two polynomials. Pick two new polynomials.
