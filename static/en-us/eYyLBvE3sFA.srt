1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,480
I'll show you my implementation.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,560
First off, I'm using date.now, and

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,010
I'm storing it to dateSubmitted in this object literal.

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,720
This is what becomes our note.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,270
By the way, in case you're interested,

6
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,740
that number is the number of milliseconds since January 1st,1970.

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,000
Fun fact.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,830
Well anyway, this is simple enough.

9
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,530
I'm just storing our current time into the dateSubmitted property.

10
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,140
Now, I've also added something down here in the view.

11
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,100
Down here in the view,

12
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,260
I've added a little piece of functionality to the render function.

13
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,010
When render is called, the date gets put into the HTML string.

14
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,570
Now a little note about this thing here.

15
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,860
I'm actually making a new date with that number, and

16
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,600
then I'm converting it to a string.

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,220
That ends up looking something like this.

18
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,120
Now it's not the most beautiful, readable date, but you can go in and

19
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,650
use some of the date methods to make it better if you'd like.

20
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,250
But the coolest thing is,

21
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,440
if you look back the amount of code hasn't really changed much at all.

22
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,640
We just have this one new line in the view, and

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,200
this one new line here where we create our notes.

24
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,270
Now one quick sidenote about this being in the octopus.

25
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:13,340
Strictly speaking, you can make the argument that this is kind of dataish.

26
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,990
Maybe it should be in the model.

27
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,060
And that's a totally legitimate argument.

28
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,660
In fact, a lot of organizational paradigms and

29
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:24,020
frameworks put this kind of a thing in the model itself.

30
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:28,420
Now for simplicity in this particular example, I'm not doing that.

31
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,740
I'm just creating an object literal right here, but

32
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,600
later on in the course, you'll see some of the interesting and

33
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,140
slightly more complicated ways that people form models.
