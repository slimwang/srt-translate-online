1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,744
Although this scale can be useful for helping determining situations that may

2
00:00:03,744 --> 00:00:06,830
be stressful, it's important to know that we can also experience many small

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:12,692
hassles throughout the day, and that can lead to stress. So the accumulation of

4
00:00:12,692 --> 00:00:16,462
minor irritations, such as waking up late for work, getting stuck in traffic,

5
00:00:16,462 --> 00:00:21,971
doing poorly on a test or even your significant other not calling you back. All

6
00:00:21,971 --> 00:00:27,388
those things can add up and the result is stress. However, it's important to

7
00:00:27,388 --> 00:00:32,240
note that what you may find stressful, I may not. Therefore, stress is what we

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,698
call an individual response. The important thing to remember here is that it's

9
00:00:36,698 --> 00:00:42,138
the person's perceived ability to meet the demands of the situation. That

10
00:00:42,138 --> 00:00:45,970
determine whether or not it's stressful. For example, what you may find

11
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:50,346
stressful, I may not. Now, this skill is used for, but it doesn't tell us

12
00:00:50,346 --> 00:00:54,820
everything about every type of stressful situation. In addition there are some

13
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,110
items that are a bit outdated. For example, one item says, wife begins or stops

14
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:04,620
working. Nothing about a husband working, or a partner working, just a wife.

15
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,782
Now, this leads us to the second way to look at stress, and that is stress as a

16
00:01:07,782 --> 00:01:12,456
response. When we see that everybody handles stress differently, we're talking

17
00:01:12,456 --> 00:01:15,858
about how does that person handle stress, both psychologically, as well as

18
00:01:15,858 --> 00:01:20,236
physiologically. Now we're going to go to Lauren, and look at the psychological

19
00:01:20,236 --> 00:01:22,650
vantage point of how people handle stress.
