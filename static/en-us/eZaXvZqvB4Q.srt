00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,860
I rearranged things on the screen here a
little bit. just so I'd have room to write

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,264
my answer out, but this is all the
information that you had to start the last

3
00:00:07,264 --> 00:00:12,307
quiz with. Remember, from our practice
using substitution before, that if we see

4
00:00:12,319 --> 00:00:16,091
a variable in one equation, but we know
that that variable is = to some other

5
00:00:16,104 --> 00:00:20,387
expression, then we can substitute in that
alternate expression in the place of the

6
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,834
original variable. So, in the case of w
and n, for example, we have these two

7
00:00:24,846 --> 00:00:31,216
numbers that we can now replace them with.
So, we see w here, 402w, and w here, w = 30.

8
00:00:31,216 --> 00:00:35,729
So I can take the 30, and move it into
this slot. And I can do the same thing

9
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:40,343
with n and 12. I'm going to rewrite this
side of the equation again, but this time

10
00:00:40,343 --> 00:00:46,111
with our new numbers plugged in. In place
of w I put 30 and in place of n I put 12.

11
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:51,970
Now we need to recall our understanding of
order of operations. So PEMDAS. The thing

12
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:56,624
we need to decide here is whether we
multiply or we add first. Since we have we

13
00:00:56,624 --> 00:00:59,642
have two terms that are multiplied and
another two terms that are multiplied but

14
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:03,562
then also an addition sign. In our past
practice with simplifying expressions we

15
00:01:03,562 --> 00:01:07,075
always simplified within each term, or
multiplied everything out, before we

16
00:01:07,087 --> 00:01:11,176
combined like terms or added, and that's
completely in line with PEMDAS. Remember,

17
00:01:11,267 --> 00:01:14,924
this is an acronym to help you remember
the order in which you do different

18
00:01:14,936 --> 00:01:19,000
mathematical operations within a given
expression. So the M here, which stands for

19
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:23,723
multiplication, comes before the A, which
stands for addition. So we're going to do

20
00:01:23,723 --> 00:01:32,106
our multiplication first. 402 times 30 =
12,060, and 480 times 12 = 5,760. Last but not

21
00:01:32,106 --> 00:01:38,668
least, we add these two numbers together.
This gives us a final answer of 17,820.

22
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:43,017
Much to the delight of Grant and his
venture capital funders. They're going to

23
00:01:43,029 --> 00:01:48,326
bring in $17,820 with just the
orders that have been placed so far in the

24
00:01:48,326 --> 00:01:53,170
first few weeks. That is really
incredible. Grant has proven that he has a

25
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,461
product, or actually two products, that are
popular and people think are really going

26
00:01:57,461 --> 00:02:01,951
to be useful. He is convinced he's out to
change the world, or at least the way that

27
00:02:01,963 --> 00:02:06,120
glasses wearers see the world.
Congratulations on great work, we covered

28
00:02:06,132 --> 00:02:09,277
a ton of material, and I am sure that you
did great.
