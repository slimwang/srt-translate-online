1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:06,315
We would need to add 9, 36, 4, and 25 to complete each of these squares. Great

2
00:00:06,315 --> 00:00:10,358
thinking if you found these numbers. For the first polynomial, we can think

3
00:00:10,358 --> 00:00:14,134
about having one block that's area is x squared, and then six other tiles that

4
00:00:14,134 --> 00:00:19,825
have an area of x. We take the 6x and we split three of the x's over here and

5
00:00:19,825 --> 00:00:26,097
three of the x's over here. So we'll have x squared plus six x's, and then

6
00:00:26,097 --> 00:00:31,971
we'll need to add at 9 one pieces to complete our perfect square. So, when

7
00:00:31,971 --> 00:00:37,830
thinking about completing the square, it's best if this b term is even. This

8
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,485
allows us to split up the x's, so we have half of them here and half of them

9
00:00:40,485 --> 00:00:44,080
here. And then we can figure out how many one pieces we would need to add to

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,812
complete our perfect square down here. For this first polynomial, it turns out

11
00:00:49,812 --> 00:00:53,910
that was 9. For the second one, we draw a similar figure as the one before, and

12
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:59,238
we'll find out that we'll need to add 36 one tiles to complete the square. For

13
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:03,898
this third polynomial, we said we had negative 4x here. So, we'll have our x

14
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:09,095
squared like before, and then, we'll have negative 4 x's. So negative 2x and

15
00:01:09,095 --> 00:01:14,882
negative 2x, which makes negative 4x. So, if we were to lay out these tiles, we

16
00:01:14,882 --> 00:01:17,550
could see that we would need to add four more one pieces to complete the

17
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:23,940
square. We know that this diagram also makes sense in terms of multiplication.

18
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:30,140
We know x times x equals x squared, and x times negative 1 equals negative x.

19
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:36,472
We have this negative x four times. Once here, once here, once here, and once

20
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:42,554
here. And finally, for these 4 one pieces, we have a sidelength of negative 1

21
00:01:42,554 --> 00:01:49,597
here and a sidelength of negative 1 here. So, negative 1 times negative 1 would

22
00:01:49,597 --> 00:01:54,440
equal a positive 1. We have this positive 1 four times, so we know we have to

23
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,410
add 4 one tiles to complete our square.
