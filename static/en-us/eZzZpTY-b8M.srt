00:00:02,828 --> 00:00:07,008
our two functions here. Let's see if we can really pin down this relationship

3
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:12,214
is though. If we have a point a,b that we know allies in the function where y

4
00:00:12,214 --> 00:00:17,759
equals 10x plus 150. Then do we know anything about a point on our other

5
00:00:17,759 --> 00:00:22,650
function, y equals x over 10 minus 15. Please pick the statement that

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,860
