1
00:00:00,191 --> 00:00:05,117
Now, let's look at some examples of
how these metrics, session count,

2
00:00:05,117 --> 00:00:10,133
session length, and retention can
really affect monetization in games.

3
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:15,042
First, let's consider a straightforward
example of a game that uses ads to make

4
00:00:15,042 --> 00:00:15,553
money.

5
00:00:15,553 --> 00:00:19,832
Now ads might not make the most money,
which we'll get into later, but

6
00:00:19,832 --> 00:00:24,194
their success does depend on how often
and how long users play your game.

7
00:00:24,194 --> 00:00:26,800
Because each time an ad
is displayed in the game,

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,545
it makes a small amount of money for
the developer.

9
00:00:29,545 --> 00:00:33,417
And when there are a lot of sessions,
so the session count is high,

10
00:00:33,417 --> 00:00:36,544
there will be a lot of
opportunities to display an ad.

11
00:00:36,544 --> 00:00:38,985
Similarly, when a session is long,

12
00:00:38,985 --> 00:00:42,625
ads might be displayed
multiple times in one session.

13
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:46,505
So both of these result in
more ads being displayed.

14
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,793
And more ads mean more money, and

15
00:00:48,793 --> 00:00:53,135
retention looks at these effects
over a longer period of time.

16
00:00:53,135 --> 00:00:56,035
Say, your app launches, and
people are excited about it.

17
00:00:56,035 --> 00:00:59,923
There's a lot of sessions, but then
after a week or so, people start to get

18
00:00:59,923 --> 00:01:03,655
bored with it, and the number of
players and sessions drops over time.

19
00:01:03,655 --> 00:01:08,345
And when the number of sessions drop, so
does the amount of money the game makes.

20
00:01:08,345 --> 00:01:12,569
So high retention is important for
monetization because your game will only

21
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:16,005
make money over time if you retain
a steady number of players.

22
00:01:16,005 --> 00:01:20,549
Retention is especially important if
your game is planning on selling items

23
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:21,904
in the game over time.

24
00:01:21,904 --> 00:01:26,314
These items are called in-app purchases
and include things like power-ups or

25
00:01:26,314 --> 00:01:30,143
special game equipment that players
can buy and then use in the game.

26
00:01:30,143 --> 00:01:32,944
And you want these sales to be
pretty consistent over time so

27
00:01:32,944 --> 00:01:34,520
that you continue to make money.
