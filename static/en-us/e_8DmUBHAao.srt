We've seen this kind of code before. All we're doing is we're

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,670
using qplot to plot the price of diamond against its carat weight. And

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:13,530
we're going to trim the top percentile off of both carat and price. If

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,740
you use the full ggplot syntax, your code will look something like this.
