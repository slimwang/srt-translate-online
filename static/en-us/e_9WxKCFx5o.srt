00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,311
First though, a little quiz to make sure we think about the implications of the 2 approaches,

2
00:00:04,311 --> 00:00:07,777
which we're calling again, thread per row and thread per element.

3
00:00:07,777 --> 00:00:10,003
It's not immediately clear which is better.

4
00:00:10,003 --> 00:00:12,129
So for the same matrix,

5
00:00:12,129 --> 00:00:15,216
which approach will answer these 3 questions for--

6
00:00:15,216 --> 00:00:18,755
please choose either thread per row or thread per element.

7
00:00:18,755 --> 00:00:21,859
And the 3 questions are, which approach will launch more threads?

8
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:24,895
Which approach will require communication between threads?

9
00:00:24,895 --> 00:00:28,263
And which approach will do more work per thread?
