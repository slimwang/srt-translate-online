00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,790
So now that our code has worked, let's figure out what's actually going on with

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,830
this program. Now, the first thing that strikes

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,080
me is this first line of code, which

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:15,830
is from twilio.rest import TwilioRestClient. Now thus far,

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,670
what we've been doing is statements like this,

6
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:21,780
where we say import some filename. Like in

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,160
this case, import turtle, but here we have

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:33,010
this new word called from. So here's a task for you, we want you to find out

9
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:38,080
what this Python keyword from means? You can enter your responses in this box.
