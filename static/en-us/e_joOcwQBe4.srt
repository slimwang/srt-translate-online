1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,370
Let's look at the same example, starting off with this one.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,680
But this one I'll actually be doing comparisons on ISO versus

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,570
aperture and shutters.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,070
Filled out the same thing as before.

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,757
We're basically now going from increasing the speed from one-tenth to 2500.

6
00:00:16,757 --> 00:00:19,683
So we basically increase the shutter speed.

7
00:00:19,683 --> 00:00:23,040
Now, let's actually look at different ISO values.

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,078
One one hundred, 200 is the ISO.

9
00:00:26,078 --> 00:00:32,707
This was 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400.

10
00:00:32,707 --> 00:00:37,525
Now again you notice that as I got to 6400, it got much more brighter.

11
00:00:37,525 --> 00:00:42,947
And this one is underexposed at 100.

12
00:00:42,947 --> 00:00:47,547
So here somewhere in this range would have been a good choice of a ISO value,

13
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,383
with respect to what we want.

14
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,120
Of course, we could fill this out also.

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,644
So this is, ISO is increasing and this is shutter speed.

16
00:00:55,644 --> 00:00:59,491
So you see the effect, and again, photographers do the best they can to

17
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:02,950
figure out what first scene that they want a different effect.

18
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,210
That's why they also carry a light meter sometimes, to kind of get a sense what

19
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,950
would be the best combination of the shutter speed, the aperture value and

20
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,280
ISO they could use for the for the purpose of the pictures they are taking.
