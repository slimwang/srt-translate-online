00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,839
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,670
Today we are going to talk
about projector camera systems.

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,460
Remember, when we started talking
about computational photography,

4
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,920
I talked about capturing
an illuminated scene, and

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,230
being able to generate
a novel image from it.

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,640
Now in that pipeline, I did talk about
the fact that you could actually control

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,210
the illumination, the optics, and the
camera, and the processing all together

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,430
in the pipeline of computation
photography, to generate novel images.

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,120
Today we are going to talk about
a specific set of instances where we're

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,225
going to merge, couple, for example,
a camera and a projector system.

11
00:00:33,225 --> 00:00:36,380
A projector is, of course,
where we can actually control light.

12
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,890
Remember the example of dual
photography we covered initially,

13
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,710
in the class, where being able
to illuminate a scene, and

14
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,860
being able to control it with a camera,
allowed us to actually see newer things.

15
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,060
Well how, now I'm going to actually
show several different examples

16
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,690
of techniques people have used,
of coupling cameras and

17
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,670
projectors together,
to generate novel forms of images.
