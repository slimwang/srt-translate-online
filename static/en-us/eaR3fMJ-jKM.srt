00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My final question is a simplified self-driving car question,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
that is usually solved using dynamic programming.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
But I have to warn you, the state space shown here

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
isn't the full state space.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The orientation isn't really made explicit, in this state space.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But suppose you have a road environment,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
that has a straight street over here,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
you can turn left, go straight, or turn right over here,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and similarly you can turn left or right over here.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And we assume that moving from one grid cell to the next

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
has a cost of '1'.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Turning left has a cost of '14'.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And turning right has a cost of '1' as well.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Let's assume the robot when it turns,

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
stays in the same grid cell, but it only can turn once.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
After it turned, it has to actually move.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So it's impossible, for example, to turn right three times

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
just to avoid the cost of a left turn.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I would like to know,

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
what is the minimum total cost

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
of going from the start location, over here,

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
to location 'A'.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I realize that there is many ways to get there.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'd like to know the minimum.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So what's the minimum cost to get to 'A',

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
irrespective of what orientation you assume at 'A'? I don't really care.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The same from the start location to 'B'.

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And from the start location to 'C'.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please enter your best guesses on the right side.
