00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,213
The GCF is 9 x squared y squared. Let's see why. This would be the prime

2
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:08,186
factorization for 45 x squared y cubed. And this would be the prime

3
00:00:08,186 --> 00:00:12,326
factorization for 36 x to the fourth y squared z. I'm going to regroup my

4
00:00:12,326 --> 00:00:16,837
numbers together so that we have the 2's together and the 3's together. I want

5
00:00:16,837 --> 00:00:21,702
to find the lowest power of each factor that appears in both terms. We know that

6
00:00:21,702 --> 00:00:26,336
3 appears in both terms, and in fact a power of 3 squared appears in both terms.

7
00:00:26,336 --> 00:00:30,797
So that's going to start the product of my greatest common factor. This number

8
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:35,199
has a 5, however this number does not, so I can't list 5 as part of my greatest

9
00:00:35,199 --> 00:00:39,626
common factor. However X is a factor that appears in both terms and we have a

10
00:00:39,626 --> 00:00:44,195
power of X squared that is common between them. So we can list X squared in the

11
00:00:44,195 --> 00:00:49,215
product of our GCF. And finally, they both share the lowest power of y squared,

12
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:53,882
so we can include that in our GCF as well. The greatest common factor is the

13
00:00:53,882 --> 00:00:58,698
product of all of these factors together. So we have 9 times x squared times y

14
00:00:58,698 --> 00:00:59,325
squared.
