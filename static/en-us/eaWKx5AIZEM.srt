1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,250
Let's take a moment to check if
we understand how write-update

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,710
coherence works.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,070
Suppose that a core has
a single block cache

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,870
with a valid bit,
a tag and the data, and

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:19,390
suppose that we have four such
cores numbered 0, 1, 2 and 3.

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:23,610
Suppose that core 0
reads from 700 first.

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,980
So now it gets the valid bit to be 1.

8
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:32,290
The tag is 700 and
let's say that the data rate is 6.

9
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:36,830
After this,
core 1 reads the same location.

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:43,600
Then, core 2 writes a value
of 17 into this location.

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,030
And finally,
core 3 reads from that location.

12
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,620
After all this, in core 0 what
is the valid bit in the cache?

13
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:58,150
The tag is still 700, and
what is the data that we get?

14
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,890
And the same for cores 1, 2, and 3.

15
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,160
What is the valid bit in
each of these caches, and

16
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,360
what's the data value placed here?

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,040
You can use this as an example, where
the valid bit is either one or zero, and

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,450
the data value in this
case is 6 after this read.

19
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,780
So, what's going on in these four
caches after we do this sequence?

20
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,500
We complete this, then this,
then this, then this.
