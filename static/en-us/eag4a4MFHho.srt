1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
Now it turns out that this graph does actually have a Hamiltonian path.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:14,000
And to see this, let's go ahead and start here, and let's come around here and here.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We're going to come over here, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And we have covered every single vertex, as you can see.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,500
Now it turns out that this graph does not have a Hamiltonian cycle.

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,000
And, in order to show this, you would actually have to know a bit more math

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
or exhaustively check every single possibility, which I am not going to do

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
in this video because it would take far too long.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So I invite you to try and find a Hamiltonian cycle if you doubt that,

10
00:00:49,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but it may take some time.
