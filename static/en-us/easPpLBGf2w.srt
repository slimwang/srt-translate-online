1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Okay--I'd like to add a new element.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So instead of requiring users to put text in the box and hit enter,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
we'd like to give them a button to click on to submit our form.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We're still going to use the input element,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
but it's going to have a new attribute--

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and it'll look something like this.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So--we're still using the input element.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This time we have an attribute called type, which equals submit,

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and this instead of drawing the text box that accepts input from users.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We'll draw a little button that should allow us to submit the form.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Okay--I'm going to add this in our HTML now,

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and then we'll load it in our browser to see how it looks.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Okay--so we're adding a second input element,

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and this one is type equals submit.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
There we go. We'll save this file.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We'll go to our browser, we will reload the page,

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and there we have it--we have a new little submit button.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Now, I'm going to enter some text into here, and click submit.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Okay--so--before I click submit, I'd like you to click submit,

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and tell me--is clicking submit any different than pressing enter in the form?
