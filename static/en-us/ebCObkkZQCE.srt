1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
All right; let's wrap this up.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Over the entire course, we've seen lexing, parsing; we just saw optimizing.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We've seen interpreting.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And just in case anything goes wrong, we know how to do debugging.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Lexing was based on regular expressions.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
They specify sets of strings, and they can be implemented under the hood

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
with finite state machines.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Parsing uses context-free grammars, which can capture behavior

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
like balanced parentheses that regular expressions can't.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And we saw how to implement those with dynamic programming,

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
that is, writing ourselves little memos in a chart, and parse states.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Optimizations are great; they make the programs simpler

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and conserve some important resource like time or power or heat dissipation.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But they're only valid if they retain the meaning.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
In general, interpreting refers to walking the abstract syntax tree recursively

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and computing the final value.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
In our particular web browser, our HTML interpreter calls the JavaScript interpreter,

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and our HTML interpreter calls the graphics interpreter.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And in debugging and testing we can gain confidence that our program adheres

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
to its specification by thinking very hard about which parts of the input

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
or which parts of the program might be wrong

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and carefully crafting them, paying attention to all the information we have available.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
In the homework or the class final projects, you'll finish the browser,

24
00:01:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and unit 7 will be review for the final exam.
