1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,130
Let's look at some examples additional
examples of how they've done this.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,325
>> Here's the input video for
another scene played at high speed.

3
00:00:14,293 --> 00:00:17,892
And here's the panoramic video
texture created from the input.

4
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:20,585
This entire grove of trees
is one dynamic region

5
00:00:24,323 --> 00:00:26,565
Notice the rippling
lake in the background.

6
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:32,484
The middle portion of
the scene is static.

7
00:00:35,364 --> 00:00:40,008
One frame of this panoramic video
texture contains over 9 million pixels.

8
00:00:42,635 --> 00:00:45,108
The two trees form
a single dynamic region.

9
00:01:05,405 --> 00:01:08,540
Finally, notice the gentle
waving of the trees in the left.

10
00:01:11,744 --> 00:01:14,298
Here is another input video,
played at high speed.

11
00:01:24,753 --> 00:01:26,634
And here is the output.

12
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,289
The entire region of flags,

13
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:56,973
as well as the highway in
the back is one dynamic region.

14
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:03,664
The motion of the vehicles on
the highway is visually seamless,

15
00:02:03,664 --> 00:02:06,737
though they often disappear
behind the occluding boat masts.

16
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,252
Here is the input video for
our final scene.

17
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:16,511
And the final result.

18
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:19,847
This scene is composed of one
large water region, flags, and

19
00:02:19,847 --> 00:02:22,815
tarps covering some of the boats
that blow in the wind.

20
00:02:43,894 --> 00:02:46,318
In conclusion, we present a method for

21
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,662
creating high-resolution panoramic
video textures of a location.

22
00:02:50,662 --> 00:02:54,047
Panoramic video textures combine
the wide field of view of panoramic

23
00:02:54,047 --> 00:02:56,920
photographs with the infinite
length of video textures.

24
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,020
The result is an immersive
experience of being there.
