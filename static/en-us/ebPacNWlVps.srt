1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,310
In this challenge,
you will create your own API Mashup.

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,960
Write a function called findARestaurant
that will take an extreme representation

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,110
of a mealType and location.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,870
This function should first
geocode the location and

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:17,209
then pass in the latitude and longitude
coordinates to the Foursquare API.

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,100
After that, it should parse the JSON
response, such that it returns the first

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,360
restaurant in an easy to read format for
the user.

8
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,590
You will have to explore the Foursquare
documentation a little bit to figure out

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,340
a way to retrieve an image of your
restaurant if Foursquare has one.

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,040
If no image is available, then provide
a default image for the restaurant.

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,759
The image should be sized
to 300 by 300 pixels.

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,270
A starter template is provided
in the instructor notes.

13
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:47,296
I have added the following lines of
code such that non non-ascii characters,

14
00:00:47,296 --> 00:00:49,790
or characters not common
to the English language.

15
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,330
Also render properly in your code.

16
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,320
I also strongly recommend
using the browse parameter

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,060
when you send off your
URI to Foursquare.

18
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,110
This will search in a much wider
vicinity than just the latitude

19
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,640
longitude coordinate
you provide the API.

20
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,570
Your code should print
the results to the terminal,

21
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,250
when run from the command line.

22
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,420
And also return a dictionary with the
restaurant's name, address, and images.

23
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,070
This challenge is intended to be tough,
but don't give up.

24
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,370
Use your resources and other students
if you get stuck or have any questions.
