1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,460
So making the business car app complete with OCR is a bit out of the scope for

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:05,570
this lesson.

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,930
We're going to start with a much simpler introductory exercise.

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,560
Ever think that a word should be part of the English language?

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,610
For a long time I've been using my own custom spelling of the word dude.

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,880
Which relates to an obscure Japanese media reference.

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,790
That's my own strange word quirk.

8
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,690
Perhaps you've been chatting with your friends about how udacious your new

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,350
content provider will be.

10
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,300
When you're using custom words like this,

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,420
you can save them to the user dictionary.

12
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,620
All you need to do is click on the word and then click Add to the dictionary.

13
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,750
For the rest of this lesson,

14
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,930
we'll be working with Android's User Dictionary Provider,

15
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,170
which is a list of your custom words.

16
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,200
At the end we'll have a good example of how to work with a standard Android

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,540
content provider to print out some data.

18
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,880
Let's get started.

19
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,340
Your app relates to the User Dictionary a bit like this.

20
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,770
I want to take a look at the data source here.

21
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,760
So, we can think of that User Dictionary data like a table.

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,350
There are a couple of columns in this table.

23
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,090
An ID, a word column,

24
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,940
a frequency column, a few other miscellaneous columns over here.

25
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,560
As you can see the word column, we have the words that I typed into the phone.

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,810
The frequency column is a number between 1 and 255,

27
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,820
which represents how frequently I used the word.

28
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,217
The more frequently I used the word, the higher the number.

29
00:01:16,217 --> 00:01:18,940
So, 255 would be the most frequent.

30
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,820
So we have all this juicy data in the data source, and

31
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,040
we're going to need to use the content provider to get access to it.

32
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,960
If you haven't done so already, go ahead and

33
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,210
save some words to the user dictionary just like I did.

34
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,020
If you're working on an emulator, you're definitely going to want to save some

35
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,700
words in a default messaging app or email app.

36
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,940
Just type the word and give it a click and you should be able to save it.

37
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,790
In this lesson we're going to make a simple app to read out the entries of

38
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,460
the user dictionary.

39
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,180
The end product will look a bit like this.

40
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,620
When you're ready click Continue for a tutorial on how to start making this app.
