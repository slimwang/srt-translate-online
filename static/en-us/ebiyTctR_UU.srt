1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,710
There are essentially two parts to
building a Discriminative System.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,700
We have to build an object model
that is a representation of each

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,750
of the training instances.

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,410
And here we're going to
be talking about images.

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,310
The methods that I'm going to show you
of course, the overall classification

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,570
method could be applied to future
vectors from all sorts of things.

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,630
That in fact if you take
a machine learning class,

8
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:23,960
many of you already have.

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,230
You learned about discriminative
classification for arbitrary.

10
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,500
vectors, so we'll spend a little bit of
time talking about features that come

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,119
from a computer vision or
an image element.

12
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,110
Right?
So you would use them for

13
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,040
biological data of describing genomes.

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,900
But the representation you might
apply to other kinds of pictures.

15
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:41,950
So you have to build that model.

16
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,320
And the second thing you have to do
is you have to train the classifier.

17
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,570
Then when you run this thing, what you
have to do is you have to figure out,

18
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,840
I need to generate new
candidates to test.

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,850
So I give you a picture.

20
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,830
What does it mean to say,
tell me, you know, what's in it.

21
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:55,650
Is it the whole picture,

22
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,850
parts of the picture,
we'll talk about that in a minute.

23
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,330
And then once I generate candidates
I'm going to have to score them.

24
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,250
I have to evaluate them with
a classifier of yay or nay.
