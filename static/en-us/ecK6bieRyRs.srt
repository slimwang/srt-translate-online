1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This is where the difference between physical and web/mobile channels first come into play

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
because the MVP for a physical channel that is something you sell directly through stores

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
under the direct sales force is very different than something that you might be building

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
for the web or even more so for a mobile channel.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So in a physical channel, what you really want to have is something that customers can touch

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and feel because you're going to be out talking to them and while you could certainly go out

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
with a PowerPoint deck with a photo of what the product's going to look like, etc.,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
my advice always is invest a day or two in building something even if it's out of Styrofoam

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and cardboard or if it's something as small as a chip or a microphotograph

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
or a microphotograph of a proposed die layout.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That is almost for any physical product you should probably be going out

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and trying to get some reaction based on something that people could see and touch.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And in doing that, you're going to test your understanding of the problem,

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
test your understanding of the solution, and when you do that it's going to prove

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
that it solves the core problem of the customers.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And you're going to learn what the minimum set of features are from the early evangelists.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
In a physical channel, this requires lots of interviews, demos, and prototypes

18
00:01:14,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and lots of eyeball of contacts.
