00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:03,100
For the single [UNKNOWN] the applicability is fairly obvious.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,060
There must be only one such instance of the class, and

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,670
it's must be accessible to clients from a well known place.

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:11,650
As far as structure is concerned, there is a single class called here,

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,330
singleton class, but it can be whatever name you want to supply.

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:19,790
The singleton class has two particular attributes. One of which is static or

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:24,390
sometimes called a class attribute. That is, it's an attribute of the class and

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,910
not an instance of the class. Here it's called unique instance.

9
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,640
There may also be whatever data you'd like to have within that singleton

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,440
as other attributes of the class. The singleton class also has some operations,

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,130
and one of those operations is a class method.

12
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,770
That class method is responsible for retrieving for

13
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:50,160
the client the particular instance which is the only instance of the singleton.

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,430
There of course may also be operations within the singleton like there could be

15
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,080
in any other class for providing access, for example, to the other

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,150
data that's there or doing whatever operations you'd like that singleton to do.
