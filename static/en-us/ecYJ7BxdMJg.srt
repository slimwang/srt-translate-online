1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,684
Moving everything over to one side gives us the quadratic equation x squared

2
00:00:04,684 --> 00:00:09,209
plus 2 x minus 15 equals 0. From here, we can factor to find the x values that

3
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:13,710
make this equation true. This factors to the quantity x plus 5 times the

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,973
quantity x minus 3. And the product of those 2 equals 0. Still, that means to

5
00:00:18,973 --> 00:00:22,940
make this true, x can either equal negative 5 or x can equal positive 3. Now,

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,951
let's think about what we're really solving for here. And if we were to do this

7
00:00:26,951 --> 00:00:31,338
graphcially what we'll working on. Well, here we have two polynomial set equal

8
00:00:31,338 --> 00:00:35,272
to another. Just like in the previous problem, we can solve this problem

9
00:00:35,272 --> 00:00:39,387
graphically by setting this side equal to y. And this side equal to y, and then

10
00:00:39,387 --> 00:00:43,796
finding the intersection of those two curves. Let's try it out. You can see here

11
00:00:43,796 --> 00:00:48,292
that we have two points of intersection on this graph between these two curves.

12
00:00:48,292 --> 00:00:52,300
We have one right here, which we see does in fact have an x coordinate of

13
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,533
negative 5. And we have one right here, which, if we follow it down, does in

14
00:00:56,533 --> 00:00:58,860
fact have an x coordinate of positive 3.
