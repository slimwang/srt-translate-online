00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,884
Let's try something a little more difficult. Here's a polynomial with multiple

2
00:00:04,884 --> 00:00:09,109
variables. We have a and b. We're going to divide this polynomial by 5ab

3
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:13,761
squared. We divide each of these terms by 5ab squared. So now, you tell me.

4
00:00:13,761 --> 00:00:18,414
Using what you know about division and exponents, what would the answer be?
