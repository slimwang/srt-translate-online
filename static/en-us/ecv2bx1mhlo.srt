00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:02,120
Caching the photos is great, but

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,930
like we saw with the database earlier,
we can't just keep adding stuff.

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,830
We need to remove stuff
that we don't need anymore.

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,260
This involves a couple of cache
methods that we haven't seen yet.

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:16,590
If we want to remove specific entries
from the cache, we can use cache.delete,

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,768
passing in the URL or the request
of the thing we want to delete.

7
00:00:19,768 --> 00:00:21,760
There's also cache.keys.

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,590
That returns a promise that gives us all
the requests for entries in the cache.

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,702
What I haven't mentioned so far,

10
00:00:28,702 --> 00:00:32,445
is all of this is available from
pages as well as service workers.

11
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:35,740
In the next chapter, we'll use these
methods to clean the image cache.
