1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,952
Well, we can't make any conclusive statements, but we only have the statistics

2
00:00:05,952 --> 00:00:11,622
for this one sample, and so our best guess would be 40 since we have a sample of

3
00:00:11,622 --> 00:00:17,613
people who just used the Bieber Tweeter, and the mean clout score of them is 40.

4
00:00:17,613 --> 00:00:22,219
This value, 40, is called a point estimate, and that's because it's only one

5
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:28,068
number. So this is our best guess for the population mean if everyone started

6
00:00:28,068 --> 00:00:29,970
using the Bieber Tweeter.
