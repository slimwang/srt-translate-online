1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,885
Still don't think keyboard
shortcuts are a big deal?

2
00:00:02,885 --> 00:00:04,553
Let's put them to the test.

3
00:00:04,553 --> 00:00:08,522
For this quiz you'll be competing
against yourself in a timed challenge,

4
00:00:08,522 --> 00:00:12,650
to see how fast you can type with and
without keyboard shortcuts.

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,750
In the notes below,
I've provided you with two files.

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:21,135
The first file is called start.html, and
the second file is called finish.html.

7
00:00:21,135 --> 00:00:23,580
I want you to download both files and

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,290
place them side by side in
the text editor, like so.

9
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:30,738
If your screen is not big enough,
print out finish.html and

10
00:00:30,738 --> 00:00:33,880
open start.html in your text editor.

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,270
Next, using only your keyboard and
no shortcuts,

12
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:41,870
try fixing the start.html file
to match the finish.html file.

13
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,480
Make sure to time yourself and
see how long it takes.

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,370
Then I want you to repeat
the same exercise but

15
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,830
this time, use keyboard shortcuts.

16
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:54,050
I think you get where I'm going with
this, but your time should get better.

17
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,700
Since this is a timed challenge,
you'll need to have a stopwatch.

18
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,840
If you have a smartphone, it should
come with a stopwatch feature, but

19
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,650
if not, just use Google stopwatch.

20
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,010
There's a link in the notes below.

21
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,140
Feel free to complete the challenge
as many as times as you'd like to

22
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,530
improve your time.

23
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,520
Remember, only use your keyboard.

24
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,410
And don't just copy and

25
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,540
paste the code from the second file,
that'd be cheating.

26
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,780
When you're done, click continue
to quiz to enter your best times,

27
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,800
with and without shortcuts.

28
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,300
Have fun.
