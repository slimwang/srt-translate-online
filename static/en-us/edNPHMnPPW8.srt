1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,710
Let's take a look at more
examples of using the model.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,950
Remember that users are more
likely to download a free app

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,650
compared to a priced one.

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,370
There are numbers of ways to monetize
free apps by using in app billing.

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,770
>> Yeah, there's actually two
avenues that you can take.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,810
There are objects that users
can purchase once, and

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,080
they're always able to access.

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,570
So, example, something like levels,
Telltale games, Angry Birds,

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,540
all allow users to unlock
new levels by paying for it.

10
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:33,580
There's also objects that users will
always need to keep purchasing, coins,

11
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,260
extra lives, boosters, gems, whatever.

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,410
Clash of Clans is an example of this.

13
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,660
>> In this model,
the goal is to gain trust.

14
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,020
We want to lower the entry barrier and
allow users to try us and fall in love.

15
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:52,490
After that, we can offer users who
are using the product to pay for it, and

16
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,830
they will be willing to do it with
a big smile if we are doing everything

17
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:01,680
correctly, because users will recognize
the value that we created for them.
