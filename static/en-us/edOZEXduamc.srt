1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,969
So, let's talk a little bit more about images as functions, all right?

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:07,220
So, we can think of an image as a function, f, sometimes we'll say f,

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,560
sometimes we'll say I.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,940
That maps, you know, to, from R squared to R.

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:15,540
That is, it goes from an x y to some pure intensity or

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,020
value at that position x y.

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,420
But we're not going to have, sort of,

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,240
arbitrary functions, we're going to limit them in certain ways.

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,330
For us, an image is going to be defined to be over some bound.

10
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,040
So x ranges from a to b.

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,729
And y ranges from c to d.

12
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:38,150
And the intensity ranges from some min to some max.

13
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,740
Now, raise your hands out there if you think that images value go from

14
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,670
zero to 255.

15
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,200
Come on, be honest, you're raising your hands, okay.

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,770
That is a pure accident, zero to one probably would have made a lot more sense.

17
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:54,420
Zero be black, white be white, oh sorry, one be white.

18
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:56,900
Where did the 255.

19
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,070
Well, you computer nerds we all know.

20
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,180
Well there are 8 bits in a byte, right.

21
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,010
So if they're all on they're all ones we'll call that 255.

22
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:07,601
There is nothing special about 255, okay.

23
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:08,329
And in fact,

24
00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:13,430
later we're going to even have to have images that can have negatives in them.

25
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,640
So the thing that you just have to remember,

26
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,410
is we're going to allow our images to go from some min to some max.

27
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:23,710
The min will be sort of the blackest black, the max will be the whitest white,

28
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,820
if we're actually thinking of them as intensities.

29
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,710
But later if we think of them as just pure functions,

30
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:34,270
like image derivatives, they just going to take on some real value.

31
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,810
By the way, we can do color images the same way.

32
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,690
Now, instead of having one function that maps x,y to an intensity, we just have

33
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,880
three functions, often called r, g and b, sometimes called l, u and v.

34
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,880
We're going to talk about that way later.

35
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,200
All right? But they basically,

36
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,510
you can think of this as what we call a vector-valued function so

37
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:57,070
every pixel, the function is a vector of three numbers.

38
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,620
Like I said, most of the time we'll be sticking to gray level images.
