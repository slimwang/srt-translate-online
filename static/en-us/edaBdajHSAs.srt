1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,389
12 minus 3 is 9. So, the right side has become 9 at the point when X is by

2
00:00:04,401 --> 00:00:08,954
itself. Our equation thus tells us that X equals 9. There is one more step

3
00:00:08,966 --> 00:00:13,814
though, we need to check our answer. That basically means confirming that the

4
00:00:13,826 --> 00:00:18,561
value of X we found actually makes this original equation, X plus 3 equals 12,

5
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:19,331
true.

6
00:00:19,332 --> 00:00:24,528
So you need to substitute our 9 in the place of x in that first equation. And

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:29,655
sure enough, if we take one more step, 9 plus 3 is in fact equal to 12. This

8
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:31,574
means that our answer works.
