1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer is it's the more peaked Gaussian.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
That is somewhat counter-intuitive.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You'd think if this was your initial measurement probability

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
you really don't know where you are, and you should pick a very wide Gaussian.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But the truth is our new sigma-squared is obtained independent of the means.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's this formula over here.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now because both means are the same, this resolves to 1 over 1/σ^2.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That's the same as σ^2 over 2,

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
which means a new variance squared is half of the old one.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That makes it a narrower Gaussian,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
so the green one here that's the most peaked is indeed the correct answer.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This is very counter-intuitive, but now we understand why.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I hope you feel comfortable with the fact that we have actually gotten

14
00:00:54,000 --> 99:59:59,999
more information about the location, which is manifest by a more focused estimate.
