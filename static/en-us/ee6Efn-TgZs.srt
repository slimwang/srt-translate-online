1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,509
If all this sounds exciting to you,
you're in the right place.

2
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:08,059
This nano degree program is organized
into two parts, starting with this term.

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,410
>> Here in term one, we'll cover
the fundamental principles of AI,

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,179
search optimization, logic,
planning, probability, and so on.

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,530
No matter where you go in AI,
these form your vocabulary, and

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,859
foundation in artificial intelligence.

7
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:23,509
>> We've previewed many of
these ideas in this lesson.

8
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:27,020
And throughout term one,
we'll get into them in far more depth.

9
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:29,600
>> Throughout the term, you'll watch
lectures taught by some of the world's

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,210
foremost authorities in the field,
like Peter Norvig, Sebastian Thrun, and

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,530
Thad Starner.

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,340
We'll also check in with
other authorities, and

13
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,140
hear how AI is used to solve current,
real world problems.

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,859
>> Supplemental readings will be
assigned throughout the lessons

15
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:47,619
from this book, Artificial Intelligence,
A Modern Approach, Third Edition.

16
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:48,979
Written by Stuart Russell and

17
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:54,419
Peter Norvig, it is the most popular
textbook in AI, and highly recommended.

18
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,750
>> Then in term two, you'll be able to
choose an area of concentration for

19
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,980
further in depth study, such as computer
vision, natural language processing, or

20
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,299
speech recognition.

21
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:05,200
>> Created by experts from academia and

22
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,609
industry, these courses will teach
you additional techniques, and

23
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:11,750
practical aspects of designing
intelligent systems.

24
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,700
Here you will build a capstone project
that addresses a challenging problem

25
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,230
from that domain.

26
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,540
>> We can't wait to see what you build.
