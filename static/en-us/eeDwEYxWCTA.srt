00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
[Norvig] The final problem involves situation calculus.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
In the domain I want to describe, we have a combination lock with 4 digits,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and the correct combination that will open the lock we'll call X.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
There are 2 actions you can perform.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
One is to dial any combination on the dial,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and if you dial the correct one, X, then the lock will open.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And the other action you can perform is to press a lock button,

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and if you press that button, then the lock will be locked,

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
whether it was open before or not.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm going to describe some axioms,

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and I want you to tell me whether these axioms are correct for the domain or not.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
First the possibility axioms.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
One choice is the possibility axiom that says

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:09,000
if C equals X, then it's possible to dial C in situation S.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And here I'm assuming that all variables are scoped

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
so that we say an implicit for all C and for all S here.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And X is not a variable. This is a constant, referring to the correct combination.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The other possible axiom is for all C if C is greater than or equal to 0

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and less than or equal to 9999,

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:50,000
then it's possible to dial C in any situation S.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So tell me which, if any or both, of these axioms you think correctly encode the situation.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Next we'll look at the possibility axioms for the lock action.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Here's one.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We can say if the safe is open in situation S,

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
then it's possible to execute the lock action in S.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Or maybe we should say if the safe is not open in S,

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
then it's possible to execute Lock in S.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Or maybe we should say if true,

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
then it's possible to execute the lock action in situation S.

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And tell me which, if any, of those represents a correct representation of the problem.

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And finally we need successor state axioms for all the fluents,

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
but there's really only one fluent, and that's whether or not the safe is open.

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So here's one example of a successor state axiom.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We could say for any situation and action,

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
if it's possible to execute that action in the situation,

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
then the Open fluent is going to be true in the result of executing that action

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:36,000
if and only if the action is dialing the correct combination, X,

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:47,000
or if the safe was already open in S and the action is not equal to Lock.

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
That's one option.

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And the other option is the same thing on the left-hand side,

41
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:03,000
and on the right-hand side it's open if and only if the action is dialing the correct combination

42
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and the action is not equal to Lock.

43
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So tell me which, if any or all, of these are accurate representations of the problem.

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
In each case I want you to tell me if each of these axioms are good as they stand alone.

45
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I don't want you to look at any combinations of axioms

46
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
but just go through each one and check the box if you think that the axiom on that line alone

47
00:04:33,000 --> 99:59:59,999
is a correct representation of the problem.
