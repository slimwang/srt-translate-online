1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,280
Here's the picture so far.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,430
We have a primal program over
here trying to be maximized, and

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,840
we have a dual program over here
trying to be minimized, and

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,920
the obvious question
is do they ever meet?

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,450
Well, the answer here is yes,
they always do.

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,680
More precisely, we state this as
follows in the duality theorem.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,720
If either the primal problem or
the dual has a finite optimum solution.

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,400
Then so does the other.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,870
And, the optimum objective
values are equal.

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,009
And if either problem has
an unbounded objective value,

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,330
then the other is infeasible.

12
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:38,600
Note that it is possible for both the
primal and the dual to be infeasible.

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,070
We'll start the proof by
showing the second part.

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,130
If either problem has
an unbounded objective value,

15
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,870
then the other has no feasible solution.

16
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,790
So we'll suppose that
the primal is unbounded and

17
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,700
that y is feasible for the dual.

18
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,060
Well, by weak duality,
b transpose y must be

19
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,280
at least c T times x for all feasible x.

20
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,250
But since the primal is bounded,
there has to be an x that's larger.

21
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,310
And that creates a contradiction.

22
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,970
The case where the dual instead of
primal is unbounded is analogous.

23
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,050
Now we turn to the first
part of the proof.

24
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,420
And we want to show that
if either the primal or

25
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,390
the dual has a finite optimal solution,
then so does the other, and

26
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,519
even more that the optimum
values are equal.

27
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,790
Let's start with the primal
having a finite optimal solution.

28
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:33,610
Well, that then implies that it has
a finite optimal basic solution

29
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,680
by the Fundamental Theorem
of Linear Programming.

30
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,820
Let's let the basis be the first
m columns of the matrix a, and

31
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,720
we'll divide up x and
c in the usual way.

32
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,395
Remember that B stands for basic here.

33
00:01:47,395 --> 00:01:52,220
Recall then from the simplex
algorithm that this vector r D,

34
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:58,070
which represented the effects of moving
along one of the directions in x D

35
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:03,050
had to be non-positive Otherwise
this basic solution wasn't optimal.

36
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,340
Now we're actually going to
construct a solution for the dual.

37
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:11,260
We'll let y transpose be CB
transpose times B inverse.

38
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:16,560
And then from the non-positivity of r,
it follows that y transpose D

39
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,459
has to be at least as
great as CD transpose.

40
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:26,250
And then we can show feasibility
by arguing that y transpose A, and

41
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,160
we can just rewrite that in
terms of sub matrices B and D.

42
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,250
Just by definition,
the first part is just CB transpose, and

43
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:41,410
the second part is this expression here,
which again, from our The fact that

44
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:46,850
our D is non positive
is at most Cb times T.

45
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:50,240
Well that's just our vector C and

46
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,300
we can see that y does in fact
meet the feasibility constraint.

47
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:00,460
Moreover, Y transposed B, that is the
objective function for the duel program.

48
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,680
Is equal to CV transpose
times B inverse, times B.

49
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:10,040
But B inverse B, that's equal to XB, and

50
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:16,500
C transpose B times XB was the value of
the objective function for the primal.

51
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,060
So these are equal, and

52
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,660
then by weak duality it follows
that our choice of Y is optimal.
