1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,196
As before, we pull out a common factor from each pair of terms, and that gets us

2
00:00:05,196 --> 00:00:10,350
to a point where we have x plus 4 times x squared minus 1. Now, it's really easy

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:15,506
to think that this is the final factored form, but we are not done right now. We

4
00:00:15,506 --> 00:00:20,875
have to recognize that the term x squared minus 1 is just a difference of

5
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:26,041
squares. We know that if we have a squared minus b squared, that can be factored

6
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:30,616
as a plus b times a minus b. We can do the same thing for this expression, x

7
00:00:30,616 --> 00:00:35,410
squared minus 1 is equal to x plus 1 times x minus 1. This orange expression is

8
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:40,135
our final factored form. This rule is definitely a really tricky problem, so

9
00:00:40,135 --> 00:00:40,803
great job.
