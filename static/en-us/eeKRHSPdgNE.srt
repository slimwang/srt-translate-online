1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:04,710
As you're hopefully coming to realize,
everything starts with a route, so

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,340
the first step is to
create the bricks route.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,160
According to Ember's documentation,
we need to pass an object with a path

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,660
property as the second
argument to the route.

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,040
This path property is what
the URL will match against.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,340
This is what needs to be Legos,
not this.

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,580
So the Legos path uses the bricks
route file and the bricks template.

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:28,490
In the bricks template I've added
the required HTML and I'm done.

9
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,735
Making Ember load a template that's
named differently from the URL

10
00:00:31,735 --> 00:00:35,085
is straightforward but has always
seemed a little backwards to me.

11
00:00:35,085 --> 00:00:38,155
Make sure you don't get tripped up
between the order of the two of these.

12
00:00:38,155 --> 00:00:40,834
The first are the route file and
template that will be used,

13
00:00:40,834 --> 00:00:43,200
while the second is what
the URL will match against.
