00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,740
Let's study the botnet C&C problem.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:06,760
The key question here is that
how can the bot master know

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,210
which computers have been infected?

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,120
In other words,

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,360
how can the bot master contact
the infected machines and use them?

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,990
Let's think like a bot master for
a moment.

7
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,810
The easiest way to think of,
is to have the victims or

8
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,610
the compromised computers to contact us.

9
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,310
So, okay, let's do this.

10
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,040
The first step is to create the malware.

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,160
We call it vx.

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,180
So for example we can download
some example vx code from the web,

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,290
fiddle around it, compile it, okay?

14
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,510
To make sure that it works.

15
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,630
Then, we can use email to publicate it.

16
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:44,420
For example, using social engineering to
send it to some people that we know, and

17
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,230
from there it will spread.

18
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,500
That is, we create a malware,
we spread it through email.

19
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,210
Spreading is the easy part, but

20
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,140
now what if we want to make
use of these victim computers?
