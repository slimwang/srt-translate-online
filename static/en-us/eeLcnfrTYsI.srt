The original texture is just fine, it's a square. Even if it were distorted in

2
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:06,778
some funny way, why the upper left of the texture would be different than the

3
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:11,798
lower right isn't clear. The second answer is incorrect. Three JS may have some

4
00:00:11,798 --> 00:00:15,328
bugs in it but this is not one of them. The third answer is interesting. In

5
00:00:15,328 --> 00:00:18,056
fact if the square was made out of a fine mesh of triangles, depending on how

6
00:00:18,056 --> 00:00:20,608
the triangles were created when the square was worked, could make the

7
00:00:20,608 --> 00:00:25,470
distortion look more natural. The fourth answer is indeed the reason. If you

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,815
tried the show polygon option in the demo, you'd see the two triangles. Since

9
00:00:29,815 --> 00:00:32,116
the square is made of two triangles, moving the corner of the upper left

10
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:36,510
triangle has no effect on the triangle in the lower right. I highly recommend

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,602
reading the article that is listed in the additional course materials. It

12
00:00:39,602 --> 00:00:43,239
discusses this and a number of other common rendering problems.
