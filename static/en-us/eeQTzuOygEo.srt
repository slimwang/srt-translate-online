1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,090
Well hopefully you had
luck trying to do this.

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,800
Let's see what we need
to do to make this work.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,050
So this is the function that we
need to do some things with.

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,100
So if you were to play around with this.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:17,240
Let's just change this value to four and
five, and run.

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,680
And now let's look at the results.

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,690
Once again it shows you all
of the debugging parts,

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,380
and all of the corners of this
hexagon are now computed and

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,980
actually highlighted
by these nice visuals.

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,490
So this is just to kind of
of get you familiar a bit,

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,480
even the coding part of it and actually
try something interesting in the space.
