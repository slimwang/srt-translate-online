3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,630
this a one to many relationship. There is

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,150
a one to many relationship between warehouses

00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,170
and items, and festivals and stages. In the

6
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,120
Salesforce Schema Builder, we show these relationships

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,810
walk you through the incredible power of these relationships.
