00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,290
Just want to end a little
bit talking about,

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:06,250
if you've got this way of recovering
depth, how do you represent depth?

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,090
That is, how do you think about
the representation of it?

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,010
We only actually talked about disparity.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,020
We talked a little bit about
depth images but not too much.

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,030
But I want to talk about
just two quick methods here.

7
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:20,345
One is a depth image and then there's
a slightly more, I use the word nuanced,

8
00:00:20,345 --> 00:00:24,710
a little more recent notion of
representing depth, namely point clouds.

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:30,670
So depth images as shown here this was
another one of those stereo figures

10
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,800
from the Middlebury
data stereo dataset and

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,890
this is a ground truth
known depth image, right?

12
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,970
So you see these rings here?

13
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,240
Right, well, you see that this one's
darker, and brighter, and brighter.

14
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,740
They're at different depths.

15
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,970
Likewise, this picture here
is this picture there.

16
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,830
It's brighter than this mannequin
back there because it's closer, and

17
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,970
if we had more grayscale resolution,
you would see this would be darker than,

18
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:59,540
than, than this area because the nose
is further back from the cheek.

19
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,050
So depth images have some
nice representations.

20
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,710
First of all,
I've got depth everywhere, right?

21
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,040
I can just go to every pixel and
say what's your depth?

22
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,180
So I've got a full dense
depth representation.

23
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:13,890
Something that's a little more subtle,
is that a depth image not

24
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,520
only tell you it's two meters
from here to that table,

25
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,180
it also tells me that between here and
that point is free space.

26
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,320
So it doesn't just represent the
surface, it also represents, by default,

27
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,620
if you will, that there is no stuff
between here and there, right?

28
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,220
So that putting the point
down there is also declaring

29
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,900
that the ray from my eyeball
to that point is free.

30
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,750
So it's a representation of both
the surface and of free space.

31
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,645
People don't make nearly enough use of
that fact but it's true and important.

32
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:55,395
The other thing is often we need to
think about depth discontinuities.

33
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:58,395
Well, depth discontinuities
are just edges in the depth image,

34
00:01:58,395 --> 00:02:02,455
where we have lots of processing for
dealing with images.

35
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,075
There are, of course, disadvantages.

36
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,850
One is that it's very
viewpoint dependent, right?

37
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:12,090
I've got this scene geometry but my dept
image is based upon where my camera is.

38
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,530
So if I move over here, I've got
a different depth image, and combining

39
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,715
them is difficult because they're
in the reference frame of my image.

40
00:02:19,715 --> 00:02:22,445
They're not in sort of some
natural reference frame

41
00:02:22,445 --> 00:02:24,265
that talks about the object.

42
00:02:24,265 --> 00:02:26,845
So it doesn't capture
the geometry quite so much and

43
00:02:26,845 --> 00:02:30,515
the other thing is, if I want to think
about reasoning about the geometry,

44
00:02:30,515 --> 00:02:33,765
I kind of need to know
where the camera is,

45
00:02:33,765 --> 00:02:37,365
with respect to this, in order for
me to talk about where the geometry is.
