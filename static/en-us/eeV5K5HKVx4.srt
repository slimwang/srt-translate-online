1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,350
Which species does
the zoo have only one of?

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,980
That seems like a pretty
straightforward question, but

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,920
it turns out that you
can't answer it like this.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,380
The reason is that where,

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:16,890
applies to the rows of the underlying
table before count is performed.

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,030
There's no nom column
in the animals table.

7
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,350
And you can't use where
after a group by anyway.

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,650
If you tried this query out, you'd get
a big error, but if we change just one

9
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:32,250
word, we can make this right,
whereas where filters the source table,

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,170
animals, having filters
the result table.

11
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,100
So having applies after
the group BI aggregation.

12
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,130
And we'll get the right answer.

13
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,350
Again, there is another way
of answering this question,

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,120
using a more complicated sort
of query called a subselect.

15
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,830
But this is the easy way to do it.

16
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,870
So now for
a different sort of question and a quiz.

17
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,100
Which food is eaten by only one animal?

18
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:59,060
Not just by one species, but only one
individual animal in the whole zoo?

19
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,650
To answer this, you'll have to
use both the having clause, and

20
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:03,880
a join that we've seen before.
