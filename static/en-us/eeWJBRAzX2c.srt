1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,493
>> The answer is AC. Since A is equal to the invisible 1 that's written right

2
00:00:05,493 --> 00:00:11,357
here, and we know that 2 times 3 equals 6, we also know that 6 times 1 equals 6.

3
00:00:11,357 --> 00:00:15,799
And 6 and 1 are just C and A, so their product is A times C.
