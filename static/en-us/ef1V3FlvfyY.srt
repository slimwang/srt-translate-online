00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The next concept I want to talk about is conditional probability.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This is the one we're going to need to use to prove that the one-time pad is perfectly secure.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Here's the definition of conditional probability.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If we have two events--we'll call them A and B--

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and they're in the same probability space,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
the conditional probability of B given that A occured

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
is written like this: it's the probability of B given A--so we use the bar

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
to indicate conditional probability--and it's defined by this formula.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's the probability of A intersected with B

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
divided by the probability of A.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
To get an intuition for that, let's look at these sets.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Here's our universe omega. That's all events.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Our question is given that we know A occurred,

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
what's the probability of A.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The fact that A occurred means the rest of our probability set doesn't matter.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We're only considering the outcomes where A occurred.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
That's the set for A.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We want to know what was the probability that B occurred.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Those are the elements in this intersection--the times when B did occur

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
divided by the size of the sets A,

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
which is the probability of A. That's the intuition behind this formula.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let's see if it makes sense for our example as well.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The question is given that we have a valid coin toss,

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
what's the probability that it's heads.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'll remind you the model we had.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It said the probability of heads is 0.49999 with four 9s.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The probability of tails is 0.49999.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The probabiilty of edge is 1 minus the sum of those,

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
which is 0.00002.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We define valid as the outcomes where it lands on heads or tails not on the edge.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Given that you know a coin toss is valid,

32
00:01:57,000 --> 99:59:59,999
what's the probability that the outcome is heads?
