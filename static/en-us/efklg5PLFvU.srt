00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,698
Well, it cost me $20 just to rent the truck, that's just to get the keys. Then I

2
00:00:05,698 --> 00:00:11,067
paid $2 per mile, so I'm traveling 20 miles and I have to pay $2 for each of

3
00:00:11,067 --> 00:00:16,397
those. So I have my initial fee of 20, $2 for my cost per mile, and then 20

4
00:00:16,397 --> 00:00:21,427
miles, so I get $20 plus $40, which is $60. If you got $60, nice work.
