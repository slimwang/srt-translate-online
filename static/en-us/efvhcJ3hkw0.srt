1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,890
So now we'll have a couple quizzes to see that you

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,110
understand how to index subsequences from strings. So your goal for

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,020
this quiz is to write Python code that will print out

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,040
Udacity with an upper case U, given that we've already defined

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,930
the variable S to have the value, the string audacity. And

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,110
we want you to do this in a way that uses

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,630
the string indexing operators up. It wouldn't be a good way

8
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,270
to solve this by just printing out Udacity with an upper case

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,670
U as a string. But see if you can find a way to write Python code that uses

10
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,690
s and has as little extra code as possible

11
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,780
but prints out the string Udacity starting from s.
