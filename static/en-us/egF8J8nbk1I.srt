1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,014
We see here that the term with an x in it has a coefficient of negative 3. So

2
00:00:04,027 --> 00:00:08,191
like we've done before, we just divide by that coefficient, and, of course, you

3
00:00:08,203 --> 00:00:12,122
do this at both sides. 12 divided by negative 3 is negative 4. so x equals

4
00:00:12,134 --> 00:00:12,703
negative 4.
