1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And the answer is 0.5, 1/2.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
To see this, recall that there were four possibilities for the numerator--all equally likely,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and if the first flip is heads and we have no other restrictions, the last three flips can be anything.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So each one has two possibilities and 2<i>2</i>2=8 and 4/8=0.5.
