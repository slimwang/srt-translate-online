1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,100
For the Mountain View postal code 94043,
this is what the query would look like.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,510
You could have also used
94043 comma USA and

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,690
that would have given
us the same result.

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,720
We set the mode to be JSON format.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,810
In reality, you actually don't
need this parameter because this

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,280
API sends back JSON data by default.

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,430
But just to be sure,
we set this parameter.

8
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:23,900
Then we set the temperature
units to be in metric, and

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,160
the count param to be 7
days of forecast data.

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,190
Let's take this URL and
use it in our app.
