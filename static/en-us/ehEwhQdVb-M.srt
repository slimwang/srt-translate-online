00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,803
Okay, so let's recap with a little quiz.

2
00:00:01,803 --> 00:00:04,926
GPU can do the following, so
mark each one that's true.

3
00:00:04,926 --> 00:00:09,815
One, initiate a send data
from the GPU to the CPU.

4
00:00:09,815 --> 00:00:14,110
Two, respond to a CPU request
to send data from GPU to CPU.

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:18,540
Three, initiate or
receive of data sent from CPU to GPU.

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:23,540
Four, respond to a CPU request
to receive data from CPU to GPU.

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,865
Five, compute a kernel
launched by the CPU.

8
00:00:26,865 --> 00:00:30,451
Six, and there's no box here so
don't check and don't not check.

9
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:32,700
Compute a kernel launched by the GPU.
