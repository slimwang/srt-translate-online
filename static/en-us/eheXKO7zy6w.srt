00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,460
We briefly mentioned attitudes earlier in this lesson, but now we're going to

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:08,988
take a look at attitudes in a bit more detail. First, we can define attitudes

3
00:00:08,988 --> 00:00:14,025
as an individual's favorable or unfavorable beliefs, feelings or actions toward

4
00:00:14,025 --> 00:00:20,014
an object, an idea or a person. How do you feel about birth control, or

5
00:00:20,014 --> 00:00:26,104
abortions? Or what about guns, or even the Detroit Red Wings? Well, we can look

6
00:00:26,104 --> 00:00:29,521
at attitudes towards one of these examples by examining the three components of

7
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:34,587
our attitudes. Given my earlier discussion about the Red Wings, let's use that

8
00:00:34,587 --> 00:00:39,763
as an example. Attitudes are comprised of three components. First, we have the

9
00:00:39,763 --> 00:00:44,203
affective component. And this includes our feelings and emotions that are

10
00:00:44,203 --> 00:00:49,332
associated with our belief. In my example, my affective component towards the

11
00:00:49,332 --> 00:00:55,006
red wings would consist of enthusiasm, excitement, price and overall happiness.

12
00:00:55,006 --> 00:00:58,646
Now, let's move on to talk about the second component and that is the

13
00:00:58,646 --> 00:01:01,000
behavioural component
