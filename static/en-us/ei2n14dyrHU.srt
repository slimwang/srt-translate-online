00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now in our final question, I now give you the observed outcomes.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Five people were healthy and five remained sick without a change of the cancer in the N = 10 experiments.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:26,000
My question now: do you reject the claim that this treatment will heal 80% of the people?

4
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Yes or no?
