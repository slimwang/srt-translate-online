1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,250
We're going to use the master detail
structure in the Von Villain's app

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,020
to show details on each villain.

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,770
Here you can see the villain table and

4
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,260
then if I could click on Jaws a detail
view appears with an image and

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,670
a label and if I go back I can do
the same for any of the villains.

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,739
You've already seen all the steps to
build this now it's time to put them

7
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:19,380
all together.
