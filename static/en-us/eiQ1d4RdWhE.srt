00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,870
I did want to mention, the touch

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:04,210
events, and therefore, pointer events, can come in

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:07,920
very fast. Most touch, input devices, actually, give

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,810
a lot more data, than most mice do.

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,360
So, what should you do, in response, to

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,520
this? Should you just upgrade, your computer? Ask

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,190
your users, to move, their fingers more slowly?

8
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,180
Or, maybe, there's something that request animation frame?
