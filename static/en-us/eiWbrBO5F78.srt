00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:01,750
>> Alright, so, can you explain it back to me?

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:05,905
>> Well, yeah, there's three properties of sound wave. The sound is a wave. First

3
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:10,135
there's amplitude, that's how high and how low a wave goes. Then there's

4
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:14,219
frequency, that's how many waves there are per second. And then there's purity,

5
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:15,850
that's how complex a wave is.

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:20,059
>> Excellent, so those are the properties of the wave itself. But what about three

7
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:24,340
properties of what we hear, what we perceive? So, by that I mean the volume,

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:28,887
the pitch, the timbre. Can you match the perceived sound properties to the

9
00:00:28,887 --> 00:00:30,789
properties of the wave?
