1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,937
In this lesson, we'll be looking
at some components we haven't yet

2
00:00:02,937 --> 00:00:06,380
used in Unity, and
using scripting to customize them.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,140
&gt;&gt; Right, and specifically we're
going to be looking at the physics

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,410
systems and the audio system.

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,290
&gt;&gt; So with physics what we'll be
able to do is stimulate real forces.

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:19,890
So for example we can have gravity,
or pull and push objects.

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,010
&gt;&gt; And with the audio system,

8
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:24,540
we'll be handling 3D positional audio,
which is really important for

9
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,590
virtual reality because you need to
direct the attention of your viewer.

10
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,960
And you don't necessarily know where
they're looking at any given moment, so

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,160
you can't use visual cues.

12
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,370
If they're looking over here and
you want them to look over there,

13
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,420
you can only use sound to
draw their attention and

14
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,720
so, this is a really powerful system.

15
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,710
&gt;&gt; So yeah, by the end of this lesson,
we'll be able to use both these engines

16
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,640
to really make our projects feel and
sound great.

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,570
&gt;&gt; And it's excellent scripting
practice, so let's get started.
