1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,726
Here, the possible solutions for p are between negative 2 3rds and positive 1

2
00:00:04,726 --> 00:00:09,627
3rd. Now, that's amazing problem solving if you got this one correct. To start

3
00:00:09,627 --> 00:00:13,814
this problem, we want to subtract 2 from both sides of the inequality. This

4
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:18,244
gives us a quadratic expression on the left and zero on the right. Now, we

5
00:00:18,244 --> 00:00:22,315
want to find the 0s or the values of p that make this quadratic expression

6
00:00:22,315 --> 00:00:29,014
equal to 0. We find factors of negative 18 that summed to positive 3. Those two

7
00:00:29,014 --> 00:00:33,230
factors are positive 6 and negative 3, and we use them to rewrite the middle

8
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:38,900
term of plus 3p. Using factoring by grouping, we get the factors 3p plus 2 and

9
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:44,638
3p minus 1. Next, we set each factor equal to zero, and then we solve for the

10
00:00:44,638 --> 00:00:51,060
values of p, so p could equal negative 2 3rds or p could equal positive 1 3rd.

11
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,067
Next, we use our two zero ro values to create three different intervals. And

12
00:00:55,067 --> 00:00:58,666
now, it's just a matter of testing each one to see which ones are part of the

13
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:04,248
solution. For the first interval, we'll plug in p is equal to negative 1. When

14
00:01:04,248 --> 00:01:08,222
we plug in this value for p, we'll get this statement, 4 is less than 0. We

15
00:01:08,222 --> 00:01:12,187
know this statement is not true, so we exclude this interval from our solution

16
00:01:12,187 --> 00:01:16,967
set. For the second interval, we'll test the value of zero. We know zeros in

17
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:20,477
between these two fractions, since one of them is negative and the other one is

18
00:01:20,477 --> 00:01:25,813
positive. When we plug in p equals 0, we get the statement negative 2 is less

19
00:01:25,813 --> 00:01:31,755
than 0. This is definitely true, so this part is part of our solution set. For

20
00:01:31,755 --> 00:01:35,415
the third interval, we'll test p equals 1 and we'll get the statement 10 is

21
00:01:35,415 --> 00:01:40,302
less than 0. We know this is false, so this is not part of our solution, which

22
00:01:40,302 --> 00:01:45,232
leaves us with this interval only. Any value between negative 2 3rds and

23
00:01:45,232 --> 00:01:50,440
positive 1 3rd will make our original inequality true. We also use parentheses

24
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,720
here and in our interval notation since this is just a less than than symbol.

25
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,840
We can't be equal to zero.
