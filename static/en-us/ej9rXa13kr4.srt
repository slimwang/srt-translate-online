00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
In the last question involving this data structure,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
we want to create a dictionary that contains the hexamesters as the keys

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and the values as a list of each course a given person is involved with.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So let's look at Dave.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
For April 2012 he's involved in 2 courses:

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
cs101, his intro course, and cs387, the Applied Cryptography course.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And the dictionary continues on, but the structure stays the same,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
where the key is the hexamester and the value is a list of courses

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,500
for which that person is involved.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,000
So 1 question you may be asking yourself, what does it mean to be involved?

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And if we go back to our data structure, what we're going to do

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
is look at the name value pairs associated with the course.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So if we're looking for Steve, Steve is associated with his class, cs253,

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
the Web Engineering - Building a Blog.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,500
And so that's what we're going to do.

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,000
We're going to go through each course, looking at the value in the name value pairs,

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and if the value is what we're looking for,

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
then we're going to add that course to our dictionary

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
associated with the key of that hexamester.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It sounds a little convoluted, and the answer is a little long,

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
but it's really a simple idea.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The first thing I'm doing is creating the output dictionary.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We're going to go through each hexamester.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We're going to go through each course in each hexamester.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We're going to go through each key in the name value pairs.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
If the value associated with all this is the person we're looking for,

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
then we're going to update our output dictionary.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
If we've already added this hexamester as a key to the output dictionary,

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
then we're just going to append this course at the end of the list

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
associated with that hexamester.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Otherwise we're going to create a new list for which the course is the sole value,

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and once we're done with all these for loops, we're going to return our output dictionary.
