1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,440
So in general, we know that the logarithm of some number is really an exponent.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,834
We can take the log of any number a, so long as this argument a is greater than

3
00:00:10,834 --> 00:00:17,163
0. The other condition we need is that b must be our base. And its gotta be

4
00:00:17,163 --> 00:00:22,790
greater than zero and not equal to 1. If b were 1, then a would have to be 1.

5
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:28,786
And x could be anything since 1 raised to any power always equals 1. And just

6
00:00:28,786 --> 00:00:32,800
like before we see that our base is the base of our log rhythm. And the

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,585
exponent is the answer to our logarithm. And a is the number that we take the

8
00:00:37,585 --> 00:00:38,840
logarithm of.
