00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,510
Let's first briefly review
the WiFi technology.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,480
A typical use of WiFi is to
allow personal computers or

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,330
devices enabled with WiFi
in a locale such as a home

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,710
to access the Internet through
the access point, or AP.

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:20,210
The AP connects to these
devices wirelessly.

6
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:24,080
And connects to the Internet
through physical wiring.

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,240
Such as to a router provided by
the Internet service provider.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,880
Devices in a locale can also connect to
each other wirelessly through the AP.

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,285
In wireless networking, data is not
transmitted via physical wiring.

10
00:00:38,285 --> 00:00:44,320
Instead data is transmitted in
air which is an open medium.

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,090
In other words, there is no inherent
physical protection of communications.

12
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:53,550
Also since there's no hard wiring
connecting two devices for

13
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,170
direct communications,
in wireless networking,

14
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:02,510
communication between two devices is
achieved by one device broadcasting and

15
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,890
the other device listening
to the broadcast.
