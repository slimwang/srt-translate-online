00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Thrun] So we just learned something really important,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
which is the central law of perspective projection,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
which basically says that in a pinhole camera, or in fact any camera,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
the projective size of any object scales with distance.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So you have an object that's yea tall over here

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
that looks just about the same as an object yea tall over here.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
In math x is proportional to the size of the object

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
but inverse proportional to the distance to the object,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and the only constant that then governs that relationship is the focal length, f.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So if we take an object and move it further away,

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
it'll appear smaller, and we all know this.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Just look at this object over here, how large it is.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And as I move it away from the camera, it becomes smaller.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Large...and small.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And that's a function of distance.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The law that governs the size change of this object in appearance

17
00:01:06,000 --> 99:59:59,999
relative to the camera image is the perspective law we just saw.
