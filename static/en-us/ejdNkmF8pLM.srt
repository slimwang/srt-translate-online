00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,260
I bet you're itching to do this yourself.

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:06,024
Here's the function I want you to define, find_template_2D.

3
00:00:06,024 --> 00:00:09,140
Takes a template and an image as input and

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:13,870
returns the x and y coordinates where the template is found in the image.

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,210
I have just the image to test this out.

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:20,220
I'll cut out a glyph from this tablet, which will serve as our template.

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,380
Remember, you want to find where the top left corner of

8
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,000
the template occurs in the image.

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,540
Also note the order of the return coordinates, y x.
