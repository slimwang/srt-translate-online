00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,260
In this day and age, parallelism has

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,600
become fundamental to computer systems. Any general purpose

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,540
CPU chip, has multiple cores in it.

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,700
Every general purpose operating system is designed to

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,180
take advantage of such hardware parallelism. In

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,480
this unit, we will study the basic algorithms

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,800
for synchronization, communication, and scheduling, in a

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,230
shared memory multiprocessor. Leading up to the structure

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,020
of the operating system for parallel machines.

10
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,150
We'll start today's lecture with a discussion

11
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:37,020
of the model of a parallel machine. A shared memory multi-processor, or a shared

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,920
memory machine we can think of three

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,710
different structures for this shared memory machine.

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:50,460
The first structure is what we call a dance hall architecture and a dance

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,770
hall architecture is one in which you have CPUs on

16
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,050
one side and the memory on the other side of an

17
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,590
interconnection network and let me say something that is common

18
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,640
to all the three structures that I'm going to describe to

19
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,340
you. The common things are that in every one of

20
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,420
these structures, there's going to be CPUs and there going to be memory,

21
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,820
and there's going to be an interconnection network. And the key

22
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,980
thing is it's a shared memory machine. What that means is

23
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:20,550
that the entire address space defined by the memories is

24
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,930
accessible from any of the CPUs. So that's one common

25
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,760
thing that you see in all the three styles that

26
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,020
I'm going to talk to you about. And in addition to that,

27
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,310
you'll see that there is a cache that is associated

28
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,810
with each of these CPUs. So there's a Dance Hall

29
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,550
Architecture. And the next style is what is called an

30
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:41,390
SMP architecture, or a Symmetric multiprocessor. Here what you see is

31
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:45,370
the interconnection network hat I showed you from the

32
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:48,510
dance hall architecture. I simplified it considerably, showing a

33
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,380
simple bus. A system bus that connects all the

34
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,700
CPU's to talk to the main memory. And and

35
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,620
it is symmetric because the access time from any

36
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,450
of the CPUs to memory is the same. And

37
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,780
that's the idea of the system bus that allows

38
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,480
all of these CPUs to talk to the main memory.

39
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,080
The other thing that you'll notice that I already

40
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,100
mentioned is that every CPU comes equipped with a

41
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,150
cache and we'll talk more about the shared memory

42
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,770
machine, the caches in a minute. So the third style

43
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,670
of architecture is what is called a distributor shared

44
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,880
memory architecture. So in this distributor shared memory architecture what

45
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,700
you have, or DSM for short, is that. You

46
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,720
have memory and a piece of memory that is associated

47
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,600
with each CPU. At the same time each CPU is able to access all of

48
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,020
the memories through the interconnection network. It

49
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,250
is just that the access to memory that

50
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,240
is close to this guy is going to be obviously faster than trying to access

51
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,930
memory that is farther from here that

52
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,860
has to be accessed from the interconnection network.
