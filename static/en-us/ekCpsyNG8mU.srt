1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,760
So before we go on to the next example, Michael, I wanted to

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,480
do a quick quiz, just to make certain you really get what's going

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,650
on here. The, the sort of power of looking, using Bayesian learning. The,

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,400
the main insight, I think, I, I want to drive home here, is something

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,610
you said. Which is that, when we were doing regression before, when we

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,750
were talking about the perceptrons, we actually had in our head a particular

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,220
kind of function, a particular hypothesis class. In here with what been talking

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,893
about with Bayesian learning, the answer tto

9
00:00:23,893 --> 00:00:25,780
finding to sum of squared errors was

10
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:30,360
independent of the hypothesis class and only dependent upon the

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,880
key assumptions that we were making, mainly that we had

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,180
labeled the data with certain form, and that that data

13
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,720
was generated by a process that took deterministic function and

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,500
added some Gaussian noise to it. So, here's the quiz.

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,340
Here's your training data. You've got a bunch of Xs

16
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,005
and a bunch of Ds. These are the values that

17
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:51,052
you have to learn. And I want you to tell

18
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:54,852
me, which of these three functions over here, these three

19
00:00:54,852 --> 00:00:59,300
hypotheses is the best one under this assumption. Got it?

20
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,020
>> mod? Are we allowed to do that?

21
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,569
>> We are allowed to do that because

22
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:05,570
>> It's just a function.

23
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:06,640
>> It's just a function, man.

24
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,530
>> Interesting.

25
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,360
>> It's just a function.

26
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,160
>> So we've got a linea-, a

27
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,510
constant function, a linear function, and we've talked

28
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,720
about those, but we've also got a mod

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,420
function. alright, and we've got a uniform prior

30
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,100
over these threes hypotheses.

31
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:18,330
>> Yup.

32
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,530
>> Okay. Yeah, I think I can do that.

33
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,700
>> Okay. Go.
