1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
A typical confidence is from 90% to 99%, you can find these values in tables.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
They are called quantiles. There might be numbers like 2.58, 1.64, 1.96.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
In this quiz, I just want you to tell me which of these numbers corresponds to what confidence intervals

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and I'll give you that to correct each of those match exactly one of those over here.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So check exactly three boxes.
