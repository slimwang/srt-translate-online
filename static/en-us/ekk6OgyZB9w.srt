So this happened to me in my last year of graduate school, when I was trying to

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:06,340
give a neuroscience presentation on an article I read. I knew the article

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,460
really well, but I hadn't slept at all the night before the presentation, I was

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:14,220
really stressed out with work and school, so I just wasn't thinking straight.

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,780
And I get up there, I'm halfway through, then I just completely blank. I have

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,264
no idea what I'm talking about, I have to consult my notes. It was kind of

7
00:00:20,264 --> 00:00:23,452
embarrassing, but I got through it. Luckily my classmates were pretty nice

8
00:00:23,452 --> 00:00:26,270
about it, so don't feel alone if this has happened to you.
