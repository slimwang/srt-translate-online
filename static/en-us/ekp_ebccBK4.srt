Earlier on, we looked at the graph of y equals 3 x minus 5. We saw that we got

2
00:00:04,853 --> 00:00:10,051
this line. Thinking about your new understanding of what the slope of a line is,

3
00:00:10,162 --> 00:00:15,361
can you tell me how many units up, for every unit across to the right, this line

4
00:00:15,373 --> 00:00:20,147
goes? It can be helpful to start at a point on the line and draw a right

5
00:00:20,159 --> 00:00:24,850
triangle, first moving out to the right and then up, to help you figure this

6
00:00:24,862 --> 00:00:25,082
out.
