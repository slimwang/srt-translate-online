00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,666
We know that whatever is under the square root side has to be greater than or

2
00:00:03,666 --> 00:00:07,539
equal to 0. Because otherwise we'll be taking the square root of a negative

3
00:00:07,539 --> 00:00:11,920
number and we don't want non-real solutions in this case. So finding the domain

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,544
of a square root of x minus 5 is solving an inequality. You have to set x minus

5
00:00:16,544 --> 00:00:20,944
5 greater than or equal to 0. This gives us x is greater than or equal to 5 and

6
00:00:20,944 --> 00:00:23,653
[foreign] that's our new domain restriction.
