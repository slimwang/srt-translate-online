1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
Which actually brings me to my next question.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,010
Now, we have always said that NP-complete problems

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,410
are very hard or challenging problems.

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,710
Are there problems that are even more difficult to solve than NP-complete problems?

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,710
And the answer here might surprise you.

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:20,170
Actually, finding an optimum strategy in most games, such as chess or checkers,

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,240
turns out to be harder than NP-complete.

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,930
Of course, when I say chess or checkers, I do not mean the normal 8 x 8 board

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,700
that you're playing on, but rather its generalized versions of those games

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,750
where you can have an arbitrarily large board.

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,380
The reason, of course, being that if you fix this as 8 x 8,

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,200
then the problem size or input size is always fixed.

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,480
So a concept like NP-completeness does not apply; you always need an input size.

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,610
But if you take the dimensions of the board as an input size,

15
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:54,480
then certain questions about these games become provably harder than NP-complete.

16
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,900
So the problem of determining for a given game position on an n x n chessboard:

17
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,330
if white can force a win, which means that no matter how good black plays,

18
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,660
white can always find a strategy to win.

19
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:10,910
Asking that question is believed to be much harder than solving an NP-complete problem.

20
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:16,330
Now, I say "believed to be," because this hardness requires that P does not equal NP.

21
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,060
If P equals NP, then, actually, many variants of this question here

22
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,550
and their different ones will also be solvable in polynomial time.

23
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,090
But in the case that P does not equal NP,

24
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:30,750
this problem here is much harder than NP-complete problems.

25
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,470
There are even some problems that are provably harder than NP-complete problems.

26
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:40,930
So even if P were equal to NP, these problems would be harder.

27
00:01:40,930 --> 99:59:59,999
And I'll give you 1 example for that.
