00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,320
Here's the solution for

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:06,689
binding an adapter to a ListView within the PlaceholderFragment class. First,

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:11,280
we find the ListView in the view hierarchy by using the findViewById call and

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,510
then, we set the adapter to it. The adapter will supply list item layouts to

5
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:22,690
the ListView based on the weekForecast data. Note that the rootView here

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:27,840
refers to the root view of the fragment, which we just inflated up above here.
