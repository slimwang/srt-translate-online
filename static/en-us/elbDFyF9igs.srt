Suppose you're summing the elements of
an array, but I tell you nothing about

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,470
how the array is aligned,
with respect to the transfer size L.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,960
In the worst case, how many transfers
might you need to read the array?

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,770
Note that I want an exact answer,
not an asymptotic one.

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,080
And if you need things, like floors and

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,010
ceilings, feel free to use
these in your symbolic answer.
