1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,354
So I think the most important thing you
can do in the early days trying to get

2
00:00:03,354 --> 00:00:05,295
people to come work for
you is beg really well.

3
00:00:05,295 --> 00:00:08,340
And there's some truth to that, really.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,910
But the thing you can offer people
at that stage of a company is

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:18,330
impact and vision and passion and
that they can't get anywhere else.

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,970
I mean sure, you need to set up
the incentives and compensation so

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:22,640
that it makes sense.

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,048
They're going to make a sacrifice
joining you early in this journey,

9
00:00:26,048 --> 00:00:28,770
almost certainly, right?

10
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,483
There's some opportunity cost for you.

11
00:00:30,483 --> 00:00:32,665
There's some opportunity cost for
your early employees.

12
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:34,458
And that could last years.

13
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:37,390
So you want to set up incentives
in such a way and compensation and

14
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:41,420
such such a way that it's fair and
equitable, equity.

15
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:46,750
But the thing that you really offer
them, I mean everybody offers equity.

16
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,460
And it's worth the paper
it's printed on, literally.

17
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,461
What you can really sell people on and
really get people excited about is

18
00:00:52,461 --> 00:00:55,763
the impact they'll have and the vision
that you have and the product itself and

19
00:00:55,763 --> 00:00:57,084
the changes that you can make.

20
00:00:57,084 --> 00:01:01,130
Even if it's just, it doesn't have
to be a world changing product.

21
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,790
But the ability,
people want to have an impact.

22
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,830
The kind of people you want to hire
desperately want to have an impact.

23
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:09,500
And that's what you can give them that
they can't, they go to a larger company,

24
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,690
that impact is necessarily diminished.

25
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:15,860
And so I always talk more about
the impact and the learning and

26
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,860
the roles and
the fact that they will be making more

27
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,630
decisions then they'll probably make
it any other time in their life.

28
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:27,370
And the right people for those early
hires will just gravitate towards that.

29
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,926
And the sort of compensation in dealing
with the sort of sacrifice that they're

30
00:01:30,926 --> 00:01:34,072
making, the opportunity cost of
their incurring, is just details.

31
00:01:34,072 --> 00:01:37,010
You just get them excited about
the impact that they can have.
