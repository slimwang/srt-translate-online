1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,860
Let's first look at the range of the function.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:07,800
Since each location has a tuple of three values, hence the right-hand side of

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,060
the mapping should have R cross R cross R, or R cubed.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:16,260
The first expression is therefore clearly wrong.

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,590
Note that a color image is still a mapping over a domain of two

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,230
dimensional x and y values.

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,780
Hence the third expression is also incorrect.

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:31,859
Therefore, we can represent an RGB image as a mapping from R

9
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:34,202
cross R to R cross R cross R.

10
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:39,080
This is the same as writing R cross R maps to R cubed.

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,690
In fact, you could also shorten it to R squared to R cubed
