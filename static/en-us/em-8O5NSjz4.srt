1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,562
To start our problem, we want to multiply the numerator and denominator by the

2
00:00:03,562 --> 00:00:09,640
conjugate of this denominator. The conjugate of root 2 plus root 5, is root 2

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:14,504
minus root 5. We distribute this 6 to each of these terms to get 6 root 2 minus

4
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:19,830
6 root 5. Next, we use our difference of squares factoring pattern, to do a

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,500
squared minus b squared. We square root 2 to get 2 and we square root 5 to get

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,852
5. Next we subtract inner denominator to get a denominator of negative 3, and

7
00:00:28,852 --> 00:00:34,240
here's where we want to be careful. When we simplify we can divide negative 3

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,178
into this term and into this term, 6 divided by negative 3 is negative 2, and

9
00:00:38,178 --> 00:00:44,873
negative 6 divided by negative 3 is positive 2. This is how we get our answer

10
00:00:44,873 --> 00:00:49,846
of negative 2 root 2, plus 2 root 5. Another way the think about it is to

11
00:00:49,846 --> 00:00:54,202
factor a negative 3 from each of these terms. If we factor a negative 3 from

12
00:00:54,202 --> 00:00:58,952
this first term, we'll be left with negative 2 times root 2. And we factor a

13
00:00:58,952 --> 00:01:03,690
negative 3 from this term we'll be left with 2 root 5. We can check this really

14
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,512
quickly by distributing this negative 3 to each of these terms. We'll wind up

15
00:01:07,512 --> 00:01:11,524
with our numerator from before. Now that we have a common factor of negative 3

16
00:01:11,524 --> 00:01:15,974
in the numerator and in the denominator we can simplify. These reduce to 1

17
00:01:15,974 --> 00:01:21,197
which leaves us with just our numerator, negative 2 root 2 plus 2 root 5. And

18
00:01:21,197 --> 00:01:24,444
now there are a couple of ways to write this answer. You could have factored a

19
00:01:24,444 --> 00:01:29,000
negative 2 out to get this answer or you could have factored a positive 2 out.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,668
Either of these is correct. Nice algebraic thinking if you got any of these

21
00:01:33,668 --> 00:01:34,893
answers.
