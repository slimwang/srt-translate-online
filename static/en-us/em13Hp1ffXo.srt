00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,340
There are five places where you can add the this reference, for the instance

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:09,240
variable miles driven, for the instance variable miles per gallon and twice

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,250
again for the instance variable gas in tank. It is actually pretty nice. Right

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,910
now, you can clearly tell which ones are the instance variables, and which ones

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,440
are the local variables. So yeah, I kind of like it. then again, it does make

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,460
the code longer. That's not so good. I'm obviously conflicted about whether

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,200
it's a good idea or not. Some people really like it, some people don't like

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,250
that the code gets longer. Now, Sara will go over with you how the, this

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,360
reference can be useful in a couple of other cases.
