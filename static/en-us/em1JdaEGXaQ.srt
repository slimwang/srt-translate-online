00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's start with a bird's eye view on the finite-element method--FEM.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
These days it's the workhorse of almost all mechanical engineers.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
FEM can answer, for instance, what happens when you put a huge truck on a bridge.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
To compute this deformation is application of FEM to the static case,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
but FEM can also be applied in a dynamic setting,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
for instance, to simulate the effect of a crash on a car body.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Here it's important to look at the process of buckling.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Whereas in the static case we're not really interested in how the truck was placed on the bridge.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It just has to be there.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I want to outline three fundamental ideas of the finite element method.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The first is discretization.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The continuous structures are approximated with the help of--guess what--finite elements--

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
elements of finite size, not infinitesimal size.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
When we do so the first question is which geometry these finite elements should have.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Should they be tetrahedra?

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Should they be cubes?

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Or should they even be curvilinear?

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The second fundamental idea is that of interpolation.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Given the finite elements, how do I compute a value at an arbitrary location?

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
For the static case, a really fundamental idea is that of minimization

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
of the potential energy.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Think about a ball that rolls on a terrain of mountains and valleys.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Eventually, it's going to come to rest in a valley.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
In the static case, potential energy is minimized.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Let's have a closer look at that valley.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
In the Gedankenexperiment, it splices this object a little further to the left

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
or a little further to the right.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Then the energy stays almost the same because we're at the bottom of the valley,

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
which means that to displace this object in this way require no work.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This is the concept of virtual work.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
For all infinitesimal displacements that are allowed--

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
we can't go down and we can't go up, obviously--

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
the virtual work equals 0.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
In mathematics, this way of posing the problem with the help of virtual work

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
is called a weak form.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The strong form would be to ask for all forces to compensate.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The weak form asks for the virtual work to be equal to 0 for all allowed virtual displacements.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
This weak form results in a finite number of equations that we can solve on the computer.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
This finite number, however, may range in the hundred thousands or even millions.
