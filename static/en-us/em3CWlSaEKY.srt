00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,040
For this quiz, the goal is to see that you

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,470
understand how to define a dictionary. You should define a dictionary

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,820
and assign it to the variable population, and it should

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,370
provide information on the world's largest cities. The key values in

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,170
your dictionary should be names, the name of each city.

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,520
And the associated value is the city's population in millions. So

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,800
that's a number. To get you started, here are the four

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,420
cities that your dictionary should

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,500
include. Shanghai's population of 17.8 million,

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,197
Istanbul with 13.3 million, Karachi, 13.0, and Mumbai with

11
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,549
12.5. If you don't happen to live in one

12
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,740
of those four cities, you might want to also include

13
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,270
your hometown and any other cities that you're interested

14
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,120
in. If you define your dictionary correctly, you should

15
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,360
be able to use it like this. Print the

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,710
population, indexing, looking up the value associated with the

17
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,951
key Mumbai, and you should get as output 12.5.
