00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,802
Since we've already factored the 3 x out, we want to work with this trinomial.

2
00:00:04,802 --> 00:00:09,190
This top number should be a times c. A is the coefficient in front of x squared

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:15,060
and c is our constant term. So 12 times negative 2 equals negative 24, this

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:20,808
choice. The bottom number is the b or the coefficient in front of x, so negative

5
00:00:20,808 --> 00:00:24,658
5. Great work if you found these two numbers. I know this question was tricky,

6
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:28,820
since I threw another polynomial at you. But, we want to make sure we work with

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,617
factoring this quadratic.
