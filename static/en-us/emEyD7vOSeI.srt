00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Customer relationships is kind of a fourth piece,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and customer relationship has a really interesting interaction with these other three pieces.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It basically says how do I get customers, how do I keep them,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and how do I grow them, and just like thinking about distribution channels,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
these are very different for web mobile than they are for physical channels.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But visually, they kind of look like this double-sided funnel.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Let's just take a look at quickly a web example--in getting customers, you're going to be

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
o worrying about how do I acquire them that is how do I get them even to my website,

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
how do I activate them that is how do I make them do something, and then later on

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
we'll see after I got them how do I keep them around that is how do I not lose them

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
through attrition and churn and then what can I do once I have customers

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
to make them spend more money or use my product even more.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
One of the things we'll be thinking about is how do I get, keep, and grow customers.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And just like every other step, you might have hypothesis on day one,

15
00:01:02,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but you're only going to figure this out when you're out of the building.
