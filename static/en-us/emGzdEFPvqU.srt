1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,260
So, how do we do pyramid blending?

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:08,000
Again, my original image here, and what we have is this pyramid representation.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,690
Of course, I can compute, just as I showed you before, the Gaussians for

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,180
this and the Laplacians for this.

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,320
So just to make it interesting in this example next to the Einstein,

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,800
I'm going to use this Tigger image and we're going to do blending between those.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,400
Let's actually go ahead and showcase all of the, the Laplacian and

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,360
the Gaussian pyramid levels for this image also.

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,800
So now we have both the pyramids again we're going from coarse to fine.

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,250
Now if you were going to do any blending between this image and

11
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,780
that what we could do is.

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,740
Again, learned something with it before.

13
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,140
And just cross-fade at each and every level.

14
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:41,890
Right?

15
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:42,940
I can take parts of this,

16
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,880
parts of this, and merge these together to generate a blended image.

17
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,870
And remember when we talked about cross-fading images,

18
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,770
we basically said let's do it at the different frequency bands.

19
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,740
In essence, that's what we're doing here.

20
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,620
That we're going to look at the different frequency bands and

21
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,140
do cross-fading individually at those frequency bands,

22
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,349
octaves and of course merge them together.
