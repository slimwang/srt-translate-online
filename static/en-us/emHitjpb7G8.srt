1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,669
All the task data, is stored in
a SQLite table that looks like this.

2
00:00:04,669 --> 00:00:06,359
The table is named Tasks, and

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,140
each task in the table has three
pieces of data that describe it.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,110
The first is the task id,

5
00:00:12,109 --> 00:00:15,239
which is a unique integer that
identifies a row of data.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,250
Second, is a description of the task,

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,230
which is stored as text in
a column named description.

8
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:25,320
And third, is the priority level of
the task which is an integer 1, 2 or 3.

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,859
So each of these pieces of data,
is a column in the tasks table.

10
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:32,359
And each row contains data for
individual tasks.

11
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:35,359
Multiple rows of data,
are generally called a directory.

12
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:38,369
And a single row of data
is often called an item.

13
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:41,149
And you'll hear me use these
terms throughout the lesson.

14
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:44,908
The name of this table and its columns,
are all in the TaskContract class.

15
00:00:44,908 --> 00:00:46,871
Stored as constant strings.

16
00:00:46,871 --> 00:00:50,256
They declare this constants because
you'll be referring to them in your code

17
00:00:50,256 --> 00:00:52,890
multiple times and
you want to stay consistent.

18
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,710
Next, I want you to open up and go
through the code in TaskContract class,

19
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,350
and identify these constants
by their variable names.
