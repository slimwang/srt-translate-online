1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,250
So what I'm now going to do is--I'm going to take the structure here, make it a bit smaller like this

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,710
and take away the NP here, and we are going to reappear in a minute.

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,250
What I'm now going to do is I'm going to put a bunch of these structures together.

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:18,430
So connect this one edge, connect this one edge, and we're also going to do one here

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,990
and now call this one A and this one B.

6
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:25,050
Now, what you see here is that I have taken three structures like these

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,550
and put them between A and B.

8
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,020
I'm going to do this more generally now.

9
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:34,190
Imagine that instead of an edge here, I could have more of these structures.

10
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,160
I'll just write three dots here and these will represent

11
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,030
additional copies of this structure being in between here.

12
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:47,760
So in total, I will have n copies of the structure--n times this structure here appears between A and B.

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,020
And now my question is, how many shortest paths between A and B

14
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,780
can you have that visit all of the vertices here.

15
00:00:53,780 --> 99:59:59,999
If you have n copies of that structure, is that nÂ², is that 2^n, or is that 2n.
