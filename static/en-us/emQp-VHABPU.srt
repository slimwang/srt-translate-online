1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,740
Moving forward.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,780
It is good that we can
access elements in a, but

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,860
another important operation is assigning
values to specific location in a.

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,890
This will give us access to the element
at the position 0, 0 in the a.

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:19,490
Using the assignment operator,
we can assign a value one to it.

6
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:20,430
Let's see the output.

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,560
Here you go.

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,910
This is the original array where we
replaced the element at 00 with 1, but

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,070
that's not all,

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,850
with the minor change you can assign
a value to the entire row or column.

11
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:35,430
Let's do it.

12
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,470
This will give us access
to the 0 true and

13
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,750
we assign the entire row a value of 2.

14
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,570
Let's run this.

15
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,180
Using similar operation and

16
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:50,630
column slicing, we can also assign
an entire column a single values.

17
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:56,460
Now what if we need each column or
row to have different value and

18
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,750
not the same as we did over here?

19
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,120
Let's see how we can achieve this.

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,570
Yes, this is a list of values.

21
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,790
You can assign a list of
values to a row or a column.

22
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:12,660
Here we assign this list of values
to column number three, but

23
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,530
make sure you keep
an eye on the dimension.

24
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,560
That is, for this example,

25
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,430
if you have five rows in an area
the list should have five elements.

26
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:27,400
As you can see, all the list values
have been assigned to the third column.

27
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,980
So now it's your turn.

28
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,350
Go ahead and try more row and
column slicing.
