00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,358
Remember that to get that common denominator in both terms, we need to multiply

2
00:00:05,358 --> 00:00:10,589
the first term by 5 over 5, so the denominator becomes 5x. Then we just combine

3
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:15,835
our like terms, and simplify. This gives us a new equation of 14 over 5x equals

4
00:00:15,835 --> 00:00:16,024
7.
