1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,785
So, since 7 is the number that we're multiplying by itself over and over again,

2
00:00:04,892 --> 00:00:09,600
it is the base number, and it goes here as the big number that we write first.

3
00:00:09,707 --> 00:00:14,340
Now, we have four of these 7's multiplied together so the exponent that we want

4
00:00:14,352 --> 00:00:17,710
is 4. So that means that 7 times 7 times 7 times 7 equals 7 to the 4th power.

5
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:22,590
Now, there are several different ways of saying this answer out loud. You can

6
00:00:22,602 --> 00:00:27,299
say 7 to the 4th power 7 to the 4, 7 to the power of 4, or just 7 to the 4th.

7
00:00:27,405 --> 00:00:32,366
Certain other exponents have special names that we use, but they're pretty self

8
00:00:32,378 --> 00:00:37,464
explanatory. For example, 7 times 7 is equal to 7 to the 2nd power. But instead

9
00:00:37,476 --> 00:00:42,148
of saying that, we might also say 7 squared, right here. In the same way, if we

10
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,494
have three 7's multiplied together, 7 times 7 times 7, we get 7 to the 3rd

11
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,793
power. But sometimes we say 7 cubed instead.
