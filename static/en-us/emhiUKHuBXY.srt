Welcome to Unit 6. The big idea in Unit 6 is recursive definitions and we'll see

2
00:00:03,956 --> 00:00:07,380
how to use a recursive definition of popularity to make the search engine

3
00:00:07,392 --> 00:00:10,993
respond with the best page for a given query instead of just giving us all the

4
00:00:11,005 --> 00:00:14,835
pages. This is really a key advance that made Google so successful. The real

5
00:00:14,847 --> 00:00:18,695
goal of this unit is to give you infinite power. I know what you're thinking, I

6
00:00:18,707 --> 00:00:22,620
have infinite power already, and you're right. You've had infinite power since

7
00:00:22,632 --> 00:00:26,485
Unit 2 when you learned about procedures and if. And that was enough to write

8
00:00:26,497 --> 00:00:30,270
every possible computer program. But we went on to introduce while, to use a

9
00:00:30,282 --> 00:00:34,160
while loop to find all the links in a page. And that really should not have been

10
00:00:34,172 --> 00:00:38,170
necessary. If you already had infinite power, you wouldn't have needed anything

11
00:00:38,182 --> 00:00:41,467
new to do that. What we're going to see in this unit is that you could do that

12
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:44,786
without while, that all you really need is procedures, and by thinking about

13
00:00:44,798 --> 00:00:47,775
things recursively, you can solve lots of problems in interesting ways.
