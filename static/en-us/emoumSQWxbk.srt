00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,037
A set of points described by Z equals 0 is a plane going along the X and Y

2
00:00:03,037 --> 00:00:07,088
directions, through the origin. This is where the camera is located in

3
00:00:07,088 --> 00:00:11,394
projection space. So the third answer is the correct one. The points described

4
00:00:11,394 --> 00:00:15,288
by the last three answers are all located outside the frustum. These points

5
00:00:15,288 --> 00:00:18,610
should be culled, and any edges formed from them clipped to the view volume.

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:22,225
This culling and clipping is done before division by W. Points on or inside the

7
00:00:22,225 --> 00:00:25,040
frustum are guaranteed to have valid W values.
