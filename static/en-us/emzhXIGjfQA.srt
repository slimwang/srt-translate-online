1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,939
As we said before, we'll be using template HTML to build our awesome resumes.

2
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:10,440
>> To do so, we'll be using the string.replace method to find a pattern

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,380
in a string and replace all or some matches of it.

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,940
We'll be using the most simple version to find the first instance of a pattern,

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,270
but you can do much more.

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,790
Check the instructor's notes for more details.

7
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,360
>> Let's take my email address as an example.

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,040
If I wanted to change out my Udacity email address for

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,040
a Gmail email address, I could use a replace function.

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,540
In this case, I've got var newEmail.

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,310
It goes email, the string with my Udacity email address and

12
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,940
I'm replacing Udacity with Gmail.

13
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,810
>> And don't forget to check to see if that worked.

14
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:50,680
>> Right.

15
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:57,668
Let me add console.log email to see my old email address and

16
00:00:57,668 --> 00:01:03,940
console.log(newEmail) to see my new email address.

17
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:11,730
Okay, we're going to refresh our page, open up the console and there we go.

18
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,510
We can see my old udacity email address showing up on the console as well

19
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,280
as my new Gmail address on the console as well.

20
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,440
>> Let's have the students try it but

21
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,780
this time, let's append the new message to the page.

22
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:29,210
I want you to create a new called funThoughts where you take

23
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:34,800
everything that was in awesomeThoughts, but replace the word awesome with fun.

24
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,410
Use .append(funThoughts) and put it on the page.

25
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:41,910
Check this box when you see your message show up on the page.
