00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,450
We just threw a lot of terms at you in
that last video, so let's take a closer

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:09,620
look at common metrics and acronyms
used when it comes to advertising.

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:16,610
There are five we'll be exploring,
CPC, CPM, eCPM, CPI and CTR.

4
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,900
Knowing the definitions for each of
these terms is extremely important,

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,060
especially as you're evaluating the
success of using ads in your product.

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,030
Let's start with CPC or cost per click.

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,150
Now, this is essentially
how much an advertiser pays

8
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:38,530
you if a visitor to your site or a user
of your product clicks on their ad.

9
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,310
The acronym CPM is a little tricky.

10
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,441
This stands for cost per thousand and

11
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:48,788
the M actually is the Roman numeral for
a thousand.

12
00:00:48,788 --> 00:00:53,860
CPM is how much you earn for
every 1000 views of an add.

13
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,054
This can also be referred to as CPI or

14
00:00:57,054 --> 00:01:01,640
cost per impression,
another item from our list.

15
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,226
eCPM is then the estimated cost per
thousand views and is calculated by

16
00:01:06,226 --> 00:01:12,170
dividing your total revenue by the total
number of views of the ad in thousands.

17
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:16,100
eCPM is helpful when you're evaluating
the performance of different ads on your

18
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,100
site, and you want to estimate how much
you'll make as the views increase.

19
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,940
Lastly, we come to click-through rate or

20
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:28,240
CTR, this metric measures how many
users have actually clicked on an ad.

21
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,460
It's calculated by dividing the total
number of clicks by the total number of

22
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:38,640
impressions or views, and multiplying
that number by 100 to get a percentage.

23
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,770
So now that we've gone through each
of these definitions, let's test your

24
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,600
memory and see if you can remember
these three-letter acronyms.

25
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,740

acronyms using the provided boxes.
