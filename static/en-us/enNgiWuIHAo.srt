1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,200
What are some of the properties of simulated amealing? No we

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,900
already talked about two of them: this idea that as the temperature

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,130
goes to zero, it acts, it's acting more and more like

4
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:11,200
hill climbing, only taking steps that improve the fitness. And as T

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,360
goes to infinity, it's like a random walk around the neighborhood.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,530
So you, wherever point where it is, it's willing to go to

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,660
any of the other points in the neighborhood and it just

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,650
doesn't, it doesn't really pay any attention to the fitness function anymore.

9
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,720
>> So huh,

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,210
so that makes sense right if I wanted to, to go

11
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,170
with the analogy. High temperatures like a lot of heat, which

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,850
is a lot of energy and so molecules bounce around a

13
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,900
lot. That kind of has the effect of flattening out the fitness

14
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,745
function. T goes to zero, that's no energy. It's like you've

15
00:00:40,745 --> 00:00:45,020
frozen; molecules can't move and so you only move to places with

16
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,900
lower energy or in this case, higher fitness. So that all

17
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,980
makes sense. So how do I get from one to the other?

18
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:51,776
You see you had any

19
00:00:51,776 --> 00:00:54,500
>> You had in the algorithm decrease t, but do we need

20
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,880
to decrease t quickly, slowly, what's the right way to do it?

21
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,950
>> So in practice, we wanted to decrease the temperature slowly, because

22
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,560
it gives it, the system a kind of a chance to explore at

23
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,320
the current temperature before we start to cool it out. So, well,

24
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,310
one way to think about it is, if you think, if you consider

25
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,970
some kind of function that we're trying to optimize,

26
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,280
when the temperature is high, it kind of doesn't

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,550
notice big valleys. It's, it's willing to kind of

28
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:24,280
wander through big valleys. As the temperature gets cooler, the

29
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,640
valleys become boundaries and it starts to break things

30
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,560
up into different basins of attraction, but smaller gullies

31
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,724
it still is able to walk, walk over. As

32
00:01:33,724 --> 00:01:37,910
the temperature gets even lower, those become barriers as well.

33
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,160
And so what we really want to do is give

34
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,115
it a chance to kind of wander to where the,

35
00:01:41,115 --> 00:01:44,710
the high value points are before cooling it so much

36
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:48,090
that it can't now bridge the gulf between different local optimums.

37
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,680
>> Ok, that makes sense. So, property

38
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,780
as it's sort of bouncing between exploration and

39
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,590
exploitation. I buy that. So where do you end up? Where do you end up?

40
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,075
>> Well, if we're lucky, we end up at the global optimum; yay.

41
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:03,500
>> [LAUGH] Is there anything, you know, we could say

42
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,210
that we could characterize how often we end up there, or are we

43
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,600
going to have to do randomized restarts

44
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,788
and do simulated annealing a million times?

45
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:12,850
>> So, we're not going to be able to go through the argument for exactly

46
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,500
why this is true, but there is a

47
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,670
remarkable fact about simulated annealing that is worth

48
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:23,780
mentioning. That the probability end at any, any given point x in the space is

49
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,420
actually e to the fitness of x divided

50
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,530
by the temperature and then normalized, because this

51
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,680
is a probability distribution over the input space. So this is,

52
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,420
this is pretty remarkable right? So this is saying that it's most

53
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,590
likely to be in the places that have high fitness, right?

54
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,880
because that's those are where it's going to have the highest probability of

55
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,700
being. And you can see now what the relationship with the

56
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,570
temperature is here too, that as we bring the temperature down, this

57
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,125
is going to act more like a max. It's going to put

58
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:53,545
all the probability mass on the actual x star, the, the, the

59
00:02:53,545 --> 00:02:57,780
optimum. And as the temperature is, is higher, it's going to smooth

60
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,340
things out and it'll, you know, be randomly all over the place.

61
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:00,925
>> Hm.

62
00:03:00,925 --> 00:03:03,180
>> So, so that's why it's really important

63
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,570
that we eventually get down to a very low

64
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,490
temperature. But if we, again, if we get there

65
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,710
too quickly, then it can, it can be stuck.

66
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,375
>> Hm.

67
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:14,580
>> Right, because it's spending again, time proportional to the fitness.

68
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,900
So, it is spending time ending up at points that are not

69
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,410
the optimum, if they're say, close to the optimum.

70
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,655
>> Okay, so you know, I actually now that you, you spell that out,

71
00:03:25,655 --> 00:03:28,074
I actually recognize this distribution, it has

72
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:31,310
a name it's called the Boltzmann distribution.

73
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,500
>> That's exactly right, and if there's people listening that

74
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,240
have a physics background, they're going to probably be poking

75
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,210
their eyes out because, huh, it's the case that we,

76
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:44,100
we're using a number of physics concepts, but we don't quite

77
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,410
use the same notation and we don't quite do things exactly the

78
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,530
way that a physicist would. So,

79
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,660
there's definitely a relationship and the Boltzmann

80
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,140
distribution is used quite a bit in, in the physics community, but

81
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,720
it may not be exactly like that so don't, try not to panic.

82
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,020
>> Yeah, it's more like an analogy, like

83
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,470
so much of life. It's a simulated Boltzmann Distribution.

84
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,780
>> It's like a simile.

85
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,081
>> [LAUGH]
