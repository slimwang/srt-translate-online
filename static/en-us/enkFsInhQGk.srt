1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,540
That ends our sort of little
introduction to video analysis.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,820
And what we'll do for
the next lecture is,

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:12,920
we'll take a little bit of a look at how
people do activity recognition in video.

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,040
One of it will be some
slightly more modern method,

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,260
which is really just like
a discriminative classification.

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,980
We'll just do that real short.

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,520
And then there's one
that I really enjoy.

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,770
Why?
because my students invented it.

9
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,940
But it, it's become, useful,
about a way of describing human motion,

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,980
which you could then apply
the discrimination methods to, so,

11
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,800
the idea is that it's
a representation of the action.
