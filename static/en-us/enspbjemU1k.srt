1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,559
I guess we've already
seen one optimization.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,200
>> How so?
>> Well, if I choose the least

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,130
constraining value for Queensland,
we would not have had to back up.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,650
Let me show you.

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,009
We started with
Western Australia being orange.

6
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:14,379
Then the Northern territory was green.

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,080
Since Queensland is not next to Western
Australia, I can use orange again.

8
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:19,879
That will leave blue unused.

9
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:24,729
>> Okay, so orange was the value that
least constrained our future choices.

10
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:25,980
>> Now, you get it.

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,620
>> Another optimization is to choose
to assign the variable with a minimum

12
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,330
remaining values next.

13
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:33,100
>> If we start with
assigning Western Australia,

14
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,460
then the Northern territory colors, the
variable with the least number of values

15
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,929
remaining is South Australia, so we
should choose that one next to assign.

16
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:41,439
>> What if I have a tie?

17
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:42,679
>> What do you mean?

18
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:47,229
>> In this example, we have assigned
Southern Australia a Northern Territory.

19
00:00:47,229 --> 00:00:51,640
There are two regions that can be
only assigned orange, Queensland, and

20
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,329
Western Australia.

21
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:54,739
Which do we chose?

22
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,039
>> Choose the one with
the most constraints.

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,359
>> You mean Queensland in this case
because the border is New South Wales,

24
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,379
as well as a Northern Territory,
and Southern Australia.

25
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:10,585
Western Australia, only borders,
Norther Territory in Southern Australia.

26
00:01:10,584 --> 00:01:11,544
So it's not as complex.

27
00:01:12,545 --> 00:01:15,534
By choosing the one that's more
constrained in the future,

28
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:19,274
we'll appeal to running the problem
sooner rather than delaying them.

29
00:01:19,275 --> 00:01:20,135
>> Correct.

30
00:01:20,135 --> 00:01:23,590
>> Okay, well how much do these
improvements to backtracking help?

31
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,350
>> Remember our end queens problem?

32
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:26,239
>> Yeah.

33
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,459
>> Well it is another example of
a constraint satisfaction problem.

34
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:30,469
>> Okay.

35
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:32,200
>> And
using the least constraining value and

36
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,840
minimum remaining values heuristics, the
improved backtracking search will allow

37
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,020
us to do the thousand queens problem.

38
00:01:38,019 --> 00:01:39,769
>> I don't think I could
ever do that by hand.

39
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:40,909
That's impressive.

40
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:41,840
>> You haven't seen anything yet.
