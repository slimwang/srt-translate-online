1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:00,985
All right so here's the mixed strategy.

2
00:00:00,985 --> 00:00:03,281
The mixed strategy is
that everyone just dares,

3
00:00:03,281 --> 00:00:05,723
chooses to dare with
probability one-third.

4
00:00:05,723 --> 00:00:06,533
>> Really?
>> Yeah,

5
00:00:06,533 --> 00:00:08,843
that works out to be a Nash equilibrium.

6
00:00:08,843 --> 00:00:12,125
We'll leave it as an exercise to the
reader to convince themselves of that,

7
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:14,315
but it does actually
work out to be the case.

8
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:17,459
>> And so that means we both, okay,
we both dare with probably a third,

9
00:00:17,459 --> 00:00:20,018
which means two-thirds
of the time we chicken.

10
00:00:20,018 --> 00:00:23,190
So there's going to be some probability
that we both chicken, some probability

11
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,680
that I chicken and you don't,
some probably that you chicken and

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,160
I don't, and then the lowest
probability is we both dare, boom!

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,342
>> Right, so in fact, I'm glad you
said that, because that's exactly how

14
00:00:33,342 --> 00:00:36,929
we would figure out how good
a strategy this mixed strategy is.

15
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:37,871
>> Right.
>> So, let's do this.

16
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:38,521
So, let me ask you a question.

17
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:41,748
What's the probability
that we both chicken?

18
00:00:41,748 --> 00:00:43,548
>> Four-ninths.

19
00:00:43,548 --> 00:00:44,430
>> And how do you get four-ninths?

20
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,788
>> I looked at your notes.

21
00:00:45,788 --> 00:00:47,515
That's the problem with
being in the same place when

22
00:00:47,515 --> 00:00:48,621
we're doing these recordings.

23
00:00:48,621 --> 00:00:50,964
>> Well, I'm pretty impressed that
you can actually read my handwriting,

24
00:00:50,964 --> 00:00:51,582
I'm pretty sure.

25
00:00:51,582 --> 00:00:52,830
>> No, I cannot only not read it, but

26
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,645
my eyes are old enough that I can't read
it anyway even if you write it nicely.

27
00:00:55,645 --> 00:00:59,521
So, no, what I did is, I took if
the probability of dare is a third,

28
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:02,381
then the probability of
chicken is two-thirds.

29
00:01:02,381 --> 00:01:05,779
And we're independently choosing that,
so the probability that both of us

30
00:01:05,779 --> 00:01:08,720
choose it is two-thirds times
two-thirds, or four-ninths.

31
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,305
>> So what's the probability
of one person chickening and

32
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:13,512
the other person daring,
in particular C, D?

33
00:01:13,512 --> 00:01:16,170
>> C, D, so that's one-third times
two-thirds, which is two-ninths.

34
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:16,914
>> Mm-hm.

35
00:01:16,914 --> 00:01:18,295
And by symmetry?

36
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:19,359
>> Nine-seconds.

37
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:21,425
Sorry, two-ninths.

38
00:01:21,425 --> 00:01:21,960
>> Mm-hm.

39
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,390
>> And then dare, dare would be
one-ninth because it's dare times dare.

40
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:25,924
>> Right.
>> And

41
00:01:25,924 --> 00:01:28,489
let's just double check that four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

42
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:29,208
Whoo-hoo!

43
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:31,298
Wait, no not one-third,
the bottom thing.

44
00:01:31,298 --> 00:01:32,502
>> Thank you so much.
>> Okay.

45
00:01:32,502 --> 00:01:36,285
And so, now we can figure out from
this what our expected, let's say,

46
00:01:36,285 --> 00:01:39,706
my expected reward would be for
playing this Nash equilibrium.

47
00:01:39,706 --> 00:01:42,210
>> Right, so
let's say you're player one.

48
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,132
So this is you.

49
00:01:43,132 --> 00:01:47,220
So then if we do C, C, what is your,
actually you're the row.

50
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,750
What is your a payoff?

51
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,306
>> 6.

52
00:01:49,306 --> 00:01:52,094
>> So,
we can just say 6 times four-ninths.

53
00:01:52,094 --> 00:01:54,670
What's the payoff if you chicken out and
I dare.

54
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:55,912
>> 2.
>> 2.

55
00:01:55,912 --> 00:01:58,733
And what's the payoff if you dare and
I chicken out?

56
00:01:58,733 --> 00:01:59,732
>> 7.

57
00:01:59,732 --> 00:02:01,973
>> And
what's the payoff if we both dare?

58
00:02:01,973 --> 00:02:02,473
>> 0.

59
00:02:02,473 --> 00:02:03,807
>> 0.

60
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:06,774
So we add all that up,
multiply these numbers, add them, and

61
00:02:06,774 --> 00:02:08,110
what do we end up with?

62
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:08,908
>> You're asking me?
[LAUGH]

63
00:02:08,908 --> 00:02:09,965
>> Yeah.

64
00:02:09,965 --> 00:02:11,092
>> You're the one who can do arithmetic.

65
00:02:11,092 --> 00:02:12,066
>> You're right, it's 4 and two-thirds.

66
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:12,693
>> Really?

67
00:02:12,693 --> 00:02:15,050
>> Yeah, we just did that by
keeping the denominator the same.

68
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:19,567
So, that's 24 plus 4,
which is 28, plus 14, right?

69
00:02:19,567 --> 00:02:20,252
>> Mm-hm.

70
00:02:20,252 --> 00:02:23,970
>> Which is 42, plus 0,
42 over 9 is 4 and two-thirds.

71
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,320
>> This is actually pretty cool,

72
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,410
and the payoff is 4 and
two-thirds on average for you.

73
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,730
And by symmetry it's actually 4 and
two-thirds.

74
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,820
>> Which I like better than
both of us chickening out.

75
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,010
>> Right, both of you chickening out is-
>> No, no, sorry, sorry.

76
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:37,960
That's better.

77
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,984
I like better than me chickening out.

78
00:02:38,984 --> 00:02:40,076
[LAUGH]
>> Right.

79
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:40,762
>> And then I'll only get two.

80
00:02:40,762 --> 00:02:44,325
>> Right, and so actually doing this,
even though occasionally we will, well,

81
00:02:44,325 --> 00:02:47,618
in the game we'll both die, but
of course we aren't going to die, we're

82
00:02:47,618 --> 00:02:51,199
just going to get 0 utility because all
that other stuff doesn't really matter.

83
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:53,021
>> Okay.
>> We're going to do this.

84
00:02:53,021 --> 00:02:55,657
This is actually pretty good, right,
this is a pretty good pay-off.

85
00:02:55,657 --> 00:02:56,656
>> Okay, I agree with that.

86
00:02:56,656 --> 00:02:59,795
>> In fact, for either one of us, if we
get in the short end of the stick for

87
00:02:59,795 --> 00:03:02,043
the C,D,D,C,
this is actually better for us.

88
00:03:02,043 --> 00:03:05,223
>> That's true, the worst of us,
or sorry, not the worst of us.

89
00:03:05,223 --> 00:03:05,920
That doesn't sound right at all.

90
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,565
But the least fortunate of us is much
happier with this outcome than the C, D.

91
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:14,474
>> Right, and by the way, we're actually
happier with his outcome than if we had

92
00:03:14,474 --> 00:03:16,100
uniformly randomly chosen between them.

93
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,486
>> And we're better off with this
outcome than if we had done C, D,

94
00:03:19,486 --> 00:03:23,090
and then like split the winnings,
which would be 4 and-a-half.

95
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,981
>> Yeah, so it's the same thing as
doing half, or going by half, right?

96
00:03:25,981 --> 00:03:28,370
It's 4 and-a-half, 4 and-a-half
is less than 4 and two-thirds.

97
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,526
Those are, in fact,
the same thing in this case.

98
00:03:29,526 --> 00:03:30,766
>> Got it.
>> This is why it's

99
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:33,820
something like a third and
not something like a half.

100
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,530
So, that's pretty cool.

101
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,127
So, this seems like a pretty good win,
but

102
00:03:37,127 --> 00:03:39,516
I'm going to claim
that we can do better.

103
00:03:39,516 --> 00:03:40,131
>> Hm, okay.

104
00:03:40,131 --> 00:03:40,852
>> Okay.

105
00:03:40,852 --> 00:03:45,059
So, let's remember this 4 and two-thirds
and keep it around for a little while,

106
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:48,020
and let me try to convince you
that we're going to do better.

107
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,930
Okay?
>> Okay.
