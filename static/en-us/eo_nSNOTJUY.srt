00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,150
Now let's talk about what
happens in a write back cache.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,650
Write through is fairly simple.

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,880
We just send writes to memory and

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,284
the cache works just as
we described it before.

5
00:00:09,284 --> 00:00:13,740
But for write back caches,
we can have a block that we did write

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,580
since we last brought
it from the memory.

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:22,300
In that case, when we replace the block
we need to write it to memory, but

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:27,520
we can have a block that we didn't write
since we last brought it from memory.

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,890
That block has only been
read since we brought it in.

10
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:31,730
In that case,

11
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:36,500
when we replace, there is no need
to write that block back to memory.

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,190
But how do we know which
one of these we have?

13
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:43,960
One choice that we might make
is that we don't want to know.

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,860
We'll just every time that
we replace the block.

15
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,630
Unfortunately, there is a lot of
read only stuff that we will now

16
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:55,380
end up writing to memory over and
over, all that's unnecessary.

17
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:01,730
So instead, we choose to add a dirty
bit to every block in the cache.

18
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:05,090
The dirty bit says
whether we have written

19
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:08,300
the block since it was
placed in the cache, or not.

20
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:13,620
So if the dirty bit is zero,
it means that the block is clean, or

21
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,510
it was not written since it
was last brought from memory.

22
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,910
Or, we can have the dirty bit be one,
in which case we say that the block is

23
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:27,410
dirty, or it was written since
we last brought it from memory.

24
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:31,710
And that means that we need to
write this block back to memory

25
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,530
on replacement.

26
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,524
When this block is kicked out of the
cache it needs to be written to memory.

27
00:01:36,524 --> 00:01:38,940
If it's claim then we don't
have to write it to memory.
