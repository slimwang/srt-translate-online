00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,233
So, we're interested in exploring the situation where a determinant, b squared

2
00:00:04,233 --> 00:00:08,314
minus 4ac, is negative or less than 0. The reason this is an issue is because we

3
00:00:08,314 --> 00:00:12,282
know we need to take the square root of the determinant, and right now, we have

4
00:00:12,282 --> 00:00:16,170
no idea what taking the square root of a negative number means. None of the

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,766
types of numbers we've dealt with so far can express the answer to this

6
00:00:19,766 --> 00:00:25,012
equation. So, I guess that means we're going to need a new kind of number. Let's

7
00:00:25,012 --> 00:00:28,691
look back then at all the kinds of numbers we have dealt with. Here's a diagram

8
00:00:28,691 --> 00:00:32,442
depicting our world of numbers that Julie introduced in the very first lesson of

9
00:00:32,442 --> 00:00:36,016
the course. I know this looks a little bit different because I decided to use

10
00:00:36,016 --> 00:00:39,656
rectangles this time instead of circles, but all the sets and subsets have the

11
00:00:39,656 --> 00:00:43,792
same relationship to one another. You can see that we have the natural numbers,

12
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:47,692
which are inside of the whole numbers, which are inside of the integers, which

13
00:00:47,692 --> 00:00:51,496
are inside of the rationals. And together, the rationals and the irrational

14
00:00:51,496 --> 00:00:55,882
numbers make up the real numbers. The question I have for you then is where this

15
00:00:55,882 --> 00:01:00,686
new kind of number we're talking about belongs. We see that the number n is some

16
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:05,370
negative real number. Where should we put the square root of n? Does it belong

17
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:09,996
in the natural numbers? The whole numbers? The integers? The rationals? The

18
00:01:09,996 --> 00:01:13,151
irrational numbers? Or outside of the real numbers?
