1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,530
Now let's look at the quiz
number three in this sequence.

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:08,790
We have a very similar set of
executions and processors P1 and

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,230
P2, and slightly different focus
on what's happening on P3 and P4.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,830
The question is the same.

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,480
Considering the following
sequence of operations,

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,200
is this execution
sequentially consistent?

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,840
You need to provide your answer yes or
no.

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,680
And also,
is this execution causally consistent?

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,760
Again, you need to provide
your answer yes or no.
