1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,510
I find that the easiest way
to keep things straight,

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:06,310
is to think about this relation
as referring to hardness.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,630
Thus, I would read this as
saying B is as hard as A.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,920
The word reduction also
makes sense in this light.

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:17,890
We are reducing the hardness
of A to that of B.

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,510
The answer of course is the first and
the last.

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,354
If there's a decider for B then
that let's us build the decider for

8
00:00:25,354 --> 00:00:27,620
A just by composing with the reduction.

9
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:32,490
And the last statement is just
a counter positive of the first.

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:38,210
The second statement is false because it
might very well be that A is decidable,

11
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,190
but B is not.

12
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,600
A could be easy while B could be hard.

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,250
And the same logic applies
to the third state.
