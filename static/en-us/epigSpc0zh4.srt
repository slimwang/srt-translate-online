1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,610
So are you familiar
with K-armed Bandits.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:03,690
>> Let's pretend I'm not.

3
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,130
>> All right, so let me tell you
a little bit about K-armed Bandits then.

4
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,140
So here's the basic idea.

5
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,790
You have K bandits and
each of them has an arm.

6
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,800
>> So wait,
why isn't it K armed-bandits then?

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,700
Why isn't the dash between armed and
bandits?

8
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,725
>> Oh, K armed-bandits.

9
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:20,320
Yeah, because each one is an armed
bandit and there's K of them.

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:20,900
>> Right.

11
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,870
>> Yeah.
That works, but

12
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,130
I think we're supposed to think of it,

13
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,711
the important thing is that
there's K different arms.

14
00:00:24,711 --> 00:00:26,140
>> [LAUGH]
>> Okay.

15
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,010
>> And so the bandit,

16
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,220
this comes from terminology
having to do with slot machines.

17
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,820
They named this model back in
the I'm going to say '50s.

18
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,370
So, we don't have to necessarily
understand it anymore.

19
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,940
That was ancient history.

20
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,740
But the fact of the matter is
sometimes people will call

21
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,900
a slot machine a one armed bandit.

22
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,762
In a slot machine, you get to make
a choice at each moment in time,

23
00:00:49,762 --> 00:00:52,280
which of the one arms to pull.

24
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,250
Which, of course, is not a very
interesting decision problem.

25
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,660
So, the idea of a K-armed Bandit is,
you've actually got, in this case,

26
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,750
what K is 7?

27
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,459
And each of these arms has some
probability of paying off.

28
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,720
So, you pull on it and you either get
jackpot, or you don't get a jackpot.

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,050
Now usually in a casino these
would be rather low payoffs.

30
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,320
In fact, I think it's not so
uncommon in the casino for

31
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,910
them to have not even
necessarily different payoffs.

32
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,418
But here for this,
it's going to be interesting to have

33
00:01:21,418 --> 00:01:23,377
each of the arms have
a different payoff.

34
00:01:23,377 --> 00:01:25,769
Or at least we don't know what the
payoffs are, they could be different.

35
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:27,210
>> Okay.

36
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,040
>> So which arm do we want to pull?

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,270
>> The best one?

38
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,290
>> Yeah, which one is that?

39
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,010
>> The one that has the best
chance of giving you money.

40
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,460
>> Here, I'll make it easier for you.

41
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,360
Okay.
>> I'm going to give each

42
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:35,890
of them a name.

43
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,070
All right, now which one do you pull?

44
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,580
>> The letter that has the most
money associated with it.

45
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,100
>> Okay, all right, so
I think you're making a valid point,

46
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,000
though you're making it
in a frustrating way.

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,040
And that is that we don't know which
arm to pull because we don't know

48
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,590
what the payoffs are.

49
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,500
So if I tell you the payoffs this
problem becomes really easy right?

50
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,860
>> Yeah.
>> We just do argmax right?

51
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,810
Whichever one has the highest payoff,
we just choose it all the time.

52
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,940
But, what makes
the K-armed Bandits problem

53
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,090
interesting is that we
don't know the payoffs.

54
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:06,880
Let's say instead what we know is
that each one has some probability of

55
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,550
giving a pay off.

56
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,979
And the payouts are all the same,
let's say they're all 0/1.

57
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,520
And each bandit has a probability
of paying off a one.

58
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,280
But, we don't know what it is at first.

59
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,070
And, in fact, if we pull arm A and

60
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,900
it doesn't pay off, does that
mean that A is not the best one?

61
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,830
>> No, I mean, how would we know?

62
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,150
We don't know what anything else is.

63
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,100
>> No, right, right.

64
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,680
So, therefore, we can prove that one arm
pull is giving us some information, but

65
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,410
not an awful lot.

66
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,940
We actually have to combine information
across a whole lot of pulls to start to

67
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,200
really appreciate what
the best thing to do would be.

68
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,680
>> Okay, so we have to explore.

69
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,150
>> Yes! Good.
Way to connect it back to the topic.

70
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,430
All right, so let's think about what
that problem might actually look like.

71
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,470
So, I wrote down the observed
payoffs for each of these arms.

72
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:58,865
Associated with each one of these arms
is the number of times that we've pulled

73
00:02:58,865 --> 00:03:01,630
that arm: 10, 20, 40, 5, 10, 20, 40.

74
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,880
And of those times that we've pulled it,

75
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,990
the number of times it
actually paid off for us.

76
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,506
So, this arm, we pulled 10 times and
we got a payoff of 1.

77
00:03:10,506 --> 00:03:14,956
This arm, we pulled 10 times, and
we got a payoff twice, two payoffs.

78
00:03:14,956 --> 00:03:18,895
So between a and e,
if we had to choose one,

79
00:03:18,895 --> 00:03:24,140
it seems pretty clear that
e has been better so far?

80
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,310
>> Yeah, so far.

81
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:29,100
>> Yeah, and let's say between a and

82
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:34,635
d they both paid off once, but d gave
us the payoff after only five hits.

83
00:03:34,635 --> 00:03:37,480
Or in the context of five hits,
five pulls.

84
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,700
And a in the context of 10 pulls.

85
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,230
So d is a bit better than a as well.

86
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:46,310
So, what I'd like us to do is
think about two different things.

87
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,860
One is,
given the data that we've gotten so

88
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,420
far, which arm has
the highest expected payoff?

89
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,240
And, of all the different
arms that we could pull,

90
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,730
which of the estimates
are we most confident in?
