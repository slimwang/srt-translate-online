00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,260
Hey, glad you're back.

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,270
Let's talk about another useful tool
that'll help you gather data and

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,730
get better insight into how
your applications using energy.

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,690
It's called Battery Historian.

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,570
Basically, you're going to use
ADB to dunk data from your phone.

6
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,770
And then use the Battery Historian
tool to convert that data into a nice

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,340
HTML table that you can
view in your web browser.

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,580
Now Battery Historian is a separate
open source python script

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,740
that you're going to need
to download from GitHub.

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,425
So.
So let's go ahead and do that.

11
00:00:28,425 --> 00:00:31,495
Okay.
So here we are at the GitHub page for

12
00:00:31,495 --> 00:00:33,555
Google's version of Battery Historian.

13
00:00:34,755 --> 00:00:36,195
Now in order to download this file,

14
00:00:36,195 --> 00:00:39,599
we want to come down here to lower right
and click this download zip button.

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,160
For this demo we're going
to work from the desktop.

16
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,810
But you can use any
directory of your choosing.

17
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,640
Now to get started let's go ahead and
double-click this zip file which is

18
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,970
going to extract the folder with
the python script that we care about.

19
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,630
Okay.
Let's go ahead and open the folder.

20
00:00:54,630 --> 00:01:00,320
As you can see there's a license file,
as well as the historian python script.

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,949
Let's go ahead and
drag this script to the desktop.

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,129
Okay, that's it for setup.

23
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:07,660
We should be all set to
use Battery Historian.

24
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,970
Now the next thing you're
going to want to do,

25
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,910
is make sure you connect
your phone to your computer.

26
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,620
Also make sure that USB
debugging is turned on.

27
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,680
I'm going to go ahead and
run ADB devices just to confirm.

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,000
All right, the next steps will
work from any terminal window.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,950
But if you have Android Studio
opened like I do,

30
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,500
you can actually open a terminal
right within the ID, like so.

31
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,340
Go ahead and cd to your desktop.

32
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:34,090
Now as a precaution, we're going to go
ahead and shut down our ADB server.

33
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:37,450
The way you do this is by
typing adb kill server.

34
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,220
Now this is an important step
because while we're developing,

35
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,980
lots of stuff can be turned on
that might cause conflicts,

36
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,780
while trying to do battery recordings.

37
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,810
So to be safe here,
we want to start ADB clean.

38
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,120
All right.
So I'm going to go ahead and

39
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,070
type ADB devices.

40
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,990
As we can see, ADB is restarting,
and our phone is attached.

41
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:00,610
If you don't see any devices,
make sure your phone is connected and

42
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,380
your USB debugging is turned on.

43
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,060
Then go ahead and kill and
restart ADB once more.

44
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,650
Now the next thing we want to do is
reset the battery data gathering so

45
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,979
you can start from a blank state,
we do it like this.

46
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,690
So I just type this command adb
shell dumpsys batterystats,

47
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:17,830
With the reset option.

48
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:23,320
This is going to go ahead and
reset all the battery gathering data.

49
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,530
Now if you don't do this,

50
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,020
you're going to get a lot more data
than is actually useful or relevant.

51
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,130
In other words, you're going to see a
lot more noise than you want when you're

52
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,110
reading your battery stats.

53
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,380
All right.
So now you can go ahead and

54
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,020
disconnect your phone
from your computer.

55
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,570
When you go ahead and
pull this cable out right here, so

56
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,100
you don't draw any current from your
computer instead of the battery.
