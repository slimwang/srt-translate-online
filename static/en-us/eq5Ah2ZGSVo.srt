1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,630
So next you'll need to bring
in two utility functions.

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:06,660
formatFilters and
getQuery from todo5conference.py.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,960
Lets take a look at those.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,480
The formatFilters function takes
the user separated values and

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,380
creates a filter in a format
that app engine understands.

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,950
It also makes sure that users are not
trying to run impossible queries,

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,618
by using an inequality
filter on two fields.

8
00:00:20,618 --> 00:00:23,920
And the getQuery function uses
the formatted filter to form a query,

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,510
including using proper ordering,
when necessary.

10
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:29,711
So to make your app actually
take user filters into account,

11
00:00:29,711 --> 00:00:34,290
you'll also need to change the query
conferences method in conferences.py.

12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,030
To use the getQuery method
to get the query, and

13
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,950
then return the result as before.

14
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:39,570
Now, go ahead and

15
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,660
make the changes necessary to enable
this functionality in your app.

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,850
After you've done that,
check off these boxes,

17
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,040
then make a couple of
conferences in your app.

18
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,289
Make one of them named Udacity.
