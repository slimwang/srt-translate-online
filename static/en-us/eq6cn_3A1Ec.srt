00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,560
Welcome to Udacity's Full Stack
Web Developer Nanodegree.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,400
My name is Michael Wales, I've been
lucky enough to be a professional web

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,490
developer for over 16 years.

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,940
It's a job that I love and
I'm passionate about.

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,220
I joined Udacity to help people like you
launch themselves into a career that is

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,610
fun, exciting and
in a field that is endlessly growing.

7
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,540
By completing Udacity's full
stack web developer nanodegree,

8
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,750
you will have the qualifications you
need to start or advance your career as

9
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,260
a professional web developer with
the portfolio of projects to prove it.

10
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,310
For example, you'll build a movie
website to share your favorite movie

11
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,730
trailers with your friends.

12
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,850
You'll build a database driven
application to store and

13
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,740
analyze the results of a tournament.

14
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,580
You'll build an item catalog website
that includes authentication and

15
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,840
allows users to update the content.

16
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,990
You'll build a massively scalable
API that powers a mobile conference

17
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:44,950
application.

18
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,330
And finally, you'll turn a bear
bones Linux server into a secure and

19
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,210
efficient web server
your applications demand.

20
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,670
>> With the help of
our industry partners,

21
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,840
we designed these projects
to showcase the skills and

22
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,210
technologies companies are looking for
when hiring full stock web developers.

23
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,690
Our team here at Udacity is excited to
help you develop the expertise you need

24
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,300
to build these projects.

25

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,450
and by Udacity's coaches and

offer project feedback, and

30
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,530
