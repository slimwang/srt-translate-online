1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,948
And this one is maybe a little bit tricky.

2
00:00:01,948 --> 00:00:03,490
You might have said other, but

3
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,370
I would actually argue that this is a type of text.

4
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,220
It's not words maybe in the most classic sense, but it's words of

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,450
a very specialized vocabulary, where the vocabulary is email addresses.

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,720
And so, text wrangling tools might be one of the more better ways to

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,650
deal with email addresses.

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,710
Great job. Now that we've gone through all these examples of types of data,

9
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,230
hopefully you have a good sense for what might be some interesting features to

10
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,710
look for and what type of data those features are.

11
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,020
Now obviously, not everything we talked about here is something that's going to

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,180
be available to us in the email corpus.

13
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,620
For example, salary information is very,

14
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,400
very interesting, but it's not going to show up in your email inbox.

15
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,820
So now, let me tell you a little bit more about the data set that we've made

16
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,540
because I haven't been totally honest so far.

17
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,340
We do have a lot of emails, but

18
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,360
there's some other very interesting stuff that we have available as well.
