1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So let's say now that you have a problem

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
that you know to be an NP such as vertex cover,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and there's basically two ways that you could show this problem to be NP-complete.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The first one is, you could take another NP-complete problem

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and reduce it to your new problem.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
A second way would be to use the definition

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
that we just had of NP-completeness

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and show that this problem here can be used

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
to solve any other problem that is also solvable in NP,

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and by showing, I mean proving.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That is the first way, and the other way would be to

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
just use the definition of NP-completeness that we just looked at,

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
so what you could also do is you could show,

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
or in this way you would have to prove mathematically,

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
that any problem in NP can be reduced to your problem.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And the emphasis here is on any problem,

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
because otherwise, it wouldn't be NP-complete.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And those are the two possible ways you could show NP-completeness.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I will call this here approach number one

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and this one up here approach number two.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Now if you look at those two approaches,

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
this one here sounds much easier in a way than this one here,

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
because here we just have one problem where we have to have a reduction,

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and here we have to have any problem.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Not even some problems, not even a million problems, but really any problem.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But there's a little problem with the first approach here,

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and I hope you can tell me what that is.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So what could be potential issues with approach number one?

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Could it be that this only works for some problems in NP?

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Could it be that before we can do approach number one,

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
we must first have had success with approach

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
number two for at least one problem in NP?

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Or could it be that approach number one is not always correct?

34
00:01:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So please check all of these statements which you believe are true.
