00:00:05,265 --> 00:00:10,640
variables, we can really substitute in pretty much anything we want. Now, you

00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,605
know that my favorite letter in the entire world is m. So, I'd like you this

4
00:00:15,605 --> 00:00:20,240
time to set x equal to m, and use that in our function. What is f of m?
