1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,652
To get a perfect square on the left. We'll need to add the quantity b over 2

2
00:00:03,652 --> 00:00:09,522
squared to both sides of the equation. Here, our value of b is positive 6. We

3
00:00:09,522 --> 00:00:14,541
take 6, and we divide it by 2 to get 3. And then finally, we square that

4
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:18,720
quantity to get 9. The amount we need to add to both sides of our equation.
