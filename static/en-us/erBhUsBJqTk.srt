1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,820
We know that we want to multiply A by alpha and

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:09,660
since the some of weights needs to be one we multiply B by one minus alpha.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,900
And finally we assign this to the output variable.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:13,730
That's it.

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,120
Let's see what we get.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,800
Alright, same image as before.

7
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,420
Now see how easy it is to change the blending weights.

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,940
For example, I want little less dolphin and more of bicycle.

9
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,520
And, there we go.

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,359
It almost looks like there is water on the street.

11
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,560
This method of obtaining a weighted sum of two images is the basis of

12
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,080
alpha blending.
