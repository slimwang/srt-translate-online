1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,839
Our first investors,

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,617
I don't know if it's the first investor
because we had a few on day 1.

3
00:00:06,617 --> 00:00:11,400
They were the best possible fit for us.

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,410
They shared the same culture as us,
the same beliefs.

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,360
The same approach of
starting a business.

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,670
They gave us their full support.

7
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,870
They really believed in the team.

8
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,200
Some believed in the CDO
more than in the CEO.

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,390
Some believed in the CEO
more than the CDO.

10
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,880
But they were there for us.

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:40,720
And working with them was an experience
that I will never forget.

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:48,020
And I owed him so much like Michael is,
I owed him to my first investors.

13
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:53,120
They validate your vision and
they say okay, you are not crazy.

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,928
We believe that you can lead a team
to execute on this crazy vision.

15
00:00:58,928 --> 00:01:03,838
And when people that you appreciate say
something like that and actually put

16
00:01:03,838 --> 00:01:09,128
their money where their mouth is, it's
something very special, something very

17
00:01:09,128 --> 00:01:14,210
special happens when when they do it for
some people, for most people even if.
