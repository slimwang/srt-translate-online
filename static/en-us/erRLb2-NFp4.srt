1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,870
So here we are in app.yaml.

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:05,540
And here's the new configuration for
sending confirmation email.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,960
Then in main.py, here's the new
SendConfirmationEmailHandler,

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,500
which we've added.

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,530
And then in conference.py, whenever
a conference is created, right after

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,920
putting it into the datastore,
we now add the task to send the email.
