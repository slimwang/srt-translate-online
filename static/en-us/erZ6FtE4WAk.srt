1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,570
Well, as you recall, the concrete state is like the abstract state except we've

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:09,050
added in a running total to it. And if we do the addition and, and

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,240
if I've done my addition correctly, then the value of the running total

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,400
attribute is going to be 4 at this time. That is the valid concrete state is

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,120
identical to the abstract one with the running total added in.
