1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,148
Both of the functions we have here output real numbers for y, for any number of

2
00:00:04,148 --> 00:00:09,861
x that we could plug in. So the domain of each is all real numbers. In other

3
00:00:09,861 --> 00:00:13,738
words, negative infinity to infinity. The ranges of both of the functions are

4
00:00:13,738 --> 00:00:18,295
the same as one another, as well. They are both 0 to infinity, not including

5
00:00:18,295 --> 00:00:23,505
either of those endpoints. Now we can see this happening on either graph, but

6
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:28,270
why is it happening? Here is an instance where our equations can lend a hand.

7
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,750
No matter how small a number you plug in for x in our exponential growth

8
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:37,124
function, 2 to the x will never reach 0. The numbers will get closer and closer

9
00:00:37,124 --> 00:00:41,655
to 0, but they'll never actually equal it. For the exponential decay equation,

10
00:00:41,655 --> 00:00:45,010
if we look way out to the right side of the graph as x approaches infinity, y

11
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,475
will approach but never touch 0, since the same thing will be happening with

12
00:00:48,475 --> 00:00:51,390
this equation.
