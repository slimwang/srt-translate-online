1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,920
I hope you got three.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,370
One, two, three.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,920
And of those three, I see that this one and this one are slow.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:09,810
So two of them are slow.

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,990
And the last one in the list there is fast.

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,630
So this is the steep path of my tree.

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,950
Then on the other side is my flat terrain.

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,010
I only have one example of a flat terrain, and that's fast.
