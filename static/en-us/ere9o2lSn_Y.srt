1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,500
So here now we can see we
can get the transition type

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,370
using
geofencingEvent.getGeofenceTransition.

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,320
This is going to return
an integer to us.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,300
Now, the geofence object contains these
constants GeofenceTransitionEnter and

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,610
GeofenceTransitionExit.

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,730
So all we have to do then is if
the geofence transition is this or

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,160
the geofence transition is this,
then we're going to run a block of code.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,670
We'll see what that block of
code is in a few moments, but

9
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,250
this is all you'll have to do to check

10
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,750
the transition type if you're
entering or if you're existing.

11
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,270
Of course, it's up to you how
you build your application.

12
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,400
If you want to build it so
that events only happen when you enter,

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,100
then you don't need to check for the
geofence transition exit and vice versa.
