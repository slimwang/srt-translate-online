00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,550
Here we have our data from our caffeine and reaction time experiment. The

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:09,240
caffeine group is called the experimental group and the no-caffeine group is

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,300
called the placebo or control group. We just mention the mean, which is another

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,450
statistical tool that we use in psychological experiments. The mean is the

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:22,080
average of all scores. So for our caffeine and reaction time experiment we took

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,200
each individuals reaction time and got an average. So for our experimental

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:33,790
group the average or mean score on reaction time was 0.3527 seconds. And for

8
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:39,810
our control or placebo group, our average reaction was 0.5621. So what does

9
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,960
this difference mean? We ran another statistical test and we found that the

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,810
difference between the experimental group and the control group was

11
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:52,590
statistically significant. But what does that mean? It means that it is highly

12
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,880
unlikely that the scores we observed were due by chance. So again in this

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,430
caffeine and reaction study we can say the signicant difference between point

14
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:06,670
three and point five seconds occurred most likely because of the caffeine and

15
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,759
not because of some other variable.
