00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,280
To go in a little bit deeper
into the special device files,

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:08,530
Linux also supports what are called
pseudo or virtual devices.

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:13,040
These devices do not represent an actual
hardware and are not critical in our

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,820
understanding of I/O management,
but are useful nonetheless.

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,790
As a quiz, I will ask you to look at
the following function descriptions and

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,940
name the pseudo device that
provides that function.

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,770
First, what is a device that accepts and

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,800
then discards all output without
actually producing anything?

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,877
Second, what is a device that
produces a variable-length string of

10
00:00:33,877 --> 00:00:35,550
pseudo-random numbers?

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,510
For your answers, please fill them in,
in these boxes, and

12
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:43,840
also use the full path to the device
to specify what is the correct answer.

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,484
For instance to answer that
the devices line printer is here up,

14
00:00:49,484 --> 00:00:51,792
use path /dev, /lp0.
