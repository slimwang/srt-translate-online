1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,620
So when we remove the keyword, self, from in front

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,650
of storyline. Let me go ahead and do that one

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,370
more time. What we are really doing is changing storyline

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,740
from being an instance variable, accessible with instances like Toy

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,120
Story and Avatar, to being a simple local variable inside

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,180
the function in it. Now, I will still be able

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,890
to access this variable, storyline, from anywhere inside this function

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,440
in it. But not with an instance like Avatar. And

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,890
since we are attempting to do that in

10
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,100
this print statement, my hypothesis is that Python will

11
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,480
throw an error and say that this movie object

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,210
Avatar has no story line. So to check that

13
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,600
hypothesis, I will Save my media file, and

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,270
then go back to my entertainment center file and

15
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:48,000
run that file. There is the error. Python says

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,530
that Movie instance, in this case, Avatar, has no

17
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:55,750
attribute called storyline. So, to correct this, what I will do, is go

18
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:01,202
back to the code and add the self keyword in front of storyline, there.
