00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let me do another quiz.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Suppose that at x1 we see landmark L0 at a distance of 9.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This gives me a relative constraint between x1, right over here,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and landmark 0, which is over here.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Just like before, these link two things together relatively--the x1's and the L0.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Now this doesn't look like a submatrix, but it is. It's spread a little bit apart.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
But I want you to modify those 4 values in the matrix and those 2 values in the vector

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
to accommodate that we believe that the occasion

9
00:00:33,000 --> 99:59:59,999
of L0 is 9 greater than the robot position x1.
