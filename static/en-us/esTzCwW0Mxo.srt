00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,336
Our numerator is a difference of two perfect squares. So we can factor it as 2x

2
00:00:05,336 --> 00:00:11,022
plus 5y times 2x minus 5y. This denominator isn't identical to one of our

3
00:00:11,022 --> 00:00:16,024
factors, but it is an opposite polynomial for this factor. We can see that the

4
00:00:16,024 --> 00:00:20,720
2xs are opposite in sign and the 5ys are also opposite in sign. So these two

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,981
factors simplify to be negative 1 and were left with negative 1. Times 2x plus

6
00:00:26,981 --> 00:00:32,921
5y. We can distribute our negative 1 to get our answer, negative 2x minus 5y.

7
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:36,180
Fantastic work if you got that expression.
