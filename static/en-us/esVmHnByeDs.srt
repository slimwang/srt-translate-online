1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:00,910
All right.

2
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:03,680
So to do that,
is just a little bit of math,

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,970
it's not a horrible amount of math, it's
just sort of pretty straight forward.

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:12,040
So here's our line, and let's set
our line to be wx plus b equals 0,

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,075
and that's going to go down
the middle of the line.

6
00:00:15,075 --> 00:00:16,824
I'm sorry, down the middle of the set,

7
00:00:16,824 --> 00:00:18,732
that's going to be our
separating boundary.

8
00:00:18,732 --> 00:00:23,733
Now, what we can do is we can say the,
the lines that are the,

9
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:28,836
the margin lines,
the ones that hit the nearest points,

10
00:00:28,836 --> 00:00:34,233
we can say that the value on one
side is w.x plus b equals minus 1,

11
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:38,218
and on the other side
w.x plus b equals 1.

12
00:00:38,218 --> 00:00:40,908
Now you might ask,
how come I can set them equal to 1?

13
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:42,728
>> How can I set them equal to 1?

14
00:00:42,728 --> 00:00:45,078
>> Megan's asleep over there,
but she got to it eventually.

15
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:48,525
Well, remember I could scale,
w and b, right?

16
00:00:48,525 --> 00:00:50,752
And still have wx plus b equals 0.

17
00:00:50,752 --> 00:00:53,902
So what I can do is I can scale
them up to make it so tho,

18
00:00:53,902 --> 00:00:56,660
those distances are 1.

19
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,931
What we want is, we're going to define
a little auxiliary variable called y,

20
00:01:00,931 --> 00:01:04,864
corresponding to the xs, and the idea
is that when I have a positive x,

21
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:06,890
we're going to find y to be plus 1.

22
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,024
When we have a negative x, and what I
mean positive, is a positive example and

23
00:01:10,024 --> 00:01:13,132
a negative example, you know, this is
a baseball, this is not a baseball.

24
00:01:13,132 --> 00:01:15,738
All right, so when y equals minus 1,

25
00:01:15,738 --> 00:01:18,925
we've got x.w plus b to
be less than minus 1.

26
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:22,773
So that's a way of saying that, you
know, we want all the positives to lie

27
00:01:22,773 --> 00:01:27,030
over here, and we want all
the negatives to lie over there, okay?

28
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,650
Notice, that on this drawing, there
are a couple of special points, okay?

29
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,850
Now, in today's age, we like to tell
points, all points are special.

30
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,978
But in reality, just like real life,

31
00:01:38,978 --> 00:01:41,379
only some of us points are special,
okay?

32
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:45,429
In particular, this point is special,
this point is special, and

33
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:49,430
this point is special,
because they define our margin.

34
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:54,840
All these other points out here,
they don't impact our margin, all right?

35
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,037
And this is part of why discriminative
classification is, is sort of better,

36
00:01:59,037 --> 00:02:01,972
not sort of,
is in some sense better than generative.

37
00:02:01,972 --> 00:02:05,710
We don't actually have to worry about
representing all these points out there.

38
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,911
We're just representing the boundary but
getting back to what we're saying,

39
00:02:09,911 --> 00:02:14,070
that we have these three special
points that define what our margin is.

40
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,411
And those, are referred to as our
support vectors, these are vectors,

41
00:02:18,411 --> 00:02:18,920
right?

42
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,654
They're points in our feature of space,
so you can think of that as a vector,

43
00:02:22,654 --> 00:02:26,272
and these are called support vectors
because these are the ones that sort of

44
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:29,490
define for us that,
that best separating plane.

45
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,830
So those are support vectors, okay?

46
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:37,800
So at our support vectors, x.w plus
b actually equals 1, right, okay, and

47
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:44,380
the distance between those lines, that's
going to be referred to as our margin.

48
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:51,030
So we can compute, the size of M,
as a function of these values, right?

49
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,300
So we have the same
equation we had before,

50
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:59,380
the distance between the point and the
line, x.w plus b normalized by w, okay?

51
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:04,540
That's the, that's the, the,
the distance between a point and a line.

52
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:11,580
Well, so for support vectors, w.x plus b
is just either plus 1 or minus 1, okay?

53
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,650
It's plus 1 on one side,

54
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,230
minus on the other side,
divided by the magnitude of w.

55
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:21,480
So that means that M is just,
you know, 1 minus negative 1 over w,

56
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,620
because of that value, right,
and so it's just 2 over w, okay?

57
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,690
So the margin M is just 2 over w.

58
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,030
What we need to do is we
want to find w that does what?

59
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,740
We want to maximize the margin
