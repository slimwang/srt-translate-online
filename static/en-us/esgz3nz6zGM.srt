00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,910
Let's investigate incremental builds and
up-to-date checking.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,100
Go ahead and check out
the exercise in the course code,

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,700
then see if you can
answer this question.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,250
How does time stamping build outputs
interact with incremental build support?

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,100
Does everything work fine?

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,900
Is it a problem because build support
should be tagged by version number, or

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,649
is it true that the task
can never be up-to-date?
