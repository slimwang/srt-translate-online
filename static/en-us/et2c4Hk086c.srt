Let's do a little quiz that checks you on this, with respect to completeness,

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:10,540
and overlapping. I'm going to give you two examples. The first example is

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:16,570
athletes, and let's say we have, subclasses of athlete, for baseball players,

4
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:22,050
football players, basketball players. Determine whether first of all,

5
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,370
those subclasses are disjoint,and are they complete?

6
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,196
Second example is books which can be Paperbacks, ComicBooks or hardboundBooks.

7
00:00:33,196 --> 00:00:39,720
Are they, complete subclasses? Are they disjoint, subclasses?
