00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,336
So, we know that meditation is linked to overall feelings of well-being, but

2
00:00:04,336 --> 00:00:10,208
does meditation only effect self reported changes in feelings? New research has

3
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:14,429
actually shown that meditation increases the growth of brain tissue in the

4
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:20,428
areas that are important in emotional processing and attention. In this study,

5
00:00:20,428 --> 00:00:24,460
half of the people were trained in meditation and engaged in meditation for

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:29,079
eight weeks. The other half were randomly assigned to the control group, and

7
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:33,388
they did not meditate. At the end of the study, the changes in brain tissue

8
00:00:33,388 --> 00:00:38,448
were also associated with emotional well-being in those that meditated. This

9
00:00:38,448 --> 00:00:42,107
nicely demonstrates how changes in our environment can change our brain. So,

10
00:00:42,107 --> 00:00:46,312
here's a question. Was the study I just talked about a correlational research

11
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:50,079
design or an experimental research design? Select one.
