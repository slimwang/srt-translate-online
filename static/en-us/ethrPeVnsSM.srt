1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,850
When you save an entity with a key, it creates a new

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,990
entity in the data store with that key. As you found out

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,680
earlier, this creates a key conflict. If an entity with that key

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,760
already exists, it is out of luck and it gets chucked out.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,900
It's overwritten in the data store. So if you want to update

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,680
an existing entity, first you need to get it out of the

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,570
data store, then you make your updates and then you save it

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,410
back into the data store again. So back here in the save profile

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,660
method of that conference API, whenever we've been saving our

10
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,170
profile the first thing we do is create a new

11
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,210
profile with the user ID. That means that actually every

12
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,812
time you update your profile, you're not really updating it,

13
00:00:37,812 --> 00:00:41,250
you'll create a new profile entity which overrides the existing

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,170
profile entity. You can see how that plays out in

15
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,620
the API Explorer. Now that we've implemented get profile, we

16
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,730
can just call get profile to get the existing profile

17
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,840
for the current user. So lets do that. Okay. Lets see, so my display name

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,750
is "Chocolate Cake" and my t-shirt size is XL. Now, lets say I want to

19
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,665
change that, I want to change my t-shirt size, so I go to

20
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:10,605
saveProfile and the only thing I want to do is to change my

21
00:01:10,605 --> 00:01:16,180
t-shirt size from XL to XS, extra small, this time.

22
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,810
Now we'll execute. And what would be really nice,

23
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,020
would be that the only thing that changes it

24
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,804
the t-shirt size. So let's see if it will

25
00:01:23,804 --> 00:01:27,410
happen. But, no, that's not what happens. You see

26
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,720
how the display name gets set back to the

27
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,890
default, which is example and my t-shirt size did

28
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,120
change. What should really happen, the saveProfile method should

29
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,180
get the existing profile and only update the fields that

30
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,550
have changed. So that's going to be your next task.
