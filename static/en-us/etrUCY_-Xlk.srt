00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,700
Let's look at shortest tour but -how about we look at a bit more

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,850
practical version of the shortest tour problem.

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:13,210
So let's say first the shortest tour problem, instead of using 1 van which seems a little silly--

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:21,740
you'll realize, "Hey, let's just use a lot of vans," let's say we'll use n vans in order to deliver the mail.

5
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,880
Now, if all vans start at the same time, well then how does this end up changing

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,140
the behavior of the problem and the complexity of the problem.

7
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,270
Well, let's take a look at two different questions.

8
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:38,430
First, let's ask how much time until all the mails delivered and all vans return to the base

9
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,190
in the n vans scenario and the 1 van scenario.

10
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,800
Will the n vans take less time, less than or equal to the same amount of time,

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,930
greater than equal to the same amount of time, or always greater than the time that 1 van will take.

12
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,480
And similarly, for the sum of all individual times taken by the vans.

13
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:01,540
Now, what I mean by that is--if let's say each van takes 8 hours to deliver the mail

14
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,430
and then return back to base, then the total amount of time would be 8 hours times n

15
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,240
where n is the number of vans.

16
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,000
And is this total amount of time always going to be less than, less than or equal to,

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,840
greater than or equal to, or always greater than the amount of time

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,000
taken by a single van to do the same thing?

19
00:01:22,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please check whichever is most appropriate for both questions.
