Graphs A and D probably look pretty familiar to you and they go respectively

2
00:00:03,742 --> 00:00:07,928
with functions G and F. I know it probably seems a little bit strange because

3
00:00:07,928 --> 00:00:10,853
we haven't seen equations like these before, even though you recognize their

4
00:00:10,853 --> 00:00:14,752
graphs. We'll talk more about this later, but start to think, right now, about

5
00:00:14,752 --> 00:00:18,950
what these equations reduce to. And why they produce the graphs that they do.

6
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,163
Graphs B and C however are definitely new for us. Graph B represents the

7
00:00:23,163 --> 00:00:28,480
function one over X and graph C represents the function one over X squared.

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,532
You'll see a lot more graphs that look like these two over the next few

9
00:00:30,532 --> 00:00:34,139
lessons. And pretty soon you'll understand exactly what's happening in each of

10
00:00:34,139 --> 00:00:34,799
them.
