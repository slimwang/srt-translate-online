00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,600
Great.
So, now let's do a quiz.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:07,420
Here are three glob patterns, and here
are some filenames that they might or

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,640
might not each match.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,700
Go through these lists of filenames,
and for

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,150
each pattern mark the box with
the filename matches the glob pattern.

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,870
If you're not sure whether a filename
should match the glob pattern or

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,990
not, you can always try making a file or
directory with that name, and

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,445
testing the pattern with LS.
