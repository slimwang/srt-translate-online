1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now, I've chosen to say that only robotic soccer and hide-and-go-seek are stochastic.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
By that I mean if you have an action like go forward 1 meter,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
the result of that action stochastic. You may not go forward exactly 1 meter.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You could also analyze games like poker and cards and say that they're stochastic

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
in that the next car is random, and so the action of flipping over the next card is stochastic.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You don't know how that action is going to result.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I've chosen to model that as partial observability.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What I've said is it's not that you pick randomly from the next card,

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
it's that the cards are already arranged in some order.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's just that you don't know what that order is.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
There's partial observability that gives you the next card.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Partial observability also shows up in the real world sports

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
or of robot soccer and hide-and-go-seek.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Obviously, that's kind of the point of hide-and-go-seek that it's partially observable.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Now, in terms of unknown, I've said that only hide-and-go-seek satisfies that.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
In everything else, the world is well-defined.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Even in the real world in an environment like robot soccer,

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
you only have the known field to deal with.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Whereas in hide-and-go-seek, someone could be hiding anywhere

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
in a room or location that you don't know about yet.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Notice that many games are adversarial, but some games are not.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Solitaire games are not adversarial.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You could mark that down as saying, well, I'm playing against the game itself,

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
but we don't count that as adversarial, because the games itself is not trying to defeat you.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The game itself is passive.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Whereas in these games and what adversarial has come to mean is that

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
the opponent is taking into account what you are thinking

28
00:01:52,000 --> 99:59:59,999
when the opponent does their own thinking and tries to defeat you that way.
