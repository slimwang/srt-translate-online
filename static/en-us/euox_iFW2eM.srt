00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hey, guys--so today we're going to

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
go over how to install Python

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and then install Google App Engine

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
so that you can get going on the homework.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's really the main point of this homework--

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
to get you up and running, so that--

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
for the rest of the homeworks--

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
you actually have a good handle

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
on how to start, and we can just go over

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
how to actually start building some Real World Web Applications.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So okay--let's start out.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So here, I'm at: www.python.org.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Go ahead and go there, and then you'll get this link

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and go down to: download Python now.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The good thing is that if you're on Mac or Linux,

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
then you probably already have Python installed.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You shouldn't need to get anything.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
If you do, then you can go ahead and install it from here.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So down here what you want to click on is--

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
if you're installing Windows, then either a 64-bit system, down here, or 32-bit--

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
you simply click on there and install it like you would normally on a Windows system.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Same thing with the Mac system.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
On Linux, you can install a source tarbal--

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
but, honestly, you probably already have it,

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and there's an easier way to do that with your package manager.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'll have a list of instructions for some of the more common

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
package managers for Linux up in the forums.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So we're not going to go over that right now.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But go ahead and open it, for example--right there--

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and then install it as you normally would.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It shouldn't take more than a few minutes.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And after that--once we have Python installed,

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
we have everything we need for Google App Engine.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So let's go ahead and install that.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Now, Google App Engine is right here.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
If you don't want to type all of this in,

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
just Google App Engine and it should be the first option

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
on the search results page.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So before we go ahead and sign up,

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
we're going to install the software development environment

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and it's pretty easy to use, for the most part.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So we're going to go over here to Downloads.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
We're going to want the Python Version of it,

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
so either the Windows, the Mac or the Linux--

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
depending on what platform you're on.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Don't worry about the MapReduce Bundle.

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That's not something we need to worry about right now.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So go ahead and open up whichever one is appropriate for your system.

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
All of them are super simple to install.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Once you've got it installed,

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
we're going to open up Google App Engine

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and it opens into this screen right here, okay?

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Now what we need to do is open up a new application.

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So go to File>New Application,

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
and then that should open up this, right here.

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We'll go ahead and install it under, let's say: hello-udacity.

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Great. And there we go.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Okay. So there are a couple things to look at.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Now we can open up the files

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
that this automatically creates.

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So go to the Path, which you see right here,

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
and there's really only 1 file you need to worry about--

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and that's: main.pi.

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
There are a few other files in that directory.

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
We're not going to worry about them right now.

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
We'll explain it later.

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
There's not much to it, really.

68
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Here's your main file for your Web application: hello-udacity.

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So open main.pi, and it's really a pretty short file.

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And now you change this to print out: hello-udacity.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
We can run this.

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You see that it's running on Port 8081.

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Steve talked about Ports early in the course.

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So what we're going to do

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
is open up localhost.8081--

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and you see: Hello world!

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Now, you're going to have to change this

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
to print out: hello-udacity.

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But the hard part--the part we're really interested in--

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
is actually installing this so you're ready for other homework assignments later on,

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
when we're building--well, some Web applications with some actual content.

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Now we've got it running on our local system.

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But, obviously--well, hopefully,

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
we can't see your local system.

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So we need to actually sign up for Google App Engine.

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So let's go back to the main page that we were at before,

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
sign up for an account with them--it's very simple,

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and once you have all of your information there,

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
then all you have to do to put this up online

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
is deploy it to your account and password,

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
sign in, and it will automatically load all these things.

92
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And then, once you're done,

93
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
you should be able to go to the Google App Engine Web site

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and check out your Web app.

95
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Now, I haven't loaded this on yet,

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
but once you do, you should get the same results from there

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
that you do from your local host.

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And that's about it.

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
All you have to do is change this to: hello-udacity

100
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
and then load up the URL,

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
whatever this happens to be--

102
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
this is hello-udacity in mine;

103
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
in yours, it would be whatever this is--

104
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
and put that in for the homework assignment,

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
and you should be good to go!
