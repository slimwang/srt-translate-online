00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,820
So far in this course we have been primarily concerned with top-down design.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,570
That is, when given a set of requirements come up with a set of pieces,

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,940
connect them together and refine.

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,840
In this lesson we will go the other way.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,600
Start with self contained pieces called components and

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,250
put them together to build systems.
