00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,860
Let's start with looking at
an example of an AI agent in action.

00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:08,070
Many are you are familiar with Watson,
the IBM program that plays Jeopardy.

00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,280
Some of you may not be, and that's fine,
we'll show an example in a minute.

00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,260
When you watch Watson in action,
try to think.

00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,990
to play Jeopardy?

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,520
Write them down.

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,810
And anytime you feel the pain,
hey, this guy refrain.

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,200
Don't carry the world
upon your shoulders.

11
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,009
Watson?

12
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,200

this man's perfect 2008 Olympics,

16
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,460
losing to him by
one-hundredth of a second.

17
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,060
Watson.

18
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,840
>> Who is Michael Phelps.

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,970
>> Yes, go.

20
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,270

24
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,670
>> Tickets aren't needed for this “event”,

25
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:04,860

which matter can not escape.

26
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:05,870
