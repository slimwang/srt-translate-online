1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
All right. Let's figure out what the answer is.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now, there's a couple of things that I want to try to illustrate with this example.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
One is that up to this point, our shortest path has been the shortest number of hops,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and there's a one hop path from A to B, which also happens that it's actually fairly expensive.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Paths that have a shorter total distance like 13 that actually consist of hops, and in fact,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:28,000
the shortest of all in larger lot of hops goes like this--4+3 is 7 equals 8+2 is 10+1 is 11.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Now, let's take a look at how we can do this systematically

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
so we can actually build an algorithm that can find answers like this.
