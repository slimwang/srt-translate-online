1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,467
Our two lines intersect at this point. We follow that up to the x-axis, looks to

2
00:00:05,479 --> 00:00:10,703
be halfway between these two grid lines, which are x equals negative 4 and x

3
00:00:10,715 --> 00:00:15,446
equals negative 6, which means, the x-coordinate is negative 5. The

4
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:21,012
y-coordinate, if we go over the y-axis, is negative 11. So, this point is

5
00:00:21,024 --> 00:00:26,202
negative 5, negative 11. And the x-coordinate of that is negative 5. So, x

6
00:00:26,214 --> 00:00:31,687
equals negative 5. Remember that the original equation we started with was 3x

7
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:36,790
plus 4 equals 2x minus 1. Let's make sure that negative 5 actually is a solution

8
00:00:36,802 --> 00:00:41,277
for this equation. If we plug in negative 5 to the left-hand side, we get 3

9
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:46,054
times negative 5 plus 4. And this simplifies to negative 11, which was, in fact,

10
00:00:46,066 --> 00:00:50,763
the y-coordinate that we found for our point. On the right-hand side, we have 2

11
00:00:50,775 --> 00:00:57,755
times negative 5 minus 1, and that also equals negative 11. So, the solution for

12
00:00:57,767 --> 00:00:00,000
x works for our original equation. Awesome.
