1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Thrun] Remember in Laplacian smoothing our best estimate

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
is the count of the occurrence of the words divided by N,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
but we add our Laplacian smoother over here,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and down here we add K times number of classes.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
For the movie prior we have 3 examples of movie titles over 6 total titles,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
which gives us 3 over 6.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We add our Laplacian prior, 1 over here.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
There's 2 classes, movie and song, 2 over here.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We get 4 over 8, which is a half.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The same is the case for song.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It gets more interesting for this probability over here.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In our movie class there's 2 occurrences of the word "perfect" out of 8 words,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
so we get 2 over 8.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But in adding the Laplacian prior, 1 over here

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and 1 number to add down here,

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
the number of classes here is the size of the vocabulary.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
In total for this model there is 11 different words.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
There are 16 total words in both titles,

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
but because of repetition there's only 11 distinct words:

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:26,000
a, perfect, world, my, woman, pretty, day, electric, storm, another, rainy.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So we add the number of classes over here, which is 11.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We obtain 3 over 19.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
For the song class there's 1 occurrence of perfect.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Adding 1 we get 2 over 19.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
There's no occurrence of storm in the movie class.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
However, our Laplacian prior gives us 1 over 19.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And there's 1 occurrence of storm over here, which gives us 2 over 19.
