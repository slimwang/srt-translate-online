1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,114
To find the pooled variance. We add the sum of squares, and then divide by the

2
00:00:04,114 --> 00:00:08,375
total degrees of freedom. Which is the degrees of freedom from x plus the

3
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:15,277
degrees of freedom from y. 3 plus 2 which is 5. We get 15.2.
