1
00:00:00,126 --> 00:00:02,907
Let's take a look at the next step in searching for a business model,

2
00:00:02,907 --> 00:00:04,824
and that's customer validation.

3
00:00:04,824 --> 00:00:07,332
By now to get to this step

4
00:00:07,363 --> 00:00:11,124
we assumed you believe you have product market fit.

5
00:00:11,124 --> 00:00:14,290
Now, you would say, "Okay, now I can hire people."

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,158
"Now I could run my million dollar Google AdWords campaign,"

7
00:00:17,158 --> 00:00:19,457
and we say, "No, not really."

8
00:00:19,457 --> 00:00:22,172
We don't really think you have enough evidence to do so.

9
00:00:22,172 --> 00:00:24,190
We kind of hear you that you believe you do,

10
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,189
so we're going to do this again, but this time try to get orders

11
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:32,921
or users or both, depending on what your business model said.

12
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:35,423
Phase 1 is you're going to get ready to sell.

13
00:00:35,423 --> 00:00:38,421
If it's a physical product, you're going to develop sales collateral,

14
00:00:38,421 --> 00:00:41,789
meaning the data sheets and price lists and demos, etc.

15
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:44,805
If it's a web and mobile product, you're going to try to

16
00:00:44,805 --> 00:00:47,424
acquire and activate customers, and you're going to build a

17
00:00:47,424 --> 00:00:50,972
high fidelity, minimum viable product, which is a fancy word for

18
00:00:50,972 --> 00:00:53,991
your website or mobile app will look like it's almost done,

19
00:00:53,991 --> 00:00:57,107
maybe the help files aren't there, et cetera, and maybe not all the features

20
00:00:57,107 --> 00:01:01,122
but the core features that people will use, and then you get out of the building,

21
00:01:01,122 --> 00:01:03,972
physically or virtually, and you try to get out and sell

22
00:01:03,972 --> 00:01:07,456
and see if you get users or payers or both.

23
00:01:07,456 --> 00:01:10,223
The other thing you'll be doing simultaneously with this

24
00:01:10,223 --> 00:01:13,390
is to develop positioning, which is a fancy word for saying

25
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,123
"Okay, I now have a lot of customer feedback."

26
00:01:16,123 --> 00:01:20,690
"How could I have best described this based on what the customers are actually telling me?"

27
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,107
Because you'll ask "So, I explained it to you like this."

28
00:01:23,107 --> 00:01:24,971
"How could I have said it better?"

29
00:01:24,971 --> 00:01:28,140
And if you actually listen to them they actually would have said,

30
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,756
"Yeah, I ignored the first 7 things you said,

31
00:01:30,756 --> 00:01:34,572
but when you said number 8 that's when I really got interested and excited."

32
00:01:34,572 --> 00:01:37,706
And so you're going to develop both corporate or company

33
00:01:37,706 --> 00:01:41,790
and product positioning, and you're going to do this way before you ever spend money

34
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,775
on external PR agencies by actually listening to your own customers.

35
00:01:45,775 --> 00:01:49,840
And then in Phase 4 you're going to verify or repeat,

36
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,839
and you're going to see if you're ready to start scaling

37
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:56,140
sales and marketing spending in customer creation,

38
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,824
which is the most expensive part of a startup.

39
00:01:58,824 --> 00:02:02,756
This customer validation stage actually gets you out,

40
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:06,122
and you pretend you have the world's largest sales force,

41
00:02:06,122 --> 00:02:09,288
and you're ready to go "Okay, I think it's really going to work

42
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:12,006
because I've tested it in customer discovery."

43
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:16,491
And most of the time you find out, "Oops, I really didn't quite understand

44
00:02:16,491 --> 00:02:18,607
what those customers were saying."

45
00:02:18,607 --> 00:02:20,940
And instead of being out of business because you spent all your money

46
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,257
on sales force or Google AdWords campaigns

47
00:02:23,257 --> 00:02:26,473
or customer acquisition you now have the cash and time

48
00:02:26,473 --> 00:02:30,106
to simply go back from Phase 4 and go back and pivot

49
00:02:30,106 --> 00:02:33,472
and say, "I clearly didn't understand something about

50
00:02:33,472 --> 00:02:38,523
my customer segment or features or customer needs or how to do customer relationships,"

51
00:02:38,523 --> 00:02:42,174
et cetera, and so customer validation in its detail, again,

52
00:02:42,174 --> 00:02:46,006
has 2 tracks, 1 for physical, 1 for web/mobile.

53
00:02:46,006 --> 00:02:47,523
Get ready to sell.

54
00:02:47,523 --> 00:02:50,556
Sell to early customers who we call early evangelists.

55
00:02:50,556 --> 00:02:55,042
Develop positioning, and again, either pivot or proceed.
