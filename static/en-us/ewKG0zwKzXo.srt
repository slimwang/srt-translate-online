00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,380
So today we've talking about understanding, which how agents make sense of

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,900
stories, events and other things in the world around them. We started off by

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,980
creating a more formal type of frame representation called thematic role

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:14,000
systems that captures verbs and tell us what to expect in certain events.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,590
We then talked about how single verbs can actually have ambiguous meanings. But

6
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,900
thematic role frames can help us differentiate which meaning a verb has in

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,220
a particular sentence. Finally we talked about constraints and how

8
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,760
certain words or frames can constrain the possible meanings of a sentence and

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,270
help us figure out those ambiguous meanings. Today we've largely been talking

10
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,740
about how single words or phrases can have multiple possible meanings, but

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,580
next time we’ll do this in reverse. We’ll talk about how multiple words or

12
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,340
multiple phrases or multiple sentences can actually have the same meaning.

13
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,090
We'll talk about how we can discern that sameness, and then react accordingly
