00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,469
As Eames said,
the details make the design.

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:06,020
Motion can be an opportunity
to provide delight and

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,970
make a connection with your user.

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,170
They can also bring
personality to your app.

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,710
After all, animating literally
means bringing to life.

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,280
Whenever an element changes state
this is a great opportunity to

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,580
animate this change.

8
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,460
This helps both to explain what is
changing and can direct attention.

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,900
This technique isn't restricted
to larger blocks of your UI.

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,390
Animating small details
eases the transition.

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,120
Take a look at these examples.

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,190
The clock up here runs an animation
whenever we switch tab.

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,500
This helps to communicate
the tab's purpose.

14
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,230
PocketCasts here animates the transition
between the play and pause states.

15
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,340
And here the Google I/O app, when we
reach the bottom, it animates the logo.

16
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,620
Now these last two might not
provide extra functionality.

17
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,010
These small details bring
a smile to your face and

18
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,430
make the experience of using
the app more enjoyable.
