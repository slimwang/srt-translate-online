00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,480
Let's suppose that in a network we have three

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,820
hosts shown as squares at the edge of the

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,840
network that are connected by links with capacities as

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,170
shown. The two senders on the left can send

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,600
at rates of 10 megabits per second and 100

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,580
megabits per second, respectively. But the link to the

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,140
host on the right is only 1.5 megabits per

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,380
second. So these different hosts on the left are actually

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,620
competing for the same resources inside the network.

10
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,100
So the sources are unaware of each other and

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,110
also of the current state of whatever resource

12
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,380
they are trying to share. In this case How

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,310
much other traffic is on the network. This

14
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:44,280
shows up as lost packets or long delays and

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,240
can result in throughput that's less than the

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,620
bottleneck link, something that's also known as congestion collapse.
