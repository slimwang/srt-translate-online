00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,157
You might be wondering where the 30 and the 11 come from in the number puzzle.

2
00:00:04,158 --> 00:00:08,726
Well we actually multiply the coefficient of the x squared term and the constant

3
00:00:08,726 --> 00:00:13,111
term together to get this top number. This bottom number 11 comes from our x

4
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:17,668
term. Whenever we want to factor a trinomial we can set up a number puzzle and

5
00:00:17,668 --> 00:00:23,038
then find the two factors we need to rewrite the x term. So, I can rewrite this

6
00:00:23,038 --> 00:00:30,014
expression as x squared plus 5x plus 6x plus 30. We can rewrite the 11x as 5x

7
00:00:30,014 --> 00:00:36,094
and 6x. The 2 numbers come from our number puzzle. By rewriting this x term as

8
00:00:36,094 --> 00:00:41,496
5x plus 6x we can use factoring by grouping. I remove an x from the first 2

9
00:00:41,496 --> 00:00:46,850
terms and a six from the second two terms. And whoa, look at that, our factored

10
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:52,188
form. So for any quadratic trinomial, we can try this process to factor it. We

11
00:00:52,188 --> 00:00:57,280
can find two factors of a times c, that sum to the middle number b. We'll

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,033
rewrite the middle term using those factors and then try factoring by grouping.
