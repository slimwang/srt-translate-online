1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,560
So, the process from an MVP to
getting funded is really depending on

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,752
many factors, perhaps the main
one being the domain you're at.

3
00:00:07,752 --> 00:00:13,140
So there some domains, like security for
example, that may be an MVP,

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,620
plus an early pilot would be
enough to get seed funding.

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,310
There some domains,
perhaps a mobile application,

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:26,120
that more often than not requires
more than just a basic MVP, but

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,920
actually some proof in the market that
this can be something interesting.

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,150
Clearly, there's no rules,
and no right or wrong, but

9
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:38,030
it really does depend on the domain
you're at, but once you're ready,

10
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,360
it's about having everything
you need in order to fundraise.

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,330
You need to show that you have
some plan of what you want to

12
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:51,070
do with the market or what you want to
do with the money when you fundraise.

13
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:55,290
You have the team, and
the MVP is a good indicator that,

14
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,520
you know what, maybe it's
interesting what you've built.

15
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,940
And this MVP shows not only your
ability as a team to execute, but

16
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,930
the market is receptive
to what you have built.
