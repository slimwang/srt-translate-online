1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,665
The last choice is the best one. Factoring by grouping won't work for this

2
00:00:03,665 --> 00:00:07,689
cubic. We just pulled out next, so we don't want to remultiply it back in.

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:11,206
There are no like terms to combine. And if we divide both sides by x, we'll end

4
00:00:11,206 --> 00:00:15,526
up with f of x over x here. And that's not really very helpful. The best way to

5
00:00:15,526 --> 00:00:19,993
find potential zeroes, of this polynomial, is to use the rational zero theorem.
