1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now we've got this great property.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We've got two things that are significantly different from 1/2.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Can we use that to break the cipher?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Now the question is assuming that the probability of ΔK is 0 is still 1/2,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
does knowing that these probabilities for ΔM and ΔS being greater than 1/2 help us?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Remember that our ciphertext values that we're intercepting

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
are the XOR of ΔM, ΔK, and ΔS.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The choices are, yes, that it definitely helps us.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It doesn't necessarily help us, but if we knew something more about K

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
maybe it would help us.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 99:59:59,999
It doesn't necessarily help us, but if we knew something more about M maybe it would help us.
