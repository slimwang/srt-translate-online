00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,810
Try putting together a simplified
version of the circular motion demo.

00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,420
Instead of circular motion, you'll just

00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,440
forth motion.

00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,610
Remember to check out the solution
project if you run into

00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,100
anything confusing.

00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,460
