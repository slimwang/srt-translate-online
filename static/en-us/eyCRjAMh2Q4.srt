00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,160
Sender apps can run on iOS,
Android and Chrome for all platforms.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,180
Cast Receiver applications are not
pre-installed on Cast devices but

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,210
instead they're pulled from a URL.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,740
And although Senders could transmit
video content directly to a Cast device,

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,070
this is almost never done for
efficiency reasons.

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,640
You don't want to tie up the Sender and
you want users to be able to use their

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,280
phone for other things like checking
e-mail while the Cast is going on.
