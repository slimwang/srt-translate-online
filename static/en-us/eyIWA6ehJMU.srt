A 3D virtual world has three major components: objects, lights and cameras.

00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:08,310
This unit is going to explore lights. The next, cameras. These components are

00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,780
on opposite ends of the rendering process. Photons are generated at light

00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,347
sources and the photons that reach the camera are what form the image. The

00:00:15,347 --> 00:00:18,709
objects in the scene are what ties these two ends of the process together.
