1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,180
For working with time series data,

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:06,680
pandas provide a number of functions
to compute moving statistics.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,530
We use rolling mean function to
compute the rolling mean of the SPY.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,670
Note that rolling mean is
not a DataFrame method but

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,790
it is a function with
the pandas library.

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,190
So we wouldn't be able
to call def.rollingmean.

7
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,230
Instead we pass in a set of values for

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,650
which rolling mean has to be
calculated as the first parameter.

9
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:28,920
Now let's go for this.

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,840
Firstly, let's get SPY data in
our data frame for the year 2012.

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,830
We also go ahead and plot the SPY data.

12
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,720
Notice that we retain
the matplotlib axis object so

13
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,460
that we can add to it later on.

14
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:49,190
Next we call the rolling mean
function from pandas library, and

15
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,300
pass in two parameters.

16
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,320
As explained before the first
parameter would be the values for

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,050
which the rolling mean
has to be calculated.

18
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,120
Hence we pass our data frame
containing SPY values.

19
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,690
The next parameter is the window size,
for which the mean will be calculated.

20
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,050
We use a period of 20 days.

21
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:12,030
This will return a series
consisting of the rolling mean.

22
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,220
It is always good to
visualize the rolling mean.

23
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,740
So we plot the series
using the plot function.

24
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,190
This time, while plotting the rolling
mean, we pass in the matplotlib

25
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,920
axis object so
that it gets added to the existing plot.

26
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:33,040
Notice that we specified a label
is equal to rolling mean.

27
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,290
This will be used to
create a plot legend.

28
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:40,930
Let's add the legend and
some access labels to our plot.

29
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,560
So here we add our legend to
the upper left corner of the plot

30
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,150
at the X label and the Y label.

31
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,810
Finally we are all set to view the plot.

32
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,810
Observe that the rolling mean
has missing initial values.

33
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:58,080
The reason is that we defined
a window period of 20 days, so

34
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,100
the first 20 days there are no values.

35
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,070
Also notice how it follows
the movement of the draw prices, and

36
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,090
is also less spiky.
