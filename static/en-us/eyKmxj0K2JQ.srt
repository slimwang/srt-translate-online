1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,070
From the if statement here,

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,810
we can see that the puppies route should
respond to get and post requests.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,939
So we can add the methods here.

4
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:11,640
A get request to the slash puppies
route represents a request to view

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,940
all of the puppies
already in the database.

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,910
So get all puppies is
the appropriate method to call.

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,310
The post request represents making a new
puppy entry in our web application.

8
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,300
So let's return the make a new
puppy method accordingly.

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,930
When the puppy's route is accessed with
an integer variable, this represents

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,280
an operation on a specific puppy
that has already been created and

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,740
assigned an ID number.

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:37,550
So then get, put, and delete operations
can be used to read, update, and

13
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,620
delete a specific puppy entry.

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,140
So let's call the get puppy ID,
Update Puppy ID, and

15
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,740
delete Puppy ID for
this exercise .Solution code for

16
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,920
this activity is available
in the instructor notes.
