00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Okay, here's an example of a decision problem that comes up in social network analysis

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and that's the clique problem.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Remember clique is a set of nodes in a network that are all pairwise connected--

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
everybody in the group knows everybody else in the group.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We were given a graph G and a number k, let's say 4, and we're asked--is there a clique of size k in G.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So remember clique is a connective set of nodes--so for example 1, 3, 4 is a three clique,

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
but now the question is--is there a four clique in the graph.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So just to make sure that you understand the idea of this problem,

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
why don't you find the four clique--there is a four clique in this graph.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Find the four clique, add the node numbers that make up the clique together,

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and enter the answer in the box.
