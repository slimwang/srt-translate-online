00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Okay, so the correct answers are not because posts can't return HTML.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We've seen that posts can return HTML.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
They can return our error page, for example.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Reloading our success page doesn't resubmit the form.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That's a nice benefit to remove the form parameters from URL.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Technically, if you had a get request that submitted your form,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and then you redirected when a form was valid,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
yes you can remove the form parameters from the URL.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
However, if you're sending data to the server with the get request

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
you have not been paying attention to this lesson.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So I'm not going to count this as correct.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Finally, so we can have distinct pages for forms and success pages.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This is also true.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What I've been getting at is this nice behavior you can have

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
where you have your forms, and you submit that form over and over, you post to it,

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and you keep getting that form over and over until it's valid.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Once it's valid we bounce the user, we redirect the user to another page,

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
whether it's a permalink to the blog post they just entered

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
or a thank you for being so good at entering dates page,

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
to a thanks for registering on our website page.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
There's lots of things you want to do there, but having separate pages for those is nice.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's a nice way to structure app.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So let's go ahead and make this change to the app we've been working on.
