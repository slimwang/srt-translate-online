00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,000
Before we talk about the abstractions in

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,760
an operating system for managing the processor and

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,160
memory, I want to throw another fun quiz at

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,670
you. Now in this quiz, I'm going to ask

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,129
you the following question. The computer, regardless of

6
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:19,990
which platform you're using, seemingly runs several programs

7
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,060
in parallel. You may have an email program

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,080
running, a browser you may have music playing,

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,930
maybe you're watching a video clip and so

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,090
on, but supposed it is, only one CPU inside.

11
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,830
Let's assume, that your computer system has exactly

12
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,610
one CPU inside. How is it possible that it

13
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,040
is running several programs in parallel? I'm going to

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,580
give you multiple choices. The first choice is, even

15
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,590
though there is only one CPU, there are

16
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,410
multiple cores within the CPU, and there's one core

17
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,100
for each of the applications that you're running,

18
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,550
and that's how we're able to run multiple applications

19
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,110
in parallel. So that's your first choice. The second

20
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,422
choice is, I'm trying to trick you, that this

21
00:01:04,422 --> 00:01:07,680
is a trick question, actually there's only one

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,700
app that is running at a time and the

23
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,910
premise of the question itself is wrong. So that's

24
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:16,500
your second choice. The third choice says that there's

25
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,030
only one CPU, there are multiple applications,

26
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:24,300
but these applications share the CPU through

27
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,425
the operating system so that for different

28
00:01:27,425 --> 00:01:30,680
time units, different applications are running on

29
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,355
the CPU. So, for instance, in time unit t1 application one is running, time unit

30
00:01:36,355 --> 00:01:42,040
t2 application two is running, and so on. And this is what is

31
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,845
making it appear as though there are several programs running on the CPU

32
00:01:46,845 --> 00:01:52,550
simultaneously. What is going on is that the operating system is multiplexing

33
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:57,530
the CPU among these applications. So these are the choices I'm giving you,

34
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,500
and I want you to pick what you think is the right choice.
