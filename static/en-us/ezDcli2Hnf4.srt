1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,170
You just finished your first lesson,
and you may be feeling excited,

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,620
or confused, or
intrigued, or frustrated.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,730
But, before we continue,

4
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,710
I want to take a little time to
explain how learning to code works.

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,790
But actually, what I want to talk to you
about isn't just about how learning to

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,450
code works, it's actually about
how learning anything works.

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,490
But it's especially relevant to coding.

8
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,620
And if you really internalize what
we'll discuss in this lesson,

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,800
you'll be in a much better
position to learn programming.

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,780
Anything you learn, whether it's
a language like Spanish, riding a bike,

11
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,670
or programming a computer,

12
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:35,850
you always begin at the exact
same place as a complete novice.

13
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,600
And if you choose to put in the effort,
you can become an expert.

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,310
The problem is that there is a big
gap between these two extremes.

15
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,750
So, instead of treating learning as
an attempt to bridge this massive gap

16
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,600
all at once, it's better to think
of it as a continuum of expertise

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,510
that begins somewhere over here, where
you don't even know where to begin and

18
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,700
goes all the way over here, to where
you forget how it was ever even hard.

19
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,540
Right now, you're somewhere over here.

20
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,990
You're actually not a complete novice.

21
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,970
You've learned a bit, and

22
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,510
since you're in this nano degree,
you do have an idea of where to begin.

23
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,960
And learning happens whenever
you make progress this way.

24
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,530
Now, this is fine; you may not
understand why this is worth

25
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,150
talking about, and I'll explain
exactly why this way of thinking

26
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,110
about learning is incredibly
helpful in just a minute.

27
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,580
But, the explanation
will be much more clear

28
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,000
if you take a minute
to think of something.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,900
In which you are an expert,
or at least a near-expert.

30
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,320
And you are an expert in something.

31
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,310
If you're having trouble,

32
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,140
your native language is something
you're probably an expert in.

33
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,230
But ideally, try to think of something
in which you've acquired your expertise

34
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,160
somewhat more recently.
