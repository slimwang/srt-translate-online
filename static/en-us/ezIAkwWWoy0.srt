00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,682
So we've changed this equation that had rational expressions to an equation that

2
00:00:04,682 --> 00:00:08,860
contains a quadratic, x squared. Since this equation is quadratic, we want to

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:13,150
bring all the terms to one side of the equation, factor the expression, and then

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:17,660
set each factor equal to zero. So I want you to try and rearrange this equation,

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,272
so that way you can factor it. Then solve it just like you've done before. When

6
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:26,506
you think you've the values of x, enter them here as a set, and be sure to

7
00:00:26,506 --> 00:00:28,433
separate the values by a comma.
