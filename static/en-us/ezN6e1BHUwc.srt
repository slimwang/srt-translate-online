1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,750
x plus 4 divided by x plus 1 is correct. For the first numerator, we find the

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:10,450
factors of 12 that sum to positive 7, which are positive 3 and positive 4. For

3
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:15,013
the second numerator, we find the factors of positive 4 that add to negative 5.

4
00:00:15,013 --> 00:00:19,922
These are negative 4 and negative 1. Notice that the a coefficient in front of

5
00:00:19,922 --> 00:00:24,354
the x squared term is 1 in every single quadratic. This means that we can just

6
00:00:24,354 --> 00:00:28,660
use the factors we find of 12 That summed to 7 in our binomials. The same was

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,188
true here, we used the factors of positive four that sum to negative five and

8
00:00:32,188 --> 00:00:36,133
four in our binomials. These are the factors for our other denominators and now

9
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:41,300
we're ready to simplify. X plus 3 divided by x plus 3 equals 1. And x minus 4

10
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:47,706
divided by x minus 4 Also equals 1. The last equivalence of 1 is x minus 1 and x

11
00:00:47,706 --> 00:00:52,324
minus 1. Remember that these factors don't dis, disappear, they really equal 1.

12
00:00:52,324 --> 00:00:58,294
So we multiply 1 times x plus 4 and one's times x plus 1. Any times anything is

13
00:00:58,294 --> 00:01:03,174
itself. So we're left with x plus 4 divided by the quantity x plus 1.
