1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,070
So some assumptions I'm going to tell you now are,

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,320
the ones that we're going to use to drive a particular computational theory.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,080
It's not clear exactly what assumptions your brain makes,

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,142
because your brain does some very complicated things.

5
00:00:11,142 --> 00:00:14,850
But, here's some simple assumptions that we can make use of computationally.

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,450
So this first assumption is that, this light is slowly varying, okay?

7
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,810
So for sort of a kind of a plainer or, or smooth world.

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:23,780
That's not unreasonable.

9
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,560
The light falls off.

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,960
So we've got these beautiful lights here,

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,180
that Megan has set up to make me look gorgeous.

12
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,600
I look gorgeous, right?

13
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,580
Right Megan?

14
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,310
>> yes.

15
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,070
>> Thank you very much.

16
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,220
anyway, and as I move the light, change it a little bit.

17
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,740
Now we have some other light sources, but

18
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,420
the idea is that the light changes slowly as I move around.

19
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,860
In fact, even on a cast shadow, when you see these shadows here.

20
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,250
Right first of all they're not harsh because Megan's such a good videographer,

21
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,440
she set up these lights.

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,190
But also, because of the size of the light source,

23
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,640
there's still relatively slowly varying compared to say

24
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,380
the line between my skin and the shirt, all right.

25
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,970
So the light is slowly varying.

26
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,260
The next thing and this is somewhat more problematic,

27
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,670
is we're going to assume within an object or within a patch.

28
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,840
The reflectance is constant.

29
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,140
That's a little bit of a stretch,

30
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,080
because there's a question of how big a patch, et cetera.

31
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,430
So we have these things here, you see this texture, and

32
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,640
maybe you can say we're going to assume that this texture is constant.

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,620
But the idea is that whatever reflectance function we're going to use,

34
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,110
we're going to assume it's constant over a patch.

35
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:30,730
And that between objects, the reflectance changes quickly.

36
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:34,850
Okay, so that any smooth variation we see is due to lighting.

37
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:39,240
Any sharp variation that we see, is due to the texture, all right?

38
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,960
And that should give you a hint of how we're going to solve this, right?

39
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,610
We're going to look for changes.

40
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,660
And we're going to try to eliminate the smooth changes and

41
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,400
keep only the sharp ones.

42
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,730
Now this assumption is sometimes called the Mondrian world.

43
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:55,650
And if, if, I, I, I don't really know whether he's French, or must be Piet.

44
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,730
Must be so, that would be Mondrian.

45
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:01,230
My French is awful, so somebody, write in a complaint to Megan.

46
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:06,200
Anyway Piet Mondrian, a very famous artist started a bunch in contemporary art.

47
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,610
And you've probably seen his work.

48
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:12,400
He made these pictures that were just these constant intensity patches.

49
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,540
Now, his patches happened to be square, or rectangular, I should say, and

50
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,920
that was part of the deal.

51
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,710
But the idea is that, this is the model that we're going to make use of, right?

52
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,680
That our world is made up of patches of

53
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,590
constant intensity separated by sharp boundaries.

54
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,290
Now, of course, we're not going to use anything so

55
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,930
beautiful, he's an artist, but we're boring, so

56
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,850
we're going to assume that we've got objects that look like this.

57
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,040
Okay, so we're just going to talk about intensity today.

58
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,050
I don't have these black stripes between them,

59
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,720
I just have patches that have constant intensity.
