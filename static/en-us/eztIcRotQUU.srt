00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,790
Now that we're changing each of these 2 fractions, I want you to multiply these

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:07,702
numerators together and write your answer here. For the denominators, we don't

3
00:00:07,702 --> 00:00:11,275
want to multiply them out. We just want to list the factors. This is because

4
00:00:11,275 --> 00:00:15,206
we're going to add the numerators in the end. We'll refactor that if possible

5
00:00:15,206 --> 00:00:20,290
and see if we can cancel any factors in the numerator and denominator of our

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,293
final answer.
