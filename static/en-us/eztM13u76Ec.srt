1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now I'd like to ask you about the relationship between a pie chart and a histogram.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Both of which represent count data or frequency data or, if you prefer, relative sizes.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
For this pie chart, I'd like you to tell me which histogram looks like it came from the same data.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Is it this or this or this or is it this? Select the closest answer.
