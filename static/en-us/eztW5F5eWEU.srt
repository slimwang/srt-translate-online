1
00:00:00,578 --> 00:00:04,303
So one thing that many students in this
class are probably familiar with is

2
00:00:04,303 --> 00:00:07,442
Sebastian Thrun's Robotics
class on autonomous vehicles.

3
00:00:07,442 --> 00:00:11,358
David, where do you think an autonomous
vehicle would fall on the spectrum?

4
00:00:11,358 --> 00:00:14,177
>> So it seems to me like an autonomous
vehicle definitely moves around in

5
00:00:14,177 --> 00:00:15,960
the world so
it certainly acts in the world.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,228
And driving is a very
human-like behavior so

7
00:00:18,228 --> 00:00:19,967
I'd say that it acts like a human.

8
00:00:19,967 --> 00:00:20,888
>> What do you think?

9
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:22,630
Do you agree with David?
