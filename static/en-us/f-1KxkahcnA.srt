1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,540
Now let's look at a more realistic
use case for a relative layout.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,070
For example,

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:08,380
this is a good ViewGroup to use when
you're building a list item like this.

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,290
We've provided a link below with some
XML for you to get started with.

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,880
Go ahead and modify it so
that you can build something like this.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,570
As a hint, first try switching from
a linear layout to a relative layout.
