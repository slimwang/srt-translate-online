1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,850
When the setUID bit is set, the UID
temporarily changes to the owner of

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:09,240
the file that is getting executed on
which the said UID which was set.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,040
Owner is U1.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:15,520
So although the process that we're
talking about was started by U2,

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:20,610
during the execution of this file F1
One, user ID is going to change to U1.

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:25,230
And it's going to change because
F1 has the SetUID bit set.

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,290
And when the SetUID bit is set,

8
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,800
the effective UID becomes whoever
the owner of this file F1 is.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,580
So in this case, the answer is U1.
