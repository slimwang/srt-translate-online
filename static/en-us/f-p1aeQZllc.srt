00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,717
So 1 elegant answer to this problem was proposed by Nathan Bell and Michael Garland

2
00:00:03,717 --> 00:00:06,142
at the Supercomputing Conference in 2009,

3
00:00:06,142 --> 00:00:10,187
and their answer was, use both approaches, and here's how we're going to do that.

4
00:00:10,187 --> 00:00:12,817
We're going to divide the matrix into 2 pieces.

5
00:00:12,817 --> 00:00:17,307
One piece, the more regular piece, is going to use the thread per row approach.

6
00:00:17,307 --> 00:00:20,091
This right side here, the more irregular approach,

7
00:00:20,091 --> 00:00:22,810
is instead going to use the thread per element approach.

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,996
And then we compute each of these separately

9
00:00:24,996 --> 00:00:27,499
and add the results back together at the very end.

10
00:00:27,499 --> 00:00:30,731
So the final question is, where do we draw this line?

11
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:33,873
What happens if we draw it too far to the left or draw it too far to the right?
