1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,210
All right, well the answer is b, one point.

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,590
Because translation is a one point transformation.

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:12,270
If you tell me where this bottom left-hand corner, better make it bigger,

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,210
big point, bottom left hand corner is over here, I knew where,

5
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,310
I know where the rest of the image, goes.

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,920
Couple of ways of thinking about that, one to think about is, there is only

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,620
two unknowns, and every pair of corresponding points gives me two equations,

8
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:33,370
it tells me how the two xs align and the two ys align.

9
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:37,340
So, each pair of points gives me two equations, I have two unknowns, so

10
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,410
I only need one pair of points, got it?

11
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:40,910
Cool.
