00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,454
Try a few yourself. Let's say that we find some sample means from a population

2
00:00:05,454 --> 00:00:11,108
and these sample means have the following Z-scores. What alpha levels could we

3
00:00:11,108 --> 00:00:15,558
put here for these particular Z-scores? So fill in the alpha levels as

4
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:16,796
propotions.
