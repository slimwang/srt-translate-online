1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
But, I'm now going to do this with the formula up here.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In particular, we have four things we add in the denominator

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and also four things we add in the numerator.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's four because there are four data points over here.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Before we fill in this data, I'm going to ask you a different question,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
one that is easy for you to answer, and that is

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
what are the means for x and for y in this data set.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You will need them when you fill in these blanks over here.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So, please give me just the two numbers here in green.
