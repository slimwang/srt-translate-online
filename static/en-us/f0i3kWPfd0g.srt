1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's make sure that we all have the same idea

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
about how that architecture is going to go--with a quiz.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm going to write down candidate steps--or candidate parts--

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
of our algorithm's design,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and you're going to tell me which parts are wrong

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
or if there's a part that's shown in the wrong order.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So here I've written 5 possible steps,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
in a particular order,

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
that our Web browser might follow and I want you

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
to put a check mark--in this multiple multiple choice quiz--

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
next to each step that's either erroneous

12
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,999
or out of order.
