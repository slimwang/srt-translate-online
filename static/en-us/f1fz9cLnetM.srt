1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,030
So in this first case, we have three
columns, student name, teacher name, and

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,710
the student's grade.

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,450
One of the rules for normalization is
that we have to have a unique key,

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:14,240
that says what each row is about,
but names aren't unique.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,730
If we have two students named
Jake Smith, or Pavel Ivanov, or

6
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,970
something else,
this isn't going to do very well.

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,500
Also, if a student is taking two courses
taught by the same teacher like,

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,820
maybe a CS and a math course.

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,440
We'll have problems there, too.

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,780
So this is not normalized.

11
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,890
Over here, we also have a single table.

12
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,500
Here we've given each
student a unique id number.

13
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,270
And we're also using a unique id for

14
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,900
courses, instead of just
the teacher's name.

15
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,640
But, we're storing facts that don't have
to do with each other in the same table.

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,070
Like student 23 is always Jake Smith,
regardless of what course he's taking.

17
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:53,900
This really ought to be split into two
tables, so this is also not normalized.

18
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,280
And splitting it into two tables,

19
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,710
is exactly what we've
done in this third group.

20
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,350
One table that gives the relationship
between each student id and their name.

21
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,129
And the other gives the grade for
each course they take.

22
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:06,100
If all we know is a student's name,

23
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,700
we can join this against
that to find their courses.

24
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,000
But, if there are two students with
the same name, we will get both.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,290
Nonetheless, this is normalized.

26
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,320
And the fourth group,
the only difference between this one and

27
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,450
that one, is that here, we're also
keeping track of students' birth dates.

28
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,540
But a person only has one birth date.

29
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,140
And the birth date, doesn't have
anything to do with their grades.

30
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,130
So adding this column to this table,

31
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,920
doesn't make this any less
normalized than this one.

32
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,060
So this and this, are both normalized.
