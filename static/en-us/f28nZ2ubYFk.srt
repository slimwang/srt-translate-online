1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,090
Now that we're logged into our server
as the student user, let's try and

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:05,900
run a sudo command.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,830
We'll try and run sudo cat /etc/passwd.

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:13,410
We're asked for a [sudo] password for
the student which is just the standard

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,400
password we set for the user
when we initially made the user.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,330
We now get this warning.

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,330
The student is not in the sudoers file.

8
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,810
This incident will be reported.

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,830
Our students does not have
permission to use the sudo command.

10
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,330
So, let's fix that.

11
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,290
I switch back to my other terminal
where I'm logged in as vagrant.

12
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:33,190
This is a user we know
can run sudo commands.

13
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,850
They can perform administrative tasks.

14
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,770
Now, the list of users that
are allowed to do this

15
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,130
is within the etc/sudoers file.

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,360
Let's read that file using
sudo cat /etc/sudoers.

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,820
Here we can see that
the root user is listed

18
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,510
along with a few groups using % and
then the name of the group.

19
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,770
On some systems you would just add
the student user just like this,

20
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,640
using a special program called visudo,
that's allowed to edit this file.

21
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,420
But on Ubuntu,
it handles it a bit differently.

22
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,770
If you look at the very
bottom of this file,

23
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:13,410
there's a here that says
includedir /etc/sudoers.d.

24
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:18,310
This command tells the system to also
look through any files in etc/sudoers.d

25
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:23,830
and include those as if they were
written directly within this file.

26
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:27,410
This is a common pattern since
distribution updates could

27
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:28,610
overwrite this file.

28
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,740
And if that were to happen, you would
lose all of the users you added.

29
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,700
By keeping your customizations
in this other directory,

30
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,170
the system eliminates that risk.

31
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,050
Let's see what files are currently
included in that directory

32
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:45,290
by running sudo ls etc/sudoers.d.

33
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,160
We see a file here called vagrant and

34
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,900
that makes sense since we're
actually using sudo here.

35
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:55,730
Even though vagrant wasn't within our
etc/sudoers file itself, this file is

36
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:59,960
being included by this directory, giving
this user the permissions it needs.
