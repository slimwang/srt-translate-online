00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The value proposition for a company that's selling services is kind of the same.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You just need to ask--what are core services that are part of your value proposition.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Consulting, a haircut, investment advice, and if you're selling whether it's software or hardware,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
you could have separate services that are part of this whole product--

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
pre- and post-sales services, finding the right solution, financing, free delivery.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Amazon makes a great business because in fact they could do 1-day delivery

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
or they could do 2-day Premier Service.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That is--service is sometimes, well, might seem to be ??? or kind of add ons

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
actually making your products work better than the competitors.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And then what are after-sales services--free maintenance, disposal, etc.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
And so all these add up again to what is it that your product features do.
