00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,460
SNORT can be configured as in-line or
passive.

00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:07,380
In the passive mode, it simply
copies and monitors traffic, and

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,080
the traffic does not pass through SNORT.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,440
That is, with the passive mode, SNORT
is configured for intrusion detection.
