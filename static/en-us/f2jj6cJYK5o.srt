One important feature of inverse functions that we haven't really talked about,

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,590
is the fact that they are, well, functions. Here for example, are the functions

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:12,668
we were working with in the last quiz. We started out with the equation y

4
00:00:12,668 --> 00:00:17,592
equals 4x, and found that its inverse is y equals x over 4. Of course, the

5
00:00:17,592 --> 00:00:20,886
original equation is a function, but we can tell that its inverse is too. It

6
00:00:20,886 --> 00:00:24,880
passes the vertical line test. We saw that y equals 4 over x is its own

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,770
inverse. It passes the vertical line test, too. Another fun fact about this, is

8
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,670
you can tell that it's its own inverse, because the function itself is

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:37,524
symmetric across the line y equals x. Now if we had a function and we went

10
00:00:37,524 --> 00:00:41,022
through the process of finding its inverse, but the resulting equation did not

11
00:00:41,022 --> 00:00:46,430
graph a function, then the original function would not have an inverse at all.

12
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:50,980
I know that sounds kind of complicated and that would involve a lot of steps.

13
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,004
So luckily, there's an easier way to tell whether or not a function will have

14
00:00:54,004 --> 00:00:58,586
an inverse. It involves graphing. Now I just said that we can figure out if a

15
00:00:58,586 --> 00:01:03,286
graph represents a function by using the vertical line test. And we also know

16
00:01:03,286 --> 00:01:06,510
that in order to graph the inverse of a function, we need to reflect it in the

17
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:12,417
line y equals x. So, what if we decided to reflect a vertical line in the line

18
00:01:12,417 --> 00:01:17,512
y equals x? Here, I've graphed a random vertical line. I happen to pick x

19
00:01:17,512 --> 00:01:22,530
equals 4. And this dotted black line is the line y equals x. What is the

20
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,982
reflection of x equals 4 in the line y equals x? Please write the equation of

21
00:01:27,982 --> 00:01:30,419
this new line in this box.
