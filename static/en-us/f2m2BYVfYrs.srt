1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Now, of course, this overview is super subjective and far from complete

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,010
and also maybe not always correct but nevertheless.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,460
I think clustering or finding groups of related objects, usually it's a good idea

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,490
to try to do a reduction from clique.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,650
Covering a set of objects--that is basically the problem that Alice was looking at

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,840
for her Telecommunications Company.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,300
Vertex cover is usually a good idea and there are certain generalizations of vertex cover

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,440
called hitting set that can also be a useful tool in proving that problems like these are NP complete.

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,950
Optimizing pathways--well, yeah that is shortest tour and also here you should know that

10
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:41,430
shortest tour has a very closely-related problem and that is the famous traveling salesman problem.

11
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,800
They are not the same but they are very, very close.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,040
Traveling salesman is basically shortest tour, but you cannot visit a vertex more than once,

13
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,990
so it's enforced here, and traveling salesman or the shortest tour problem here,

14
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:57,040
it is always a good idea to try to use these problems for a reduction when you want

15
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:02,440
to show that a problem that deals with optimizing pathways under constraints is NP complete.

16
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,670
Now, diversification/independent objects--yeah. If you're a bit test savvy, you would already have guessed.

17
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,860
This is, of course, independent set, and then, finally, something else.

18
00:01:11,860 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, you use our general tool and that is SAT.
