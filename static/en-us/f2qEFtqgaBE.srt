00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,807
In addition to specifically looking at conformity, social psychologists also

2
00:00:03,807 --> 00:00:08,530
look at social factors that pressure us to act in certain ways. And here we're

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:12,830
talking about social norms. Now social norms are rules of acceptable behavior

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:18,315
that are imposed on us by our culture. And norms actually vary by culture. For

5
00:00:18,315 --> 00:00:22,750
example, maybe you can think of a social norm that's specific to your culture.

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,812
For example, when I was younger, I was living and working in Tokyo. And I was

7
00:00:26,812 --> 00:00:30,666
very unfamiliar with the Japanese culture. But there was one social norm that I

8
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:34,680
noticed right away, that was different from the way I grew up. And that was

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,460
that the Japanese kept their shoes outside their door. Perhaps you can think of

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,001
some social norms and talk about those on the forum. Now what I realized later

11
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:45,922
is that the Japanese kept their shoes outside of their house. Not only for

12
00:00:45,922 --> 00:00:49,135
practical purpose, such as keeping the house clean, but also for spiritual

13
00:00:49,135 --> 00:00:53,052
purposes. But now let's go back to Lauren and look a little bit more

14
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:54,800
specifically at conformity.
