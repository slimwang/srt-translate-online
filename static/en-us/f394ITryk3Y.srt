1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,060
The answer to this is, yes.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,290
They're different ways of
doing voice biometrics.

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,880
Either someone can record your voice and
play it, that's one way, or

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,150
they're also sort of voice synthesis
kind of attacks people can do

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,590
if they have some segment of voice
from you that can build a model for

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,390
you and so, similarly,
these could be repeated.

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,830
So just because it's something you are,
in the end we're extracting a set of

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,280
features from you that we
make available to the system.

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,350
If somebody else can grab
those set of values, well,

10
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,732
then they can fool the system into
believing that is really you, and

11
00:00:33,732 --> 00:00:35,720
defeat the biometric indication method.

12
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,290
So, it's interesting read
how you defeat fingerprint,

13
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,730
the touch ID that users fingerprints but

14
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,910
similar tax people have explored on
voice space authentication and so on.

15
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:50,600
So yes we make hopefully we make
the task harder for the attacker but

16
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,690
there is never a full proof, completely
100% secure authentication solution.
