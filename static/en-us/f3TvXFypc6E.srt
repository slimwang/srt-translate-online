1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,060
The best answer is the second one here.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,050
The argument goes like this.

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,940
As I stated in the hint,
the longest representation of a number

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,390
after i steps is order n plus i.

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,650
Addition can lengthen the binary
representation of a number

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,690
by at most one bit.

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,560
Next, observe that the total number
of symbols used, let's say l,

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,780
increases by at most order ri
as the i step is simulated.

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,930
We might get this increase by writing
a number to the random access device

10
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,410
to a location that we
haven't written to before.

11
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:40,640
Thus, after step j,
the total number of symbols used,

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,913
is going to be order n + j squared.

13
00:00:43,913 --> 00:00:48,800
Finally, each step only takes a constant
number of passes over the symbols used

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,542
on the tape, so

15
00:00:49,542 --> 00:00:54,750
we can bound the total number of steps
with this sum here, to get the result.
