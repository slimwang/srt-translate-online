00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,080
I claimed that prove, that the composition of two polynomial reductions was

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,210
polynomial. But why was that the case? Think carefully, and

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,875
give the most appropriate bound for the running time of the reduction R.

4
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:17,258
Which is the composition of m. Which runs in time p. And N,

5
00:00:17,258 --> 00:00:24,030
which runs in time q. You can assume that both m and n read all their input.
