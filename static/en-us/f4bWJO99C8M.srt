1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,180
So, why is the epipolar constraint useful?

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:09,300
Well, we've already said that basically, the epipolar constraint reduces

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:15,030
the correspondence problem to a one dimensional search along the epipolar line.

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,850
In this particular case, we have parallel epipolar lines,

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,720
we'll see that in just a minute, but the red dot on the left that's located in

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,870
the window of this beautiful chapel or whatever that is.

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,940
Is located somewhere, in this epipolar line on the right, so I search for

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,500
the middle of the window, I don't have to look all over the image,

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,070
I'm just looking along the corresponding epipolar line.

10
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,270
So what do epipolar lines look like, and we'll consider two cases.

11
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,730
There's the general case on the top, where we've got verged cameras, and

12
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,560
then there's this special case where we have parallel optical axes.
