00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,883
It's important that the HTML and CSS that you write is correct and

2
00:00:03,883 --> 00:00:05,820
complies with standards.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,020
If it's incorrect it might display okay in one browser,

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:15,100
which correctly guesses your intention, but incorrectly in another which makes

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:20,510
a different assumption, and there are also icons you can show on your web page.

6
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:24,440
So that others know that your page complies with the standards.

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,460
We've provided links where you can verify your HTML and

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,920
CSS code in the instructor note section below.

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,760
Go ahead and do this now for your HTML page and

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,500
explore the error that it returns.

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,950
The error is somewhat cryptic, so

12
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,000
if you can't figure out what it means, don't worry.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,200
Just see the answer video for an explanation.

14
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,230
In exploring the error,

15
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,160
you'll notice that there's something missing from the page.

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,400
What element is mission something?

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,480
Let me know which element is missing something.

18
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,900
Now, you just have to enter the tag here.

19
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,400
For example, html or div.

20
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,459
Then let me know was your CSS correct?

21
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:06,080
Just answer yes or no
