00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome to Unit 5. The main topic for Unit 5 is cryptographic protocols.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We're going to look at ways to use the things that we've seen in the previous 4 units

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
to solve problems.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So we'll be using symmetric encryption, we'll be using cryptographic hash functions,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and we'll be using asymmetric encryption to solve problems.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And the main problem we're going to solve is how to authenticate

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
between a client and a server.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Any time we talk about cryptographic protocols, we have to think about what our threat model is.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If we want to argue that a protocol is secure, we need to understand the threat model,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
which means knowing the capabilities of the adversary.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
In order to argue the protocol is secure, we need to argue that an adversary

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
with only those capabilities will not be able to break the protocol.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So what are the kinds of things we need to assume?

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The first main assumption is that the adversary has limited computational power.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And that generally means that we're assuming that our encryption primitives work

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and the attacker who intercepts a message encrypted with some key k

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
is not able to decrypt it unless they know k

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
or have some other advantage for decrypting that message.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We also assume that hash functions have the properties they should--

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
that it's preimage resistant,

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
so an adversary who has the hash of x cannot figure out what x was,

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and that they also have strong collision resistance--

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
that an adversary can't find 2 values that hash to the same output.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We might also make assumptions about what the attacker can do to the network.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
If the attacker is passive, that would mean that they can only eavesdrop.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
They can listen in on messages on the network, but they can't modify them

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and they can't inject their own messages into the network.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
A more powerful adversary would be an active attacker.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
An active attacker controls the network.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
They can modify data and messages. They can replay messages.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That means they can record messages on the network

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and then at some later time replay a message that they heard previously.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
They can also do attacks like we saw against Diffie-Hellman

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
where they act as a middleman intercepting traffic between 2 parties

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and replacing it with their own traffic.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So let's have a quiz to see if you understand threat models.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Which of these threat models would be a good model for an adversary

38
00:02:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
who controls a router on the Internet?
