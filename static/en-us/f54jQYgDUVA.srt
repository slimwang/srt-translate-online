1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,960
Now, what if we want both
confidentiality and integrity?

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,730
How about we encrypt the message and
send all the CBC blocks, and

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:13,780
that's the ciphertext blocks for
protecting confidentiality.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,860
And then, we'll replicate the last
block, which is a CBC residue, and

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,000
that's for integrity.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,040
Would that work?

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,550
Obviously this approach does not work

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,250
because if we simply replicate the last
block, we are not adding anything.

9
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,259
That is, we are not doing anything
in addition to protecting

10
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:33,640
the confidentiality.

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,580
Therefore there is no way this
approach will work to provide both,

12
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,110
confidentiality and integrity.

13
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,170
We can instead use two different keys.

14
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:48,270
One for producing CBC blocks for
confidentiality, and

15
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,180
the other for generating the residue for

16
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,920
integrity, that is we encrypt
twice using two different keys.

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,130
Another approach is that we first
compute a hash of the message.

18
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,800
Appended it to the message and
then encrypt the whole entity.
