1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
In principle, of course, you know by now

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
how to show that a problem is NP-complete

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
because we have already shown this in the last unit for 4 different problems.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We have shown the NP-completeness for vertex cover,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
we have shown the NP-completeness for clique,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
we have shown the NP-completeness for independent set,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and then for SAT, the mother of all NP-complete problems if you will.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So for showing NP-completeness, there is always 2 steps.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
First you have to show that your problem is in NP,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
which means that a nondeterministic RAM

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
can solve your problem in polynomial time,

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and later in this course we will meet some problems

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
actually that are worse than NP-complete problems,

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
so it's often a very simple step,

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
but it's one that you have to go through

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
because you might be dealing with even harder problems although that is unlikely.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And the second step was finding a polynomial time reduction

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
from another problem that is known to be NP-complete

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
using the ideas that Cook and Levin had for their famous Cook-Levin theorem.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Then we showed that clique is NP-complete by reducing SAT to clique.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And then from our first unit,

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
we already knew that clique, vertex cover,

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and independent set are all very closely connected to each other.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So you can basically reduce these problems to each other

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
in any order or way that you want

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
because they are so closely related.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I would like to do a brief quiz with you,

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
which is a little bit subjective although I think you'll likely agree with me,

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and what I would like you to tell me is

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
how difficult you found those reductions that we have encountered so far.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So showing that SAT is NP-complete,

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
showing that clique is NP-complete,

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and then showing that vertex cover and independent set are NP-complete,

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and I would like you to rank these

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
3 reductions that we have had so far by difficulty

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
where 1 means easiest,

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
3 means most difficult, and you can guess what 2 means.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So please rank the difficulty of those reductions that we have encountered so far.
