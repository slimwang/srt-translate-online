1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, finally, what about Bob, who is solving Shortest Tour?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Well, Shortest Tour is a problem that hasn't been investigated that much.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In the general case, for it's closely related problem, Travelling Salesman,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
we don't know.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But there are many special cases of this problem

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
where good approximations are actually possible.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But the bounds of approximation for Shortest Tour and Travelling Salesman

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
have actually not been investigated that much.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So if you're really into it, that will be a possible area for research.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Although, it seems to be quite hard to actually transfer the results

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
from here over to Shortest Tour.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So maybe we can make Alice a little bit less happy;

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
although, she has been quite lucky in this course.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
She has a constant factor approximation algorithm,

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and the limit of 1.36 probably doesn't affect her that much.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And Bob, well, it's not really clear if he should be happy or not,

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
but as we mentioned, in practice it's likely

18
00:00:53,000 --> 99:59:59,999
that his problem is actually very well solvable.
