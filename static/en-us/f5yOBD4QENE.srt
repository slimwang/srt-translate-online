1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,590
So we have clicked Andy provided us, and

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,370
we're not at the Google App Engine
download page.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,950
Let's go ahead and
click on Google App Engine for

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,090
Python since that's the programming
language we will be using.

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,260
Look like it opens the window a little
bit, so we're going to scroll down.

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:18,270
And then we're going to choose
the operating system for our computer.

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,980
I'm using a Windows computer,
so I'm going to go ahead and

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,300
click on the Windows download link.

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,820
And we're going to want to keep that,
and

10
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,490
as you can see in the bottom left-hand
corner, the download has begun.

11
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,670
Let's actually scroll down and
click on installing on Windows.

12
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,880
So it looks like it gives us some
additional instructions, first we're

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,720
going to want to click on the link we
just downloaded once it's finished.

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,720
And two, we're going to need
Python installed on the computer

15
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,020
to use Google App Engine.

16
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,540
Since you already have Python installed,
we're good to go.

17
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,840
Let's go ahead and
click on that download file, and

18
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,700
then we're going to go ahead and run it.

19
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,050
Okay, we are at
the installation instructions.

20
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,540
We're just going to follow all
the instructions they have, click Next.

21
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,740
A short license that
we're going to read.

22
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,250
going to want to accept the returns
of the license agreement.

23
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,810
Continue forward.

24
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,190
Okay this page is going to tell
us where we're going to install

25
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,770
Google App Engine.

26
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,570
It's going to create Start Menu
shortcuts, a Desktop shortcut, and

27
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,520
add your path to the user path.

28
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,550
That just lets Google App Engine
know where you're installed.

29
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:22,160
Now, let's stick with
the default settings.

30
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,780
Click Next, and
then we're ready to install.

31
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,510
We click on Install and we'll wait
while it completes the installation.

32
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,580
We're going to click on Yes,

33
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,600
we do want to allow the following
program to install.

34
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,720
So I allowed Google App Engine
to be installed on my computer.

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,550
Make sure to do that, too, if you
get a pop-up, asking for permission.

36
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,970
Okay, it looks like
the installation has finished.

37
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:43,820
Let's go ahead and

38
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,510
run the launcher just to double
check that everything worked out.

39
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:51,100
So great, it looks like we've downloaded
and installed Google App Engine and

40
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,350
ran it successfully.

41
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:52,850
Let's move on.
