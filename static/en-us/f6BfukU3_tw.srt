Before we get to that, I want to make one more important point about types and

2
00:00:03,866 --> 00:00:08,150
that's the difference between static and dynamic types. So, here's some not very

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:12,630
good python code, but I want to use this to illustrate something about types in

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,136
python. So, the question is, at all the points that I show, what is the type of

5
00:00:17,136 --> 00:00:22,018
X? So, for each box, enter the type of X at that point in the execution. If it's

6
00:00:22,018 --> 00:00:26,768
not known, you should enter unknown. So at each point in this execution, I want

7
00:00:26,768 --> 00:00:31,934
you to answer what the type of X is, so that means, what were the result of type

8
00:00:31,934 --> 00:00:34,903
of X be or if it's not known, enter unknown.
