1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,830
So how can Alice approach her problem

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:05,160
if there are lots of these communication centers?

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,990
Certainly, she can't just do a random approach and trust that she's somehow

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,030
going to find the best possible solution.

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,560
So she needs some sort of algorithm to solve her problem.

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,090
And one algorithm that would be guaranteed to find the best possible

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,950
solution, or the minimum number of devices that you need,

8
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,950
would be to just try all possibilities.

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:30,340
So, for example, if you have a very simple network, such as this one here--

10
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,220
Well, first of all, let's have a look at the best possible solution,

11
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,110
and we're going to do this as a little quiz.

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,890
So I want you to tell me where to install the monitors

13
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,030
so that each cable in this network is monitored.

14
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:49,660
And I want you to do this by checking off the communication centers

15
00:00:49,660 --> 99:59:59,999
where we need to install monitoring devices.
