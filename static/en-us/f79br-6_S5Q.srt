>> Let's look at another case of a pretty common mistake people could make on

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:07,295
this problem. Let's say that you looked at this and though oh, 12 and 18 are

3
00:00:07,295 --> 00:00:11,150
both even numbers that means they are divisible by 2. And, if we factor out a 2

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,811
from both terms here, we're left with 6x plus 9. But remember I said that I

5
00:00:14,811 --> 00:00:18,982
didn't want to see any common factors between terms. Inside the parentheses

6
00:00:18,982 --> 00:00:23,447
aside from 1. And 6x and 9 are both divisible by 3. That's not super hard to

7
00:00:23,447 --> 00:00:28,158
fix, though. If I pull out a 3 from here, then my coefficient, or rather my term

8
00:00:28,158 --> 00:00:31,744
multiplying the things inside parentheses, is 2 times 3.
