00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,648
Another way to think about rendering is as if we're looking through a screen

2
00:00:03,648 --> 00:00:07,804
door or a wire screen in a window. The screen is there to keep out flies but for

3
00:00:07,804 --> 00:00:12,348
my purposes each little square on the wire screen is like a pixel on a computer

4
00:00:12,348 --> 00:00:17,473
screen. Through some screen squares we see a bright red. Through others a deep

5
00:00:17,473 --> 00:00:22,151
green, and putting them all together we get a rose. When we look in our computer

6
00:00:22,151 --> 00:00:25,680
screen, we can think of it as a window into a 3D world. However, moving our head

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,104
in the real world, normally does not change what we see through this window. Our

8
00:00:29,104 --> 00:00:33,388
task in 3D computer graphics is to define a world, and then figure out as best

9
00:00:33,388 --> 00:00:37,143
we can what light comes from each direction and so forms an image.
