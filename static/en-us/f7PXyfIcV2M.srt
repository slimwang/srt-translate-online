>> David's example of a robot that knows how to assemble cameras, but

2
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,750
then is given the goal of disassembling a camera is a good example of

3
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,970
goal based autonomy. Earlier we had looked at, how an agent can go about

4
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,130
repairing his knowledge or reasoning or learning when it makes some mistake or

5
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:15,060
reaches a failure. But sometimes it is not so much that the agent

6
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,310
reaches a failure, as much as it is that the agent is given a new goal.

7
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:23,370
When the agent is given a new goal, we do not want the agent to just fall apart.

8
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,900
We do not want brittle agents. We want agents that can then adapt their

9
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,670
reasoning methods and their learning methods to try to achieve the new goal.

10
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,520
Even if they were not necessarily programmed to achieve that goal.

11
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,170
We know that human cognition is very robust and flexible. You and

12
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:43,230
I address a very large number of tasks, a very large number of problems and

13
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,220
achieve a very large number of goals. If we are to design human level,

14
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,350
human like AI agents, then those AI agents will have to be equally robust and

15
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:56,190
flexible. Metacognition provides a powerful way of achieving that robustness and

16
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,520
flexibility. It does so by flexibly, dynamically,

17
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:05,280
selecting among competing strategies. It does so, reflexively and

18
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,900
dynamically, integrating multiple strategies as the problem solving evolves.

19
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,540
It does so, by using reasoning strategies and

20
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,050
knowledge that were programmed into it to achieve new goals.
