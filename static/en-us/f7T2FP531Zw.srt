00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,139
The distance from the earth to the sun is approximately 1.5 times 10 to the

2
00:00:03,139 --> 00:00:08,102
eleventh meters. And light travels at about 3 times 10 to the eight meters per

3
00:00:08,102 --> 00:00:13,096
second. We just found that time is equal to distance over speed. So can you

4
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:16,111
tell me how many seconds it takes for light to travel from the sun to the

5
00:00:16,111 --> 00:00:20,461
earth? You can use your calculator or you can try to think of another way to do

6
00:00:20,461 --> 00:00:21,379
this.
