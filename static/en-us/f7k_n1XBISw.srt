1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250
Now, this is how I think about the problem.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:07,568
Does this phenomenon occur because the process which produces intertweet time is

3
00:00:07,568 --> 00:00:12,593
in fact random, or is it in fact influenced by factors which we have not seen.

4
00:00:12,593 --> 00:00:17,883
If the answer is the former, then the best we can do is our exponential fit

5
00:00:17,883 --> 00:00:23,899
estimator with our guess of 8,585.5 seconds, which we developed above.

6
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:28,634
However, if it's the latter, then we can reduce the inherent variance,

7
00:00:28,634 --> 00:00:33,674
effectively reducing the spread, making intertweet time more predictable by

8
00:00:33,674 --> 00:00:37,230
finding the factors on which intertweet time depends.

9
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,911
To see this, let's look at a simple example.

10
00:00:40,911 --> 00:00:45,015
But if it's the latter, then we can reduce the inherent variance,

11
00:00:45,015 --> 00:00:49,839
effectively reducing the spread, making intertweet time more predictable by

12
00:00:49,839 --> 00:00:53,240
finding the factors on which intertweet time depends.

13
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,970
Now, to see this, let's look at a simple example.
