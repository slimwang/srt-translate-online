00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,861
Since point p is a point that is shared, by both the line, y equals 850, and the

2
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:13,480
line y, equals 10x plus 150, both of these lines have the same y value at that

3
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:20,601
point. Since the y value of y equals 850 is always 850, that means that this the

4
00:00:20,613 --> 00:00:28,119
y value of 10x plus 150 at point p. So, we just need to substitute 850 into the

5
00:00:28,131 --> 00:00:36,118
spot of y, in the second equation. That gives us a single equation of 850 equals

6
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:44,016
10x plus 150. And yes, x is the only variable in this equation.
