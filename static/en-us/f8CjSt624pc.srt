1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,090
Now you can do this with existing files on your

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,230
computer, but if you want to follow along this example,

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,540
feel free to download the zip file in the instructor

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,460
notes. When you unzip that file, you'll have a folder

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,670
much like this one, with about 50 photos. Okay, so

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,820
what I've done thus far is just created a new

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,180
file in Idle, and I called it rename_files.py. And inside

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,460
that, I've created an empty function by the same name.

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:31,090
Then I added comments of the two main things I have to do in my program. By the

10
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,330
way, notice that the function right now is pretty

11
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,220
empty, and if I saved and ran the program, it

12
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,780
would essentially do nothing. The first thing I have

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,990
to do, is get the file names from a given

14
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,400
folder. So Google can help with that. Let me

15
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:51,340
just type in Find file names in a folder in

16
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,460
Python. Now I read through the results, and

17
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,100
I got to this stack overflow.com page. And here

18
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,270
I read that there is this thing called os.listdir,

19
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,300
which will get you everything that's in a given

20
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,780
directory. Now it turns out that there is a

21
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,970
module in Python called os, short for operating system.

22
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,500
And that has a function inside it called listdir.

23
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,360
Which, as its name suggests, lists everything that's in

24
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,890
a given directory. So let's add this to the

25
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,350
code and see what it does. Now this function listdir

26
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,890
takes in a path of the folder that contains our

27
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:29,323
photos. So I'll go back to my folder. Copy its

28
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:32,760
address, and paste it. Now for those of you who

29
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,270
are on a Mac, you can use a document in

30
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,580
the instructor notes, that will help you get the path

31
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,595
of your folder. On a Windows machine however, right before

32
00:01:41,595 --> 00:01:44,090
where the path begins, I will add this

33
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:48,210
letter r, and r stands for rawpack, and it

34
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,560
tells Python hey, take this string as it

35
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,980
is, and don't interpret it any other way. So

36
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:59,510
here let me just save this in a variable, and print that out. Let me save, and

37
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:06,690
then run, and oh wow, we get a list of all of the file names inside that folder.

38
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,574
It's an ugly looking list, but a list

39
00:02:08,574 --> 00:02:12,470
nonetheless. Alright, step one of the program is done.
