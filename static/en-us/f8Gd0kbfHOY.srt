1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,350
All right, so
this seems like a good time to stop and

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:05,090
ask ourselves what have we learned?

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:05,770
>> Oh, you're asking me?

4
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:06,890
>> I am indeed, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,000
>> Okay, that's not a problem,
I think I know the answer.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,570
So the first thing is we
relearned everything we learned

7
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,410
from the MDP lessons from before.

8
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,400
So, we learned all
about Scooby Doo MDPs.

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,630
>> [LAUGH] I don't think
that's a kind of MDP.

10
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,250
>> It is now.
We should write a paper, quick.

11
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,110
>> And so that included things like
what are states, and transitions, and

12
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,570
rewards, and so forth, right?

13
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,680
>> Right, I think.

14
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,380
>> Anything else?

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,000
>> Well, I think we learned
a bunch of new things.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,395
So for me,
I learned all about Q functions

17
00:00:38,395 --> 00:00:39,160
>> Mm-hm

18
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,280
>> I learned about continuations And,

19
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,600
in general, when I think about that,

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,050
I really learned about what
the Bellman Equations,

21
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,550
as opposed to equation,
are really trying to capture for you.

22
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,350
Even more than we did when we
talked about that with MDPs.

23
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,155
>> Alright, so deeper understanding of
the Bellman Equation and how it relates

24
00:00:57,155 --> 00:01:00,020
the rewards in this infinite
sequence of rewards to each other.

25
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,070
Yeah, that's sort of
what I was going for.

26
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,620
>> Yeah, and I think that's a lot.

27
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,140
And I think I learned
that notation matters.

28
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,671
>> [LAUGH] Okay.

29
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:09,710
[LAUGH]
>> No,

30
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:14,010
remember we talked about
the reward in the Scooby Doo MDP.

31
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,360
We talked about R is a function of S.

32
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,410
And when we talked about Q functions and

33
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:23,150
C functions in the Bellman equations,
we went to R being S of a.

34
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,500
And even though we had mentioned
before that they were mathematically

35
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,700
equivalent, it turns out,
just like sometimes thinking about Q,

36
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,480
sometimes thinking about C might be
better than thinking about V or U.

37
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,843
It turns out that sometimes thinking
about R of S of a, Is better than

38
00:01:36,843 --> 00:01:40,620
thinking about R of S, even if they
really are mathematically equivalent.

39
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,180
>> And in some sense it
doesn't matter though, right,

40
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,065
because we actually were able
to do similar things with the R,

41
00:01:45,065 --> 00:01:46,580
S as we are with the R, S, a.

42
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,160
>> True, although, you know what,
that's not really notation, right?

43
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,240
Notation is used doing V instead of U.

44
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,290
This is really a representation.

45
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,370
>> Ooh.

46
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,780
Representation matters.

47
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,980
>> Yeah, and I think that's
actually a pretty important lesson.

48
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,430
And when I think about some of the other
things that we know about reinforcement

49
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,180
learning, the representation is
going to make a huge difference.

50
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:04,750
>> I think that's right.

51
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,930
I think that's a good lesson for
I want to say AI in general, but

52
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:08,919
certainly machine learning.

53
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,055
>> Okay, well that seemed like
a profound point to end on.

54
00:02:11,055 --> 00:02:13,180
>> [LAUGH]
>> Okay, cool.

55
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,500
So we'll pick it up with
reinforcement learning next time.

56
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,140
>> Done.
Let's do that.

57
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,360
Have a good time, Michael.

58
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:17,860
>> You too.
>> Bye.
