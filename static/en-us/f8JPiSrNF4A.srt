00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,115
Welcome back.

3
00:00:18,115 --> 00:00:21,525
We've been looking at how frameworks
help developers become more productive.

4
00:00:21,525 --> 00:00:24,485
And we've taken a deep dive into
specific features of backbone and

5
00:00:24,485 --> 00:00:25,235
underscore.

6
00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:28,055
In this lesson, you'll be using
the Angular framework to put together

7
00:00:28,055 --> 00:00:32,034
a simple app that lets you record menu
items for a specific meal of the day.

8
00:00:32,034 --> 00:00:34,785
We'll be diving into Angular
version one, which is a mature and

9
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:36,230
stable framework.

10
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,170
Angular two is currently
under development and

11
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,890
is not backwards compatible
with Angular one.

12
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,960
Just as a local model is built up of
a number of different pieces to form

13
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,520
a complete design.

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,000
Frameworks are built up of
different techniques and concepts.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,060
Learning the concepts and this lesson
will make it easy to snap on concepts

16
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,670
from Angular two or another framework.

17
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,820
As we go through this lesson.

18
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,660
I encourage you to work through
each of the steps yourself.

19
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,380
Build up the app along with me.

20
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,410
You'll learn a lot by watching me
work through building up a project.

21
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,090
But you'll learn so
much more if you build it yourself.

22
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,820
Angular is an awesome framework.

23
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,360
And when we're finished, I hope you'll
love working with it as much as I do.
