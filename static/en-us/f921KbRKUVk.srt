1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,340
So everybody will tell
hire the A players.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:07,730
Don't bring B players or A minus
players, and that's a no brainer.

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,830
Everybody wants the A players.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,610
The whole thing is to get them,
especially when you're small.

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,130
So let's say that you're a new company.

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,140
You don't have any money at all, or

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,750
you are not even worth, you have half
a million or one million in funding.

8
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,820
You supposed to be able to offer
something to your employees,

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,970
but you know that you can't because
you have a that it's very limited.

10
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:36,520
So you can offer all kinds of things.

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,190
First of all,
you can offer stock options.

12
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,650
That's, again, that's obvious.

13
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,030
You can offer your first employees

14
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:47,530
options that hopefully will
get them rich very soon.

15
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:52,483
Another thing that you can offer them
besides salary, is specific, sorry,

16
00:00:52,483 --> 00:00:56,130
another thing that you can
offer them is benefits.

17
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:02,220
Some benefits will go a long way, like
health plans and subscriptions to gyms.

18
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:02,950
It depends on where you live.

19
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,739
If you live in San Francisco,
that's nothing.

20
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,250
But if you live Midwest,
that's something else.

21
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,710
It's more popular there.

22
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,850
The most important thing
that a new company can offer

23
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,570
the employees is sense of purpose and
culture.

24
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,150
Because if you have a good culture,
you have something special,

25
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,119
you have that good vibe
going on in your office.

26
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,360
It's worth more than
money to some people.

27
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,200
People would like to go to work for

28
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,700
you because you give
them an experience back.

29
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,420
You give them the option to work with
amazing people for a great company.

30
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,900
They feel that they really contribute,
and

31
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,890
this is something that goes a long way.

32
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,800
Another thing that you can offer your
new employees is to give them the option

33
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,380
to work with people they see as
important, as smarter than them,

34
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,360
more experienced, people they can
actually learn something from.

35
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,870
People that will help them get
more advanced in their career.

36
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:01,190
They can learn from, they can build
something special with those people.

37
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,020
And this is something that you
can't buy with money, okay.

38
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,433
It's worth more than an extra 10 or
$20,000 a year.
