00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,546
Hello everyone and welcome to
today's webcast on html and css.

2
00:00:07,546 --> 00:00:09,456
I'm Denkine, this is Jarund.

3
00:00:09,456 --> 00:00:13,215
And we're of course
managers here at Udacity.

4
00:00:13,215 --> 00:00:17,510
And you know we're going to be
talking about some css things.

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,800
The way css works is
you have a selector.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,718
For example dot targets classes.

7
00:00:23,718 --> 00:00:25,020
And then the styling and

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,155
then you have styling that
goes into the curly brackets.

9
00:00:28,155 --> 00:00:34,434
Right, so for example,
I have this really simple HTML.

10
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:38,598
And, as you can see,
it's just a bunch of boxes.

11
00:00:38,598 --> 00:00:40,100
Right?

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,340
And then I've linked here to my style
sheet which is called style.css.

13
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:54,070
And then, for example, if I wanted
to target, all the class box ones.

14
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,498
I can do this via this notation,
so .box, select all the class box.

15
00:00:58,498 --> 00:01:03,550
And then inside I have property call
in value and so backyard color grey and

16
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:08,128
then 10 pixels margin to the bottle and
mean high to 50 pixels.

17
00:01:08,128 --> 00:01:12,988
And then as you can see all of my dibs
are defined as as having class box and

18
00:01:12,988 --> 00:01:18,347
then each one also has an additional
class box one, bow two, box three right.

19
00:01:18,347 --> 00:01:23,478
And so over here, when you go, like,
into the separate box one, box two,

20
00:01:23,478 --> 00:01:28,280
box three, I actually overwrite
the background color property.

21
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,930
So, I gave each one
a different background color.

22
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,730
And then,
if we open this in the browser, right,

23
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,079
so this is how it looks like.

24
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,490
Right they all have different colors
they all have like the same in height of

25
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,460
50 pixels and
then ten pixels in between them.

26
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:52,080
The box model is something that you have
probably seen but just a quick recap so

27
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,990
all elements our box says if we
go into the developer tools.

28
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,769
Can select for example this.

29
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,650
And, you can see.

30
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:02,930
Where did there we go.

31
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,167
And you can see that this is
really how it looks like, right?

32
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:09,560
So, there's, it's this box.

33
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:15,716
It can change the padding here to,
I don't know, 40 pixels?

34
00:02:15,716 --> 00:02:21,953
And see how weird, this actually
moved it to text 40 pixels to right.

35
00:02:21,953 --> 00:02:23,986
>> And the padding is inside.

36
00:02:23,986 --> 00:02:25,164
>> Right.

37
00:02:25,164 --> 00:02:29,591
So usually this is a counter
whatever you have inside

38
00:02:29,591 --> 00:02:34,460
the box could be text,
images, another box whatever.

39
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,650
And then the padding.

40
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:41,950
Is comes right after that and the border
is actually after the padding.

41
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:46,267
Right so the border encompasses
their content and.their padding.

42
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:49,090
And then after the border,
there's the margin.

43
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:54,115
So if we, for example so this is set
to 10 why not set it to 40 as well.

44
00:02:54,115 --> 00:02:58,775
You see it, everybody else just
moved down to a company that's like

45
00:02:58,775 --> 00:03:00,590
three pixels of padding.

46
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,165
So, yeah so the box model pretty cool.

47
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:09,809
Box elements, versus block
elements versus inline elements.

48
00:03:09,809 --> 00:03:17,430
And so divs H1s, most of what you could
think of, those are all block elements.

49
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,900
There are couple of inline
elements I think mostly,

50
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,860
tags such as bold like making your
text bold and things like that.

51
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,890
>> Expanders.

52
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,724
>> Yeah.
>> Block elements right as they're stuck

53
00:03:29,724 --> 00:03:33,466
vertically and inline elements
are kind of in the same line.

54
00:03:33,466 --> 00:03:38,420
>> Right yeah, like block elements
are sort of like they take all the space

55
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:44,057
they can take in line, horizontally but
still spaces they can take vertically.

56
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:51,670
So for example in the css code that I
show you all the boxes had a min height.

57
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,527
50 pixels.

58
00:03:53,527 --> 00:03:56,152
And if we take that min height away, so

59
00:03:56,152 --> 00:04:00,130
you see in here min height
50 pixels say for this box.

60
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:04,407
If I take that away, whoops,
all the boxes disappeared,

61
00:04:04,407 --> 00:04:09,316
the only one that remained is this
one because it has content in it.

62
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:14,132
When we give the min high back they
go back by because these are block

63
00:04:14,132 --> 00:04:14,997
elements.

64
00:04:14,997 --> 00:04:20,160
Their default properties is
as be as wide as you can and

65
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,270
but as short as you can, right.

66
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:27,010
So they're going to either accommodate
content if they have content or

67
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,550
if you have specified mean height for
them they're going to accommodate that.

68
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,257
If they're if you don't have content and

69
00:04:32,257 --> 00:04:34,517
don't have mean height they're
just not going to show.

70
00:04:34,517 --> 00:04:36,671
Let's change that to yem.

71
00:04:36,671 --> 00:04:38,743
>> So
it's big huge that's pretty massive.

72
00:04:38,743 --> 00:04:42,075
So maybe you might want something
much smaller like 3m or something.

73
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:43,559
>> Let's do that.

74
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:46,780
>> So yeah thanks yeah.

75
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,209
So you could play with that means if you
change the font the default font than

76
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:53,895
this size will change accordingly and
yeah.

77
00:04:53,895 --> 00:04:59,116
You know you can but the percentages,
all the others we talked about, dh etc.

78
00:04:59,116 --> 00:05:03,370
There's two kinds of centering,
you either want to center your div or

79
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,266
you want to center the things
in the divs right.

80
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:10,684
>> So to center your div you can
use the margin left right and

81
00:05:10,684 --> 00:05:12,850
margin right properties.

82
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:17,748
And then, so if you set them to auto,

83
00:05:17,748 --> 00:05:21,864
that's going to center the div.

84
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:25,370
And then-
>> You could see what happen.

85
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:29,003
We set left to auto and it's like it had
it's arm and it pushed it all the way

86
00:05:29,003 --> 00:05:31,891
over to the left,
that was Ben Jackie's visual for that.

87
00:05:31,891 --> 00:05:33,719
And then when you set right
it's like you take the right

88
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:34,528
arm you push yourself.

89
00:05:34,528 --> 00:05:38,010
It pushed itself all the way
across from the right side.

90
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:41,790
>> Right, so you're telling it be
as much as you can to the left but

91
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,840
also be as much as you can to the right.

92
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,071
That sort of like two conflicting
instructions so what does it do?

93
00:05:47,071 --> 00:05:48,970
Stands right there in the middle.

94
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,760
So that's that's a way
to center your element.

95
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,710
To center the text or whatever.

96
00:05:54,710 --> 00:06:00,230
If you have text inside the element then
you can just use a text align property.

97
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,570
And then we can use a different thing,

98
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,019
you can you center if you
wanted the text to be centered.

99
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:10,937
Again so now that it's a centering
we can also use it to do other

100
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:14,080
things such as say nice and justified.

101
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:20,030
Another thing that you can use instead
of using margin left and right so

102
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:25,629
let's get rid of these,
is you can use margin auto.

103
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:29,231
So this is actually margin zero and
auto.

104
00:06:29,231 --> 00:06:32,006
So, this looks like it
does the same thing.

105
00:06:32,006 --> 00:06:35,406
Because what this does
is it sets the top and

106
00:06:35,406 --> 00:06:41,340
bottom margins to zero and
then the left and right margins to auto.

107
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,600
And the top and
bottom margins are very different.

108
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,040
This is a very different from the left
and right just because those elements,

109
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,780
because box elements behave
differently when it comes,

110
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,760
they behave differently
vertically versus horizontally.

111
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:01,746
So you can actually center in the middle
of the screen using something like

112
00:07:01,746 --> 00:07:06,160
margin top or auto or margin bottom
although that just won't work.

113
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,400
Yes.

114
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,651
>> It's fine to do something like this
you say top and bottom a zero, left and

115
00:07:10,651 --> 00:07:12,812
right are auto is the short hand,
the short cut.

116
00:07:12,812 --> 00:07:13,312
>> Yeah.

117
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:19,950
If you float an element they take
your element and sort of cause it

118
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:24,693
to make it look like as if it's
like in a, on a layer of its own.

119
00:07:24,693 --> 00:07:25,830
>> Mm-hm.

120
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,015
>> It's not really in
a layer of its own, but

121
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:32,485
it looks like as if it's
on a layer of its own.

122
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:36,569
And we should actually demonstrate that.

123
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:39,718
So let's actually float this box.

124
00:07:39,718 --> 00:07:45,334
And then I think.

125
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:46,983
It's floated to the left.

126
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:49,754
>> Yeah, what just happened here.

127
00:07:49,754 --> 00:07:50,770
>> Exactly.

128
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:55,370
So now it looks really weird
because all the other boxes just

129
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,430
jumped as if like they
couldn't see this box at all.

130
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,250
They just like jumped one up.

131
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,670
This is because we are now saying hey,

132
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:09,310
this box1, it becomes invisible
to the other boxes, really.

133
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:14,100
And it no longer takes maximal
space available to it,

134
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,960
so the other boxes just jump.

135
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,040
Let's float another one.

136
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:28,380
I want to now float this box and
then I'm going to, Load it left as well.

137
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,142
Okay, now it disappeared completely,
but it didn't disappear,

138
00:08:32,142 --> 00:08:33,530
it's actually hiding.

139
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:39,393
Let's give it a different width,

140
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:43,405
so now we've floated both.

141
00:08:43,405 --> 00:08:46,393
Both the box one and box two.

142
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:50,060
>> So, what happened why did
they go to where they are.

143
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:54,860
Well essentially they went when they're
both floated they're both like on

144
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:59,285
a separate layer by themselves kind
of like you can think of that as like

145
00:08:59,285 --> 00:09:01,540
a layer, layer two.

146
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:06,720
And they're aware of each other's
existence, but they're not aware of the,

147
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,920
but other boxes are not aware of them,
so other boxes do not see them.

148
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,510
And it is as if those boxes
are taking zero space.

149
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,000
So, essentially, when you unfloat them,

150
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,690
You see how this goes back
to being on a normal layer.

151
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,690
And then but when you float it,
it goes back up.

152
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,674
And the other thing is that they’re also
not only they're aware of each other but

153
00:09:30,674 --> 00:09:34,496
they're also, like, this is all that
weird because if they're one fluid.

154
00:09:34,496 --> 00:09:39,331
So let's unfloat them and
let also unfloat this.

155
00:09:39,331 --> 00:09:42,950
They are actually
underneath one another,

156
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:46,876
they're not horizontally
next to each other.

157
00:09:46,876 --> 00:09:48,340
>> Because they're block elements.

158
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:52,766
>> Right, yeah but then when you float
them that's no longer the case right.

159
00:09:52,766 --> 00:09:56,883
When you float them they sort of like
lose that property of like wanting to

160
00:09:56,883 --> 00:09:59,458
take as much space as
they can horizontally.

161
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:04,990
Sort of like they are no longer
horizontally territorial.

162
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,540
>> Yeah,
because we're telling it to float left.

163
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,630
Now it's interesting that we
take box2 and we float it right.

164
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,943
Let's see what happens there.

165
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,767
If we take box2,
then we can defloat right.

166
00:10:13,767 --> 00:10:16,000
What do we think will happen?

167
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,360
Right, it jumps to the right side.

168
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,620
So you can put things on both sides,

169
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,040
they're both in this float layer and
they're hiding.

170
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,910
Now here's an interesting thing,

171
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,590
what happens if we float
box one to the right also?

172
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,010
Let's see.

173
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,227
Yeah, look.
That's interesting,

174
00:10:29,227 --> 00:10:32,875
notice how box one is to the right
of the green box, box two.

175
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:36,590
And the reason for
that is box one came before box two.

176
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,417
So it's kind of like there's a race.

177
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:41,879
And the first one you say okay float
right and you get to box one the box one

178
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:45,283
goes to the right and then you got to
box two and you say float right but

179
00:10:45,283 --> 00:10:48,717
box one is already there so it goes
as much to the right it's possible.

180
00:10:48,717 --> 00:10:52,423
>> This is sort of like the first
element and so when you float it to

181
00:10:52,423 --> 00:10:56,151
the right it's the first one it's
going to be on the right side.

182
00:10:56,151 --> 00:10:57,497
And when you float it to
the left it's going to

183
00:10:57,497 --> 00:10:58,922
be the first one it's
going to be on the left side.

184
00:10:58,922 --> 00:11:01,310
And then when you float
elements that come built that.

185
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:04,720
This is the second element and so
it's going to follow the first element.

186
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,462
Now what if what if we have the common
situation where we like these things

187
00:11:07,462 --> 00:11:11,770
floated but what we want everything else
to come after it like you know like.

188
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:15,660
We need to clear like it's there's
actually something called clear fix.

189
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,837
You need to fix this.

190
00:11:16,837 --> 00:11:19,101
We need to clear all the problems.

191
00:11:19,101 --> 00:11:21,830
To fix these these floating inches.

192
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:25,960
So, let's select the third box right.

193
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,817
And then let's give a property.

194
00:11:29,817 --> 00:11:32,459
Let's clear-
>> Clear both.

195
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:33,402
I think that's left and right.

196
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:34,366
>> Let's clear both.

197
00:11:34,366 --> 00:11:37,271
>> Yeah, boom, look at that!

198
00:11:37,271 --> 00:11:41,179
>> So now you're essentially telling
it you actually you got to be aware,

199
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:45,151
you've got to be aware because there's
actually elements floated on both

200
00:11:45,151 --> 00:11:47,247
sides which clear opens on both sides.

201
00:11:47,247 --> 00:11:50,433
We actually we floated those to
the left so we don't have to,

202
00:11:50,433 --> 00:11:52,436
this is going to be the same thing now.

203
00:11:52,436 --> 00:11:54,800
>> [CROSSTALK] Right, yeah.

204
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,430
>> The clear right works for

205
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:00,880
this because those two elements
are like floated to the right side.

206
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,790
So you're telling that
third box watch out,

207
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:08,410
you have elements floated to your
right so you want to be below them.

208
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,140
>> Yeah.

209
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,780
So if you ever hear someone
talking about clear fix,

210
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,610
This is kind of a trick that you need,
you can Google it.

211
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:18,201
There's actually two things you need for
clear fix you need to clear left or

212
00:12:18,201 --> 00:12:20,481
right, and
you also need to set the overflow for

213
00:12:20,481 --> 00:12:22,520
a weird case where you have nested divs.

214
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,700
So when you look at the clear fix,
you'll see it clears and

215
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:30,480
it also sets an overflow, so if you
don't forget, just google it and add it.

216
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,248
And even within Bootstrap you sometimes
have to be aware of these issues, too.

217
00:12:33,248 --> 00:12:37,630
So you'll see references to
clear fix in Bootstrap shot.
