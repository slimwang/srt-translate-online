1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We're going to use regular expressions,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
which are very good at specifying sets of strings

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
to specify tokens.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Later on we'll want to match a bunch of different tokens

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
from webpages or JavaScript, and this is how we write out

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
token definitions in Python.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The t_ tells us--and it tells the Python system--

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
that we're declaring a token.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The next letters are the name of the token.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You either get to make this up yourself, or in the homework

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'll tell you what I want it to be.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Tokens are in some sense going to be functions of the text they match.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
More on this a bit later.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Skip me for now.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Next, we have a regular expression

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
corresponding to this token,

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
which in this case, for the right angle token,

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
there's really only 1 string it can correspond to,

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
so we've written out the regular expression that corresponds to a single string.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And then here on the last line we're returning the text of the token unchanged.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We could transform it, and you'll see us do that for more complicated tokens

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
like numbers where maybe we'll want to change the string 1.2

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
into the number 1.2.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Now it's your chance to define your first token.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What I would like you to do is write code

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
in the style of the procedure I just showed you before

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
for the LANGLESLASH token.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The LANGLESLASH token is surprisingly important.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We really need it to know when all of our tags end.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Use the interpreter to define a procedure

31
00:01:40,000 --> 99:59:59,999
t_LANGLESLASH that matches it.
