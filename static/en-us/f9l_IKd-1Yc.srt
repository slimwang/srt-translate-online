00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,390
In this session, we're going to build on
our understanding of Boolean expressions

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,430
to create if else statements.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,370
If else statements will give
us the ability to branch or

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,310
redirect the execution of our
applications based on truth values.

5
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,160
So if something's true, do this.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,660
If something's false, do this.

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:17,950
And that's just a simple case.

8
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:18,970
But by the end of this session,

9
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,720
we'll build pretty complex
logic using this concept.
