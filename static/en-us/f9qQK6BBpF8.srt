00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,840
I now like to begin looking at how you're going to deal with, you, and

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,220
you'll know, relationships that show up in your analysis model.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:15,080
In your ultimate program, there aren't any, direct representations of those,

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,840
particular relationships, so during design you need to

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,560
come up with a strategy for how you're going to deal with them. First one we

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,620
like to look at is generalization. Now, object oriented programming languages

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:30,360
have a feature called inheritance, and I want to take a minute to describe to

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,670
you the differences between inheritance and generalization, because it can

9
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:39,260
get you into trouble if you just routinely treat one as the same as the other.

10
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,470
First off, Generalization is an abstraction between two classes that mean that

11
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:48,530
all instances of the child class are also instances of the parent class.

12
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,890
Inheritance, on the other hand, is an implementation technique, whereby messages

13
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:59,080
sent to a child may be delegated to a parent. You can use inheritance to,

14
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,410
implement Generalization, but you have to be careful how you do it.
