1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,330
Create a landscape
version of fragment_main.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,160
So, first of all,
grab the starting code, as we always do.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,196
And I recommend copying
the existing fragment_main

4
00:00:10,196 --> 00:00:11,990
into the layout-land directory.

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,730
Modify the layout to match the design.

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,640
You can set the width of the included
fragment_main base layout,

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,922
to this new dimension that we've given
you, landscape_forecast_view_width.

8
00:00:24,922 --> 00:00:27,420
Know they'll have to be
careful about elevation and

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,560
reorder the layout, since the forecast
list is going to overlap the app bar.

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,710
And again, don't worry about
with this padding up here.

11
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,830
We'll deal with it later.
