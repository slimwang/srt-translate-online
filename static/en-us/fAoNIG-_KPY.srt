00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,820
Now that our program draws the people in the social network, we need to make it

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:09,457
draw the friendships. I wrote a main method that creates three people, Sarah,

3
00:00:09,457 --> 00:00:15,610
Cheng-Han, and Cay, and then adds Cay and Cheng-Han to my friends. When I run

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:20,060
this main method, It draws connections from me to Cheng-Han and me to Cay. This

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:26,810
dot means that Cheng-Han is in my friends list, but not necessarily that I'm in

6
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:31,925
his. Your task now is to fix the person class so that when you run this main

7
00:00:31,925 --> 00:00:37,090
method, it draws this picture. With the lines. Each person gets a picture when

8
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:41,710
the object's constructed. And when someone adds a friend, you draw a line, from

9
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:46,480
the person who who has a new friend, to the person who is the new friend. The

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,060
lines for now should just connect all of the top left corners of the pictures.

11
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,470
This is a pretty complicated task right now. You might be thinking, you're not

12
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,890
really sure what to do first. So let's chat a little. Here's most of our code

13
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:02,145
for the Person class. You're only missing get friends at the bottom. And

14
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:07,380
y-coordinate over here. In which method should we add code that draws a line

15
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:15,798
between friends? The constructor, addFriend, unfriend, getFriends, or somewhere

16
00:01:15,798 --> 00:01:16,386
else?
