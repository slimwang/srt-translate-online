00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Just to remind you from last time, the structures that we're talking about mostly in this course

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
are graphs--also sometimes called networks,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
which is a discrete structure consisting of a set of nodes--sometimes called vertices--

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and edges--sometimes called links.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Interestingly, usually the people who call the nodes "nodes" call the edges "links,"

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and the people who call the nodes "vertices" call the edges "edges,"

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
because these both come from geometry.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But, for whatever reason I mix them together. I apologize.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I tried to change, but it just didn't work.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Here's an example of a graph that has six nodes--the blue circles here--

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten edges connecting those nodes together.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
In these kinds of graphs, the edges just link up two of the nodes--

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
not more than two, not fewer than two.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
In what we're going to be talking about, the edges don't have any direction to them.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
They just link them together.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The particular positioning of them on the page is really irrelevant.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What matters is which nodes are connected to which other nodes.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What we're going to be talking about for the next little while are special networks

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
that have particular structures and that usually fall into different families.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
One particular family of networks is called chain networks.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Chain networks consist of a set of nodes and a sequence of edges between them

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
that basically connect them into a single chain.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This is an example of a chain network with five nodes--one, two, three, four, five--

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and four edges--one, two, three, four--connecting them together.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
There's essentially only one such network.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We can imagine flipping it around or relabeling the nodes,

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
but topologically, there really is only one way of connect five nodes into a chain.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Now, I mentioned that this is part of a family of networks.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Now, you get a different chain network for each different possible number of nodes.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Now, a question I'd like to have you answer is how many edges do you have

31
00:01:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
in a network that has n nodes if it's a chain network?
