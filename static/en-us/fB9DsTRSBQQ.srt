Hi.
It's Jessica.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,990
Your friendly,
neighborhood program manager.

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,390
I just wanted to pop in quickly and

4
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:09,330
let you know that the content in this
lesson is still under construction.

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,370
That means that we're still
making some updates and

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,460
some re-records for Swift 2.0.

7
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,585
However, while we're doing that,
you will always find the most

8
00:00:16,585 --> 00:00:20,580
up-to-date code for
Swift 2.0 in the instructor notes.

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,430
So we thank you for your patience as
we go through and update everything.

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,960
We hope you enjoy the content,
and happy coding.
