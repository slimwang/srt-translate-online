00:00:00,232 --> 00:00:02,522
On app launch, I know that
you're probably tired of seeing

2
00:00:02,522 --> 00:00:05,230
the dummy data and needing to hit 
the refresh button

3
00:00:05,337 --> 00:00:07,151
for real data every single time.

4
00:00:07,211 --> 00:00:10,341
I'm going to show you how to display 
the data using the current settings

5
00:00:10,341 --> 00:00:12,921
each time the activity is loaded.

6
00:00:12,921 --> 00:00:15,385
In forecast fragment, 
we just refactored the code

7
00:00:15,385 --> 00:00:17,207
so that when the refresh button
is selected,

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,836
we call this helper method, 
updateWeather.

9
00:00:19,836 --> 00:00:22,071
Now that it's in a helper method, 
we can also call it

10
00:00:22,071 --> 00:00:23,713
from the onStart method.

11
00:00:23,744 --> 00:00:26,265
We over write onStart so that 
the refresh happens

12
00:00:26,265 --> 00:00:27,994
whenever the fragment starts.

13
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:30,102
This will cause 
the weather data to appear.

14
00:00:30,102 --> 00:00:31,628
We'll learn all about onStart,

15
00:00:31,628 --> 00:00:34,754
and the rest of the Android 
life cycle in the next lesson.

16
00:00:34,849 --> 00:00:37,577
At this point, we can also remove 
all the fake data that we had

17
00:00:37,577 --> 00:00:39,142
in the onCreateView method.

18
00:00:39,142 --> 00:00:42,629
Then we pass in an empty array list
to the ArrayAdapter.

19
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:44,259
Now we can test this.

20
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:46,381
We need to make sure that 
this is the first app launch

21
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:49,775
and that it wasn't already running,
so if it's already running, kill it.

22
00:00:49,775 --> 00:00:51,584
Then tap to open the app,

23
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:54,104
and then you should see 
the actual weather data immediately.

24
00:00:54,104 --> 00:00:58,182
Under settings we can change the location
to be the pairs postal code.

25
00:00:58,182 --> 00:01:00,765
We hit OK, and then return 
to the main list,

26
00:01:00,765 --> 00:01:03,170
and then we see that 
the weather data has updated.
