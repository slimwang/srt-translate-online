00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,350
So finally, to make things as meta as possible, meta reasoning has actually been

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,360
a motivating pedagogical goal for the design of this very course. You'll notice

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,460
that for almost every lesson, we start with an example of a problem that you

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,720
could solve. In incremental concept learning, for example, we start by giving

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,780
you several examples of foos and not foos. And then we asked you is this a foo?

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,470
In production systems, we gave you some information about a baseball game and

7
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,650
asked you to decide what the pitcher should do next. In learning by recording

8
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:29,890
cases, we gave you a world of rectangles and asked you to decide what color

9
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:33,660
a new rectangle might be. In classification, we gave you a bunch of pictures and

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,660
asked you to decide which of those pictures were birds. In planning,

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,200
we gave you our blocks micro-world and

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,980
asked you to develop a plan to go from our initial state to our goal state.

13
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,330
In each of these, we've started with the problem that we could solve,

14
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,860
that we then wanted to design an agent to solve.

15
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,570
These examples then motivated our discussion not necessarily of how we did it,

16
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,980
but how we could design an agent to do it. Then at the end of each lesson,

17
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,160
we revisited that example. We took the reasoning method that we designed for

18
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,480
our agent and looked at how that exact reasoning method would allow it to

19
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,489
answer the same example with which we started the lesson. When you

20
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,590
did the example at the start of the lesson, you didn't necessarily know how you

21
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,740
were able to solve that problem. You could speculate, but you never know for

22
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,290
sure. But then by building an agent that can solve that problem, we start to

23
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,720
gain some understanding for the processes that we must be able to engage in,

24
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,260
in order to solve that problem as well. So by designing the agent,

25
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,830
we develop a greater understanding of our own cognition. So in this way,

26
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,270
the very design of the lessons in this course has been driven by trying to

27
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,010
develop metacognition in you. In fact, developing metacognition in

28
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,870
students is the entire goal of my own PhD dissertation.
