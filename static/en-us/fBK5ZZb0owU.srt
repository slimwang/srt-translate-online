1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,930
So, question, if you're going to do the moving average computation,

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:08,510
the number of weights that you have should be what?

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:12,010
A, odd, because it's easier to have a middle pixel.

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:16,800
B, even, that way it can be symmetric around me.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,140
Or c, obviously either even or odd.
