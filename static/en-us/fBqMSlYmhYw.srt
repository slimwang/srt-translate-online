00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,718
You saw me do it but now it's your turn.

2
00:00:02,718 --> 00:00:05,299
We begin by creating our
number list item layout

3
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:08,429
containing a frame layout
enclosing a single TextView.

4
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:12,016
Then we create our NumberViewHolder
inner class containing a single TextView

5
00:00:12,016 --> 00:00:12,619
reference.
