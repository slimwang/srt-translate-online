00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,640
When we go through this long division we end up with x squared plus x plus 1.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,873
You'll remember that you actually have seen this problem before when you

3
00:00:07,873 --> 00:00:12,668
learned how to factor, we learned a rule for factoring difference of cubes. We

4
00:00:12,668 --> 00:00:16,877
learned that x cubed minus 1 is equal to x minus 1 times x squared plus x plus

5
00:00:16,877 --> 00:00:20,563
1. Now we just proved that rule, awesome.
