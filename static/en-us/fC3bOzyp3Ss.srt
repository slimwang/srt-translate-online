1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,770
That ends the robot vision
part of particle filtering.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:04,740
Now if you remember,

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,660
we introduced all of these stuff in
order to be able to do tracking.

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,650
Okay, we started with common filter
tracking, then we did particle filter.

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,590
So, in our next lesson,
what we're going to do is,

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,560
we're going to go back
to doing tracking.

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,070
And we'll use some simple
particle filter technique for

8
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,270
doing some visual tracking.
