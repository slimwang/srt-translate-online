1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,100
Since every Linux machine comes
with the user name root and

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:07,120
that user is super powerful, they can
do anything they want on this machine.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,870
It's very common to disable the ability
to remotely log in as root.

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,680
Instead, we'll log in as
a user we create, and

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,130
then we can run individual commands
as root by using another command.

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,910
This is to make any potential
attacker's job a little more difficult

7
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:26,120
by eliminating the username that they
already know exists on this on this box.

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,250
Our vagrant virtual machine has already
set up the security pattern for us and

9
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,190
many other cloud providers
will do this for you, as well.

10
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:37,240
If not, it's highly advised that this be
one of the very first things you do when

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,990
you're setting up a new server.

12
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,680
We'll cover exactly how
to do that a bit later.

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,070
>> Let's run that same command again,

14
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,920
except this time we'll prepend the
command with this pseudo command here.

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,050
Now we see the results.

16
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,380
The pseudo command ran this
command as if we were root.
