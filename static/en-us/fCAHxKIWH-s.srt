00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,822
>> Distributing multiplication by a to both terms inside the parentheses gives

2
00:00:04,822 --> 00:00:09,348
us a times b or ab plus a times c or ac. So now, we can see that both terms here

3
00:00:09,348 --> 00:00:13,915
have a common factor of a. This is basically the opposite of the step that we

4
00:00:13,915 --> 00:00:18,710
took in modifying our equation earlier. We're getting rid of our parentheses

5
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,636
here instead of adding them in.
