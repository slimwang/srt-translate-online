1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is, yes, there is.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
That is we can remove the lid from the can,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and we can do that to either can, can one or can two,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and then without knowing what color that can is and without knowing

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
what color any of the furniture is,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
we can first paint the table, and then paint the chair.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Then we know they'll both have the same color,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and we'll have achieved the goal.
