The answer is a blue rectangle appears. Let's try it out. Here's the blue

2
00:00:08,989 --> 00:00:14,840
rectangle it prints. This is because we made a rectangle. And then, we made a

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:20,631
variable box. And in that variable, we put a reference to the rectangle we

4
00:00:20,631 --> 00:00:26,518
made. Then, we made another variable, box2. And we copied the value from box in

5
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:32,134
the box2. So, we copied the reference. So now, box2 also refers to the same

6
00:00:32,134 --> 00:00:38,913
rectangle. Now, we've set the color of the thing in the box to red. And then,

7
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:44,545
set the color of the thing in the box2 to blue. And then, we draw or fill the

8
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:48,153
thing in box, which has the color blue.
