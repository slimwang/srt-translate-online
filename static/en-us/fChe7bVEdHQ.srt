1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now, the probability of sampling a particular variable,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
choosing a +w or a -w, depends on the values of the parents.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
But those are chosen according to the conditional probability tables,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
so in the limit, the count of each sampled variable

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
will approach the true probability.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That is, with an infinite number of samples, this procedure computes the true

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
joint probability distribution.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We say that the sampling method is consistent.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We can use this kind of sampling to compute the complete joint probability distribution,

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
or we can use it to compute a value for an individual variable.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
But what if we wanted to compute a conditional probability?

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Say we wanted to compute the probability of wet grass

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
given that it's not cloudy.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
To do that, the sample that we generated here wouldn't be helpful at all

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
because it has to do with being cloudy, not with being not cloudy.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So, we would cross this sample off the list.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We would say that we reject the sample, and this technique is called rejection sampling.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We go through ignoring any samples that don't match

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
the conditional probabilities that we're interested in

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and keeping samples that do, say the sample -c, +s, +r, -w.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We would just continue going through generating samples,

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
crossing off the ones that don't match, keeping the ones that do.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And this procedure would also be consistent.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We call this procedure rejection sampling.
