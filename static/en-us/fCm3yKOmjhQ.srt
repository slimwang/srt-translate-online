00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,520
See those three bars sticking up in the middle

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,860
of the road? So why are they there? What

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,490
are their affordances? Well, maybe they're for stretching and

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,100
turning. Maybe you're supposed to run around them as fast

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,250
as possible, in loops for five minutes. It's part

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,160
of an exercise course. Or maybe you can lean your

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,692
bicycles on them. Or maybe they they're stands for

8
00:00:22,692 --> 00:00:26,000
a net that you stretch between them, and play games.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,780
So what do you think?
