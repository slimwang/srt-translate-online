00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,315
3-D computer graphics uses an interesting concept to speed up object display

2
00:00:04,315 --> 00:00:09,058
called backface culling. Imagine you're looking at a box. Here's the side view

3
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:12,947
in 2-D. Only the sides of the box that face toward you are visible. The

4
00:00:12,947 --> 00:00:17,817
backfaces here and here do not need to be rendered. The fastest polygon to

5
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:21,653
render is the one you don't ever have to render at all. Backface culling can

6
00:00:21,653 --> 00:00:26,097
throw away about half the faces in an object, so it's a worthwhile optimization.

7
00:00:26,098 --> 00:00:30,574
For example, here's a real live box. If you look at it from any angle, you're

8
00:00:30,574 --> 00:00:34,051
only gong to see a few of the faces of the whole box, and the rest of the faces

9
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:39,128
can be thrown away. Backfaces can be culled for any solid object. This V-shape

10
00:00:39,128 --> 00:00:44,424
seen from the side has only two sides facing towards the camera, outlined green.

11
00:00:44,425 --> 00:00:48,345
These other two faces can be thrown away without further processing. It turns

12
00:00:48,345 --> 00:00:53,070
out this green face here is hidden from view by this front face, but we let the

13
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,236
z buffer take care of hiding that. We can set whether backface culling is

14
00:00:57,236 --> 00:01:01,205
enabled or disabled, but how do we determine if a triangle is a frontface or a

15
00:01:01,205 --> 00:01:06,108
backface? There are three points defining each triangle, and there is no flag

16
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:10,182
stored for additional information. What determines front or backfacing is the

17
00:01:10,182 --> 00:01:14,100
order of the vertices after they are protected on to the screen. In WebGL, if

18
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,455
the order is counterclockwise, the triangle is frontfacing. If its clockwise,

19
00:01:19,455 --> 00:01:23,100
its backfacing. Going counterclockwise like this is often called the right-hand

20
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,924
rule. The fingers of your right hand wrap around the edges of the triangle in

21
00:01:27,924 --> 00:01:32,323
order. If your thumb points at you, the triangle is then frontfacing.
