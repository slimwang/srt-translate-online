1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,819
the 2015 imagenet winner was a network

2
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:05,309
from Microsoft Research called resnet

3
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:07,710
residents claim to fame is that it has a

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,630
massive 152 layers for contrast Alex it

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,528
has eight layers VG has 19 layers and

6
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:19,618
Google annette has 22 layers resnet is

7
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:21,629
kinda like VG and that the same

8
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:23,129
structure is repeated again and again

9
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:26,070
for layer after layer the main idea was

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,079
to add connections to the neural network

11
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:30,359
that skip layers so that very deep

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:31,829
neural networks could practically be

13
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:34,590
trained resident achieves a loss of only

14
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,479
three percent on imagenet which is

15
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:38,219
actually better than normal human

16
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:39,390
accuracy

17
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,479
now that you've learned about VG google

18
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:44,850
annette and resnet we'd like you to get

19
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,700
your hands dirty in the next assignment

20
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,320
you load each of these networks and

21
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,488
benchmark their performance
