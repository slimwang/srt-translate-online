1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,991
You would have to walk 41 miles in total. That's pretty far. First, you'd start

2
00:00:04,991 --> 00:00:10,244
at mile marker 210 where your car broke down. You'd walk 20 miles west, and

3
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:16,178
then 21 miles south. So we would just add 20 miles and 21 miles, which is 41

4
00:00:16,178 --> 00:00:23,300
miles. Hopefully you also figured out that this is not the shortest distance.

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:28,311
The shortest distance between any two points is actually a straight line. Now

6
00:00:28,311 --> 00:00:31,131
we're going to assume that the region in this area is relatively at the same

7
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:36,130
elevation. Meaning we're not going uphill and downhill a lot in any direction

8
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,490
we go. This is why we can be fairly sure that this distance would be the

9
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:45,400
shortest distance from mile marker 210 straight to the town.
