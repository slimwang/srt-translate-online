Now that we can spawn entities, we need to keep tract of them, update them as

2
00:00:02,856 --> 00:00:06,848
necessary, and kill them off when they refuse to comply with our wishes! In

00:00:06,848 --> 00:00:10,196
order to do this, the game engine keeps a list of active entities that it can

00:00:10,196 --> 00:00:14,950
then use to iterate over during our update and render functions later.

00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,534
Implement the functionality in the given code calling each entity's update

00:00:18,534 --> 00:00:20,819
method in the given function.
