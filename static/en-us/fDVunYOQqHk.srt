Diagnosis is a very common cognitive task. It occurs whenever our expectations

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:09,880
are violated. We start diagnosing. Why were our expectations violated?

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,910
Within a system, we expect some behavior out of it. We get a different behavior.

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:18,000
Why did the system not give the behavior we expected from it? Notice that

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,500
diagnosis is a task. We can use several methods to address it, like case-based

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,730
reasoning. We have discussed diagnosis on several contexts like medicine,

7
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:32,715
program debugging, car repair, but it's also very common in other aspects of

8
00:00:32,715 --> 00:00:36,910
our life. For example, you get unexpected traffic. Why did it occur? We review

9
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:41,560
interaction with a co-worker or the economy. All are examples of diagnosis
