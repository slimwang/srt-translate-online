1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This quiz builds on the one before.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now, the Euler method is in place and we want to experiment with the step size.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
If you look at the solution curves, you could get the impression

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
that a step size of half a day is way too small.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Why should we be stepping in half days. What about steps of say 5 days.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Shouldn't that be working given these curves.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Let's step size in and leave that step size in for which the solution just doesn't explode

8
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and accuracy of 1 decimal place is enough.
