00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,780
Let's start by looking at line f, this turquoise line right here. I like to find

2
00:00:05,792 --> 00:00:10,437
the y-intercept first, which on line f, is at 0, negative 2. So b is just

3
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:15,422
negative 2. Then I can use this point to help me find the slope. If I move over

4
00:00:15,434 --> 00:00:20,935
1 to the right, I need to move down 1 in order to hit the line again. So, the

5
00:00:20,947 --> 00:00:26,545
slope is going to be negative 1 over 1 or other words just negative 1. For line

6
00:00:26,557 --> 00:00:32,485
g, the y-intercept is actually the origin, 0, 0. This means that b has to equal

7
00:00:32,497 --> 00:00:37,965
0. To find the slope, I see that if I start at the origin, I can move to the

8
00:00:37,977 --> 00:00:43,693
right 2 units and then down 1 unit to reach the graph again. So, the slope is

9
00:00:43,705 --> 00:00:49,327
going to be negative 1, since we moved down 1 in the y direction, over positive

10
00:00:49,339 --> 00:00:54,743
2, since we stepped 2 to the right. So, the slope is negative 1/2. And lastly,

11
00:00:54,861 --> 00:00:59,500
we come to line h. This intersects the y-axis at 0, 3, b then is 3.

12
00:00:59,622 --> 00:01:05,525
Interestingly enough, just like with g, if we walk over 2, we have to walk down

13
00:01:05,537 --> 00:01:09,652
1 to get back to the graph. So, the slope for this is also negative 1/2.
