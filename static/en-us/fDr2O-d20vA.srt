1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Another graph type worth mentioning is a tree graph.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
A tree graph has two properties.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The first property is that the graph must be connected,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and the second property is that the graph doesn't have any cycles or loops.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The best way to understand what a true graph is is to see some examples.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So, let's have a quiz.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Here are 8 graphs. For each graph, I want you to check the box if it's a tree.
