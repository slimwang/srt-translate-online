1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now we know if this game if these were terminal nodes,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
then that would be the right action for the game, and there was nothing to argue about.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
But what if instead of having these be terminal nodes, these were cutoff nodes,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and these were evaluation values for those nodes?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Furthermore, if it's an evaluation function, then it's an arbitrary function.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Suppose if instead of coming up with these values, we used a different evaluation function,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
which squared these values, and so we came up with evaluations of 0, 16, 4, and 9.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
With that function, I want you to repeat the problem of filling in the values for each

9
00:00:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
of these nodes and tell me what the rational action is for Max.
