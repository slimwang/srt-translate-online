1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,940
The quickest scene to render is the one without any lighting at all, right here

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,939
on the lower right-hand corner. These objects just use a solid color and so

3
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:12,220
little detail is visible. The second fastest to render is here in the upper

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,632
left, as the objects do not cast any shadows. Note how details get lost near the

5
00:00:16,632 --> 00:00:20,441
front edges. It's hard to tell where the floor ends, and the top of the outer

6
00:00:20,441 --> 00:00:24,450
wall begins. The next fastest to render is here in the lower left. This one has

7
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,956
shadows, which take longer to render. Shadows help us a bit in telling how

8
00:00:27,956 --> 00:00:31,954
surfaces are related to each other. However, everything in shadow looks the

9
00:00:31,954 --> 00:00:35,926
same. Since we're computing only light that directly hits these surfaces. The

10
00:00:35,926 --> 00:00:39,966
slowest rendering is here in the upper right. It's also the highest quality, as

11
00:00:39,966 --> 00:00:43,872
light bounces off the walls and into the shadowed areas, so giving them some

12
00:00:43,872 --> 00:00:44,643
definition.
