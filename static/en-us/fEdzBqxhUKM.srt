1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,570
>> Alright, so are any of these easy to answer right off the bat?

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,810
>> Well, one of them is really easy to answer

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,540
right off the bat, and that's minus 1 minus 1.

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:09,190
>> Good.

5
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,310
>> Because that's one of the points, so. [LAUGH]

6
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:15,448
>> Yeah. So, the joint strategy to get the minus

7
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:20,355
one minus one would be for both players to cooperate, right?

8
00:00:20,355 --> 00:00:22,790
Again, they're just, you know, they're just willing to do that

9
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,330
just for the sake of showing they can make that value.

10
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:29,930
>> Right, and I think I know the answers for the other ones as well

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,010
>> Alright, hit me.

12
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,250
>> So here's how i'm going to, here's how I'm going to, going to talk

13
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,620
you through my reasoning so that if any point I'm wrong, you can

14
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,625
gently steer me away from embarrassing myself. Basically I was looking at these

15
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:42,880
points and I thought hm, they form a kind of a convex hull.

16
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,700
>> Aha!

17
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,590
>> And I thought well, surely that's just an accident of the numbers

18
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,820
and then I thought, oh wait, of course we're talking about averages here.

19
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,030
So that means that all sort of possibilities have to be inside the convex hull

20
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:02,030
of the outer points. So if I drew a line between those four points,

21
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,630
I would end up with all possible, achievable averages.

22
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,810
>> What, achievable averages, how? How would

23
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,410
you achieve things inside the convex hull?

24
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,390
>> I would appropriately average them. So in

25
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,079
particular, the first thing I'd notice that minus three,

26
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,990
zero, is outside that.

27
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,450
>> Mm.

28
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,540
>> So, it can't be, it can't be something you can achieve.

29
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,012
>> Right, there's no way to make this minus

30
00:01:24,012 --> 00:01:26,710
three, zero, certainly not by choosing any of these

31
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,200
points, but also no combi, no convex combination, no

32
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,430
probabilistic combination of them, is going to do that either.

33
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:31,890
>> Right.

34
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,820
>> So, this one is just right out.

35
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,900
>> Right, so that leaves minus four minus four, and it

36
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,260
seems pretty. That's inside the convex hull, so there is some

37
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,470
combination of them that would work.

38
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,416
>> That's right. Any, any sense of what it would be?

39
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:50,800
>> 2 3rds, I think 2 3rds D,D 1 3rd

40
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,199
C,C. And I get that by noticing that D,D is minus

41
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:57,709
six, minus six, and C,C is minus one minus one, and

42
00:01:57,709 --> 00:02:01,327
four minus four is two thirds of the way between there.

43
00:02:01,327 --> 00:02:04,430
>> Boom. Cool. Alright, so you're good with that?

44
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,590
>> I'm good with that if you're good with that. It's your quiz.

45
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,677
>> Yeah. I'm excited.

46
00:02:07,677 --> 00:02:08,025
>> Oh good.

47
00:02:08,025 --> 00:02:09,985
>> So those, it's this, this, the minus one

48
00:02:09,985 --> 00:02:11,947
minus one and the minus four minus four are,

49
00:02:11,947 --> 00:02:13,484
as as you pointed out there is a more

50
00:02:13,484 --> 00:02:16,442
general result here. Having to do with the convex hull.

51
00:02:16,442 --> 00:02:17,269
>> Right.

52
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:19,765
>> Alright, so through the magic of computer graphics, I have a

53
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,637
slightly better depiction of this particular

54
00:02:21,637 --> 00:02:23,756
region now. As you pointed out this,

55
00:02:23,756 --> 00:02:27,428
this convex hull of the points is really important and what it

56
00:02:27,428 --> 00:02:31,892
represents is the, we can call it the feasible region, these are average

57
00:02:31,892 --> 00:02:35,132
payoffs of some joint strategy they, they may have to

58
00:02:35,132 --> 00:02:39,150
collude to do this. And they may not be particularly happy

59
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,710
to do that. [LAUGH]. But the fact of the matter is,

60
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:46,570
they can achieve, by working together, payoffs anywhere inside this region.

61
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,190
>> Huh, so that's what my student Liam

62
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,820
always meant when he talked about feasible regions.

63
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,350
>> Maybe so, I mean it could be that he meant any number of

64
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:56,180
other things like places he's willing to live when he goes to get a job.

65
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,050
>> No, it was all game

66
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,120
theory stuff, I just never knew what he was

67
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,580
talking about, but now I do Michael, thanks to you.

68
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,490
>> Sure, hey I'm, I'm happy to help. So

69
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,380
this is a really useful kind of geometric way

70
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,530
of picturing something that would otherwise be a little

71
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,460
bit harder to see, I think in the matrix form.

72
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,220
>> Sure.
