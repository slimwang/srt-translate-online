Peg Solitaire is not partially observable because you

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,930
can see the board at all times. It is

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,810
not stochastic because you just name all the

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,520
moves and they have very different mystic effects. It

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,150
is not continuous as there is fairly many

6
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,720
choices of actions and fairly many board positions, so

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,410
therefore it's not continuous. And its not adversarial

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,730
because there is no adversary, it's just you playing.
