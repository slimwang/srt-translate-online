1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,550
To start solving this problem,
I'm going to write some methods first.

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:07,750
Methods are little blocks of
code between curly braces and

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,690
I can get my buttons
to trigger my methods.

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,250
So I'm going to have a method for
each of the buttons.

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:19,060
I'll start with the plus three points
button, I'm going to type public void,

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,290
now this is when you would
type the method name.

7
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,910
And you should feel free to name
the methods whatever you'd like.

8
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,570
And I say that as long
as it makes sense.

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,068
So I'm going to try to name this method
very explicitly what's going to happen

10
00:00:31,068 --> 00:00:33,770
when you click the plus
three points button.

11
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:41,700
This method name is going
to be addThreeForTeamA.

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,600
And again, you could name it
something a little bit different,

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,195
like addThreePointsForTeamA.

14
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,083
Okay.
Now after that,

15
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:49,380
I'm going to type the method parameters.

16
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,290
And you don't know too much about this,
but

17
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,440
you'll learn about it
more in the next lesson.

18
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,280
It's going to be view with a capital V,
and then the letter V.

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,760
And then, I'm going to make an open
curly brace and Android Studio is smart

20
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,290
enough to give me a closed
curly brace to close my method.

21
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,960
And now any statements that I put in
here are going to be what happens when

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,960
this method gets called.

23
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,980
So what I want to happen is for
it to display for

24
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,890
team A, and then I'm going to give it
the number that I want it to display,

25
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,385
and I want it to display 3.

26
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,010
Now this hasn't been associated
to my buttons yet, so

27
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:32,120
I have to go back to my XML, and I'm

28
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,990
going to go to the button that's plus
three points, this one right here.

29
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,480
And I'm going to add
an onClick attribute.

30
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,760
And in this onClick attribute,
I'm going to give it the exact same name

31
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,350
that I gave the method
in my main activity.

32
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,400
And actually Android Studio's
jumping the gun a little bit.

33
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,510
It's even trying to suggest that I
should put in here, addThreeForTeamA.

34
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:59,570
Because it kind of sees all the methods
that are available in main activity and

35
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,660
this one seems to fit the bill.

36
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,000
So sure I am going to click on this.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,640
Okay, now I have
the onClick attribute here.

38
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,125
With this button that says +3 Points,
and it's going to trigger

39
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:15,490
addThreeForTeamA, and
I could go back to my main activity and

40
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:20,551
see that inside of addThreeForTeamA,
it says displayForTeamA(3),

41
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:23,540
which will make 3 appear on
the screen for the score.

42
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,570
Let's make sure all of
that logic is Okay,

43
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,450
here's my app, and
I'm going to press the +3 points.

44
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,550
Yay, and it says 3.

45
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,500
It might be kind of small on your
screen, but believe me, it says 3.

46
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,910
These other buttons don't work,
though, so that's as expected,

47
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,190
because we didn't change
any of the code for them.

48
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:42,980
All right, let's keep working.

49
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,680
So, now that I know that that worked,
I'm going to go ahead and

50
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,000
do the same thing for
the other two buttons.

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,059
In fact, I'm going to do such the same
thing that I'm going to copy this and

52
00:02:54,059 --> 00:02:56,190
I'm going to paste it twice.

53
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,375
And I'm just going to say,

54
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:08,970
addTwoForTeam A, and addOneForTeamA.

55
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:14,990
And here, I'm going to change this to
displaying 2 and this to displaying 1.

56
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,070
Okay.

57
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:21,530
So that's pretty much the same thing for
2 and 1 that I did for adding 3 points,

58
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:25,650
but I also have to remember to go over
to the XML, so I click to go over here.

59
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,090
Okay.

60
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,250
And I'm going to add two more onClicks.

61
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,590
So for my +2 Points button,

62
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:38,820
I'm going to do a onClick,
and oh, how nice of it.

63
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,340
It's giving me three
different options now and

64
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,820
I want to make sure to
select the right one.

65
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,490
So, this is +2 Points, so
I'm going to select addTwoForTeamA.

66
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,990
And now I'm going to come down here.

67
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:51,930
Type onClick.

68
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,500
And select the addOneForTeamA.

69
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,860
Okay, so, I'm feeling pretty
confident that that's going to work.

70
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,810
I'd bet some money on it, but
I should still run it to test it out.

71
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,120
Okay, so, I press +3.

72
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,190
Still works.

73
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,260
I press +2.

74
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,120
Oh, cool.
It says 2.

75
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,670
And now I press free throw,
and it shows 1.

76
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,600
So, awesome.

77
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,730
I've completed the task.

78
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,260
And because I've completed the task, I
get the honor of checking this box off.
