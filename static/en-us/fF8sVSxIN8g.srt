00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:06,080
HTTP is a stateless protocol,
each request is its own TCP connection.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,840
For example,
if you log into your bank's website,

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,660
each click on a URL generates
a separate TCP connection.

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:19,270
In order to carry information
across multiple HTTP requests

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:23,160
such as user authentication,
cookies are used.

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,950
A cookie is created by the web server
when the user first logs into the site.

7
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:33,420
It contains not only user identity
information, but also security

8
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,310
information such as access,
expiration time, and if SSL is required.

9
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:44,080
The user's browser stores the cookie and
includes it in subsequent requests so

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,440
that the server knows that
these new requests are related.

11
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,270
For example, they belong to
the same user login session.
