00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:05,730
Analogy is often considered to be a core process of cognition. A common example

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,680
of analogy we encounter everyday is that of metaphors. For example, you can

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:15,030
imagine someone saying, I had to break up with her. We had grown very far apart.

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,300
Far apart here is a spatial metaphor. One of the famous examples

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,410
of metaphors comes from Shakespeare. All the world’s a stage, all the men and

6
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,840
women merely players. The theater here is a metaphor for

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,570
the world. A third connection is the Rubin’s test of intelligence.

8
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,340
The Rubin’s test is considered to be one of the most common and

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,790
reliable test of intelligence, and as you well know by now,

10
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,930
it is based entirely on analogies. An analogy is that central to cognition.
