1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,300
Associated with every linear program
is a so-called dual program,

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,660
which is also a linear program.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,470
This definition is most elegant when
stated in terms of the symmetric form.

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,010
Indeed, now you see why this
form gets the name symmetric.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,490
As we saw in the exercise, the dual
program can be thought of as the problem

6
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,370
of minimizing an upper bound
on the primal program.

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,130
Observe that for all feasible y,

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:31,830
we have that b transposed y
is at least y transposed Ax.

9
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,658
Here we've just used this
constraint here from the primal and

10
00:00:35,658 --> 00:00:39,080
the non-negativity of y from the dual.

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:44,254
And this in turn, is at most cTx,
by the constraints of the dual here,

12
00:00:44,254 --> 00:00:48,380
and the non-negativity
of x in the primal.

13
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,160
In fact,
we just proved the weak duality lemma,

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,120
which states that if x is feasible for
the primal, and y is feasible for

15
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,190
the dual, then cTx is at most, bTy.

16
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:05,447
That is to say, that the value of the
primal is at most the value of the dual.

17
00:01:05,447 --> 00:01:09,669
And this makes sense because we built
the dual as essentially an upper bound

18
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,150
on the primal.

19
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,660
Another thing to note here,
is that if your primal problem

20
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,600
isn't in this exact form,
you can always convert it and

21
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,020
then look at the corresponding dual and
simplify it.

22
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,510
Often, however, it's easier just to
remember that the dual is the problem of

23
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,450
bounding the primal as
tightly as possible.

24
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:31,550
For instance, if we change the primal
inequality to an equality, then we can

25
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:37,390
proceed by the same argument, only this
first inequality becomes an equality.

26
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,300
And I don't have to rely on
the y being non-negative.

27
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,480
Everything else stays the same.
