00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,586
We're usually content with having a 95% confidence interval, but what if we

2
00:00:05,586 --> 00:00:11,006
wanted to be more sure that the population mean was within this interval? So,

3
00:00:11,006 --> 00:00:16,855
what if we wanted a 98% confidence interval? So, let's do the same thing we did

4
00:00:16,855 --> 00:00:22,671
last time. We wanted to first find the z squared values that encompass 98% of

5
00:00:22,671 --> 00:00:30,226
the data. So, I took out all the 1.96 values here, here, and here. So, how bout

6
00:00:30,226 --> 00:00:35,761
you write this z score value here? And remember you're trying to fill in the

7
00:00:35,761 --> 00:00:37,091
blank right here.
