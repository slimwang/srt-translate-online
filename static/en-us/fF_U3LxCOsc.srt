1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,640
At the end of the previous video, we ended at the following iteration.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,620
We arrived at a precisely formulated statistical inference problem.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,550
Specifically, to estimate the number of steps since candy C was chosen.

4
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,560
We will do so using the regression estimator, which uses as features,

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,170
the interselection time of Airheads, Hershey's, Reese's, Kit Kat and Rollo's.

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,150
And we choose a linear model to implement that regression estimator.

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,220
Let's now build that model using IPython Notebook.

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,410
Then in the validation phase, we'll examine how well that model works out.

9
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,220
I've added a link to the IPython Notebook for you to download and follow along.

10
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,880
To use our linear regression model, we first need to prepare our input data.

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,700
Recall that our feature set is the interselection time of each candy type.

12
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:50,220
Thus, each record will have a column for each brand of candy and the value in

13
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,230
each column will be the number of turns since someone selected that type.

14
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:59,390
First, we create a variable called shared state events containing these values.

15
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,500
Then we convert the data to a data frame.

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,540
There are six types of candy and so we have six columns.

17
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,720
We can see that by examining the data frame.

18
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,090
Now, I'm going to use the linear regression implementation for module sklearn.

19
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,230
Feel free to use any module that you'd like.

20
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:17,070
We split our data into features and labels.

21
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,830
And we also split into a training and test set.

22
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,730
We then trained our model and

23
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,090
we can see it resulted in the following coefficients.

24
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,540
This means that the model that we've learned for our aggression estimator, is

25
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,520
the following, just to read it aloud, 0.31 times the interest election time for

26
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,800
airheads, plus 0.07, times Hersey's, plus .15 times kitkat,

27
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,220
plus 0.06 times reese's, plus 0.14 times rollo's, plus a constant.

28
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,040
In our next video, we'll start validating this model.
