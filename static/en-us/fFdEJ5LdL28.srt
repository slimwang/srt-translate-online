1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,570
>> So if you scroll down to the Related List, you'll see that little

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:04,880
Wrench there, and that allows you to

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,990
customize what columns show up in that table.

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,510
>> Okay, so we're on the Stage Record. So what would you

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,490
want, if you're looking at a stage, you'd probably want to know.

6
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,790
>> What band is playing.

7
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,210
>> What band,

8
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,090
>> What time they're playing.

9
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:16,390
>> Yeah.

10
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,980
>> What day they're playing.

11
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:18,500
>> The status.

12
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,970
>> Yeah. So basically all those fields.

13
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,300
>> So Band, Band Name.

14
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,530
>> And you definitely want to leave the Set Time Name

15
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,418
there, even though it's not too useful for

16
00:00:27,418 --> 00:00:29,080
us, because that's going to be what allows

17
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,870
you to click into the Set Time Record itself. It will link you to that record.

18
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:42,638
>> Okay, cool, Save. I knew this time. That is much better. Code

19
00:00:42,638 --> 00:00:46,170
Against the Machine and of course we haven't actually specified a day or time.

20
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,600
>> Right, so, let's go.

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,290
>> Let's do some cleanup.

22
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,780
>> Yeah. Let's go fix the

23
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,910
Set Time Record, add those fields to the

24
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,340
Page Layout, and we're going to have the same problem

25
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,240
with not having a related list on Bands. So,

26
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,920
let's also do this on the Band Record also.

27
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,840
>> Okay, sounds good.
