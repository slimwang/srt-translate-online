00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,700
Okay, sad story time. So, in the early days of

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:08,170
Reddit, I stored passwords in cleartext, because when I was

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,300
writing Reddit, I didn't think anybody would actually use it,

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,980
let alone a lot of people. So, as we grew, I

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,280
had this little bird in my ear telling me, you

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,340
know, this is bad, you should fix this, you should hash

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,020
these passwords. I knew better, but I didn't because we

8
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,950
actually got some benefit out of clear text passwords. When spammers

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,120
would come to Reddit, they would create thousands of accounts, but they

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,436
would use the same password for every account. So I was able to

11
00:00:30,436 --> 00:00:35,280
catch these huge webs of spammers. Now the downside of this, is

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,930
if somebody had stolen my laptop. I'd be in trouble. And sure enough,

13
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,530
somebody stole my laptop, and I had all of Reddit's usernames and

14
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,150
clear text passwords on it, and I got in a lot of trouble

15
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,570
over that. Now, this would've been an easy fix and it turns

16
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,950
out, you know, after that it was an easy fix. We just went

17
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,080
through and hashed all the passwords like we should have,

18
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,120
but it's very important that you, as a developer, take care

19
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,660
of the user's data, because. They use the same password on

20
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,110
lots of sites, they probably don't really know better and, you

21
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,720
know, it's easier for them to be lazy than for you

22
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,140
to be lazy because you can solve it for everybody. So,

23
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,690
always hash your passwords take care of your user's stuff and

24
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,550
you won't regret it like I did once upon a time.
