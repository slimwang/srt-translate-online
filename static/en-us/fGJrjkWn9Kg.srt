1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,210
So this is the Mark IV Special Coffee Maker.

2
00:00:04,554 --> 00:00:08,400
We're going to assume that it is part of a series of coffee makers.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,771
It's the current one but it won't be long before the Mark V is coming out, so we

4
00:00:12,771 --> 00:00:17,144
have to be concerned with you know, the, the whole family of coffee makers and

5
00:00:17,144 --> 00:00:21,710
how things are going to change in the future. The Mark IV makes up to 12 cups of

6
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:26,800
coffee at a time. There's there's a filter that has to be filled with

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,490
coffee ground, and it has to be, the filter has to be slid into its receptacle.

8
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:39,330
The user then supplies some some water in, into the water strainer and

9
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:44,440
presses the Brew button. The water is heated until it's boiling. The pressure of

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,374
the evolving system forces the water to be sprayed over the coffee grounds and

11
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,490
coffee drips through the filter, your standard, standard coffee maker.

12
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:58,600
The pot is kept warm for extended periods by a warmer plate,

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,970
which only turns on if there's coffee in the pot. You don't want that

14
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,890
baking in those grounds and being unable to wash them out in the future.

15
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,010
If the pot is removed from the warmer plate while water is being sprayed over

16
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,040
the grounds, the flow of water is stopped, so

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,170
that brewed coffee does not spill on the warmer plate. Those are our

18
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,930
very high level description of what the Mark IV is supposed to be able to do.
