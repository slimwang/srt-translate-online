00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,610
Now that we've graphed this new line, how should we actually use it? Why do they

2
00:00:04,622 --> 00:00:09,092
want us to do this in the first place? Remember that what we're trying to do in

3
00:00:09,104 --> 00:00:13,357
the end is find out how much Grant will pay to each of these companies if he

4
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:17,892
decides to buy 75 gallons of cleaning solution from them. So should we compare

5
00:00:17,904 --> 00:00:22,359
the line x equals 75? Should we compare the slope of the line, x equals 75, to

6
00:00:22,371 --> 00:00:27,206
the slopes of these other three lines, the x intercept of this vertical line, to

7
00:00:27,218 --> 00:00:31,735
these line's x intercepts? Should we do the same thing with its y intercept

8
00:00:31,747 --> 00:00:36,398
instead? Or should we find out where this line intersects each of these three

9
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:36,758
lines?
