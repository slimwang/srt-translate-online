1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,670
Let's make use of that matrix, all right?

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,870
What does the essential matrix constraints say?

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:13,120
Essential matrix constraints says, that p prime times z times p equals 0.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,530
Where p prime and p are the locations of the points, one in the prime frame and

5
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,110
one in the regular frame.

6
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:20,960
All right.

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,720
So, where are our points P?

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:29,610
Well, it's in some location, cap X, cap Y, cap Z.

9
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:30,180
Okay.

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,670
Which is also, in the other frame, cap X prime, cap Y prime.

11
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,760
Also Z, because the Zs are the same because our planes are parallel, right?

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,480
Right.

13
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,480
So here are our points written.

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,900
And the first time I wrote them as we said before,

15
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,460
p is XYZ, P prime is X prime, Y prime, and the same Z.

16
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,370
But, kind of written kind of cool over here, right?

17
00:00:54,370 --> 00:01:01,020
We assume that under normal projection, little x is f times big X over big Z.

18
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:08,010
So I'm just writing big X as Z times little x divided by f.

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,960
Okay?

20
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,090
And that's how I entered in these things here.

21
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,290
Same thing with the primes over there.

22
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,230
Okay?

23
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:20,778
Let's put those points in our, essential matrix equation.

24
00:01:20,778 --> 00:01:22,928
All right.

25
00:01:22,928 --> 00:01:25,850
So, I've just inserted them here using our e.

26
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:30,040
And now I've done something a little bit sneaky again.

27
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:36,570
So here I have p prime e p, but you'll notice I've now divided

28
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,650
my points all the way through by the, the amount z over f.

29
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:42,370
A constant, right?

30
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:42,930
Z is whatever, s,

31
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,440
something, I don't know what the value is, but it's some constant value, and f,

32
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,150
I don't, might not know what that is, or I might, some value.

33
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,500
And I just divided all the points through by that.

34
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,750
Now, why am I allowed to do that?

35
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,900
See, in class, everybody yell out the answer.

36
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,390
But over the ether.

37
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,220
You guys can't say, because it equals 0, dummy.

38
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,380
All right? So I can multiply anything I want by a constant and

39
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,050
it stays equal to 0, and I just wrote it this way to make it

40
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,660
easier to see the equations that are about to happen.

41
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,900
So I just divided by z over f.

42
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,280
Copy that equation over again, multiply out the first one, so now we have x

43
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:22,880
prime, y prime, f dotted with, or transposed, of 0 bf, minus By equals 0.

44
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,590
Multiply it more again, we get Bfy prime equals Bfy.

45
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,600
B is a constant, f is a constant of divide through, and

46
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,970
it just says y equals y prime.

47
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,280
y equals y prime?

48
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,370
What does that mean?

49
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,380
Oh.

50
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:44,590
That means if I have some point in the image location x y in the regular frame,

51
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:51,990
the line y prime equals y is the line, that this point has to be on.

52
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,350
And think about what this is, so a,

53
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:58,440
a points at x y so it's the sum x location and it's y, let's suppose y is 17.

54
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,380
The equation y prime equals 17 is what.

55
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,390
That's a horizontal line at height 17.

56
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:09,040
So what this says is, our epipolar constraint for

57
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,420
parallel cameras, right, is that given a point in the image,

58
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,210
the corresponding point is on the same horizontal line.

59
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:20,220
Except last time, I just had to make you believe me.

60
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,115
In fact, you didn't even ask the question, because it's very quiet in here,

61
00:03:24,115 --> 00:03:28,840
but, it made common sense that if these cameras were lined up it

62
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,120
should be at the same line.

63
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,670
Well, common sense doesn't get you very far in mathematics.

64
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:38,870
Here is the derivation, if you will, that from parallel planes you can

65
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,335
lined up this way, that your epipolar lines are horizontal.

66
00:03:42,335 --> 00:03:46,090
'Kay? So the answer to that previous quiz of, does this work for

67
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,060
parallel planes?

68
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,950
It works beautifully, actually.

69
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,680
The rotation matrix is just the identity and

70
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,930
it derives out that your epipolar lines are in this cast the horizon,

71
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,030
the parallel horizontal lines at the same height.

72
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,530
Cool huh?
