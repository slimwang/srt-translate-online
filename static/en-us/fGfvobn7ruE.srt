00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,830
In our previous lesson,

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:06,250
we got an overview of the iterative QMV process of analysis.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:11,380
And how it can be described as a way to go about solving data modeling problems.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,940
In this lesson, we dive deep into a specific problem.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,630
We devote the entire lesson to understanding an individual's Twitter usage

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,750
pattern and how it is influenced by the relationships as well as other factors.

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,260
This lesson is all about the impact of data and how the quality and

8
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,730
quantity of data can impact the models we build.

9
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,380
We try to gain a sense of how much data is enough to

10
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,890
say something with any accuracy.

11
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:39,640
Once we've got data we can use, we think about how to determine what to

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,910
pay attention to within data, otherwise known as the feature selection problem.

13
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,620
Lastly, once we know what to pay attention to,

14
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,100
we learn how to detect certain kinds of structure that may exist in our data,

15
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,870
and what types of models are motivated by them.
