1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,990
The correct answer and again, this might be a little bit subjective,

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,500
but I think in this case it's not very subjective.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:15,220
Is showing tractability is actually easier than showing intractability, and the reason for that is

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:21,360
that if you want to show that a problem has a polynomial time algorithm,

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,980
then all you need to do is come up with that algorithm.

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,050
Now, that might be very hard, but nevertheless, once you have found a single algorithm

7
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,140
for a problem that has polynomial running time, then you're done.

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,150
You have shown that this problem is tractable.

9
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:38,810
On the other hand, if you want to show that a problem is intractable--what you have to show is

10
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:43,120
any possible algorithm, so not only the algorithms that you can come up with,

11
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:49,070
not only the algorithms that somebody else can come up--any algorithm that somebody

12
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:55,040
could come up with at any point in time must still have exponential running time.

13
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:01,020
Just stating a single algorithm or even a hundred algorithms is not enough to show intractability.

14
00:01:01,020 --> 99:59:59,999
For that reason, I think show intractability is in a way much easier than showing intractability.
