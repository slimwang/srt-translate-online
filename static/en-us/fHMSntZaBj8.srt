00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In fact, in English--and in fact, in Greek--there is a particular form of word play

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
called syllepsis, based on exploiting this semantic incongruity.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Let me give you an example of what it looks like in natural language,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and then we'll bring it back to HTML.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
In this fragment: "she made no reply, up her mind, and a dash for the door"

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
"made" is being applied to three different things--replies,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
make up a mind, and make a dash for some location.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And it means something slightly different in each of these.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Making a reply means to speak.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Making up your mind means to decide something.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And making a dash for the door means to run for the exit.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
But because we have this one function, if you'll permit me,

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
being applied to these three different types of arguments,

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
there's an incongruity which some may find humorous.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Here's perhaps my favorite example from the same source.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
"She lowered her standards by raising her glass, her courage,

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
her eyes, and his hopes."

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This is a very good but very disconcerting poem

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and a lovely example of syllepsis.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Lowered is being applied to standards;

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
that means to give up your ideals or try something worse.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Raising her glass, as if in a toast.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Raising her courage--to muster up her willpower.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Raising her eyes to look up at someone.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And raising his hopes because, well, nothing good happens in this poem.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Similarly, there's an error in HTML known as mismatched tags.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We talked about balanced parentheses in parsing--

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
the same number of As followed by the same number of Bs,

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
or the same number of open parentheses followed by

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
the same number of closed parentheses.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Recall that that's not something we can do with regular languages

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
or regular expressions, but we can capture it with a context-free grammar.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
However, we didn't handle it in our parser,

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
so we must handle it now.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This concept is not particularly tricky,

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
but it does require a context-free grammar.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So just to make sure that we're all on the same page,

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
there's a bit of a quiz.

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I have written three HTML fragments,

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
but I've left some things blank.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What I would like you to do is fill in each blank with the word

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
necessary for each fragment alone to be well-balanced HTML,

43
00:02:12,000 --> 99:59:59,999
to have its tags match up perfectly.
