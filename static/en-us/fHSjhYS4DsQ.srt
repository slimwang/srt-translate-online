1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,781
So now we know that we can pull out an x squared from the first two terms. And

2
00:00:03,781 --> 00:00:07,626
when we do that, we need to multiply it by two more terms in here. So that when

3
00:00:07,626 --> 00:00:11,795
we redistribute the multiplication, we end up with what we started with. So what

4
00:00:11,795 --> 00:00:15,856
I'd like you to do now, is fill in what belongs in each set of parenthesis here.

5
00:00:15,856 --> 00:00:19,954
Now that we've pulled out our greatest common factors of x squared for the first

6
00:00:19,954 --> 00:00:22,044
pair, and 3 for the second pair of terms.
