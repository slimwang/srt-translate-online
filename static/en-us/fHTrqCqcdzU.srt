00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,160
The most important resources in a computer are space

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,700
and time. Space in memory for storage, and time

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,290
on central processing unit for computation. We may tend

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,470
to think about these things separately, but there are important

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,570
interactions between the two. And just as understanding the

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,600
relationship between space and time is important for any good

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,535
physicist. Understanding the relationship between efficient use of memory

8
00:00:22,535 --> 00:00:24,910
and then the CPU, is important for any good program.

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,500
This interaction will be the subject of this lesson, as we

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,119
look at cache systems and that all important abstraction of virtual memory.
