00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,402
So far in this lesson, we've talked about different types of memory as well as

2
00:00:03,402 --> 00:00:08,073
different ways of forgetting and memory loss. But, in this next section, we're

3
00:00:08,073 --> 00:00:11,013
going to switch gears and we're going to talk about the role the brain plays in

4
00:00:11,013 --> 00:00:15,620
remembering and forgetting. So, the biological basis of memory. We know that

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,755
our long-term memory start with our sensations. And those are processed and

6
00:00:19,755 --> 00:00:23,235
output with our cortical sensory association areas, such as our visual

7
00:00:23,235 --> 00:00:27,237
association or auditory association areas, and that different brain regions are

8
00:00:27,237 --> 00:00:31,490
involved in different types of memory systems.
