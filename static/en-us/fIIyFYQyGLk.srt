00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,969
So Matt, why is interactivity so important for data visualization?

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:07,840
>> We think it's really important because it lets you understand a lot more

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,600
about the actual data that's shown in a graph.

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:17,010
So instead of not being able to see what the actual name or

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,550
object or company that you're looking at in a graph is, if you have, let's say,

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,770
text on the hover, and the ability to zoom and toggle.

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,180
You can really explore the graph and the data further.

8
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:33,080
So we actually have an example here that shows why this works pretty well.

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,300
So here we can see four degrees of data about this graph.

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,080
So across the x axis we see per capita GDP in various countries.

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,570
And across the y axis we see life expectancy in years for folks who live there.

12
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,340
And we can do things like pull this up and

13
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,490
down, we can zoom in and check out the bubbles themselves.

14
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,270
And what you can see here beyond the actual X and

15
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:59,880
Y axis is the bubbles are sized for the population of a country.

16
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,340
And they're colored for the continent.

17
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,129
And so you can see in the legend here the different clusters based on

18
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:06,070
the continents that they're a part of.

19
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:10,000
And so by being able to see more than just the normal x and

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,790
y plotting, you can see things about clusters of continents, for example.

21
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,360
If like here, you can see.

22
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,220
These are mostly continents that are, or countries that are in Africa.

23
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,900
And then up here, you have more of a concentration the Americas and Europe.

24
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,040
And then also, by being able to, by it being web-based,

25
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,630
we can do things like embed live graphs or live links into it.

26
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,790
So you can link back to the source of the,

27
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,390
of data if you'd like to show where it comes from.

28
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,910
We can also show the actual data behind the graph.

29
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,220
So any time you make a graph,

30
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,940
you don't have to worry about whether your data's lost.

31
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,690
And then we can actually show the code for it.

32
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:48,660
So you can see how to remake that from different programming languages.

33
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,890
And so the fun thing is then once you've made that graph you don't just have to

34
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,170
share it at a link here, though you can.

35
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,430
You can actually just put it in iframes.

36
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,870
And so it, you can then just put this on to a website so

37
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,520
other folks can also get that same interactive experience.
