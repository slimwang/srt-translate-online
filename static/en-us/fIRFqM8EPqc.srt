1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,176
So lets say we have a width of a hundred inches and each of these tiles is five

2
00:00:04,176 --> 00:00:10,470
by five inches. Note that except for the first tile, the others come in pairs.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:15,329
Each pair is ten inches long. So if I take my width, subtract the 5 inches here

4
00:00:15,329 --> 00:00:23,258
then I have 95 inches left and how many 10 inch pairs can I put in there? But

5
00:00:23,258 --> 00:00:29,732
if divide 95 by 10, that's 9.5. I discard the remainder, so I know I have nine

6
00:00:29,732 --> 00:00:37,848
pairs, and the white one for a total of 19 tiles, 10 white, and 9 red. Great,

7
00:00:37,848 --> 00:00:42,604
that's my answer in this particular instance. Now the next step is to figure it

8
00:00:42,604 --> 00:00:46,980
out for arbitrary values after which and the tile sides
