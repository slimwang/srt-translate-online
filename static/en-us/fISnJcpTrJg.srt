1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So now we come to the last problem of unit 6 and actually the last problem for entire course

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
aside from the final exam at least.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Now you have a chance to put together all of the informations that we gave you in unit 6

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
to create a 2-D wild fire.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We're going to be looking at a big grid of forest and seeing how diffusion, heat loss, wind,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and combustion come together to affect the time derivative of the temperature.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
As I talked about before, these four factors can simply be added together

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
to show how T changes with time.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Let's look at the code for a second to figure out what are we going to ask you to do.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
As you can see, they've given you a number of different constants

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
that are going to help you out a lot.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
One thing that's kind of a small detail that maybe interesting to know

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
is that the velocity due to the wind, which we can see right here, is actually very low.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's much lower than the velocity of the wind itself since the fire is only going to follow the wind

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
at a fraction of the wind's real speed.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
As I said earlier, your first task is going to be to take into account heat diffusion,

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
heat loss, wind, and combustion in the 2-D heat equation right here.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Fortunately, we're not going to ask you to use the implicit method that you used in homework 1.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You can just use the explicit method you used before so basically the forward Euler method.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And important thing that we need to deal within this problem is especially the varying conditions.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We must be careful to not introduce any hard edges anywhere, or they will probably lead to artifact.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
First in the solver to the huge values in the derivative and second in terms of the model itself.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We want to make sure that we don't see any staircases or pixelated contours

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
or really anything that does not look like reality.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
To help deal with this, we have already included a smooth calcium bell shaped

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
for the initial distribution of the temperature.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The second thing that you need to do, however, is to create an initial distribution for the wood density.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Now, I'll give you a little bit more information about that right now.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Remember the grid that we're creating using the code

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
is basically making a map of the terrain that we're looking at.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This graph right here is going to give you an idea

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
of what we are looking for in terms of wood density distribution.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Now here we have a bunch of lines that are parallel to one another but slightly displaced.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
X and y are actually just the physical coordinates that we are looking at.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But the different colors of the different lines correspond

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
to changes in the wood density at each location.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So every point along the blue line is going to have the same density as every other point on that line.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Every point on this purple line has the same density and so on and so forth.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
In the code, we created 2 constants for you, wood 1 and wood 2 which have underscores in the code.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That would be very clear what they are referring to.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
In this mark out, the highest and the lowest possible values of wood density that we have in our forest.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Now, all of these lines are parallel to one another, and we've given you the slope and the code.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That means that the only factor differentiating from one another is their y intercepts.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
If you make a graph of wood density versus y intercept to make something looks like this.

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You can see that we are only letting wood density vary between wood 1 and wood 2, right here.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Another hint that might be helpful when you're doing this problem

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
is that you can solve for the y intercept of given line by saying that

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
the y intercept equals some y value minus the slope times the x value of that point.

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So it's kind of a tricky problem but remember it's your very last one before the final.

50
00:03:13,000 --> 99:59:59,999
If you have any trouble, come to forums. Good luck.
