00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,399
We're going to go deeper into understanding the shapes of distributions.

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,091
Interactivate has its own data sets that you can play around with, so let's

3
00:00:11,103 --> 00:00:15,968
check out Body Fat percentage of 252 Men. Here, you can see that it looks like

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:22,471
it has on peak, pretty much right in the middle. And if we change the shape of

5
00:00:22,483 --> 00:00:30,176
the distribution, you can see it always peaks about here. At maybe 21% body fat.

6
00:00:30,325 --> 00:00:38,155
Again, sometimes when the bin size is too small, you can see it's really, really

7
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:44,555
small Then, there's a little too much detail. And when the interval size is too

8
00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:50,805
big, there's not enough detail. This is probably a pretty good bin size around

9
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:56,835
this area. Let's stop at about here with the bin size 2.662. Now, let's take a

10
00:00:56,847 --> 00:00:57,220
quiz.
