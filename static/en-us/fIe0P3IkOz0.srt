1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,560
Let's go through how to create
a minimal Android Auto compatible app

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,650
that implements all of
this functionality.

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,350
We will be able to put all of
the code into a single file

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:10,230
to give you a nice concise walk-through.

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,980
Let's create a new project from scratch.

6
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,090
So go to File, New Project and
give it a name of something like this,

7
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:20,980
MinimalAutoMedia, and
create it in an appropriate location.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,730
Next.

9
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,950
Make sure just the Phone and

10
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,380
Tablet option is checked and
everything else should be off.

11
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,410
And for the API level,
select API 21 or later.

12
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,730
This is when the media
API was introduced.

13
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:32,720
Click Next.

14
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,490
Select a default blank activity.

15
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:35,750
Next again.

16
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,350
You can leave the activity and
layout names at the defaults.

17
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,980
Click Finish and
Android Studio will create the project.

18
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,080
We need to declare an XML file that
will contain Android auto information.

19
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,720
So let's open up the Android manifesto
XML and lets add something inside

20
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,750
the application tag but
not inside the activity.

21
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,495
You can see here we're
defining something for

22
00:00:54,495 --> 00:00:57,870
com.google.android.gms.car.application
and

23
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,950
we're specifying an external
place to find it.

24
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,050
Now we need to create
the referenced file.

25
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,367
So we go to RES, and
you won't have an XML directory.

26
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:08,835
So create that by right-clicking, new,

27
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:12,798
directory, type the word XLM,
and then hit OK.

28
00:01:12,798 --> 00:01:14,569
You'll notice that I had to collapse and

29
00:01:14,569 --> 00:01:17,700
then expand the RES directory
to make the XML folder visible.

30
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,140
Right click on that directory and
select new, file, and

31
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,970
type in this name,
automotive_app_desk.xml.

32
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:26,800
And hit okay.

33
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,780
Inside this file you need
to declare support for

34
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,550
media with some XML like this.

35
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,370
And if we go back to
our Android manifest,

36
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,640
you can see that this is now green.
