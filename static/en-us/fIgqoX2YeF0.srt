We can rewrite this first term, natural log of 4x minus 6 to the 1 half, using

2
00:00:04,551 --> 00:00:10,448
the power property. That tells us that this is equal to 1 half times the

3
00:00:10,448 --> 00:00:17,008
natural log of 4x minus 6. That means having started off with the natural log

4
00:00:17,008 --> 00:00:22,216
of the square root of 4x minus 6 over 3, we've expanded this to equal 1 half ln

5
00:00:22,216 --> 00:00:27,420
of 4x minus 6, minus ln of 3. Awesome!
