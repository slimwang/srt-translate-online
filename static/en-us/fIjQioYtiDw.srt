Well, I can think of at two reasons why my

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:06,000
computer science professor from college may be upset with the quality

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,810
of this code. The first is that I'm doing something

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:13,090
repetitive inside my code. Things like move forward, turn right, move

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,860
forward, turn right. I do that four times, but I

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,310
don't use any sort of a loop. Another reason is that

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,570
the name of my function is draw_square. Which I do.

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,650
But then I go ahead and draw a circle inside that

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,190
function also. That doesn't seem quite logical to me.

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,310
So, based on those two ideas, what changes would you

11
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,450
make to the code that we've written thus far

12
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,300
to make it more usable? I want you to make

13
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,420
those changes and then upload a screenshot of the

14
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,700
code to the discussion forum. Here's an extra credit assignment,

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,510
which is to create a third turtle, and this one

16
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,640
will draw a triangle. Once you are done with that,

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,650
I want you to upload a screenshot of the new output to the discussion

18
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,940
forum. Make sure you check this box

19
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,920
after you've submitted your responses to the forum.
