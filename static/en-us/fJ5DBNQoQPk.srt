00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,804
This function, y equals one half to the x minus 3 power is identical to this

2
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:12,100
one, but it shifted 3 units to the right. Now, I knew that shift needed to

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:16,580
happen, because here we have the point 0,1 and to transform 0,1 to 3,1, we just

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:23,526
need to move 3 to the right. A shift of 3 units to the right means replacing x

5
00:00:23,526 --> 00:00:29,386
with x minus 3, which is exactly what's happening here. Awesome. It looks like

6
00:00:29,386 --> 00:00:32,914
you can transform exponential functions just like you can any other kind of

7
00:00:32,914 --> 00:00:37,206
function. The strategies we learned, many lessons ago, are going to be just as

8
00:00:37,206 --> 00:00:40,356
applicable here, as they were for every other kind of function we've worked

9
00:00:40,356 --> 00:00:45,312
with. That's really convenient.
