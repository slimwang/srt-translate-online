1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,440
The next step is to configure
the system to use the sign in API.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,030
When you've signed into your project,

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:10,390
as you can see here, select the APIs and
off link on the left.

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,074
Once you've done that, select APIs.

5
00:00:12,074 --> 00:00:18,150
Under the APIs, you'll then need to
find the Google+ API and enable it.

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,610
Once its enabled, you can then go to
the consent screen link on the left.

7
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,400
You might be familiar with the consent
screen from signing into apps, and

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,580
you can see an example
here on the right.

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,530
To build one of these, the least that
you have to configure is an email

10
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:37,470
address, so I'm just going to
put mine in, and a product name.

11
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,799
I'm just going to call mine Signin1_1.

12
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,150
Once you've done that,
scroll down and click Save.

13
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:50,640
Finally, under the Credential's link,
I'm going to create a new client ID, and

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,280
I'm going to select this to be
an installed application for Android.

15
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,590
I need to give it a package name and
you have to remember this package name.

16
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,260
You'll need it in the next step as
you're building your application.

17
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,160
I'm going to call it
com.udacity.firstsignin.

18
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,630
And then you need your certificate
fingerprint, your SHA1.

19
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:12,300
Now this is what you got
in the terminal earlier on.

20
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,870
So, if I go back to my terminal,
I've highlighted my SHA1.

21
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:20,040
I'm going to copy it and then I'm
going to go back to the console.

22
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,570
And in the console I'm
going to paste that.

23
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,690
Then finally, I'm going to
leave Deep linking disabled and

24
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:27,840
create a new client ID.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,890
So, we'll take a moment to
create the client ID And

26
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,030
you can see it's up here now.

27
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,420
So now, any application trying
to sign into the infrastructure,

28
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,140
the package name will be
checked against what's allowed.

29
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:44,270
And if I build an application called
com.udacity.firstsignin on the machine

30
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,590
with this fingerprint, then that
application will be able to sign in.

31
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:52,010
If I run that code on a different
machine, it won't sign in.

32
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,470
I would have to create a new client
ID for that Android application

33
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,230
with a certificate fingerprint
from the other machine.

34
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,260
This is one of the limitations that
you'll get when your debugging.

35
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,460
So sometimes you'll have
problems when you sign in and

36
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:07,120
it doesn't appear to work, and that's
usually the case of what's happened.

37
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,070
So next up,
your going to create a project and

38
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,780
your going to configure it to use this.
