00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,680
The most commonly used symmetric
encryption algorithms are the so

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,980
called block ciphers.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,660
A block cipher takes as input
a plaintext in fixed sized blocks, and

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:16,140
it produces a block of ciphertext of
equal size, for each plain text block.

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:21,130
To process a longer plain text, we can
first break the plain text into a series

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:25,990
of fixed size blocks, and then,
apply block ciphers to each block.

7
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,330
The most important symmetric algorithms,

8
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:33,310
all of which are block ciphers, are the
data encryption standard, or DES, and

9
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:36,840
the advanced encryption standard or AES.

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,740
We will present more technical details
of these algorithms in a later lecture.

11
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:46,160
For now, we note that these two
different algorithms have different

12
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,690
block sizes and key length.

13
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,070
We call that, a longer key length
means that there are more keys.

14
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:58,380
As a result, a brute force attack has
to do more work to try all the keys.

15
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,820
This table shows how
much time is required for

16
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,910
brute force attack for
various key lengths.

17
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:08,810
As we can see in the table,
DES user key length of 56.

18
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:13,730
And a number of possible keys,
is 2 to the 56th.

19
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:17,820
If a single personal computer is
used to try all the possible keys,

20
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,380
it takes about a year.

21
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,550
If multiple PCs, for example, tens of
thousands of PCs, work in parallel,

22
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,086
then the time is drastically shortened.

23
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:31,480
And today's super computers should be
able to try all the possible keys,

24
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,390
using DES, in an hour.

25
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:39,210
Key sizes of 128 bits or greater
are effectively unbreakable using,

26
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,810
simply, brute force methods.

27
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:47,040
For example, even with a super computer,
it would take 10 to 17 years,

28
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,280
to try all the possible keys using AES.
