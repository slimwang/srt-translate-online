00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,530
Try multiplying these two fractions together. You'll want to factor the

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:08,287
numerators and denominators first, and then, cancel any factors that reduce to

3
00:00:08,287 --> 00:00:12,833
one. Write your answer here and leave it in factored form. For example, if your

4
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:16,373
fraction multiplies to this, you don't want to multiply your two factors

5
00:00:16,373 --> 00:00:18,983
together in the numerator. Just leave them factored.
