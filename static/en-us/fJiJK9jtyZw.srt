00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,775
For color textures, we saw that MIP mapping improved the quality of the images

2
00:00:03,775 --> 00:00:07,800
produced. Noisy patterns were blurred out. Normal maps can suffer the same

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,300
sorts of problems with noisy sparkles twinkling on and off as we happen to

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,160
catch a normal that reflects light directly to our eye. Say we use MIP mapping

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,640
on the normal map here to avoid this problem. These bumps describe two ridges.

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,634
We average neighboring shading normals to get the next level up. The topmost

7
00:00:23,634 --> 00:00:26,900
MIP map will be a single normal that's the average of all the normals at the

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,380
bottom. So, if the object is far enough away, and this topmost level is used,

9
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,990
it will not look bumpy at all. What happens when the surface is far enough away

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,809
that MIP level one is used? The ridges disappear, the ridges become twice as

11
00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:43,280
high, the ridges become half as high, or the ridges reverse their directions?
