1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,816
So, we know that this equation describes this circle. The distance from the

2
00:00:05,816 --> 00:00:10,910
center of the circle to any point on the circle will always be 50 centimeters.

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:15,798
And that should make sense, because that's the length of our string. No matter

4
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:19,214
where the end of the string is, we know that the distance from the origin to

5
00:00:19,214 --> 00:00:24,590
the circle is 50 centimeters. Now, this distance is always constant and it's

6
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:29,585
called the radius of the circle. So in this case, the length of the string is

7
00:00:29,585 --> 00:00:32,433
the radius and it's 50 centimeters.
