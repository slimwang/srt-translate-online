00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,860
We've seen two methods for expanding
our ability to do segmentation.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,150
One was the new method,
the new algorithm of finding modes

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,340
within some feature space and that,
and it was you know, didn't require

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,070
you to know the number of modes to begin
with, and all those other properties.

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,260
And then in some sense, more
importantly, no not more importantly,

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,550
in addition, we found a way of expanding
our feature space to include something

7
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,280
that describes texture.

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,455
And what you did was you created
a big t, feature vector,

9
00:00:28,455 --> 00:00:31,748
texture feature vector at every point,
and

10
00:00:31,748 --> 00:00:36,667
you would cluster that to get
these keywords or these textons.

11
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:39,625
And then you would, for every region,
you would get a histogram.

12
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,989
And then you would cluster based
upon those histograms, and

13
00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:43,740
that's what gave you your segments.

14
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,860
Combined, these gives us
a pretty powerful method.
