1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,220
Both the price and appearance of our
offer would be good to change and

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,535
test for the price and

3
00:00:06,535 --> 00:00:10,070
A/B test could let's compare how
many people buy a new character.

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,480
That's 199 versus just 99 cents.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,380
And another A/B test would be
useful to test appearance.

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,970
We could change the size and
color of the offer.

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,140
Or even change the character
completely and

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,590
see which design gets the most clicks.

9
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,210
The age of our players is not something
we can quickly change and test.

10
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,730
And A/B tests give you
the most detailed feedback

11
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,170
when you use them to focus on
improving one variable at a time.

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,200
So these answers are wrong.
