00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,130
Since we're talking about
the trickiness of RPC calls,

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:06,910
let's also talk about errors in
fault handling and reporting.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,370
When the client hangs while waiting
on a remote procedure call,

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,410
it is often hard to take
what exactly is the problem?

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,700
The server can be overloaded, the client
request may be lost, the response may be

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,600
lost, the server machine may have
crashed, or the server process may have

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,540
crashed, or some element in the network,
some switch or router may be down.

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,570
Even if the RPC runtime incorporates
some mechanisms that time out

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,915
whenever a client RPC call hangs,
and then retries them automatically.

10
00:00:35,915 --> 00:00:40,210
They're really no guarantees that the
problem will be resolved or that the RPC

11
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:44,510
runtime will be able to provide some
better understanding of what's going on.

12
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:49,070
And potentially, for some cases, it is
possible to really understand what is

13
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,658
the cause of the error, but
in principle that is too complex.

14
00:00:52,658 --> 00:00:55,440
It would have involve a lot of overhead,
and ultimately,

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,910
it's still unlikely that it will
provide a definitive answer.

16
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:03,343
For this reason IPC systems typically
try to introduce a new type of error

17
00:01:03,343 --> 00:01:08,015
notification or a new type of signal or
exception that tries to capture what

18
00:01:08,015 --> 00:01:12,690
went wrong with an RPC request without
claiming to provide the exact detail.

19
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,920
This serves as a catch all for
all types of errors,

20
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,320
all types of failures that can
potentially happen during an RPC call.

21
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,540
And it also can potentially
indicate a partial failure,

22
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,140
so maybe the call really
didn't quite fail,

23
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,770
it's just that the client doesn't
know what succeeded and what failed.
