00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,994
this is the equation that we can write. If we add the amount of time to go

2
00:00:03,994 --> 00:00:09,019
upstream, the amount of time to go downstream. That should sum to our total

00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:13,180
time which is 16 15th hours. Nice work if you figured that out.
