00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,410
There are three statements here that are true.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:08,780
The first one is true because f(n) clearly grow slower than g(n),

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:14,300
so g(n) grows at least as fast as f(n).

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,900
The second one is also true because h(n) grows even faster, so it outgrows f(n) also.

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:25,320
The f(n) here is the slowest growing function, so it does not outgrown g(n),

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,190
but h(n) on the other hand that is the fastest growing function so it does outgrow g(n).

7
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,640
This one here is true also, and since h(n) is the fastest growing function,

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,000
it's neither in O(f(n)) or in O(g(n)).

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,220
You can see the slowest growing function is always contained in O of the two

10
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,790
faster-growing functions and the fastest growing function is not contained in

11
00:00:49,790 --> 99:59:59,999
either O(f(n)) or O(g(n)), which are growing slower.
