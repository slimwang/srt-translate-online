1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I would call this Deformation Invariance

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
because the object is actually deformable

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
as our many objects that surround us,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
like clothes and dollar bills and water glasses.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This kind of deformation is really important in the recognition of objects.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You wish to make sure that a helicopter can be recognized,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,999
no matter what angle it's rotor blades currently have.
