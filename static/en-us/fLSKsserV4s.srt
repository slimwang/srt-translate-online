00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,850
If you have followed
everything in the lesson so

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:05,660
far, then you are ready to understand
NP completeness, an idea behind

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,650
some of the most fascinating structure
in the P versus NP question.

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,860
You may have heard optimists say that
they are only one algorithm away

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,360
from proving that P is equal to NP.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,910
What they mean is that if we could
solve just one NP complete problem

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,870
in polynomial time, then we could
solve all of them in polynomial time.

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,230
Here's why.

9
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:29,697
Formally, we say that a language
L is NP-complete if L is in NP,

10
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:35,896
and if every other language in NP can
be reduced to it in polynomial time.

11
00:00:35,896 --> 00:00:39,763
Recalling our picture of P and
NP from the beginning of the lesson,

12
00:00:39,763 --> 00:00:43,730
the NP complete problems were
the ones at the very top.

13
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,710
And we called them
the hardest problems in NP.

14
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,270
We can't have anything higher that's
still in NP, because if it's in NP,

15
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,500
then it can be reduced to
an NP complete problem.

16
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:00,760
Also, if any one of the NP complete
problems were shown to be in P

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,470
then P would extend up and
swallow all of NP.

18
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,660
It's not immediately obvious that
an NP complete problem even exists.

19
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,790
But it turns out that there are lots
of them and in fact they seem to

20
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,060
occur more often in practice than
the problems in this intermediate zone

21
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,690
which are not NP complete and so
far have not proved to be an NP either.

22
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:24,710
Historically, the first natural to
be proofed to be NP-complete is

23
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,840
boolean formula satisfiability,
or SAT for short.

24
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,110
This was shown to be NP-complete
by Stephen Cook in 1971 and

25
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,680
independently by Leonid Levin in
the Soviet Union around the same time.

26
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,520
The fact that this problem is
NP-complete is extremely powerful,

27
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,150
because once you have one NP-complete
problem, you just need to reduce it

28
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:50,600
to other problems to show that they,
too, are NP-complete.

29
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,680
Thus, much of the theory of complexity
can be said to rest on this theorem.

30
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,450
This is the high point of
our study of complexity.

31
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,210
So what exactly is this
satisfiability problem?
