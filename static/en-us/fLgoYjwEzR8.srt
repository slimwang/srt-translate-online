00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,195
We know one way to articulate what we do to find the slope of a line, but there

2
00:00:04,207 --> 00:00:08,495
are definitely other ways that we can think about this as well. Please pick the

3
00:00:08,507 --> 00:00:12,775
best one of these choices. When we try to find the slope of a line, do we divide

4
00:00:12,787 --> 00:00:17,015
the x coordinate by the y coordinate, divide the increase in x by the increase

5
00:00:17,027 --> 00:00:21,330
in y, divide the increase in y by the increase in x, or multiply the increase in

6
00:00:21,342 --> 00:00:22,500
y by the increase in x?
