1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,620
Here our solution is plus or minus three i an imaginary solution, pretty cool.

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,570
We take the square root of both sides to get x is equal to plus or minus the

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:13,802
square root of negative nine. Now we've simplified this radical and remember

4
00:00:13,802 --> 00:00:19,230
that negative square roots, need to be simplified using i. We can break this

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,670
radical down into the square root of 9 times the square root of negative 1.

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,071
Then we replace the square root of negative 1 with i. We can also check our

7
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:33,834
result. We know the answers are not 3 and negative 3. Since 3 squared would

8
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:38,528
equal positive 9 not negative 9. Also at negative 3 squared would be positive

9
00:00:38,528 --> 00:00:42,672
9. Not negative nine like we want in our equation. So since these answers are

10
00:00:42,672 --> 00:00:48,020
out, lets make sure the plus or minus 3i works in our equation. I'm going to

11
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,554
check our positive 3i here in this equation and our negative 3i here in this

12
00:00:51,554 --> 00:00:56,741
equation. When we square the quantity of 3i, we get 3 squared which is 9 and i

13
00:00:56,741 --> 00:01:03,078
squared. When we square negative 3i negative 3 times negative 3 is positive 9,

14
00:01:03,078 --> 00:01:08,410
and i squared is i squared. And remember back from before, i squared equals

15
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:12,990
negative 1. So we can substitute that in here. This effectively changes the

16
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:18,052
sign of these terms. This gives us a check of negative 9 equal to negative 9 in

17
00:01:18,052 --> 00:01:23,100
both cases. So we could be confident knowing that our answers are correct.
