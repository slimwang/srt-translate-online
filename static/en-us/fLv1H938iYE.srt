1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,990
Now lets talk through the choices I've given you. yes, the operating system is a

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:11,710
resource manager. It is the boss in control of the hardware resources. So that's

3
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,610
a functionality that you do expect from

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,830
the operating system. Yes, the operating system -

5
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,190
Is the entity that provides a consistent

6
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:26,180
interface to the hardware resource. Remember earlier lecture

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,740
on obstructions, I mentioned that operating system is

8
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:33,210
a level in the obstruction hierarchy sitting between the

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,144
application and the processor and the other resources

10
00:00:37,144 --> 00:00:40,310
and so in this sense, the operating system should

11
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,910
be the entity that provides a consistent interface

12
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,040
to the hardware resources such as CPU, memory, and

13
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,910
io devices. So yes, the second choice is

14
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,220
a good one in terms of functionality, that you

15
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,290
would expect from an operating system. The

16
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:57,540
third choice says the operating systems schedules applications

17
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,720
on the CPU. This also seems like a

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,270
think that the operating system should do because

19
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,020
there could be multiple applications that require

20
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,790
these resources and therefore their has to be

21
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,700
an arbitor that is going to provide a

22
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,340
way of scheduling. Those requests on the hardware

23
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,830
devices and therefore yes. The operating system

24
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,920
is an entity that schedules applications on

25
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,130
top of the CPU. The last choice

26
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,800
says the operating system stores personal information

27
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,940
such as credit card numbers, social security

28
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,400
number and email addresses. Now this looks

29
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,600
like something that you wouldn't have want

30
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,290
the operating system to do. And these are,

31
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,570
these are personal information and you would

32
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,020
not want the operating system to store such

33
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,970
information, and therefore this is not a

34
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,680
functionality that you expect of the operating system.

35
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,780
So the first three choices are the right choices. The operating system is not an

36
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,020
entity that should be storing your personal information

37
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,590
such as credit card numbers and so on.
