00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,380
We first add the user class to
the models.py file, like shown here.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,100
Functions to hash and
verify a password are also provided.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,930
Now, in the views.py file,
we will add the logic to create users.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,610
I will add the user route so
that it will either create a new user or

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,700
identify an existing one.

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,980
Now I will add
the auth.verify_password decorator.

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,670
So Flask http off knows how
I want to validate my users.

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,160
Once that is done, I can protect
a route like /Bagels with the off.login

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,810
required variable, just like I did here.

10
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,060
With all of the code
modifications in place,

11
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,600
we should now be able to pass all
the tests in our Bagel tester.pie file.

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,370

notes to view this code.
