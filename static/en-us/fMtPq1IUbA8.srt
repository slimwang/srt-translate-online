00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,310
Now that we have a good visual idea
of how our madlib's generator is

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,270
suppose to work.

3
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,635
It's your job to put it in code.

4
00:00:05,635 --> 00:00:10,240
Remember, we already wrote a big piece
of this function by writing code for

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,760
word transformer.

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,360
So, be sure to use that.

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:13,860
Good luck.
