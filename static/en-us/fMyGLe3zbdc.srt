00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:01,920
Welcome to my office.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,939
I thought before we'd start I should
give you some tips on how to do well in

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:07,220
the class.

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,890
Step one is take a look at
the course readiness survey.

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,610
It's the minimum CS and Math-101 that
I think you need to even get started.

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,329
Next, there are these videos.

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,400
The videos are about
building your intuition.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,950
And like other courses in the series,

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,650
there are little quizzes
sprinkled throughout.

10
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,190
I'd advise you not to skip
the quizzes because I like

11
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,080
to stick new concepts there.

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,700
And beyond the videos,
there are readings.

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,760
Where the videos are about
building your intuition,

14
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,760
the readings are about spelling
out all the gory, formal details.

15
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,870
And you're going to need those details
in order to do the mini projects and

16
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,470
the exams.

17
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,292
Finally, there are the mini projects.

18
00:00:47,292 --> 00:00:51,790
The mini projects are about writing real
code because you don't really understand

19
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,610
an algorithm or a data structure until
you've tried to implement it yourself.

20
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,140
Especially, if you're trying to
understand something about engineering

21
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,340
tradeoffs.

22
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,980
Okay, so that's it for kind of
logistics and philosophy of the class.

23
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,860
With that fluffy stuff out of the way,
let's talk HPC.
