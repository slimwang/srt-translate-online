00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,330
Let's look at the solution to this part of

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:05,954
our BTB & BHT quiz. The question now is, which

3
00:00:05,954 --> 00:00:08,528
of the four BTB entries do we use for each

4
00:00:08,528 --> 00:00:12,808
of these instructions? Leave the field blank if none is

5
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:15,365
used. We already know that we use the BTB

6
00:00:15,365 --> 00:00:18,332
once here and a hundred times here, and that's all

7
00:00:18,332 --> 00:00:21,973
of the BTB uses. So the only instructions that we

8
00:00:21,973 --> 00:00:26,120
really need to put something for is this and this.

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:32,073
How do we determine which BTB entry do we use? Well, we look at the address and

10
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:39,813
just the same way that we did it for the BHT, in this case, the address is

11
00:00:39,813 --> 00:00:43,820
C008. The BTB has four entries. We take

12
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,860
the lower most two bits, in this case, because

13
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,230
we need two bits to tell us which of

14
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,275
the four entries. But, we don't use the bits

15
00:00:51,275 --> 00:00:54,778
that are always the same for all instructions. In this case, the lower most

16
00:00:54,778 --> 00:01:01,158
two bits. So, really, this is the number of the BTB entry for the C008

17
00:01:01,158 --> 00:01:08,971
instruction. 10 is 2. So we will use the entry number 2. The other instruction

18
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:15,911
that we need to figure out is at the address C01C. So it's going to

19
00:01:15,911 --> 00:01:21,351
be C01C. Again, ignore the lower most bits that

20
00:01:21,351 --> 00:01:24,519
stay the same. Take the next two bits because

21
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:26,928
we need to know which of the four entries

22
00:01:26,928 --> 00:01:29,775
to use, and we get 11, which corresponds to

23
00:01:29,775 --> 00:01:34,880
the entry number 3. As you can see, only entries number 2 and 3 are used in this

24
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,670
loop. If this instruction were a taken branch, it

25
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:41,004
would have used and entry number 0. This one would

26
00:01:41,004 --> 00:01:43,236
have used 1, 2, 3, and then, because

27
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,716
we have 4 entries, this one, again, would be

28
00:01:45,716 --> 00:01:47,907
using entry number 0, 1, 2, 3. But

29
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:50,326
because these are the only ones that actually use

30
00:01:50,326 --> 00:01:52,037
these entries, all we have to do is

31
00:01:52,037 --> 00:01:54,960
access the entry number 2 here. It's accessed once,

32
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,890
if you remember. And access the entry number 3

33
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,530
here. It's accessed a hundred times, if you remember.
