00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,410
So what makes games different
from other types of apps?

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,610
It's a hard question, because there
are so many different types of games.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,350
But here are a few of the things that
make writing games different from

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,170
writing other types of apps.

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,360
The first thing is that games
are often built around an update loop

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,650
or a game loop.

7
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,465
This is as opposed to an event-based
application where the application

8
00:00:19,465 --> 00:00:22,778
basically sits around not doing
much of anything until the user

9
00:00:22,778 --> 00:00:23,978
provides some input.

10
00:00:23,978 --> 00:00:25,295
Games on the other hand,

11
00:00:25,295 --> 00:00:28,250
are built around a timer that
fires 60 times a second.

12
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,463
When that timer fires,
it means it's time for

13
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:34,092
the game to go look at the user input,
update the state of the game world, and

14
00:00:34,092 --> 00:00:36,610
then draw a new frame to the screen.

15
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,510
This means, games often need to
deal with pulling for user input.

16
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,150
Next, games often involve
a ton of custom drawing.

17
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,120
While you can make an Android
app using entirely off-the-shelf

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,550
user interface components, it's rare
that you can do so with the game.

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,470
You'll have to create your UI and
your game world

20
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:57,450
using either primitive shapes like
lines, rectangles and circles, or your

21
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:02,220
own custom image aspects from pixel art
all the way up to complex characters.

22
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,440
Many games also feature
your special effects and

23
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:09,170
animations which are a ton of fun to
make but also a lot of hard work.

24
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,980
There are whole fields of study
that are much more relevant to

25
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,510
games than other types of
apps like physics and AI.

26
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,820
There's also exotic input
devices to deal with,

27
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,850
like game pad controllers or,
more interestingly for

28
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,270
this class, accelerometers like
the one you've got in your phone.

29
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,700
Finally, my favorite
part of game development

30
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,580
is the fact that you get to
create a lot of objects that have

31
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,150
visible representations
in your game world.

32
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,750
Designing an elegant object
oriented app is a lot more fun,

33
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,280
when your objects can run around
hitting each other with swords.
