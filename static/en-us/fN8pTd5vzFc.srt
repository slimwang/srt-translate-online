00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,430
So if given two images, merging and blending by basically taking the pixels from

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,080
those two signals tacking them on top of each other, and

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,020
then blending the pixels together would be a good solution,

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,530
it's not always the right solution.

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,840
So in this lecture, I will basically introduce, how we can take these two images

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,100
that are on top of each other, and cut one, and the other appropriately so

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,960
you would get the exact pixels from one image and the other, and therefore,

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,490
there is no blending, which basically means there is no ghosting or

9
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,130
blurriness that comes in by doing things like blending.
