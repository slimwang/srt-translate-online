00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,137
Let's say that we have some number, n. And to the left of it on the number line

2
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:08,053
is some number m. We're not exactly sure where it is but we know that it's

3
00:00:08,053 --> 00:00:11,842
located to the left of n on the number line. Which statement then, best

4
00:00:11,842 --> 00:00:14,791
describes the relationship between these two points?
