1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,369
Let's look at an example.

2
00:00:01,369 --> 00:00:04,619
And, for instance, we said one of the responsibilities of

3
00:00:04,619 --> 00:00:07,810
the operating system is to manage resources like memory.

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,400
So, we'll look at a memory management based example.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,219
To do that, the operating system uses a memory page as an abstraction.

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:20,230
And this abstraction corresponds to some addressable region of memory of

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,020
some fixed size, for instance, four k.

8
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:27,290
The operating system also integrates a number of mechanisms to

9
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,390
operate on that page.

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,240
It can allocate that page in DRAM, and

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,010
it can map that page into the address piece of the process.

12
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,420
By doing that it, allows the process to access the actual physical memory that

13
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,690
corresponds to the contents of that page.

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,170
In fact, over time,

15
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:52,860
this page may be moved across different locations in physical memory.

16
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,340
Or, it sometimes may even be stored on disk, if we need to make room for

17
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,070
some other content in physical memory.

18
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:04,769
This last one brings us to the third element, policies.

19
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,900
Since it is faster to access data from memory then on disk,

20
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,630
the operating system must have some policies to decide whether the contents of

21
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:18,820
this page will be stored in physical memory or copied on disk.

22
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,180
And, a common policy that operating systems incorporate is one that decides that

23
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,500
the pages that have been least recently used over a period of time are the ones

24
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,420
that will no longer be in physical memory, and instead will be copied on this.

25
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,390
We refer to this also as swappings.

26
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,490
So, we swap the pages.

27
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,980
It's no longer in physical memory, it's in disk.

28
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:45,320
The rational for that is that pages that have not been accessed in a while, so

29
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,330
the least recently used ones, are likely not to be as important, or

30
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:54,190
likely will not even be used any time in the near future.

31
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,160
And, that's why we can afford to copy them on disk.

32
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,340
The ones that have been accessed more frequently are likely more important, or

33
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,490
likely recurrently working on that particular part of the content, so

34
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,758
we will continue accessing them, and that's why we maintain them in memory.
