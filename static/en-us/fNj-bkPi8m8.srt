1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,867
Here, the correct solutions are positive 3 and positive 6. That's amazing

2
00:00:04,867 --> 00:00:08,527
effort if you got these two solutions. Now, don't worry if you got stuck or

3
00:00:08,527 --> 00:00:13,490
don't quite understand this at all, this is only our first practice problem.

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,838
Maybe you were able to get the substitution of X minus 2, or maybe even found

5
00:00:16,838 --> 00:00:21,392
the values of U. Let's go through the solution together, pause it where you

6
00:00:21,392 --> 00:00:24,272
think you made your first mistake, and then see if you can solve for these

7
00:00:24,272 --> 00:00:29,695
answers. To perform the U-substitution here, we're going to substitute this

8
00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:37,179
repeated expression, x minus 2, with the variable u. So we'll have u squared

9
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:43,950
minus 5 times u plus 4. This is the critical step that turns this equation into

10
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,600
a much easier quadratic equation to factor and solve. We factored this using u

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,626
minus 4 times u minus 1, and then we solve for u. U can equal 4, or u can equal

12
00:00:55,626 --> 00:01:01,990
1. Nice effort if you found these two variables. But remember we're not done.

13
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:06,504
We use the substitution u equals x minus 2 so we need to plug in x minus 2 back

14
00:01:06,504 --> 00:01:13,119
in for u to find the original values of x. So if u equals 4 and u equals 1 then

15
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:19,775
we know x minus 2 must equal 4... And we know x minus 2 must also equal 1. Now

16
00:01:19,775 --> 00:01:23,984
we just add 2 to both sides for each equation to get x equals 6 and x equals 3,

17
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:27,000
our final solution set.
