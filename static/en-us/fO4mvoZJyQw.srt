1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,306
The slope is how many units a line shifts upward for every single unit that it

2
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:08,823
moves to the right. For the segment joining these two points right here, you see

3
00:00:08,835 --> 00:00:13,961
that as we move from one point to the other, we're translating 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

4
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:19,062
horizontally to move five to the right, and then up, 1, 2, 3. The ratio of this

5
00:00:19,074 --> 00:00:23,831
vertical distance traveled versus this horizontal distance travelled is 3 over

6
00:00:23,843 --> 00:00:29,674
5. In the same, way if we look at what happen vertically when we move 1 unit to

7
00:00:29,686 --> 00:00:35,052
the right, we can see that we move up by this distance, which is 3 5th of 1

8
00:00:35,064 --> 00:00:35,429
unit.
