1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,380
When you first start out,
having never created a game before,

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,290
it feels like there's a bunch of stuff
you don't know, you're not doing right,

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:13,020
it's not working out, but games
are really like other forms of art.

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,630
You use the skills you have to
create something for yourself, and

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,970
then you decide when and
if you want to share it with others.

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,990
Some people are comfortable
putting their raw work in progress

7
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,250
right out there.

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,270
Others work privately for years
before publishing their first game.

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,400
As you learn more about how to make
games and you get better at it.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,870
The games you create just naturally
tend to become more sophisticated.

11
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:41,050
Maybe you start with really
rudimentary bad guys, but

12
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,440
then you figure out how to do AI or
pathfinding.

13
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,000
Or maybe at the beginning,

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,460
you do all your own artwork,
even though you're not really an artist.

15
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,880
While later on, you might collaborate
with someone who really knows what

16
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,090
they're doing and can contribute
amazing art direction to your project.

17
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,680
But hey there's nothing
wrong with program work.

18
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,870
Regardless of how big or complex though

19
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:07,800
the best games you'll ever write are the
ones that you think are fun the play.

20
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,770
And you can make a fun game no matter
how little experience you have so

21
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:15,000
don't get too hung up on
doing it the right way or

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,239
being an expert on everything
related to game development.

23
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,720
It's more important that you
just keep building games.

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,490
You'll learn what you need
to know as you go along,

25
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,160
and eventually it will
all make perfect sense.
