00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,050
And the correct answer is, obviously, ide.udacity.com. You

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,060
know, if we had a cookie in our

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:10,910
browser for ide.udacity.com, when, if you visited ide.udacity.com,

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,610
we'd send that cookie. And we'd also send that

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,756
cookie to other.ide.udacity.com. Basically, any sub domain of

6
00:00:17,756 --> 00:00:20,500
this domain would receive that cookie. And that kind of

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,710
makes sense, right? If you, you set this

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,230
cookie anything below that domain is kind of part

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,020
of that domain so you would receive that cookie

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,690
as well. Okay good job, let's try another one.
