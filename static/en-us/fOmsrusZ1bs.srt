1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,819
So what'd you think?

2
00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:03,620
I thought that was
a really cute algorithm.

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,715
And if you know anything about binomial
heats, which a lot of data structures

4
00:00:07,715 --> 00:00:11,940
101 classes cover, then you might of
recognized the basic idea right away.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,260
And if not,
you now have a new trick for your bag.

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,058
The original paper on this
approach is a very nice read.

7
00:00:18,058 --> 00:00:19,780
So I'd also encourage you
to take a look at that.
