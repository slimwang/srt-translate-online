00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,520
Something that might have made you
a little uneasy is that I made

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,790
an assumption about the class name
navbar being unique to the page.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,300
Class names are not guaranteed
to be unique on a web page and

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,329
many times a class name is used on
multiple elements on a web page, so

5
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,125
that way we can repeat
particular styles.

6
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:24,110
IDs however are typically reserved
as unique identifiers for HTML tags.

7
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,730
We can determine if a particular
class name is unique or

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,890
not by using d3selectAll function.

9
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,980
Instead of returning only one element,

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,570
the function will return any
elements which match the criteria of

11
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,820
the CSS selector that you
pass in to the function.

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:44,140
For example, if I pass in navbar class,
I'll get back a d3 selection.

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,340
In this case it was unique.

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,760
Another example is I could select
all the images on the page

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,300
by passing in the HTML
tag name of image.

16
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,660
Here I didn't use a class name but
usually you often use class names or

17
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,840
D selectors to select
elements on the page.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,050
And now, the elements are not unique
since there's four different images.

19
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,340
There's a logo, and there's some social
icons at the bottom of the page.
