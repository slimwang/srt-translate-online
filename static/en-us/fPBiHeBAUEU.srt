1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,870
Here's the answer.

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:05,840
Stick a 0 in the first node,
and a 1 everywhere else.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,823
So if we scan these initial values,
we'll get a 0,

4
00:00:10,823 --> 00:00:16,390
0 plus 1 is 1, 1 plus 1 is 2,
2 plus 1 is 3 and so on.
