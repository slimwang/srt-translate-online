00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:01,950
Hey Christian.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:02,550
>> Hey Chelsea.

3
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,400
>> Your box is done.

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:04,473
>> Yeah.

5
00:00:04,473 --> 00:00:05,700
>> What's going on here?

6
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,800
>> Well I, I've gotten some feedback and I was just wondering.

7
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,010
>> Yeah?

8
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:09,500
>> You want to try it?

9
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,370
>> Oh, sure. Wow. Where do I start? Okay.

10
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:14,010
>> You tell me.

11
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,280
>> Well, the first thing that stands out is

12
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,190
this guy here. And I immediately want to lift

13
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:23,570
it. Okay. I'm turning this around. Oh gosh, this

14
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,990
looks dangerous, but I still want to touch it.

15
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,230
kind of turning this around here. There's some text here. It looks like it's

16
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,760
telling a bit of a story. There was a little pig, he was

17
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,000
chasing a wolf. It makes me kind of want to turn the box, here. Oh,

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,732
and sparkles. Who doesn't love sparkles? Of course I want to touch this. Hmm.

19
00:00:42,732 --> 00:00:45,080
>> Lots going on.

20
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,900
>> Yeah. And as we saw, people did various things with it.

21
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:48,280
>> Mm-hm.

22
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,280
>> Well, there was a few things that I did intentionally here. One is,

23
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,180
that I made these finger holes. Just the

24
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,970
right size, and you'd grab it, like a bowling

25
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,750
ball. Well that's, human size. And here, it's

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,269
a little tempting to kind of touch it. And

27
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:07,990
maybe somebody would, want to, flitter with those. And

28
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,490
the balls kind of feel nice and well somewhere, here's

29
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:16,910
the squishy thing that you play with and you can even pick the box up from that,

30
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:21,640
and there's a tail. So why do we grab this? It's got an affordance for,

31
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:29,530
for grabbing. And there's one more thing. I'm using the power of story

32
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:34,090
here, because it says once upon, and you turn it. Once upon a time, there was a

33
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:39,960
little pig, who was chasing a wolf down a rabbit hole. Yeah.

34
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,371
>> [SOUND]

35
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:42,260
>> There's my box.
