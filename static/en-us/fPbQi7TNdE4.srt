00:00:04,345 --> 00:00:08,800
patterns. You should go to bed at the same time each night, and rise at the

00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,320
same time each morning. You should sleep in a quiet and dark room that's not

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,019
too hot or too cold. You should make your bed comfortable, and use it only for

00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:23,548
sleeping. Not other activities, such as reading, watching TV, or listening to

00:00:23,548 --> 00:00:28,614
music, or even studying. You should remove all TVs. Computers and other gadgets

Don't exercise within two hours before bedtime. Don't nap late in the

afternoon. If you can't fall asleep, get up and do something else. And make

it's relaxing. Oh, and about 30 minutes before bed, you should try to start

00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:53,849
winding down, get into a routine.
