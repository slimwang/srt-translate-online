1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
What happens at the depth here?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So, we keep dividing it in half until we get down to 1.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We've already spoken about that.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That is exactly base 2 log. So the depth is base 2 log.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
How many leaves do we get?

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There's one at the first level, then 2, then 4, then 8, then 16.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So in general, it's going to be 2^d.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
But we just said that depth is log base 2 of n.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So that's exactly n.
