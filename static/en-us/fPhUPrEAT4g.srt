1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:05,540
Let's give our enemy some actual teeth,
or electro repulsor fields, or whatever.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,050
When Giggy Gal touches an enemy,

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,280
she'll be flung away to
her almost certain doom.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,640
This mechanic is commonly
referred to as knock back.

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,392
First, we need to set up a constant for

6
00:00:16,392 --> 00:00:18,740
Gigi Gal's new velocity
when she gets knocked back.

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,890
Then after we establish
the Gigi Gal is touching in enemy,

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,450
we determine whether to fling her
back to the left or to the right.

00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,860
Check out the to dos in the course
code to turn our robot bodies into

10
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,380
remorseless killing machines.
