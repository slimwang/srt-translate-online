00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,515
In the next lesson, we'll be looking
in more detail at the technologies for

2
00:00:04,515 --> 00:00:07,939
aggregating data from diverse EHRs.

3
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:13,280
A specific example is BioSense 2.0,
a system developed at the Centers for

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,850
Disease Control and Prevention,
the CDC, here in Atlanta.

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,680
An often cited example of
the use of this technology

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,140
is the Tarrant County Public Health
Department in Fort Worth, Texas.

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,250
Which uses it to collect and analyze
data from 60 regional hospitals for

8
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,100
a key and foundational role
that public health plays.

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,820
Syndromic surveillance,
monitoring for disease outbreaks.

10
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,660
Here you see as an example a time
order display of the number of visits.

11
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,480
Typically these would be
emergency department visits for

12
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,370
a particular clinical problem.

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,800
The capability to produce this in
a timely manner across an entire region

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,910
is a powerful surveillance tool
