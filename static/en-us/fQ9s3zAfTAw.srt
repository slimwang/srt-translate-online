00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,010
We use our F statistic to determine if we should accept or reject the null

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:09,422
hypothesis. Where in this case the null hypothesis would be that the amount

3
00:00:09,422 --> 00:00:15,795
consumed by cows of food a, food b and c are all approximately the same. Which

4
00:00:15,795 --> 00:00:20,292
we're assuming means that cows do not prefer one type of food over the other.

5
00:00:20,292 --> 00:00:23,712
And the alternative is that they at least prefer one type of food over the

6
00:00:23,712 --> 00:00:29,575
other. So we have to compare our F statistic with the critical value. Use the F

7
00:00:29,575 --> 00:00:33,550
table to find this critical value. And then decide do we accept the null

8
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,820
hypothesis, or the alternative hypothesis?
