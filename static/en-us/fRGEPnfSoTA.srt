00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,781
The first thing that's important to remember is that the first coordinate we

2
00:00:03,793 --> 00:00:07,745
have in any ordered pair is the horizontal position of the point, and the second

3
00:00:07,757 --> 00:00:11,630
coordinate is the vertical position. So, let's start with the first point as an

4
00:00:11,642 --> 00:00:15,399
example. We have an x coordinate of 1. So we move from the origin over to the

5
00:00:15,411 --> 00:00:19,671
right in a positive direction 1, and a y-coordinate of 2, so we move up two,

6
00:00:19,683 --> 00:00:24,184
that's point b. For the second one, we have negative 2 as our x value so

7
00:00:24,196 --> 00:00:29,208
starting at the origin, we count to the left in the negative direction 1, 2. And

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,919
then, the y value is 1 so we count up one. So, that's point d. And we can do the

9
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:38,227
same process for every other point on here. So here, so here are the final

10
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,236
answers, luckily none of my letters are the same in any of the boxes cause that

11
00:00:42,248 --> 00:00:46,139
would indicate that we had made a mistake. Every pair has a unique position on

12
00:00:46,151 --> 00:00:49,880
the coordinate plane. And in the same way, every position on the coordinate

13
00:00:49,892 --> 00:00:51,486
plane has a unique ordered pair
