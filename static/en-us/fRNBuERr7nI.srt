1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,400
So, what's going to happen is that
the stock price is going to rise

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,340
to 101 because everybody
knows that on the next day,

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:15,680
you're going to have one share
of a stock worth $100 and $1.

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,879
So, the total value of that is $101.

5
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:25,092
On the very next day,
the price is going to drop by $1.

6
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:32,549
And everybody who held a share that day
will have one share of stock and $1.

7
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:39,060
So their value continues
at this $101 level.

8
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:46,313
So the answers are, the day before the
price, we should expect to see, is $101.

9
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:52,250
And the day the dividend is paid,
we should expect to see $100.

10
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:58,670
And don't forget,
you've got your $1 dividend also.
