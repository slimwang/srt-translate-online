00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,112
The next and somewhat final piece of the, puzzle to convert our

2
00:00:04,112 --> 00:00:09,400
Dimple.js plot to pure d3, is to actually draw circles on the page.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,680
I put a debugger right after all the code we've written so far.

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,960
And let's check in and see what our page actually looks like.

5
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,940
Going back to the browser, we can see the debugger's paused here.

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,150
You can see we have a y an a x axis.

7
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,820
Though they still look pretty crude they are in the right relative range

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,730
going from zero to probably looks like a 180 thousand for

9
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:41,493
attendance and the years even though they're very squished and

10
00:00:41,493 --> 00:00:47,436
scrunched together if we actually read them go from 1932 to 1934 to 1936 and

11
00:00:47,436 --> 00:00:54,970
so forth, all the way to 2014 if we look to the far extent of this axis.

12
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,690
And now we're so close to having our chart done.

13
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,280
And I've happened to save the best for last, the actual circles we want to draw.

14
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,060
For the sake of simplicity, I'm only going to recreate the scatter plot.

15
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,730
Now the way the sense of where we are in terms of the axis,

16
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:14,430
let's jump back to sublime text and actually create some circles for our data.

17
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,280
In dimple, we simply need to specify that we want to draw some

18
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,700
series corresponding to some shapes, in this case, scatter or line.

19
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,180
Removing these two lines and also since we don't have any dimple code left,

20
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,500
we can simply remove the draw.

21
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,450
In d3, there's not an explicit draw function or rather,

22
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:40,190
every SVG gets appended to the page whenever we create it.

23
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:44,560
Remember, in dimple, since it's much higher level than d3.

24
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,980
You simply have to specify what axis this series corresponds to, and

25
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,700
it automatically knows the extent, the scale, the axis of that.

26
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,780
Now here's another quirk of d3, if you remember from above.

27
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:03,000
When we bound data we actually appended circles to the page, and

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,210
now we're selecting the circles already on the page to add an x position,

29
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,410
a y position, a radius and a fill.

30
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:15,170
Going back to the browser, you'll notice here that there aren't

31
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:19,350
any circles actually drawn, but if we look back at the code.

32
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:24,100
From where we started when we bound our data, we actually appended circles.

33
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,690
So what gives?

34
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:30,850
Where are the SVG circles which our bound to data which should be on the screen?

35
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:35,700
Answer in the box below where you think the circles are on the screen or

36
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,440
why they're not showing up visually in our chart.
