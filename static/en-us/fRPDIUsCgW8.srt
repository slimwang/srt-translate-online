If you answered, it not longer exists then you might be a baby. Because the

00:00:05,083 --> 00:00:09,764
duck is under the towel, of course. But Piaget explains that infants think and

3
00:00:09,764 --> 00:00:12,410
live and the they hear now, meaning they can't understand if they

00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:12,949
[INAUDIBLE]

5
00:00:12,949 --> 00:00:18,018
statements. For example, if I cover the duck with the towel, then the duck is

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:22,795
under the towel of course. So, given what we know about infants' cognitive

7
00:00:22,795 --> 00:00:27,010
capabilities. We know that when the duck is covered, they think it no longer

8
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,220
exists.
