1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,420
Our enemies sure are scary.

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,810
All blue and shiny and evil.

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:08,750
When you get up close though they
do seem a little intimidating.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,040
Let's figure out how we can detect
when Gigago has run into an enemy.

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,379
So Gigago takes up kind
of a rectangular space.

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,020
And the dangerous bits of the enemy
are more or less a circle.

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,870
For the actual game we'll end up
approximating both Giga Gal and

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,960
her enemies as rectangles.

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,580
But as an aside, can you figure out
how to detect when a circle and

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,890
a rectangle are overlapping?

11
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,180
Check out the course code for

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,730
a little challenge on circle
rectangle collisions.
