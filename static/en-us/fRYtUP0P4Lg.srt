Starting with the following source code,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm looking for a completion of this one line over here that returns the Gaussian function

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
with arguments mu = 10, sigma2 = 4, and x = 8,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and I want the output to be approximately 0.12.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Here's my solution. This is the constant: 1/sprt(2<i>pi</i>sigma2).

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Then I multiply with the exponential of (-.5<i>(x-mu)</i>*2/sigma2).

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Applying that to the following numbers over here gives me 0.12.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Now, here's a question for you.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 99:59:59,999
How do I have to modify x the 8 to get the maximum return value for this function f?
