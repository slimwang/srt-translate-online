00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,388
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05,388 --> 00:00:08,652
Conway's law was the idea that
what we create is a reflection of

3
00:00:08,652 --> 00:00:10,260
our communication patterns.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,350
Specifically, he was
talking about software,

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,780
but we can take a broader approach for
a second.

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,100
Silos are often simply
communication models.

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,970
It's the way in which
decision-making and

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:26,020
sort of ownership around a particular
set of problems gets discussed.

9
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,560
And so, one way that you can
start to break down the silo,

10
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,490
which is the first step,
like if it's animosity that's developed,

11
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:38,400
the first step is bringing those
people into your people, right?

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,560
What you want,

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:45,560
is you want to stop having the
perspective that the silo is the thing.

14
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,810
I often tell organizations to
stop shipping their org chart.

15
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,740
The very first thing that happens,
typically,

16
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:58,790
as we see that we're good at something,
is we want to double down on that value.

17
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:04,489
And so we do that by declaring,
this team does X..

18
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:10,740
And so, we start to align and
concentrate on a functional silo.

19
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,880
We put all the like things together.

20
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:19,100
Well, let me try to address
the history for a second, right?

21
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:25,021
I often ask development teams and
people doing a DEVap's transformation,

22
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:29,750
I ask them this simple question,
does a DBA need a database?

23
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,960
And then, people look at me
like I have nine heads, right?

24
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,490
But of course,
a DBA doesn't need a database.

25
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:42,060
DBAs were created, in some way,
by software engineers

26
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,960
who didn't want to deal with
the underlying complexity.

27
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,120
They needed a place to store their data,
but they didn't want to have to

28
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,080
deal with the runtime consequences
of bringing that database in.

29
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,350
And so, right off the bat in that model,

30
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:00,700
a silo gets created through
a particular kind of conversation.

31
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,710
As a software developer,
my value is solving problems with code.

32
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,180
Surely, there must be some other place,

33
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:12,630
some other functional group,
that can be accountable for

34
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,650
the build aspects of my software,
that can be responsible for

35
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,660
the infrastructure required to run it,
who can manage it in production.

36
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,470
So, we can talk about all
of these ways in which

37
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,560
I can maximize my personal
value as a software developer

38
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,710
by not being distracted by
the consequences of the choices I make.

39
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,810
And I think that DevOps takes
a totally different approach.

40
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,930
It says, sure,
there are a number of skills that

41
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,180
need to be applied in order to
ensure that the software and

42
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,810
technology that we build
is stable in production.

43
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,350
But it does not, the approach
that it takes is one in which,

44
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:54,320
is an inclusive one, that says we
are all sort of co-responsible.

45
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,370
So yeah, bring it, right,

46
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,120
if you're a database expert,
bring that expertise into the team.

47
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,860
But what I'm not going to do is I'm
not going to force you into a box in

48
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,440
which that's the only way that you can
express your creative intelligence,

49
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,966
with relation to this product that
we're putting out in the world.

50
00:03:09,966 --> 00:03:14,380
As a matter of fact, I don't want that,
because you have had a broad history and

51
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,830
career, [LAUGH] you probably have,

52
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:20,120
there's probably a lot of awesome that
you can bring, in terms of understanding

53
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,680
that product, in terms of understanding
how it works in the world.

54
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,740
So, the approach that I would
take toward the animosity

55
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,150
would be first to heal it, right?

56
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,650
Like, the first thing you want to do is
you want to meet the people in the silo.

57
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,110
Hey [LAUGH], I'm right over here.

58
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:44,200
A lot of people have
that open spaces now.

59
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,910
My desk is right over there.

60
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,790
I would introduce yourself.

61
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,720
I would get to understand how and
why you were separated,

62
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,050
by understanding what value these people
bring, how they express that value.

63
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,110
And then I would look for

64
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:03,950
places where you can combine to improve
something in the infrastructure.

65
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,800
I bring that idea of sort of kaizen,

66
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,700
that's sort of gradual change over time,
or team improvement over time.

67
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,220
I would bring that idea
to your interactions.

68
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,019
So it's nice to get to know people,

69
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:21,140
it's great to make friends at work,
and I think that that's the basis.

70
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,130
Hi [LAUGH], who are you?

71
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,130
This is who I am.

72
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:24,940
What do you do?

73
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,780
This is what I do.

74
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,750
I think the very next step is, how

75
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,470
can we work together to make something
that's better than what we have today?
