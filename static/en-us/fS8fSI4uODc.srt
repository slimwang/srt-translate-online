1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,562
Well, to start off, 0 is the coordinate of any x-intercept. So if we plug in 0

2
00:00:05,562 --> 00:00:11,078
for x in our equation, we get f of 0 equals a to the 0. Now, if I take any

3
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:16,537
number that a could equal to the 0 power, then we get 1 for f. That means that

4
00:00:16,537 --> 00:00:21,160
the y-intercept of any exponential function of this form, whether it's growing

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,340
or decaying is 0, 1. That's really cool. Bringing it back to decimals again,

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,614
I've started us off with the function f of x equals 2 to the x. And we can see

7
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:38,820
that, yes, in fact, our y-intercept is at 0, 1. As we slide a, either making it

8
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:45,868
bigger or making it smaller, the one point that never changes is the 0.01. You

9
00:00:45,868 --> 00:00:49,700
can watch the rest of the curve flip right around that point. It's almost like

10
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,910
a pivot point.
