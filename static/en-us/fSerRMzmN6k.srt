1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,210
Now let's look at the different
types of viruses.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,860
The first is a parasitic virus.

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,220
They typically scan
programs on a system, for

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,140
example on the hard drive, and
then infect these programs.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,980
The second is the memory-resident virus.

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,780
They're typically of an operating
system, and when the system runs,

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,770
the opening system is
loaded into the memory.

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,520
So as long as a system is running,
the virus, resize the memory.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,020
Then it can infect any running
program on the system.

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,110
The third is the macro virus.

11
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,100
They're typically
embedded in a document.

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,720
And when a document is opened,
the virus also runs and spreads.

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,180
The fourth, is the Boot sector virus.

14
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,240
They reside in the boot
sector of a hard drive, and

15
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,630
whenever a system is booted the Boot
sector virus will run and spread.

16
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,660
A very important type of virus
is called a Polymorphic virus.

17
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,423
For a Polymorphic virus,
each instance, or each infection,

18
00:00:55,423 --> 00:01:00,109
can look different because part of the
virus program is encrypted by a randomly

19
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:02,870
generated key at each infection.

20
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,710
The purpose of using polymorphic
virus is to avoid detection by

21
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,120
easy signature matching.

22
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,310
We will discuss this a little bit later.

23
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,270
We should note that any of these
type of viruses can by polymorphic.
