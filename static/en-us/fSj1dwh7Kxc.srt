00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,200
Think of it like playing darts. The standard height from the floor to the

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,920
bullseye is 5 feet 8 inches, and then you have to stand 7 feet 9 and 1 fourth

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:13,854
inches back from the dartboard. Then dartboard makers had to decide how big the

4
00:00:13,854 --> 00:00:21,960
dartboard should be. Bigger targets or even the wall are easier to hit. But

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,448
it's also more likely we hit them by chance. Smaller targets are harder to hit,

6
00:00:25,448 --> 00:00:29,824
but when we hit them, we can be more confident we didn't hit them by chance. So

7
00:00:29,824 --> 00:00:32,944
the bulls eye should be big enough that it's possible to hit it, but small

8
00:00:32,944 --> 00:00:38,510
enough so that if we hit it, it's due to skill. There has to be a balance.

9
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,902
These targets on a dart board are analogous to the critical regions, with the

10
00:00:41,902 --> 00:00:45,188
boundary of each region on the dartboard analogous to the different alpha

11
00:00:45,188 --> 00:00:50,412
levels. We can easily get a mean within this area, in the middle of the

12
00:00:50,412 --> 00:00:54,764
distribution, but if a mean lands beyond a z score of 1.64, the probability of

13
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:58,980
getting this mean is less than 0.05, the alpha level, and it's not likely to

14
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:07,844
have occurred by chance. It's even more unlikely to occur by chance if the mean

15
00:01:07,844 --> 00:01:13,373
lands beyond z equals 2.32. The probability there is .01, and it's super

16
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:20,140
unlikely to have occurred by chance. If the mean lands beyond z equals 3.08.

17
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,524
This is like striking the bullseye.
