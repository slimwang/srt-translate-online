1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,950
Alright. So it's worth asking, how do we find

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:06,980
this best line? So again there's an infinite number

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,710
of lines. How do we find one that fits

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,460
these points the best. And again we're defining best fit.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,730
As the one that has the least squared error, where the error is

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,970
going to be some of the distances between these x points and the green line

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,210
that we, that we fit. I'm not even sure that this really is the

8
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,210
best fit in this case. I just kind of hand drew it. So, okay. So

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,680
is this something that we, that we would want to solve by hill climbing which

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,490
is to say, we kind of pick the. The slope and the intercept of

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,880
the line, and we just kind of try different values of this until it

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,700
gets better and better and then we can't get any better, and we stop.

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,120
Can we do this using calculus? Can we use random search, where we just

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,580
like, pick a random M, pick a random B, and see if we're happy

15
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,210
with it? Or is this the sort of thing where we probably would just

16
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,730
go and ask a physicist because it

17
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,950
involves, like, continuous quantities, and we're discrete people?
