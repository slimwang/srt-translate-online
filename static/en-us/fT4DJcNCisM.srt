00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,860
In this lesson we will
discuss memory consistency,

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,510
which determines how
strictly should we enforce

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,370
ordering among accesses to
different memory locations.

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,790
This is needed to get what we
expect from our synchronization and

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:16,350
data accesses in
a shared-memory program.
