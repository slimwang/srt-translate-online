Thank you for sharing your thoughts. Now, if any one

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:06,460
of these two scenarios occurs, the program that we wrote will

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,960
throw an error. We call this error an exception.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,970
I want you to put a pin in this thought as we

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,200
will return to this idea in the later lessons of

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,640
this course. Okay, so we are back at our code again.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,560
And now I'm curious to see where the different functions of

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,360
OS like listdir and rename are coming from. Let's find out.
