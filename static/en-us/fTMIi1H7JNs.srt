1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,240
All right, so first, some notation.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,420
As before, we've got our world times our m is our projective equation.

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,070
And notice we've got two versions here.

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:14,700
And again, what we're saying here is that uv1 is projectively similar to wu,

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,670
wv and w.

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,780
And in fact, in order to get back uv1,

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,030
I could take wu, divide by w in order to get that.

8
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,020
And that's actually what's written on the bottom.

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,470
All I've shown is that ui, that's for point i, I have to

10
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:34,850
take the product that's the first row divided by what becomes the third row.

11
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:36,060
Same thing for vi.

12
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,100
So the point here is that I get a pair of equations for every point.

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,160
For every point i here, I have an equation that's, that goes from x, y,

14
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,070
z to ui, and x, y, z, to vi.

15
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,350
So what we're going to do is we're going to have to solve for

16
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:55,470
this m matrix using a, a whole bunch of points.

17
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,670
Just continuing, I just slid those equations up, and

18
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,740
now I've just carried through, just expanded it through.

19
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:05,430
And one thing you'll notice is that every term has an m in it.

20
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,300
And for those of you who know anything about linear algebra,

21
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,340
that should start to worry you just a little bit because typically when I

22
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,130
want to solve a linear set of equations,

23
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,160
I hope that there's some term that doesn't have a variable in it.

24
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,479
And we'll see that in just a sec.

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,710
So, I have this pair of equations for

26
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,020
each point, all right, writing it again like that.

27
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,690
So now the question is how best to solve this, all right.

28
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,310
I'm going to write this a little bit different way.

29
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,800
So here I have all my variables, and here for

30
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,350
just one point, I have my coefficients.

31
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,090
So notice my coefficients involve capital Xs and Ys and Zs.

32
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,320
Those are the values out in the world, along with the v's and

33
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,250
the u's, which are the points in the image.

34
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,820
Now, stretch way back into your memory from linear algebra, and you right,

35
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:53,260
might remember that usually you were solving equations of ax equals b.

36
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,640
And you could have more equations than unknowns, and

37
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,190
you'd solve to a least square solution.

38
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,560
But there was a particular kind of sol,

39
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,330
of set of equations where the right-hand side was

40
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:06,830
referred to as a homogeneous set of equations when they were all equal to zero.

41
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,610
And that's why this is a homogeneous set of equations,

42
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,350
not just homogeneous coordinates.

43
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,340
These things are all sort of related.

44
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,720
And when you get really, really old, you'll figure that out.

45
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,490
But for now, you can just remember that these are homogeneous equations.

46
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,010
So the question is, how do we solve that?

47
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,330
Because obviously, there's a trivial solution.

48
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,190
What's the trivial solution?

49
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,510
Well, if a times x equals 0, and I'm looking for

50
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:34,100
an x, well no matter what a is, x equals 0 would be a solution.

51
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,500
So I could just say all the m's are equal to 0.

52
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,650
And that would not be a very satisfying solution.

53
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,010
So the question is, what's the best way to solve this?
