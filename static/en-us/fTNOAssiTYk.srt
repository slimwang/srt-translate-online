1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,993
Early stage investors want to invest
in people around them because

2
00:00:03,993 --> 00:00:04,892
they want to help.

3
00:00:04,892 --> 00:00:06,698
They want to be there
on a regular basis and

4
00:00:06,698 --> 00:00:09,470
go through this super difficult
thing of building a startup.

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:11,587
So, usually,

6
00:00:11,587 --> 00:00:15,427
your early investors are going to come
from the immediate vicinity around you.

7
00:00:15,427 --> 00:00:19,312
If there are no such investors around
you that are aligned with your business

8
00:00:19,312 --> 00:00:20,949
or you feel you can reach out to,

9
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:24,181
I think putting yourself in
a position where you can find ways.

10
00:00:24,181 --> 00:00:28,552
So for example if you are not
in a big metropolitan,

11
00:00:28,552 --> 00:00:33,342
perhaps going to accelerator program for
a few months.

12
00:00:33,342 --> 00:00:37,592
Perhaps thinking about where the best
place to set up your business maybe

13
00:00:37,592 --> 00:00:41,366
closer to your customers that
might be in a large metropolitan.

14
00:00:41,366 --> 00:00:45,684
I think those are some of the things you
should be thinking about in order to get

15
00:00:45,684 --> 00:00:47,090
close to the investors.

16
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,301
Because investors, it's not about giving
you a check and wishing you good luck.

17
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,718
They want to be there for you.

18
00:00:52,718 --> 00:00:54,226
They want to help you and for

19
00:00:54,226 --> 00:00:57,910
that they feel they need to be
geographically located next to you.
