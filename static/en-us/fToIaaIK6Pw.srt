1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,500
When the learner is ready
the teacher will appear.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,460
And when the learner no longer needs the
teacher, the teacher will be killed by

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,162
somebody and then you have to go off and
learn Kung Fu.

4
00:00:09,162 --> 00:00:12,064
>> I think you're actually
taking the plot of Kung Fu.

5
00:00:12,064 --> 00:00:12,899
[LAUGH]
>> I am, I am.

6
00:00:12,899 --> 00:00:14,304
>> Okay.
>> Well anyway I'd like

7
00:00:14,304 --> 00:00:15,910
to think Jordan Pollock for this.

8
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,680
I really love this example.

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,960
I was really the first example of kind
of mechanism design that really sort

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,740
of hit home for me.

11
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,150
>> Thanks.
And it seems relevant to this kind of

12
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,660
online teaching scenario
that we're in right now.

13
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,470
>> Yeah, I mean it's not enough for,
I mean I know I'm sure some people

14
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,820
taking this class have
actually done peer grading.

15
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,542
And there is always this question of
why won't everyone just give everybody

16
00:00:36,542 --> 00:00:37,060
good grades.

17
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,780
You have to construct something so
that that doesn't happen.

18
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,430
>> Good.

19
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:43,142
>> Okay, so, I'm going to give
you one more example, I think.

20
00:00:43,142 --> 00:00:46,946
And then I think maybe we'll
sort of cover the space enough.

21
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:47,835
What do you think of that?

22
00:00:47,835 --> 00:00:48,535
>> That would be great.

23
00:00:48,535 --> 00:00:49,090
>> Okay.
