00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,862
Before I implement the method, I'm going to write the tester. There are

2
00:00:03,862 --> 00:00:06,202
multiple ways you could do this, but there are also a lot of ways that look

3
00:00:06,202 --> 00:00:11,576
similar and don't work. Here's the way I came up with. First, it checks to see

4
00:00:11,576 --> 00:00:15,779
if the kitten is more than 6 months. If so, we know that we want to return

5
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:21,700
cute. Now, if the kitten is not more than 6 months, but is 2 or more months.

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:28,121
Then the kitten is super cute. This condition is only checked if this condition

7
00:00:28,121 --> 00:00:33,478
already failed. This whole piece of code is under the else clause for the first

8
00:00:33,478 --> 00:00:39,102
if. Now if both of these conditions are false. Then we end up in the last else

9
00:00:39,102 --> 00:00:42,500
clause. This catches everything that doesn't satisfy one of the first two

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:48,027
conditions. So, if the kitten's not older than 6 months, and is not 2 months or

11
00:00:48,027 --> 00:00:54,265
older. Then it's younger than two months, and so it's not cute yet. Let's check

12
00:00:54,265 --> 00:00:59,354
that this works. Okay, it looks like these match, they match, match, match and

13
00:00:59,354 --> 00:01:04,542
match. So, we're good. We could change this code slightly by adding another

14
00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:09,702
condition here. The code will still work modified this way, but it's considered

15
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:14,716
bad form. If you decide to modify the 2 months threshold. You now have to

16
00:01:14,716 --> 00:01:18,665
change it in two places instead of just one. Also, if you don't understand the

17
00:01:18,665 --> 00:01:22,819
condition right, or just make a little error, there could be cases that you

18
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:28,274
miss and don't handle at all. So, don't add an if condition here. That would be

19
00:01:28,274 --> 00:01:34,671
a bug. What if we changed the order of these checks? So, I take months greater

20
00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:40,633
than 6 and put it here. Months greater than or equal to 2, here, and then,

21
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:50,040
change the return values to match. Do you think this still works? Lets try it.

22
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,423
It looks like it's wrong for the first case. These cases are okay and this one

23
00:01:54,423 --> 00:01:59,122
is, but it looks like there aren't any cute kittens anymore. Only super cute

24
00:01:59,122 --> 00:02:03,201
ones and not so cute ones. A kitten with eight months will do the first check

25
00:02:03,201 --> 00:02:07,044
and find that it's true and return super cute, without ever testing to see if

26
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:14,496
it's more than six months, as well. No matter what number months starts out as,

27
00:02:14,496 --> 00:02:20,974
this piece of code, here, will never run. That's a bug.
