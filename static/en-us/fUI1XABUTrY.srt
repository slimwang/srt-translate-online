00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,612
>> Well if the mean is 60 and the standard deviation is 13, one standard

2
00:00:05,612 --> 00:00:12,072
deviation below the mean would be 60 minus 13. 60 minus 13 is 47. So here's 60,

3
00:00:12,072 --> 00:00:18,792
the mean, and we go back 13, and this value is 47. Two standard deviations above

4
00:00:18,792 --> 00:00:25,075
the mean would be 86, because we go up 13 for one standard deviation and another

5
00:00:25,075 --> 00:00:31,448
13 for two standard deviations. And finally, the mean minus two standard

6
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:36,025
deviations would be 60 minus 13 minus 13, which is 34.
