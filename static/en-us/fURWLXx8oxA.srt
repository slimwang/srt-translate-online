00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,065
Here the only solution is x equals positive 5. Nice solving if you found this

2
00:00:05,065 --> 00:00:09,950
number. First we'll take our quadratic equation, and we'll subtract 15 from

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:15,998
both sides in order to set it equal to 0. So we'll have x squared minus 2x

4
00:00:15,998 --> 00:00:23,130
minus 15 equals 0. Now we've factored this quadratic to give us the two factors

5
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:28,580
x minus 5 times x plus 3. Next, we said each factor equal to 0 and then we

6
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:36,058
solve for the values of x. So x can be positive 5 or x can be negative 3. When

7
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:39,066
considering these values for solutions, we want to think back to the original

8
00:00:39,066 --> 00:00:43,822
equation. If we plug in a negative 3, in for x, then this argument would be

9
00:00:43,822 --> 00:00:49,984
negative, an this one would be as well. Remember, we can't take the logarithm

10
00:00:49,984 --> 00:00:56,346
of a negative number. So that means this solution is out. This is why the only

11
00:00:56,346 --> 00:00:59,363
answer is x equals positive 5.
