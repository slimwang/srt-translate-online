1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,953
So, how much more complex
has this system become?

2
00:00:03,953 --> 00:00:05,441
100 times?

3
00:00:05,441 --> 00:00:07,153
500 times?

4
00:00:07,153 --> 00:00:08,858
10,000 times?

5
00:00:08,858 --> 00:00:10,946
I think if I remember right,

6
00:00:10,946 --> 00:00:15,388
the first version of DOS was
about 5,000 lines of code.

7
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:18,405
I said assembly code, but about 5,000.

8
00:00:18,405 --> 00:00:23,600
Windows currently is running
in the tens of millions range.

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,630
If you look at more recent Windows-based
operating systems, 50 million or

10
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,530
whatever it is,
we're talking rough estimates here, so

11
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,430
it's tens of millions.

12
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:37,356
So if you go from 5000
to tens of millions,

13
00:00:37,356 --> 00:00:42,004
the complexity has grown
by a factor of 10,000.

14
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:47,304
So one of the things people say,
why do we have these vulnerabilities?

15
00:00:47,304 --> 00:00:49,336
Well, it's complexity, and

16
00:00:49,336 --> 00:00:53,557
it's complexity because we have
all these fancy features, and

17
00:00:53,557 --> 00:00:58,576
richer interfaces, and APIs that
are more general, and things like that.

18
00:00:58,576 --> 00:01:00,237
And that adds to the complexity.

19
00:01:00,237 --> 00:01:02,586
So it relates to correctness.

20
00:01:02,586 --> 00:01:07,512
Getting operating systems correct is
a challenge because they're complex.

21
00:01:07,512 --> 00:01:11,560
And here is an example of how
the complexity has grown over time.
