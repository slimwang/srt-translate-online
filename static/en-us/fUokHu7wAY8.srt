1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,710
We've now had an overview of how
standards have evolved over the years,

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:07,120
in terms of their structure,
purpose, and technology.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:12,350
You should think about the difference
between simple classifications such as

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:19,440
NDC, CPT, and ICD, prior to version 10,
and a complex ontology such as snowman.

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,440
The standards community
has been divided for

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,650
decades over the choice
between perfection,

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,490
standards that can represent medicine
in all its detail, and practicality,

8
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,630
standards that can actually be
deployed and used in the real world.

9
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,480
We'll look at this more
specifically in lesson 6,

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,090
when we review EMR design challenges.
