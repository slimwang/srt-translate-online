1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,440
All right.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,530
Let's start by looking for

3
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:07,750
the name key in the example JSON
response from the Twitter API request.

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,660
By searching the response for
the name key,

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,290
we actually see that it appears
multiple times for different uses.

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,230
Sometimes the value is Tony Fadell.

7
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,390
Sometimes the value is Sebastian Thrun,
and sometimes it's Udacity.

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,960
In all three cases,

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,360
the value appears to be a string that
represents the name of a Twitter user.

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,540
So in the quiz, the name key maps
to the string JSON primitive.

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,320
Next, we'll look for the user key.

12
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,960
The user key maps to a value that
is enclosed in curly braces.

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,900
That means it maps to a JSON object with
a lot more attributes about that Twitter

14
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:50,270
user with the name shernazdaver,
screen_name, and other information.

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,010
If you look at the other
cases where user appears,

16
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,200
you'll find other Twitter users.

17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,900
So that means the user key
maps to a JSON object.

18
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,980
Next, we'll look for the hashtags key.

19
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,850
The hashtags key maps to a JSON array

20
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,780
because it points to a value
with square brackets.

21
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,400
There's one hashtag in this
tweet which is I\/O 16.

22
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,650
This is the hashtag for
the 2016 Google IO conference.

23
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,070
If there are more hashtags in this
tweet, they would show up in this array.

24
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,430
So the hashtag key maps to a JSON array.

25
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,588
Next, we'll look for
the followers_count key.

26
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:31,580
The key followers_count maps to
the number of followers this

27
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,359
Twitter user has,
which is 460291 in this case.

28
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,570
So the followers count key
maps to a JSON Primitive.

29
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,170
Which is an integer in this case.
