1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,130
And finally, let's look at
the fully associative cache.

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,720
If we have an eight entry cache,

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:11,010
a fully associative cache is one where
any block can map to any of these lines.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,850
In this case the address breaks
down into the offset part.

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,490
The number of index bits is
the number of bits we need

6
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,890
to tell us where in the cache we can be.

7
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,830
But because we can be
anywhere in the cache,

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,610
we don't need any bits to tell us that.

9
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:28,720
So there are no index bits when
using a fully associative cache.

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,310
All of the remaining
bits are simply the tag.
