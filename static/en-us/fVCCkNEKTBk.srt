00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,771
Sometimes, though, the equation of a circle won't appear in this form. It could

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:09,997
appear like this. When we see an equation with an x squared term, a y squared

3
00:00:09,997 --> 00:00:13,657
term, and other terms that have x and y at a constant, we want to re-arrange

4
00:00:13,657 --> 00:00:20,140
this so we can put it in this form. Notice that we have a perfect square of an

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:25,531
x term, and a perfect square of a y term. If this is the case, we want to

6
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:29,627
re-arrange this equation so we can group the x terms together and we can group

7
00:00:29,627 --> 00:00:35,828
the y terms together. We'll also want to move this constant to the right hand

8
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:40,125
side of our equation. We do this so that we can complete the square for the x

9
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:45,202
terms and for the Y terms. So what do we need to add to the left hand side of

10
00:00:45,202 --> 00:00:50,686
our equation to complete the square for these X terms. Keep in mind if we add

11
00:00:50,686 --> 00:00:54,468
an amount to this side we need to add the same amount to the right hand side of

12
00:00:54,468 --> 00:01:00,392
our equation so we keep the equation balanced. And, what do you think we would

13
00:01:00,392 --> 00:01:05,407
need to the y terms in order for this to become a perfect square. Again,

14
00:01:05,407 --> 00:01:09,640
whatever we add to the left, we need to add to the right.
