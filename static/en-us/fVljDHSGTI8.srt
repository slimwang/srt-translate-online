00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,800
So in addition to the polygon and

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,640
the polyline, you can also draw a circle
around a map around a particular area.

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,910
You specify the center of the circle,
using its latitude and longitude.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,130
You specify the radius of
the circle in meters, and

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,130
you can also specify the stroke color
that's used to draw the circle, and

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,950
the fill color that is used
to fill the circle in.

00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,440
Try to add a circle to
