00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,940
We've gotten our first taste of
web services with Flickr, and

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,800
what I want to do is expose you to some
of the other data that's out there,

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,030
because there's a ton.

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,010
So I'm going to give
you a description for

5
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,010
some data that a developer
might want to use and

6
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,045
I want you to match that with a web
service that best fits the description.

7
00:00:15,045 --> 00:00:18,945
So for developer A, let's say I want
to access information about American

8
00:00:18,945 --> 00:00:22,415
legislators, districts,
committees, bills, and votes.

9
00:00:22,415 --> 00:00:25,355
For developer B, I want to build
an app that displays player stats and

10
00:00:25,355 --> 00:00:27,590
game results from the game
League of Legends.

11
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:28,300
And that's a good one.

12
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,810
I play that one, actually, a lot.

13
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:30,740
For Developer C,

14
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,530
I want to display the locations
of restaurants in a city or town.

15
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,040
For Developer D, I want to access
information about the economies of

16
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,750
countries from around the world.

17
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,330
And Developer E, I want to display
information about sales and

18
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,370
products at top designer labels.

19
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,790
For options, we have the OpenMenu API,
the World Bank API,

20
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:55,590
Sunlight APIs, the Gilt API,
and Riot Games API.

21
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,770
So to answer these questions, I want you
to put the number of the web service

22
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,250
in the text box for the developer it
best helps over here on the left.
