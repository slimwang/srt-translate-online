00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,260
As entrepreneurs are trying to build
our their e-commerce business,

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,970
it's really important to
understand the impact

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,960
mobile devices had on
commerce in general.

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,540
For a long time,

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,700
it was thought that purchasing
on a mobile phone can't happen.

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,025
You have to type in all
this extra information.

7
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:27,660
But more and
more it's becoming really obvious

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,240
that that's where people
are spending all of their time.

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,408
So in the same way people were shopping
online on their PC's a long time ago,

10
00:00:36,408 --> 00:00:39,430
now a lot of that commerce
happens on the phone.

11
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,400
So, it's really important to really
think about how do you optimize your

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,780
experience, and your purchase experience
specifically, for the mobile device.

13
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:52,370
And so things like thinking
about how can you auto fill

14
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:57,260
information based off of what's
already in your phone built in there?

15
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,950
And thinking about,
as you're actually have different

16
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:09,520
interactions with your website.

17
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,460
Think about how much space do I actually
have on this screen to actually

18
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,460
fit in all the different buttons.

19
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,876
Like if you want to offer reviews,

20
00:01:19,876 --> 00:01:25,977
like the ability to choose color,
ability to choose size.

21
00:01:25,977 --> 00:01:29,855
Like ability to sort of switch
between a lot of different images of

22
00:01:29,855 --> 00:01:31,390
the same product.

23
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:36,380
One of the things that you realize
is that you have to make trade offs.

24
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,700
And the only way you
can really understand

25
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,760
how to make those trade-offs
is through testing.

26
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:50,740
And really figuring out,
if I have this button here, which takes

27
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:55,620
up the full screen, or opposed to having
two different buttons on that screen.

28
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,440
How does that impact
the conversion rate?

29
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:05,740
Because of the focus more and
more on the mobile device.

30
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,979
Testing becomes more and more important
because you don't have all that much

31
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,641
real estate to actually work with.
