1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is no.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
If you look at the first data point and divide the price by size,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
you get approximately 31.1765.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Compare this to the next data point, which gets you 30.9524.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
They're about the same but not quite.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 99:59:59,999
In fact, they're all different for the different data points, as you can see over here.
