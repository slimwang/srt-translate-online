1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,290
So that ends the introduction
to tracking.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,030
Basically saying that what we're
going to do is use a model to make

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:06,930
predictions.

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,720
Take some measurements,
and, integrate it.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,740
Like I said, it's not strictly computer
vision, because it involves state

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,530
estimation, which comes from all
sorts of parts of engineering and

7
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,870
robotics and things like that.

8
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,100
But it's what's required in order
to make the tracking to work.

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,740
So well, we'll sort of take a little
bit of a detour to talk about

10
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,120
state dynamics and estimation.

11
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,320
Little bit of robot localization
using visual features and

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,380
then we'll get back to fundamentals
of tracking using these methods.

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:35,960
Cool.
