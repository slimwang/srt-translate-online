1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,719
The Internet is an extraordinarily complex creature, using a

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:07,100
wide variety of hardware and communication protocols. To help

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,150
make sense of it all, most any discussion of

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,740
networking begins with the notion of interconnection layers, an idea

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,550
that captures the most important relationships among the Internet's

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,450
components. Several attempts have been made to formalize these, most

7
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,550
notably the seven-layer OSI model, and the four layer

8
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,080
Internet protocol suite. We use a hybrid model here and

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,240
try to keep the discussion intuitive. The physical layer

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,000
refers to hardware that actually creates and transmits the

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,850
electronic and optical signals, as well as the protocols

12
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,790
for interpreting these signals as bits. This would include

13
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,900
the network interface card inside your computer, the modem

14
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,540
that your Internet service provider gave you or recommended

15
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,270
that you buy. For ethernet cable connecting your modem

16
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:51,230
to your computer, and even submarine fiber optic cables that

17
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,010
stretch across the world's oceans. Protocols are interpreting the

18
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,810
signals sent across these media include physical ethernet and sonnet.

19
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,630
The link layer covers the communication between peers on a

20
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,840
local network. The most trivial topology for a local network

21
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,460
is just point to point, where there is a

22
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,610
permanent link between two end points. We can also have

23
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,910
more complex topologies, however, where multiple nodes are all connected

24
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:16,520
to the same medium, and feel all each other's signals.

25
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,680
The challenge here becomes making sure that they don't

26
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,330
all talk at the same time. The link layer also

27
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,705
encompasses switching, where connections between nodes are made on an

28
00:01:24,705 --> 00:01:28,960
as-needed basis to reduce the potential for crosstalk. The network

29
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,730
layer is responsible for end-to-end communication on the internet. When

30
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,290
you request a page from the Udacity website, the data

31
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,920
doesn't come directly from our servers, but goes through several

32
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,580
intervening machines. This process of routing the data, or figuring

33
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,810
out what path the data should take, belongs to the

34
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,390
network layer. Unlike other layers, which have evolved to include many

35
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:50,940
different technologies, the network layer is governed almost exclusively by

36
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,440
the Internet protocol and the system of IP addresses. Now, once

37
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,450
data reaches your machine, there has to be some way

38
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,590
of knowing which application it is intended for. Also, communication isn't

39
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,630
perfect, so we need some mechanism for detecting when data goes

40
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,700
missing, arrives out of order, or when the connection is overloaded.

41
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,490
Coping with these situations is the job of the

42
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,410
transport layer. And lastly at the highest level, we

43
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:16,270
have the application layer, which includes application specific protocols,

44
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:20,340
such as HTTP for web, SMTP for mail, etc.

45
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,450
The relationship between these layers is mostly one of

46
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,940
using. The link layer uses the physical layer to

47
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,360
accomplish its goal of enabling point-to-point communication across a

48
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,070
shared medium. The network layer uses the link layer

49
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,480
to accomplish its goal of end-to-end communication between two

50
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,580
machines on the internet. The transport layer uses the network

51
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:43,280
layer to accomplish its goal of reliable end-to-end communication

52
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,570
between applications. And the application layer uses the transport layer

53
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,100
to accomplish its goal, whatever it may be, whether

54
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,880
it's fetching a website, sending an email, or streaming a

55
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,750
movie. The plan for this lesson will be to

56
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,910
start at the bottom layer and move our way up.
