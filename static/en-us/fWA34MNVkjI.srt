00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,320
So let's do it, lets make a scatter plot. To make it easier, on the X axis,

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,751
we'll say that the miles are in 10,000's. So 60,000 will correspond to say, 6

3
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:15,790
on this axis and the value of the car we'll say is in 1000's. Click where on

4
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,170
this graph these points belong.
