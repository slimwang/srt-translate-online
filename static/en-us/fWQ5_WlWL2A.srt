1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,820
It's good to find a community
in anything big you do.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,350
Be part of the scene for your industry.

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:09,670
Follow, and hopefully one day also be
followed by, the right investors or

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,620
competitors in your industry.

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:16,090
Be active in relevant online groups and
contribute to them when you can.

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,950
These people are your support for
improving and promoting your app.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,630
In terms of your image,

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,950
framing yourself as a thought leader
in the industry is a wonderful idea.

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,510
You'll need to share your thoughts,

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,370
if you want people to trust
you as a thought leader.

11
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,680
Consider running your own blog and
sharing your knowledge.

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,000
This process is not just about
promoting your product left and around.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,980
It's also about becoming
a trusted expert.

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,980
>> For example,
if your product is a bike desk,

15
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,030
your blog can cover things
beyond just the bike.

16
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,370
Topics like cycling as a sport,
either outdoor or indoor.

17
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,950
This tells your followers that you
know what you're talking about when it

18
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,200
comes to cycling.

19
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,340
You can write about
fitness in general or

20
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:59,430
healthy habits to show that I can
trust you to give me lifestyle advice,

21
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,250
including just being
active at my own desk.

22
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,470
Consider publishing ongoing
pieces of content, to highlight

23
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,250
your professionalism in the industry and
promote your online visibility.

24
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,080
This will help both your SEO and
your social presence.

25
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,060
>> Some of the most useful groups,
I would say, are groups that are really

26
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:21,220
really targeted to use on part of
this five person group, of people who

27
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,860
are in the share economy, like budding
entrepreneurs in the share economy.

28
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,380
And then you can really have the
conversation you want to have, right?

29
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:32,350
So those have worked better for
me than just on-line forums or

30
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,030
these big communities.

31
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,890
>> I want you take a few minutes to
explore on-line groups that you'd like

32
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,130
to be active in.

33
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,850
Start thinking about what it means
to really become a thought leader in

34
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:41,810
the field.

35
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,790
And think about your plan to get there.

36
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:44,650
When you're ready,

37
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:48,830
write two blog titles that you'd
like to write in the blanks below.

38
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,130
After you've come up with your titles,

39
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,060
go to the forums and outline what these
blog posts will cover and then you'll

40
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,930
have an opportunity to get feedback
from some of your peers in the course.
