1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
How do we even get started?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
One of the common tricks for a school or exam or test questions

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
is to work from the bottom, up

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and see if there's extra information you can glean.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
(x + something) has to be equal to (z)--ah, not super handy yet.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Something is exactly equal to "hello".

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Well, wait--right up here we assigned: y = "hello".

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So as long as I don't overwrite (y) with 2, this should totally work:

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
y = "hello" because we just did the assignment

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
a few lines up.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
All right. Now let's take a look at the rest of these.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I need to add something to (x)--to get (z)

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
that suggests that (x) is smaller than (z)

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
because we don't have any negative numbers to play with in this example.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So I'm going to have to add something like 1 or 2 or whatnot to (x) to get (z).

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Well, if I really think that (x) is less than (z),

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
then this line is probably True.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But in order for this to print out True and not give some sort of error,

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm going to have to assign to the value (x) and the value (z) before I get here.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So one of these will have to be (x) and one of them will have to be (z).

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Since I want (x) to be smaller,

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
let's try this out: (x) is 1; (z) is 2.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
All right. So then 1 is Less Than 2--that's going to be True.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
y = "hello"--that's going to be True.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And now we have: print x + (something) is equal to z.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Well, (x) is 1 and (z) is 2, so we'd really like to just write "1" in here--

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
but remember the rules of this puzzle--

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
we can only write x, y, or z so we'll write another (x).

29
00:01:23,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Since (x) is 1, (1 + 1) equals 2.
