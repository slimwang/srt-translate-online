00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,173
>> Its been pretty easy to see what the factors of these terms with only

2
00:00:04,173 --> 00:00:08,879
variables in them are, but what if we have a number instead? An integer factor

3
00:00:08,879 --> 00:00:13,494
of a number goes into that number, an integer number of times without leaving a

4
00:00:13,494 --> 00:00:18,239
remainder. So, this is a number that we can divide evenly into another number.

5
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:23,439
So, for example, since 8 is equal to 4 times 2, 4 and 2 are both factors of 8.

6
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:29,229
So, for example, what are all the factors of 6? Please fill in those four

7
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:30,365
numbers here.
