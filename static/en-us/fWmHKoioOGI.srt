We know that i equals the square root of negative 1. This must mean that if we

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:10,400
square i then that means we would square the square root of negative 1. We know

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,294
that this power and this square root undo one another. So we would just be left

4
00:00:14,294 --> 00:00:18,744
with negative 1. Knowing that i squared equals negative 1, wouldn't you think

5
00:00:18,744 --> 00:00:24,237
the square root of negative 4 times the square root of negative 9 would equal?
