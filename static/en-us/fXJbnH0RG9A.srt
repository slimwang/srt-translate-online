1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,040
So here's the main idea of this algorithm called RANSAC.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:04,850
Fitting a line,

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:09,580
a model, is easy if we know which points belong to that model and which do not.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,500
At which point I wrote, duh.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,090
Yeah. A little more interesting.

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,320
Now if I had proposed a particular model, a particular line, we could probably

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,480
guess, in a whole bunch of points, which of those points come from that line, or

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,600
come from that model, and those are called inliers.

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,310
That is, they come from the model.

10
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:30,480
The algorithm Random Sample Consensus works as follows, and

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,100
we're going to go through this.

12
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,310
Randomly picks some points to define your mo-,

13
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,490
Line or your model.

14
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:37,320
Okay?

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,500
Then, repeat this enough times till you find a good one.

16
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,310
And what does it mean by a good one?

17
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,500
A good one is one that has many inliers.

18
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,490
That is, a lot of points are from that line.

19
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,910
And you might think that this is a.

20
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:53,930
Hopeless idea.

21
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,810
Just randomly picking things and, and computing them and hoping that you get.

22
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,740
Well it turns out that actually as was shown by Fischer and

23
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,560
Bolles way back in the dark ages of the universe 1981.

24
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:09,020
That actually this copes with a very large proportion of outliers very well.

25
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,880
I'll also tell you that Marty Fischer was my first boss after my PhD,

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,180
and Bob Bolles sort of taught me the ways of the force, or

27
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,710
of computer vision after 1981.

28
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,140
But not that many years after.
