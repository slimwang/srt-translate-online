00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,650
Hi, I'm Paul Bakaus and
I'm a Developer Advocate at Google.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,570
In my previous role as Studio CTO
at Zinga, it's my full time job

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,030
to have my team tool up to be as
productive and happy as possible.

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,020
>> And I'm James Williams.

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,670
A Course Developer here at Udacity,
where I make Android and web courses.

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,840
In the next few lessons, we're
going to teach how do you use tools.

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,010
Okay, not these tools, but these tools,
to help you become a better and

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,450
more efficient web developer whether
you're just starting out, or

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,090
have been around for
a while and want to freshen up.

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,452
>> So, how are we going to do this?

11
00:00:29,452 --> 00:00:32,740
>> You're going to stay here and
translate all the tooling mumbo jumbo

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,770
into English, and
explain the ideas and concepts.

13
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,191
>> Well, then you have to make sure
that all the material stays in long term

14
00:00:40,191 --> 00:00:42,257
memory by quizzing our students and
so on.

15
00:00:42,257 --> 00:00:43,850
Now, here's a quick disclaimer.

16
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,110
I promise you come out here supercharged
and more productive than ever.

17
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,100
It's going to involve a lot of
fiddling with the terminal,

18
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,810
a lot of keyboard shortcuts and
general groundwork.

19
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,460
Or guard work, I should say,
but we'll get to that later.

20
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,870
But we'll try to spicy it
up as much as possible.

21
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,540
>> All right, let's talk about
what you'll learn in this course.

22
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,910
We'll kick it off with setting
up your developing environment,

23
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,550
to achieve that perfect flow.

24
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,650
>> Finally, let's get you a coworker
that you can delegate tasks to,

25
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,180
your built process.

26
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,630
And then we'll dive into all
the things our fellow is good at.

27
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:14,460
Expressive life coding,
preventing yourself from disasters, and

28
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,890
saving a lot of time and
effort with automatic optimizations.

29
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:18,650
>> So let's get going.
