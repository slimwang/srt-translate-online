1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,276
But we're not really going to talk much about doing this inverse part.

2
00:00:03,276 --> 00:00:06,891
Instead we're going to talk about how the Fourier transform shows you

3
00:00:06,891 --> 00:00:09,170
what's going on in frequency.

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,840
So, suppose I have a function, and here's a function.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,000
And suppose this is this noisy signal.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,170
I want a nice smooth version of it.

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:18,850
Right.

8
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,670
So how might I do that?

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,918
Well, we learned before that you might blur it with,

10
00:00:22,918 --> 00:00:25,400
let's say, a Gaussian kernel.

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,350
Okay, and what does it mean to blur it with a Gaussian kernel?

12
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,980
We're going to convolve the underlying image with that Gaussian.

13
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:38,520
But it turns out the Fourier transform of a Gaussian is a Gaussian.

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,310
All right.

15
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:40,265
And that's what this shows here.

16
00:00:40,265 --> 00:00:44,288
So the Fourier transform, if this is h of x, this is h of u,

17
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:46,105
it's another Gaussian.

18
00:00:46,105 --> 00:00:49,695
But you'll notice that here it's over sigma squared and

19
00:00:49,695 --> 00:00:52,720
here's it's times sigma squared.

20
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,810
Okay. And that's what this is trying to show you here is that if I have this

21
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:00,140
Gaussian kernel with a variance sigma squared then I get a new Gaussian, and

22
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,980
I apologize, this is an awfully drawn Gaussian,

23
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:07,260
I get a Gaussian whose variance is 1 over sigma squared.

24
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,280
Now, if you think about that, that make a little bit of sense, right?

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,310
First of all, let's think of a really, really skinny Gaussian.

26
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,000
All right, like, almost an impulse.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,100
Remember, when you convolve a function with impulse,

28
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,240
you get back the original function?

29
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,280
So that means you basically keep all the frequencies.

30
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,640
So if my kernel was a very tight little Gaussian,

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,410
I would expect to be able to keep all the frequencies I've, oops, don't,

32
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,659
there we go, I expect to be able to get almost all of the frequencies back.

33
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,830
Likewise, let's suppose my kernel was really, really fat.

34
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,870
Blurs the heck out of everything.

35
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:49,600
Well then, I would expect to get hardly any high frequency and

36
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,010
only to get a very, only the, the low frequencies.

37
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:56,226
And that's why the Fourier transform, that's one way of thinking about it,

38
00:01:56,226 --> 00:01:59,130
that the Fourier transform of a fat Gaussian is a skinny one,

39
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,730
and the Fourier transform of a skinny Gaussian is a fat one.

40
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,940
Remember, they, they go back and forth.

41
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,810
All right.

42
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,130
So, what's going to happen when we blur this

43
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:11,860
function with the Gaussian is we're going to

44
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:17,670
multiply its Fourier transform by the Fourier transform of that Gaussian.

45
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,190
And what it's going to do is, it's going to keep the low values and

46
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,970
it's going to lower down the higher frequencies.

47
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,290
It's going to reduce the higher frequencies by doing that multiplication.

48
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,360
And we say that that means that it attenuates, that's the word we use,

49
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,580
it attenuates the high frequencies.
