I've recorded three different traces of the same page. The

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,250
only difference is how I've included the JavaScript. In one

00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,100
of these traces, I've used the blocking script tag. In

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,270
another, I've inlined the script, and in the last one, I've

00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,700
used the script tag with the async attribute. Take a

00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,500
look at the sequence of the events here and try to

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,020
figure out which is which. Once you know the answer,

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,960
just write down blocking, inline, or async in the boxes below.
