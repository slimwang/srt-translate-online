1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So, now we've learned about independence,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
and the corresponding Bayes network has 2 nodes.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
They're just not connected at all.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And we learned about conditional independence,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
in which case we have a Bayes network that looks like this.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Now I would like to know whether absolute independence

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
implies conditional independence.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
True or false?

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And I'd also like to know whether conditional independence implies absolute independence.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Again, true or false?
