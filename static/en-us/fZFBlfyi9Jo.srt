00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,100
In the previous lesson, we finally got
to play around with our apartment and

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,720
bring it to life with animation.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,700
Now how do we take that beautiful
scene and actually view it in VR?

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,560
Well, we use a game object
component called a camera.

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,200
Just like in the real world, a camera is
a tool we use to capture our world and

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,039
show it to users.

7
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,500
With Unity,
instead of capturing the real world,

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,630
we capture virtual ones
like our lovely apartment.

9
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,850
Like any game object, we can
translate and rotate our camera and

10
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,759
this allows us to control
what the user sees.

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,460
And just like the real world,
positioning our virtual camera

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,650
is important in order to show users
exactly what we want them to see.

13
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,980
Otherwise, we might show them
something we didn't intend.

14
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,600
Camera's are super important and

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,450
without them, we literally would not
be able to see any of our masterpiece.

16
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,560
Let's check out how we can use them
