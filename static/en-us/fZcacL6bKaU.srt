1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,000
As in the previous lessons,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,990
we will be using the iPython Notebook to perform the analysis.

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:12,320
Look in the instructor's notes if you have any further questions as to how to

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,940
get started with the notebook for this lesson.

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,200
We now set up some of the libraries that we will need to use for this lesson.

6
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:27,020
We're going to use seaborn and matplotlib for plotting.

7
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:31,600
We're going to use pandas for handling the data set.

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:37,446
If you scroll down further, you will see a file in the medicare data folder.

9
00:00:37,446 --> 00:00:42,456
That says Medicare_Data_IL_2012.csv.

10
00:00:42,456 --> 00:00:46,280
This is a comma separated variable file.

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,390
We created this file especially for

12
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,470
you so that you don't have to use the entire dataset.

13
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:56,370
If you're interested in using the entire dataset.

14
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,890
Use this commented out codes here to load the entire dataset.

15
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:07,330
Now use the reads CSV library from pandas to read the data and

16
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,280
load it into a data frame.

17
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,530
As before, to run this piece of code, we just use the play button here.

18
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,488
Once the dataset is finished loading you will receive a message like this.

19
00:01:21,488 --> 00:01:27,710
The f_IL is the pandas dataframe.

20
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,320
We can use the describe function to look at a summary of this data.

21
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,740
Let's run this piece of code.

22
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:40,580
Once this finishes running you should have a table that looks like this.

23
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:47,600
The total number of events we have in the data frame is 387,623.

24
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,080
You can slide this bar here to look at the rest of the table.

25
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,560
Now let's look at the top five lines of the data frame.

26
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,350
We can do that by using the head command.
