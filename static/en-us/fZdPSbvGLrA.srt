00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,400
This quiz is actually asking
you to go through this code,

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,310
and see exactly what it's doing.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,330
So, where is that data?

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,310
Is it on the stack In the stack
frame that we just talked about.

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,020
If the answer is yes, then you check it.

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,500
If the answer is no,
then you don't check it.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,220
So you go through each line.

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:26,880
Understand what the code in that line
is doing, and what data it's accessing.

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,240
If you think it's accessing data
on the stack, then you check it.
