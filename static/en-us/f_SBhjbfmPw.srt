1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,720
And again we're picking the top line.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:09,120
The value of b is the y-value when x is zero.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,990
So when x is zero, this thing over here is the value of b.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,790
And is the largest for the top graph.

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,236
And is actually negative for the bottom curve.

6
00:00:20,236 --> 00:00:24,110
So this is slope and intercept.
