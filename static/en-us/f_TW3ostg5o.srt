1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,050
Let's get to handling our
second integration point,

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,710
between the application and the user.

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:11,170
In particular, we allow for
free form text entry of the location.

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,980
That means there are multiple ways
the user can get something wrong.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,800
The user can input text that doesn't
actually resolve to a location or

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,660
the user can input text that resolves
to a different location than they

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,380
are expecting.

8
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,520
We're going to look at
handling the first problem,

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,540
the user inputting text that
doesn't resolve to a location.

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,140
The second problem is a bit trickier.

11
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,300
Many users use ZIP codes to set
their location, because we use that,

12
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,500
by default, in our application.

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,430
One of the fascinating parts about the
world's postal system is the fact that

14
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:44,870
postal codes tend to be unique within
each country, rather than truly unique.

15
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,000
As a result, sometimes a postal
code in which was intended for

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,220
location in the United States will
return information for a location

17
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:55,300
outside the United States, even if
the postal code is properly written.

18
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,090
In addition,
there are often cities around the world

19
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,670
that share the same name.

20
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,090
Unless the user types in the entire
name, including state, province, and

21
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:05,019
country, we may get this wrong as well.

22
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:07,860
Note that we currently have
a function that maps the location.

23
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,630
So, a determined user can find out where
their weather search is geolocated.
