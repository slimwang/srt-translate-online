00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,320
Take a moment now to
find the latitude and

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,980
longitude of an interesting place like
maybe your home town and make an app

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,460
that sets the initial location
of the map to those coordinates.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,310
Feel free to play around with some
of the other map attributes too.

5
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:15,135
You could post a screenshot
of your app in the forum.

6
00:00:15,135 --> 00:00:16,945
You can find latitude and longitude for

7
00:00:16,945 --> 00:00:21,565
a location in Google Maps by looking
at its URL field, or you can drop a pin

8
00:00:21,565 --> 00:00:24,145
onto your map and you'll see
the latitude and longitude right there.
