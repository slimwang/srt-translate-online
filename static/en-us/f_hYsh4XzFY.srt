1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,730
So let's take a look at the code at this new method, greetByPeriod to

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,039
application. So, here I'm in Hello world

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,760
and poin.java, I've defined my new function greetByPeriod.

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,161
Still got the name argument, and it's

5
00:00:15,161 --> 00:00:18,990
got a named period argument, period. And just

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,570
for variety, although the name is @Named

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,080
period. I'm calling the argument time of day,

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,900
just to show that whatever the @Named is what is required to be specified

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:37,400
in the request. And I'm all doing here is returning new HelloClass name, time of

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,910
day. HelloClass class, didn't actually have this

11
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,790
constructor, so I added it, it's pretty

12
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,400
simple. Here's the new construction HelloClass. Pass

13
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,000
the name, the period, construct a new message,

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,520
good, this would be morning, let's say, good morning

15
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,720
Lauren. Good morning Lauren. Okay, so let's see if it

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,380
works. I'm going to run it on the dev

17
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,150
server, save my changes, it's always a good thing to

18
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,290
do. Mkay, let's go over to the local host

19
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,500
in the browser. And I'm going to go straight to

20
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,960
the API's explorer. Oh goodness, got an error, that

21
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,082
never happens. Failed to retrieve API configs with status: 500.

22
00:01:17,082 --> 00:01:20,500
All right, first instinct panic, second instinct go

23
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,360
back and check the code. And you see I

24
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,570
got the error showing up here too, Failed

25
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,950
to retrieve API configs. That means there is something

26
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,320
wrong with my end point function. Let's look

27
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,040
at hello world end points greetByPeriod all looks good,

28
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,880
what's the problem? Aha, it's a copy and

29
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,270
paste error. See here, I copy and pasted this

30
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,130
from the previous method sayHelloByName. And I

31
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,140
forgot to update the function name. So I'll

32
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,070
just fix that real quick. You can't have

33
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,090
two functions exposed with the same name. Actually

34
00:01:55,090 --> 00:02:00,870
greet by period. Save it. And actually when you make changes in the Java code

35
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,140
and you save it. You'll usually find that

36
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,820
the changes get automatically propagated out to localhost.

37
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,360
See it says, reloading the web application, a

38
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,040
file has changed. So I don't need to

39
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,070
run it again. I'll just go straight to

40
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,870
local host, reload the APIs Explorer. Okay good.

41
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:24,550
This time it worked. Now drill down into my API. Here's my new one, greet by

42
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:31,000
period. Enter a name. And it's the afternoon

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,430
now. And then let's look at the response.

44
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,677
There it is. Good afternoon. And then Good afternoon Buttercup, because

45
00:02:37,677 --> 00:02:42,398
Buttercup's the name I gave. So one other thing to look at is the code for

46
00:02:42,398 --> 00:02:48,129
index.html and hello.js. Take a quick look

47
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:53,918
at those, index.html. Really what we had to do was add the,

48
00:02:53,918 --> 00:02:59,260
the new imput field for period is called Period_Field and

49
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,860
the new button for the greeting and in Hello.js.

50
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,520
And enable buttons that we needed to enable to

51
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,420
function for the new button. Here's the new button,

52
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,460
input greetByPeriod. We're going to call the function greetByPeriod. We're going

53
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,073
to update the button label. Now we have to

54
00:03:17,073 --> 00:03:19,408
define greet by period and here it is, it's

55
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,654
very similar to greet by name. But we get

56
00:03:21,654 --> 00:03:24,328
the name field, we get the value of the name

57
00:03:24,328 --> 00:03:26,407
out of the HTML, we get the period

58
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:29,650
out of the period field element. You construct

59
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,640
the request. And here we're calling the greetByPeriod

60
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,810
function. And then we're specifying the argument. The

61
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,920
arguments are name and period. Now because we've

62
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,620
called the period, we've named the period argument,

63
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,527
at period. This must exactly match. And then

64
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:50,133
we execute it and we call the sayHelloCallBack

65
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:54,330
as before. And again, it throws up an alert dialog box showing

66
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,300
us the message in the response. So, that's all there is to it.
