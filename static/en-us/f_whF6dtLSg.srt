00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,240
The final step in the data prep process
is to inspect the quality of the data.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,539
This is particularly important for
missing data and outliers.

3
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:12,299
These concepts are covered
in our related courses,

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,019
linked in the instructor notes,
so I won't repeat them here.

5
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:18,699
However the same consideration
should be made for

6
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:22,169
these as with any other
statistical process.

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,692
But it is important to keep in mind
though, that since the concept of

8
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:30,140
distance is so important when
creating clusters, how far out

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,820
the outliers are can have a significant
impact on the clustering process.
