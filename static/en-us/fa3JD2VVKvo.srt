00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,624
The relationship between these two functions we've been talking about has a

2
00:00:03,624 --> 00:00:08,636
special name. They are inverse functions of one another. As I said before, just

3
00:00:08,636 --> 00:00:11,964
looking at these equations, you might not have any idea right off the bat that

4
00:00:11,964 --> 00:00:16,750
these functions are inverses. To help make that more clear immediately, there's

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:21,294
a special notation we can use. Let's say that we have a function that we're

6
00:00:21,294 --> 00:00:25,663
calling f. Then if f has an inverse, we can write that inverse like this, f

7
00:00:25,663 --> 00:00:30,628
with a little negative 1 up here to the right. Now we have to be super careful,

8
00:00:30,628 --> 00:00:37,062
when we use this notation. This does not, I repeat, does not mean 1 over f. The

9
00:00:37,062 --> 00:00:41,384
negative 1 here is not an exponent. You read this as f inverse, not f to the

10
00:00:41,384 --> 00:00:46,048
negative 1. To make sure that we're keeping everything straight. Now, let's

11
00:00:46,048 --> 00:00:51,875
suppose that f, in this case, is f of x equals 3x minus 1. Right away, we can

12
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:56,390
plug in values for x to figure out different points on the line. I'll just pick

13
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:01,843
out a few for right now. We have 0 comma negative 1. 1 comma 2, and negative 1

14
00:01:01,843 --> 00:01:06,527
comma negative 4. We don't know the equation for the inverse of f quite yet,

15
00:01:06,527 --> 00:01:09,587
but we do know that we can denote it like this, and we actually know quite a

16
00:01:09,587 --> 00:01:15,320
bit more information about this, because of these points here. Based on the

17
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,785
information we have about the function f, what points do we know will lie on f

18
00:01:18,785 --> 00:01:23,335
inverse? Below each of these points that lie on f, Please write the

19
00:01:23,335 --> 00:01:26,349
corresponding points on f inverse.
