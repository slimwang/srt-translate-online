1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,620
It's often convenient to build
different Variants of your app.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,890
A free version, and a pay version
is the most obvious example, but

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,750
you also want a de-bug version of your
app for development purposes, and

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,200
a release version for when your
app is ready for the play store.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,010
Instead of constantly needing to
maintain separate code-bases for

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:20,060
every Variant, we can simply write the
code that is unique to each Variant and

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,259
Gradle will take care of the rest.

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:27,380
A Build Variant is a cross product
of two components, a Build Type and

9
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,960
a Product Flavor.

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,100
The two are mechanically similar,
but conceptually orthogonal.

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,500
Build Types are typically
transparent to users and

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,065
are only important to
you as a developer,

13
00:00:37,065 --> 00:00:41,070
whereas Product Flavors control
features that are visible to end users.

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,240
Build Types are used to control
how our app is built and packaged.

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:49,580
By default, every Android app has
two Build Types, debug and release.

16
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,850
As the name implies, Debug Build Type is
primarily used during development, and

17
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,580
the Release Build Type is for
production.

18
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,590
Also, by default, the Debug Build Type
is compiled with debug symbols and

19
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:05,050
signed with a debug key, which allows
us to install on a development device.

20
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:08,310
You can also define additional
Build Types, for example, for

21
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,100
quality assurance testing.

22
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,870
Product Flavors are used to create
Variants that will be user facing.

23
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:17,860
Product Flavors will typically map one
to one with a place door download.

24
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:22,070
A very common case is an app
with free and paid versions.

25
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:26,480
Together, Build Types and Product
Flavors create a matrix of Variants.

26
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,570
With Debug and Release Build Types, and

27
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:32,850
free and paid flavors,
you get a two by two matrix of Variants.

28
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,740
In this case, we have Variants.

29
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,370
Free Release and free Debug, and
paid Release and paid Debug.

30
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,600
Let's check out how to declare and
configure Build Types and

31
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,900
Product Flavors in our Gradle build.
