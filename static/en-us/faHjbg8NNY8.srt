>> Well, when I look at the points, I note that the Y values are all the same. Y

2
00:00:04,659 --> 00:00:09,523
is always equal to negative 3, it doesn't matter what x is. So the equation for

3
00:00:09,523 --> 00:00:14,373
this horizontal line is y equals negative 3. And remember, we have a flat line

4
00:00:14,373 --> 00:00:19,015
here so the slope must be zero. It has lots of run but no rise. This quiz was

5
00:00:19,015 --> 00:00:22,604
pretty tough. I know I haven't taught you how to write the equation of a line,

6
00:00:22,604 --> 00:00:25,075
so don't worry if you didn't get it right on the first try.
