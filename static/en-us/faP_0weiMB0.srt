1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,370
Second, will need to add a few
things to the Android Manifest.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,080
GCM requires several permissions.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,060
Sunshine is actually already requesting
one of these which is Internet, which we

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:15,130
obviously will use to communicate
with Google and with our fake server.

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,890
So, we can go and
check this one off the list.

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,290
The next permission is Wakelock,

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,220
which is technically optional
depending on whether you want to keep

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,410
the processor from sleeping
when you receive a message.

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,022
We are going to include it however,
because the receiver that we will use to

10
00:00:30,022 --> 00:00:33,400
get the downstream messages
is the provided GCM receiver,

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,640
which extends from
WakefulBroadcastReceiver.

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,610
Unless you intend to write
your own receiver and

13
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,450
to not use a WakefullBroadcastReceiver,
this permission is not optional for you.

14
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:48,220
The Receive permission is what allows
our app to register to receive messages.

15
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,270
So you obviously need this one.

16
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,660
And finally, the message permission
is a custom permission made

17
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,980
using our package name so that no other
Android app can register to receive

18
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,910
messages intended for our app.

19
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,340
Those sneaky little eavesdroppers.

20
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,700
So first you'll need to actually
declare the permission.

21
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,390
And then you can register to use it.

22
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,395
Beyond the permissions,

23
00:01:08,395 --> 00:01:12,350
we'll need to inform the app of four
new classes that we will be using.

24
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,280
The first is a declaration
of GCM receiver

25
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,610
which handles downstream messages
sent via GCM to your app.

26
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,840
Because the service wants to receive
messages only from the GCM framework,

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,330
add the send permission for
Google Cloud Messaging to the receiver.

28
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,290
Note that we aren't requesting
a permission here but

29
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,400
requiring one instead.

30
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,200
Requiring this permission means that
anything trying to send a message to

31
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,630
this receiver must provide
the send permission which

32
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,290
ultimately protects our receiver
from bugging and senders.

33
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,679
If you want to support
pre 4.4 KitKat devices,

34
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:50,140
you'll need to add an additional action
not just for receiving but now also for

35
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,940
registration to the intent filter
declaration for this receiver.

36
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,490
But once you have all of this,
you're good to go on this declaration.

37
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,750
Then we have a declaration of
a GcmListenerService which enable

38
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,320
various aspects of handling messages
such as detecting different downstream

39
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,230
message types,
determining upstream send status, and

40
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:11,620
automatically displaying simple
notifications on the app's behalf.

41
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,690
And that is our second class down.

42
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:18,340
Finally, we have to create a service
that extends InstanceIDListenerService

43
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,710
to handle the creation, rotation and
updating of registration tokens.

44
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,250
So this is a big one.

45
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,410
These are all of the required
classes that we need.

46
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,997
However, I am also going to have
you add one more declaration for

47
00:02:29,997 --> 00:02:32,730
a helper service,
which we will discuss later.
