00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,030
With your editor and

2
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:05,920
your browser output side by side, you'll
need to do a lot less context switching.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,760
Usually you'll need to reload the page
manually and trigger the build process

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,580
again after you've made some
changes to the source code.

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,660
If your build system is doing this for
you, you can save a lot of time.

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,510
While the actual time of the rebuild or

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,200
reload of your page doesn't change,
the reload is done automatically.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,720
So, by the time you focus on the output,

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,930
you've saved a couple of
seconds of contact switching.

10
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,150
Even though it might feel faster
due to the automatic reloads,

11
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,730
the build process
actually isn't sped up.

12
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:35,230
It's your brain.
