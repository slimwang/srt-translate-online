1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So let's start coding this up.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
There's our first grammar rule, expression goes to expression + expression.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Our second grammar rule, very similar but for the minus.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
All right, so here I actually have quite a bit of Python code,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and we're going to walk through it together, and then you're going to

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
help me finish it out, so here's our definition of our grammar.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It has 4 rewrite rules, and where I'm going to need your help

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
is given a list of tokens and a grammar,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I want to find all possible ways to expand it using those rules.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let me just show you what I mean by that.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Here's our grammar again, and let's say that we started with "a exp."

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I would want us to come out with "a exp + exp,"

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
"a exp - exp," "a ( exp )," and "a num."

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
For each of these possible token positions and for each grammar rule,

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
we removed the starting token and replaced it with the right-hand side of the grammar rule.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This is the way we're going to enumerate all of the valid strings in the grammar.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Now, you'll notice that I've made more expressions in many of these cases,

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
so I could go from here and start and expand it again

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and get a few more strings until eventually I'm full entirely of terminals.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm going to call the number of times I do this the depth.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
If we start with a exp and we expand it to depth 1,

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
we get 4 new utterances, 4 new sentences.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You're going to have to help me write that expansion procedure.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Down here I've got some code to help us print it out.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
For now, we're only going to enumerate things up to a depth of 1,

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and we're going to start with just expression,

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and then we're going to use your expand procedure to make many more utterances,

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
many more sentences starting from expression, probably 4 more,

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
so then we'll have a total of 5, and then at the end of the day

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
we print them all out.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
If you do it correctly, this is the output you expect to see,

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
our original sentence, but then it's been expanded

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
with 4 more, expression + expression, expression - expression,

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
open expression close and num.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And in fact, if we go back up here and change this to a exp,

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
the example we worked through in the comments,

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
we get the expected output.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
A is unchanged because there's no rewrite rule in our grammar for dealing with it,

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
but a exp becomes a expression + expression, a expression - expression,

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
a open expression close, and a num.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Your job, submit via the interpreter the correct definition

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
for the expand procedure so that it does this.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Here's a hint. You're going to need yield with high probability,

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
and you may also want to end up using list comprehensions.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
By the way, this is a very tricky quiz.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
This is not easy to get right the first time,

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
so you should not feel bad if something goes wrong.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Give this your all, but it is very difficult compared to what we've been up to so far.
