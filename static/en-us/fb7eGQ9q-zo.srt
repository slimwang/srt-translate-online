00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,768
The Intermediate Value Theorem gives us some really fundamental information

2
00:00:03,768 --> 00:00:07,960
then, about how to find zeros in curves without breaks in them. We just need to

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,315
look for regions of the graph where y values switch from being positive to

4
00:00:11,315 --> 00:00:16,300
being negative, or from being negative to being positive. In either case, the

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,450
curve must have at least one x intercept somewhere in that region that we're

6
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:23,648
looking at. This is pretty general information, though. And the intermediate

7
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:27,990
value theorem can actually help us even more. In fact, Athena used it on the

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,276
train in a very clever way. One day, Athena needed to catch the train in

9
00:00:32,276 --> 00:00:36,688
Mountain View. She had been visiting the Udacity office for the afternoon. Now,

10
00:00:36,688 --> 00:00:40,322
to find out what time her train would leave, she called her brother, Nicos. All

11
00:00:40,322 --> 00:00:43,562
he could tell her was that the train would come to Mountain View sometime

12
00:00:43,562 --> 00:00:48,490
between 4pm and 6pm. This information wasn't quite accurate enough for Athena.

13
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,716
She wanted to be able to plan her afternoon a bit more precisely. So she looked

14
00:00:51,716 --> 00:00:55,420
up the schedule for the train. Much to Athena's disappointment, somehow, the

15
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,300
one departure time that was missing from the train schedule was the time that

16
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,617
the train would leave Mountain View. We have the times for every other stop

17
00:01:02,617 --> 00:01:05,972
listed, and the stops are written in order here, just like we saw on the map

18
00:01:05,972 --> 00:01:11,310
earlier. Staring in San Jose and then moving north along the track. Based on

19
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,885
this schedule, Athena knows a window of time within which the train will leave

20
00:01:14,885 --> 00:01:18,100
from Mountain View. What is that window?
