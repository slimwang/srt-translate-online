1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,884
We need to formalize how we will precisely measure each type of variability. We

2
00:00:05,884 --> 00:00:10,483
already decided that we're going to use the grand mean, and use the same idea

3
00:00:10,483 --> 00:00:17,143
as standard deviation to measure the spread of the sample means. We'll find

4
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:22,687
each square deviation from the mean. And in this case we're going to multiply

5
00:00:22,687 --> 00:00:28,717
each square deviation by the sample size. Each square deviation is equivalent

6
00:00:28,717 --> 00:00:34,283
to the area of each of these squares. And then we'll mulitiply this area by

7
00:00:34,283 --> 00:00:40,482
their respective sample size. Here K represents the number of samples. That

8
00:00:40,482 --> 00:00:45,834
means we'll have K sample means. And then we'll add them all up. In this lesson

9
00:00:45,834 --> 00:00:51,244
though, we're assuming that all samples have the same size. So, we can get rid

10
00:00:51,244 --> 00:00:56,556
of the K. n is just a constant across all samples. That means that we can write

11
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:02,012
the numerator between group variability like this. And then we divide by the

12
00:01:02,012 --> 00:01:07,015
degrees of freedom. When we say formal way of measuring something, that means

13
00:01:07,015 --> 00:01:12,334
we get one number. If we add up each squared deviation of each sample mean from

14
00:01:12,334 --> 00:01:16,754
the grand mean, multiply this by the sample size and then divide by the degrees

15
00:01:16,754 --> 00:01:24,016
of freedom. We get one number that describes between group variability. We need

16
00:01:24,016 --> 00:01:28,826
to do the same for within group variability. And we'll do something similar to

17
00:01:28,826 --> 00:01:33,742
the way we measured between group variability. We'll take the sum of squares

18
00:01:33,742 --> 00:01:37,837
for each individual sample from the mean of each sample, and then we'll divide

19
00:01:37,837 --> 00:01:43,328
by the degrees of freedom. What do you think the degrees of freedom is in this

20
00:01:43,328 --> 00:01:48,186
case? Let's say that we have three samples. More than one option may be

21
00:01:48,186 --> 00:01:49,096
correct.
