1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,520
This example extends the UIView class
to enable a view to fade out and

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,810
fade back in.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,280
For this demo, we'll be looking
at a really simple Xcode project.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,190
Go ahead and download it from the link
in the instructor's notes, and

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:14,080
then open the project in Xcode.

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,780
It's called FadeExtensionDemo.

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:17,990
In this left panel,

8
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,360
the project navigator,
click on the ViewController file.

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,170
And then, look for
the sunrise and set method.

10
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,495
Here inside sunrise and set,
you can see that I'm using the method,

11
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:30,610
animateWithDuration, to
fade out an image view.

12
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,410
This animation changes the view's
alpha value from one to zero

13
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,040
over the duration that I
pass in as a parameter here.

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,680
This one is one second.

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,710
There's also a delay parameter, so
we could pass in a delay if we wanted.

16
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,000
Under the options parameter you'll
see we've passed in CurveEaseIn.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,950
This makes it so
that the animation starts out slow and

18
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,690
speeds up towards the end.

19
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,340
For the completion parameter,

20
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,800
I'm passing in some code
that changes the image.

21
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,690
And then, fades the view back in.

22
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:00,890
Here's the code that changes the image.

23
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,240
After the image is changed,

24
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,130
we're using animateWithDuration
again to fade the view back in.

25
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,250
You can see that this code for

26
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,670
fading the view back in is identical
to the code that phased it out.

27
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,850
Apart from the alpha value and
the completion parameter.

28
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,230
The syntax around this completion
parameter is pretty tricky.

29
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,680
So don't worry if it doesn't
make sense right now.

30
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,652
We'll talk more about completion
blocks in the next lesson on closures.

31
00:01:23,652 --> 00:01:26,440
I want to focus on another
problem with this code.

32
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,910
Soon I'll have another view that I'd
like to fade out and fade back in.

33
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,520
And I know I'd have
to rewrite this code.

34
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,290
That goes against my dry
programming principles.

35
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,610
But if I put this code in an extension,
I can reuse it.

36
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,365
So let's do that, since I can't add an
extension directly to the UIView Swift

37
00:01:43,365 --> 00:01:47,865
file, I'll make a new Swift file and
call it UIViewExtensions.

38
00:01:47,865 --> 00:01:51,445
To add a file to the project, I just
Ctrl+click on one of these folders,

39
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,705
over here in the project navigator,
and then I go to New File.

40
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,676
Then I want a Swift file.

41
00:02:00,424 --> 00:02:04,633
And again,
I'm going to call it UIViewExtensions.

42
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,120
Here we are in
the UIViewExtensions.swift file.

43
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,080
And the first thing you'll
need to do is import UIKit.

44
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,330
To define an extension,
you just write the word extension

45
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,780
followed by the name of
the type you're extending.

46
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,830
And in between curly braces,
the methods you'd like to add.

47
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,870
The methods we'd like to add
are called fadeOut and fadeIn.

48
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,300
Here in the fadeOut method,
we just want to copy and

49
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,750
paste some of the code from
that sunrise and set method.

50
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,850
So to do that we go back to
our ViewController.swift file.

51
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,150
And then,
we want to copy this fade out code,

52
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:46,360
this animateWithDuration code, up to but
not including the completion block.

53
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,080
Once you've got
animateWithDuration pasted in,

54
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,960
there are a couple snippets
of code we need to edit.

55
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:58,463
Here where it says self.imageView.alpha,
we want to replace that with self.alpha.

56
00:03:01,253 --> 00:03:03,914
Because the object that's
calling this code,

57
00:03:03,914 --> 00:03:06,580
self is the object whose
alpha needs to change.

58
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,720
Next, we need to make sure we're
passing in the necessary parameters.

59
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,260
So we'll pass the parameters
duration delay, and

60
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,995
the completion closure
into the fade out method.

61
00:03:17,995 --> 00:03:20,595
And then, we'll pass those
parameters again to the animate with

62
00:03:20,595 --> 00:03:21,845
duration method.

63
00:03:21,845 --> 00:03:25,785
So here, instead of one
second we'll put duration.

64
00:03:25,785 --> 00:03:29,824
Here, instead of a delay of
zero seconds we'll put delay.

65
00:03:29,824 --> 00:03:33,172
And then, under completion,
we'll put completion.

66
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,352
Notice that the animation option,

67
00:03:36,352 --> 00:03:40,252
CurveEaseIn is the same every
time fade out is called.

68
00:03:40,252 --> 00:03:42,683
And so, is the animation
changing the alpha to zero.
