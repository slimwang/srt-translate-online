00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,380
So far in this lesson,

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:04,810
when two repositories have gotten out
of sync, it's always been a matter of

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:08,780
one repository having commits that
the other doesn't, like in this case.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,279
What if both repositories have new
commits reachable from the same branch?

5
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:17,250
What do you think would happen if
you pulled or pushed in this case?

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,074
When you pulled earlier in the lesson,

7
00:00:19,074 --> 00:00:22,777
your local repository didn't have any
commits that the remote was missing, so

8
00:00:22,777 --> 00:00:25,335
pulling set your state to
the be the same as the remote.

9
00:00:25,335 --> 00:00:29,225
But if that happened in this case,
we would be losing this commit.

10
00:00:29,225 --> 00:00:32,085
So, what really happens
when you pull a branch?

11
00:00:32,085 --> 00:00:35,775
What you want is a combined
version of both of these branches.

12
00:00:35,775 --> 00:00:37,340
Does this sound familiar?

13
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:42,540
What you really want to do is merge the
local and remote versions of the branch.

14
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,440
We'll get into the details of
how that works soon once you

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,470
actually have some changes in
both repositories to incorporate.

16
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,390
For personal projects, this would only
happen in practice if you are working

17
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,850
from multiple different machines or

18
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,890
made some edits directly on GitHub and
others locally.

19
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,060
The more common reason for

20
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,180
an issue like this to come up is when
you're collaborating with others.

21
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,730
Caroline and
I will demonstrate collaboration, but

22
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,860
unfortunately, we don't have the time to
directly collaborate with each of you.

23
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,510
You'll follow along with Caroline's
side of the collaboration.

24
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:15,390
And when I make changes, you'll run
some code that we wrote to make it

25
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,610
look like I've made the same
changes in your repository.

26
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:21,600
We'll give instructions on how
to do this when the time comes.

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,310
First, you'll make a quick change
to one of the recipes locally.

28
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,620
After this video, you'll see
some instructions for doing so.
