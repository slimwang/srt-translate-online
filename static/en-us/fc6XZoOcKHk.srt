1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,810
The first statement,
new threats can be detected immediately,

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,730
this is false because a misuse detection
of signature-based detection system

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:14,160
can only detect attacks that match
patterns or rules of known intrusions.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,010
Second, when a new virus is identified,

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,750
it must be added to
the signature database.

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:20,805
This is true.

7
00:00:20,805 --> 00:00:26,230
Because a misused detection system
detects attacks based on signatures

8
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,580
of known intrusions, therefore
when a new attack is discovered,

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,320
its signature needs to be added
to the signature database.

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,440
Third, can only detect
an intrusion attempt

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,620
if it matches a pattern that is
in the database, this is true.

12
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:46,030
This is essentially the definition of
a signature-based detection system.
