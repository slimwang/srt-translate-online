1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,820
So the question for you is, how many messages

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,070
are exchanged among all the nodes for each lock

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:10,880
acquisition followed by a lock release? Every process, what

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,320
it is doing is making a lock request and

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,630
it follows the algorithm that we just mentioned, uses

6
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,070
the lock in the critical section. And once it

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,990
is done with that, it unlocks by sending messages

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,330
again as you saw. And the question to you

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,420
is, how many messages are exchanged among

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,850
all the nodes for each lock acquisition followed

11
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,950
by a lock release? That is, combination of

12
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,960
lock plus unlock. How many messages does it

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,110
generate? Is it N minus one messages? 2 to the n minus 1? Or 3

14
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,800
to the n minus 1, where n is, the number of nodes in the distributed system.
