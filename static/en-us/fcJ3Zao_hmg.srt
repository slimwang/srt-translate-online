Here is a simple example of creating threads with pthreads,

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,250
let's look at the main function first.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:12,460
We see that in a loop we create pthread_create a number of times or, and

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:19,050
we create four threads where each of the threads executes the function hello.

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,000
All this function does is print Hello Thread, it doesn't take any arguments and

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,340
that's why we pass NULL as a argument to the pthread creation function.

7
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,490
We also pass NULL in the attributes field because we're okay with

8
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,160
just using the default pthread's behavior.

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,810
That also means that these threads will be joinable, so

10
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,990
then we have to, in a loop, join every single one of these threads.
