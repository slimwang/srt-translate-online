00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,246
Psychologists use the general rule of 7 plus or minus 2 when referring to our

2
00:00:04,246 --> 00:00:10,425
ability to chunk information into units. Meaning 7 digits or 9 digits, that

3
00:00:10,425 --> 00:00:16,932
would be plus 2, or 5 digits, minus 2. So chunking is one way to remember

4
00:00:16,932 --> 00:00:20,906
things. But how do we get our short term memory to allow us to remember things

5
00:00:20,906 --> 00:00:25,814
such as phone numbers or directions to the mall? Or even the vocabulary words

6
00:00:25,814 --> 00:00:29,834
from this lesson? One theory by psychologist Alan Baddeley suggests that there

7
00:00:29,834 --> 00:00:34,100
are three processes involved in working memory. The first is attending to the

8
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,976
stimulus. That is, we're aware, or mindful of it. The second part of the

9
00:00:38,976 --> 00:00:43,597
process is storing information about the stimulus. And the third part is

10
00:00:43,597 --> 00:00:48,096
actually rehearsing what is stored. Let's go to Susan for a little more detail

11
00:00:48,096 --> 00:00:49,290
about this.
