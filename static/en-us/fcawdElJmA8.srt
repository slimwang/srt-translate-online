00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,820
What is LinkedIn and why does it matter?

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,440
LinkedIn is the world's largest
professional online network

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,070
with over 300 million users.

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,550
Notably, it's quite different
than a traditional resume,

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,270
whereas your resume highlights
your career at a glance.

6
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,930
LinkedIn paints a vivid portrait of
you no matter what your background.

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,460
LinkedIn has multiple functions, for

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,280
example, many recruiters increasingly
use LinkedIn to connect with candidates.

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,590
Your profile can be a great way to
market your accomplishments online and

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,660
get noticed by employers and
apply to jobs.

11
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,760
LinkedIn can also help to strengthen
your profession network and

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,870
learn about industry trends.

13
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,450
Since many industry leaders are active
contributors to the LinkedIn community,

14
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,690
LinkedIn often features
interesting articles,

15
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,570
talks and
quotes from industry thought leaders.

16
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,710
It can also be a great place to initiate
informational interviews, network, and

17
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,350
see what your peers
are up to professionally.

18
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,580
A strong LinkedIn profile
is a powerful tool to have,

19
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,420
is your profile doing
everything you needed to do?
