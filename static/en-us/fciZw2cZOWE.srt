00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,030
Here is a screen capture from a tool called Lattix, that can construct these

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:07,939
dependency matrices from code and point out violations of various principles.

3
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:10,940
The Lattix tool provides several interesting features.

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,520
On the left hand side of the image,

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:17,080
actually is conveying the hierarchical structure of the system's components.

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,880
This hierarchical structuring can be dynamically specified by the user.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,820
So within the left hand column there are some sub columns.

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,600
The ones on the extreme left, contains the ones that are just to the right of

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,640
that, which contains the ones just to the right of that and so on.

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,790
In the Lattix version of the DSM, here shown,

11
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,970
the numbers in the cells are not just zero and

12
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,820
ones, they are integer values which indicate the number of dependencies.

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,030
More over, the user of the tool can specify the kinds of dependencies and

14
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,040
get numbers for each of the different kinds.

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,030
The red triangles on some of the cells indicate violations of

16
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,020
user specified design principles.

17
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,400
And, the internal brown squares that subdivide the overall

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,400
DSM indicate candidate modules having no violations.

19
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,980
The user can construct such modules, by suitable column and row permutations.

20
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:07,040
And once you've done that and you can then focus on the remaining cells that

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,430
have violations and try to get the whole matrix to be violation free.
