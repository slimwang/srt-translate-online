00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,650
The coolest one I've worked on so far. The

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:06,770
one that I there are several that we've done kind

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:08,790
of, on the team. But the one that sort of

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,430
seemed most flushed out and seemed kind of have the

00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,550
best effect within the company thus far is the

we made a coaching dashboard for the course managers, to

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,210

to you know, figure out how well they're doing. And also on top

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,450
of that, a sort of urgency index which then tracks sort of changes in risk

12
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,390
and allows one to in theory kind of group students into trends.
