00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay, so what are some possible solutions to users entering bad data in our form?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Should we use dropdowns to limit what the user can actually enter?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Should we assume that the users will only enter good data?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Should we verify what the user enters on the server side and complain if the data is bad?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Or should we just make values up?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Check all that apply.
