00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,690
Let's look at the answer
to our cache tag quiz.

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:07,010
The cache tag always contains
the entire address of the first byte.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,670
We know this is not true.

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,950
The address that we supply to the cache
on an access contains the offset.

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,530
And the block number.

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:21,190
We have seen that the tag only needs
to contain the block number part,

7
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,470
not the offset.

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,030
The block always begins
at an aligned address, so

9
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,710
the first part of the block
actually always has zero here.

10
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,689
So there is no need to
store those zeroes.

11
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:34,430
In the cache as a tag.

12
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:39,210
The tag only needs to give us the bits
that we need to identify the block,

13
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,900
the bits that we know are always
zero are not necessary.

14
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,290
So this is definitely not true.

15
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,970
It contains at least one
bit from the block offset.

16
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,770
Again this is not true.

17
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,650
We need only the bits that
tell us which block we have.

18
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,100
The block offset tells us where
are we within a particular block, so

19
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,550
these bits are never necessary.

20
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,420
That also means that this is not true.

21
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:10,780
However, the tag does contain at
least one bit from the block number.

22
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,460
We have seen in our example
that the entire block number

23
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,600
can be a tag in that particular cache.

24
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,500
In general,
it might be fewer than all of the bits,

25
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,970
but there is a least one of them.

26
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,570
So, this is the only correct answer.
