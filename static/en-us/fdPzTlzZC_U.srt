1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:08,066
If T equals the half-life, this vector has to be one half, so that the number of particles remaining is half of

2
00:00:08,067 --> 00:00:18,766
the initial number of particles. So we get this equation: E to the minus half-life divided by 20 seconds,

3
00:00:18,767 --> 00:00:27,299
equals one half. And now you take the natural logarithm on both sides and get minus half-life,

4
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,698
divided by 20 seconds, equals the natural logarithm of one half.

5
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:40,366
You bring over the minus and the 20 seconds to the right-hand side, and what you get is the half life is

6
00:00:40,367 --> 00:00:44,366
minus 20 seconds times the natural logarithm of one half.

7
00:00:44,367 --> 00:00:48,299
So this one is correct. But that's not the only one that's correct.

8
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:58,999
The next one is two. If you found the logarithm of an inverse, you get minus the logarithm of that number.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,599
Remember, if you form an inverse, one over A, that would be E to the minus B.

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,632
So the logarithm of the inverse is minus B.

11
00:01:11,633 --> 00:01:15,699
If the logarithm of the number as such is plus B.

12
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:24,466
These two yield the same result. The last one can't be true because it has a different sign than the one before, which is correct.

13
00:01:24,467 --> 00:01:28,932
In the first one we're dividing by a number that's smaller than one.

14
00:01:28,933 --> 00:01:34,132
So we get something that's larger than 20 seconds, which can't be true, because we know that the lifetime,

15
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:37,900
20 seconds, has to be larger than the half-life.
