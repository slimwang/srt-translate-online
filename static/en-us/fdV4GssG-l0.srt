You've just written a program that contains multiple question types. Over here,

2
00:00:04,593 --> 00:00:08,848
we have a plain question, over here a choice question. We pass each of them to

3
00:00:08,848 --> 00:00:13,570
the present question method, that method is down here. It has a parameter of

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:18,167
type question. And now let's focus on this display method here. Notice that q

5
00:00:18,167 --> 00:00:22,844
is of type Question. And I would like you to tell me exactly which display

6
00:00:22,844 --> 00:00:28,258
method is called, in the call q.display. Is it always, the display of the

7
00:00:28,258 --> 00:00:33,170
question class? Is it always the display method of the choice question class?

8
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,748
Does it vary? Is it sometimes question display and sometimes choice question

9
00:00:36,748 --> 00:00:40,661
display? Or could this call even call some other method, something other than

10
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:44,700
question display and choice question display. Let me know what you think.
