1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,860
To create a scale, we'll need a variable
to store the scale, and we'll call it r.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:08,710
I'll need to use D3's scale function,
and then we're going to

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,500
use a square root scale because
we're working with circles.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,385
We know that the square root
of a country's population

5
00:00:15,385 --> 00:00:17,695
corresponds to the radius of the circle.

6
00:00:18,795 --> 00:00:23,349
The population ranges from
52,070 to 1.3 billion, so

7
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:28,820
those numbers will be the minimum and
the maximum for the domain.

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,220
And finally, we map our domain to
a range of output pixel values

9
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,910
between 10 pixels and 50 pixels.

10
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,350
Finally, we can do some sanity
checks to make sure that our scale

11
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,160
works as intended.

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,620
Our smallest country population
produces the smallest pixel value, and

13
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,370
our largest country population
produces our largest pixel value.
