00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,570
I mentioned failures in
the previous Morris cell, so

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:08,480
let me try to illustrate why our failure
is more of a problem in a large scale

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,350
system like a cloud platform, than if
we're not really concerned with scale.

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,630
Think about the following question.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,080
A hypothetical cloud
has N=10 components, or

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,450
10 CPUs, where each CPU has
a failure probability of 0.03.

7
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,810
My question is, what is
the probability that there will be

8
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:33,955
a failure somewhere in this system,
in case there are ten components.

9
00:00:33,955 --> 00:00:37,661
Then think about also what will
happen if there are more components.

10
00:00:37,661 --> 00:00:43,205
So they're 100 components, what in that
case is the probability of a failure?

11
00:00:43,205 --> 00:00:47,255
You should provide the answer in terms
of what is the percentage chance.
