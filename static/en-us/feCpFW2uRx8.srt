1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,710
Here's an example of a lookup for an A

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:05,990
record for gottech.edu. You can try this at your own

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:11,360
command line by typing, for example, dig www.gottech.edu. Now

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,990
there are some interesting things to note in this trace.

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,690
Here is our query and you can see that

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,720
this is an A record query. Here's our answer. You

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,290
can see that the answer actually has a C name

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,770
in it, which basically says, well you asked for gottech.edu

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,560
but in fact what you really want to

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,758
ask for is tlweb.gtm.gottech.edu. So then we issue an

11
00:00:31,758 --> 00:00:35,460
A record query for that name, and we ultimately

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,790
get the IP address. These numbers here indicate the

13
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,150
time to live or the amount of time in

14
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,040
seconds that the entry can be stored in the

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,365
cache. Here's another example of a DNS lookup from

16
00:00:47,365 --> 00:00:51,070
nytimes.com. The interesting thing to note here is that

17
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,860
in response to the A record query, we see two

18
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:58,030
IP addresses. This is typically performed when a service wants

19
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,870
to perform load balancing So, the client could use either

20
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,800
one of these. It might prefer the first one, but if

21
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,010
we issued the same query again, we might actually get

22
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:09,030
these IP addresses in a different order. Now, again, here you

23
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,620
can see the TTL value which indicates how long these

24
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:16,430
A records can be scored in cache. In a subsequent example,

25
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,710
we'll look at other query types that have

26
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,420
much longer TTL values. Here's an example of a

27
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,000
query for the NS record for gatech.edu. You

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,710
can see this output by typing dignsgatech.edu. You can

29
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:34,450
see here in the question section, now instead of an A record query we have an NS

30
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,840
record query. And our answer is a bunch

31
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,220
of NS records that are dns1, 2, and 3.gatech.edu,

32
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,990
any of which could answer authoritatively for sub-domains

33
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,680
of gatech.edu. You can see that in addition

34
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,990
to the answer, which return the name servers,

35
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,510
we also need the IP addresses of those name

36
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:55,560
servers, which is returned in the additional section

37
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,400
of the answer. You can see here that we

38
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,280
received not only A records for each domain

39
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,880
name but also quad A or IPv6 addresses corresponding

40
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,970
to each authoritative name server. Here's an example

41
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:13,020
of a query for an MX record or the

42
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,530
mail server corresponding to gatech.edu. Now here again, you

43
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,190
can the question is the MX record and you

44
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:23,280
can see the answer which returns two mail servers.

45
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,820
As well as the additional section, which returns an

46
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,280
A record, indicating the IP address corresponding to the

47
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,460
mail server that was returned in the MX record.

48
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,680
In addition to the TTL, we also have some metrics

49
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,100
that indicate priorities, that it would allow a system administrator to

50
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,420
configure a primary and a backup mail server. In this case,

51
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,700
the mail servers, just happen to have the same priority level.
