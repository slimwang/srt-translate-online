00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,980
In this session, we're going to
be talking about polymorphism.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,510
Polymorphism means many forms.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,230
When two instances of the same
class exhibit different behavior,

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,650
that class is said to be polymorphic.

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,560
For example, when a subclass
over rides a superclass method

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,500
in order to behave in a particular way,
that's polymorphism.

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,980
We'll explore the use of
the keyword override more deeply

8
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,360
in order to see some
polymorphism in action.

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,050
Let's get started.
