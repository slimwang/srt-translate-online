00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,129
At its core, Auto Layout is a system for

2
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:07,099
finding the best possible outcome
given a set of constraints.

3
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:11,099
This is called dynamic programming,
and it's a very useful technique.

4
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,669
Sounds like Greek to you, no problem.

5
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:17,780
Let's see an example you're familiar
with, a travel planning website.

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,810
When you book a flight,

7
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:23,500
you usually provide the system with
several restrictions or constraints.

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,740
You want to fly from
San Francisco to Fort Lauderdale.

9
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:28,969
You prefer a non-stop flight.

10
00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:32,769
You wish to leave Friday afternoon and
return Sunday night.

11
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,780
And you wish to pay as
little as possible.

12
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,969
Given these constraints,

13
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:41,560
the system will do its magic to
provide with the best possible flight.

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,520
Some of the constraints
are more important than others.

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,930
For example, a flight that
matches all the conditions but

16
00:00:47,929 --> 00:00:51,750
instead takes you to Bangkok,
it's not going to cut the mustard.

17
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,439
On the other hand,
others are more flexible.

18
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:56,250
You might accept stopping at Phoenix for

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,929
a short period of time,
if no direct flight is available.

20
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:03,240
Therefore, constraints
have different priorities.

21
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,740
Some are a must,
while others are a plus.

22
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,209
Auto Layout is exactly the same but
for UIs.

23
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:13,949
We provide the system with a series
of constraints that specify

24
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,799
desired size and position of views.

25
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,129
And Auto Layout comes with
the best possible answer.

26
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:23,670
The major restriction in flight
planning is usually your budget.

27
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,500
In Auto Layout, it's the amount
of screen real estate available.

28
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,920
But the idea is the same.

29
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,890
Now that you understand what Auto Layout
is, let's find out how we can use it.
