00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,800
Here's a stub of code for
the onConnected callback.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,420
How would you edit this to get
the latitude and longitude?

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,970
I've started the code for you.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,070
First of all, you have to set
mLastLocation to something.

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,500
And you would enter the code here.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,580
Then if it is not equal to null,
then you can set the Latitudeext.

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:23,580
By entering this code and
the LongitudeText by entering this code.

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,290
Fill in the code and then continue.
