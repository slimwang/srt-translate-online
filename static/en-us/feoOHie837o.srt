00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,910
Now let's look at, in what ways computational photography enables imaging

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,236
perhaps to generate newer or better types of imaging.

3
00:00:07,236 --> 00:00:10,710
One, you know, computational photography may allow you to

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,350
get unbounded dynamic range, this might be hard for you to see.

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:17,360
But in these types of images being able to get a very good viewpoint of

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,530
the outside, with a little bit of information about the inside,

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,440
something our eyes can do very well.

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,040
Cameras have a tough time doing.

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,850
But at the same time, we can vary a lot of different types of

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,480
things on a camera, if we bring computation close to it.

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,640
For example, we can vary things like focus, depth of field.

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,050
Here basically shown by these two examples.

13
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,330
We can of course play around with resolution, control it

14
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:45,260
as we need to while the picture is taken, at that time of taking the picture.

15
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,780
We can control lighting.

16
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,750
But basically, we can control a lot of things.

17
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,120
Also color, reflectances of the environment, and all of that wonderful stuff.

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,040
Again, understanding how to do this is valuable, and

19
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,170
something we will look it from a technology perspective.

20
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,890
But after you master the technology prospective,

21
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,440
how you leverage it to do better photography, well I'll leave that up to you.

22
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,340
So in essence this supports a creation of a newer medium of photography,

23
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,640
which could be enhanced by these technologies.

24
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,940
And of course, worse comes to worse, you can always just revert back to

25
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:20,610
the traditional form of digital photography and take pictures as you've done.

26
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,350
Question now is, if we bring in more computation, can we do more?

27
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,500
I'm being very careful and

28
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,800
I'm not using the word better, because I don't want to get into that argument.

29
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,220
But the bottom line is computation and photography combined together,

30
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,620
will let you do different, and perhaps more types of things with cameras.
