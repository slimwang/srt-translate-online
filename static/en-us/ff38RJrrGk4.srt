A mentor of mine once said that
the best debugger is clear thought and

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,360
print statements.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,550
Of course, he was a bit of a Luddite
who didn't trust symbolic debuggers,

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,860
but he's not totally wrong.

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,700
Check out the logging
exercise in the course code.

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,930
Then see if you can
answer this question,

7
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,770
what log level are print statements
logged at, and by what logger?

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,550
To get the full log output you can run
gradle--debug and run the hello task.

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,940
Fill in the logging level here and
the logger identity here.
