00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, I've told you what a successful plan looks like,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
but I haven't told you how to find one.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The process of finding it can be done through search

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
just as we did in problem solving.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So, remember in problem solving,

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
we start off in a state, and it's a single state, not a belief state.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And then we start searching a tree,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and we have a big triangle of possible states

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
that we search through, and then we find

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
one path that gets us all the way to a goal state.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And we pick from this big tree a single path.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So, with belief states and with branching

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
plan structures, we do the same sort of process,

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
only the tree is just a little bit more complicated.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Here we show one of these trees,

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and it has different possibilities.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
For example, we start off here, and we have one possibility

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
that the first action will be going right,

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
or another possibility that the first action

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
will be performing a suck.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
But then it also has branches that are part of the plan itself.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This branch here is actually part of the plan

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
as we saw before.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's not a branch in the search space.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's a branch in the plan, so what we do

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
is we search through this tree.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We try right as a first action.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We try suck as a first action.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We keep expanding nodes

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
until we find a portion of the tree

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
like this path is a portion of this search tree.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We find that portion which is a successful plan

33
00:01:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
according to the criteria of reaching the goal.
