1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,170
When we visualize data, it's usually a lot

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,550
easier to draw conclusions. And we can see a

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:10,260
clear upward trend in the relationship between hours slept

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,740
and temporal memory. Based on this data, we can

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,040
say that in general, the more you sleep

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,450
the better your temporal memory score. This isn't to

7
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:23,100
say though that sleep causes a higher temporal memory

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,540
score. This is just the trend that we can

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,320
see from this data. We don't really

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,310
know if a higher temporal memory score translates

11
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,880
to a better test result. So we can't

12
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,560
say this second option. This third option is

13
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,850
the opposite of the relationship we see here.

14
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,120
And we definitely do see an upward trend

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,540
in this relationship. We'll get more into visualizing

16
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,440
data later. But for now, the point is,

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:58,274
data comes in all forms. As raw data, or visualized,

18
00:00:58,274 --> 00:01:03,570
or in certain numbers that summarize the data. We should make good

19
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,900
decisions on what methods we should use to draw sound conclusions from our data.
