00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,488
Here's one solution, it directly multiplies the diffuse component by the

2
00:00:03,488 --> 00:00:06,946
function. I highly recommend trying out any other functions you want right

3
00:00:06,946 --> 00:00:10,125
here. The main thing is to aim for functions that give back numbers in the

4
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:14,205
range zero to one. The numbers can be outside this range, smoke won't come out

5
00:00:14,205 --> 00:00:17,692
of your computer. All that happens is that the value gets clamped to zero or

6
00:00:17,692 --> 00:00:18,430
one.
