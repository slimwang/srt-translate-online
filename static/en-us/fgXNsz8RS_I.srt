Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,750
My name's Jared.

3
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:02,940
>> My name's Gabriele.

4
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,750
>> And my name is Jessica.

5
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,650
In the coming weeks and months you are
going to be learning the foundational

6
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,640
skills used every day by iOS developers.

7
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,980
You'll also be learning the Swift
programming language, which is

8
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,150
Apple's custom language designed for
iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS development.

9
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,420
>> Before going any further,
you'll need to download and

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,570
install the core tool for
any iOS developer, Xcode.

11
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,210
Xcode is Apple's integrated
development environment,

12
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,520
which in layman's terms is the place
where you build your apps.

13
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,240
Downloading Xcode is simple.

14
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,860
It's available for
free on the App Store app on your Mac.

15
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,920
>> If you need additional help
you can find instructions below.

16
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,968
Depending on your Internet speed
however, this download can take a while.

17
00:00:41,968 --> 00:00:44,209
But don't worry, go ahead and
grab something to drink.

18
00:00:44,209 --> 00:00:45,960
We'll have some things to keep
you busy in the meantime.
