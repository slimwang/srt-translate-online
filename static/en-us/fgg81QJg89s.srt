1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,650
Now calculate the t critical value so that we can conduct a t test at alpha

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,462
equals 0.05. Remember that this is a two tailed test due to what we chose for

3
00:00:09,462 --> 00:00:15,054
our alternative hypothesis. Based on this t critical value and the t statistic

4
00:00:15,054 --> 00:00:19,360
you calculated do we accept the null or reject the null?
