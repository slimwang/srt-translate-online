1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,880
Coming up soon we'll be adding multiple cats, so

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,660
we're going to get ready by moving the model to a separate area.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,930
Because if we left the model where it is in the ViewModel, we'd be putting all

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:16,219
of this into a for loop, and making it again, and again, and again.

5
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:20,100
There's gotta be a more separated and readable way to do this.

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,000
All of this code that I'm selecting here should move

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,730
into a special function which will make us new Cats.

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,760
I'm going to cut all of it.

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,420
And wow look at how simple our ViewModel is.

10
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,740
We'll call this function Cat with a capital C.

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:39,460
As you can see, all of the cat logic is here inside of our Cat function.

12
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,730
And our ViewModel down here is super, super simple.

13
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,960
Now, we do still need to actually make this cat.

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,390
I'm going to store our cat in a currentCat variable,

15
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,110
specifically, a Knockout observable.

16
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,270
And instead of passing in an object literal, like this,.

17
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,820
I'm going to pass in a new cat and that should work.

18
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,960
Well, almost.

19
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,920
We actually just changed where our cat lives.

20
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,470
Now instead of finding our cat's properties right on the ViewModel,

21
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,980
we need to look inside of the currentCat variable.

22
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,960
So over in our html, we need to make a couple changes.

23
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,390
So here in our html, we need to change all the data-bind properties that

24
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,520
are looking for cat-related properties.

25
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,247
They all need to be currentCat.name, currentCat.title, et cetera.

26
00:01:27,247 --> 00:01:32,249
That's because, once again, our cat is not living on the ViewModel anymore,

27
00:01:32,249 --> 00:01:36,180
our cat is living in the currentCat observable.

28
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,490
And remember, we put the parentheses here because currentCat is actually

29
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:44,250
a knockout observable, which is a function.

30
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,090
In order to get the currentCat value, we need to run that function and

31
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,190
it will return the value to us.

32
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,740
Let's hop over to our browser and hit refresh.

33
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,110
Sure enough, everything seems to work just fine.

34
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:00,610
We have our nicknames, our cat image, and all of this.

35
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,130
If we try to click, however,

36
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:07,730
we get an uncaught TypeError, undefined is not a function, line 34.

37
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:12,990
In our code, app.js, for me line 34 is this right here.

38
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,578
Now what's the problem with this?

39
00:02:15,578 --> 00:02:18,860
What is this.clickCount?

40
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:24,370
Well, this represents the ViewModel and there is no clickCount on the ViewModel.

41
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,240
Remember, clickCount is now living inside of our currentCat.

42
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:34,228
In this case, I need to save this.currentCat.clickcount is

43
00:02:34,228 --> 00:02:38,420
going to be this.currentCat.clickcount plus one.

44
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,290
And now if I hop back into the browser and

45
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,580
I hit refresh, sure enough my clicking works just fine.

46
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,610
Go ahead and make those main changes.

47
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,980
First of all, moving your cat into a separate cat function.

48
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,750
Secondly, updating the bindings in your index.html file.

49
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,610
And finally, updating our increment counter so

50
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,310
that way it can get the click count properly from the model.

51
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,516
Go ahead and make those changes.
