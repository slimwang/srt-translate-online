1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,469
So let's look at three different cross-faded results we looked at, and

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:04,460
let's compare them.

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,720
Here, the whole blend from the entire size of the window, so

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,590
the window size here was, the entire image.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,280
In this case, the window is this region, and in this case, this region.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,250
Each one of them has a different effect, here,

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,080
you can still see a little bit of a sharpness, a drop-off.

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,690
Here you see, less sharpness much smoothness but

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,840
you dil, do see a little bit of ghostly artifacts.

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,270
And here of course everywhere you see transparency and ghost artifacts.

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,710
Now you can see all these images clearly,

12
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:40,720
again, more ghosting, transparency artifacts all over the image,

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,900
just restricted to this region, and this one is much nicer but does seem to

14
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,440
have a little bit of a crisp sharp line that does show up in between.
