1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,140
So a new context always gets created in the same context as its

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,030
function was defined within.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,039
In this case, that was the red context.

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,750
Moving along with our program, we see that we can add a deed variable to

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:16,149
the local context and then we run a log on all three variables.

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,370
In this case, what would you expect the output to be?
