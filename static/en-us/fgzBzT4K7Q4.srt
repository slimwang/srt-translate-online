00:00:00,015 --> 00:00:02,460
Now this quiz is an open-ended quiz. And in

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,272
this, I am giving you the same example, the

3
00:00:05,272 --> 00:00:07,780
my fun example of me purchasing a trip to

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:12,100
got to India for the Christmas holidays. And, so I

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,866
am showing you all the communication events. The communication

6
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:19,051
events are shown by these lines here, A to

7
00:00:19,051 --> 00:00:21,271
B, C to D, and so on. And this

8
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:25,090
is a textual ordering of events. In, that same process.

9
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,470
So these are eventually the same process. And the question

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,285
that I'm going to ask you, like I said, it's an

11
00:00:30,285 --> 00:00:33,940
open-ended question. I want you to identify all the events,

12
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:38,198
that are connected by, the happened-before relationship. I told you that

13
00:00:38,198 --> 00:00:41,339
this is the notation that I'm using for happened-before relationship.

14
00:00:41,339 --> 00:00:44,566
So I want you identify all the events. And I'm showing

15
00:00:44,566 --> 00:00:46,750
you a whole bunch of events starting from A working

16
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,123
your way through to L. So all these events. And what

17
00:00:50,123 --> 00:00:52,469
I want you to do is identify all the events

18
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,486
that are connected by this happened before the relationship. You can

19
00:00:56,486 --> 00:00:59,666
choose to connect both events that are directly connected that

20
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,106
happened before, as well as

21
00:01:01,106 --> 00:01:04,769
transitively connected what happened before relationship.

22
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,520
And in the second box, I want you to identify

23
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,037
all the events. That are concurrent events in the system. So

24
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:12,333
there's a whole bunch of events here, and I want

25
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:15,447
you to identify the events that you think are concurrent events.

26
00:01:15,447 --> 00:01:18,333
Meaning there is no way for, for us to assert

27
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:21,930
that there is any ordering of the events in the system.
