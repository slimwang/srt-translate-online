00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,495
So, Lauren's right. You know, sometimes different psychologists do have

2
00:00:03,495 --> 00:00:07,150
different perspectives on things. But you may we wondering, what's so important

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,555
about theory? Who really cares?

4
00:00:09,555 --> 00:00:12,710
>> Well, actually, it's quite interesting. Psychologists who have different

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,725
perspectives on language acquisition have actually had some heated debates in

6
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:20,321
the past. For example, I was trained as a behaviorist. So I subscribe more to

7
00:00:20,321 --> 00:00:22,935
B.F. Skinner's theory of verbal behavior.

8
00:00:22,935 --> 00:00:27,000
>> And I side more with Noam Chomsky. The point is that Chomsky and Skinner did

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,060
disagree, have different perspectives on how language was acquired, but that's

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,240
okay.
