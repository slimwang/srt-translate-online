00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
[Narrator] A type is just a set of similar objects like numbers or strings with associated operations,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and we've run into things like numbers in strings before,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
but there are more exotic types that also support operations,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and as we can see even from this little doodle diagram

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
sometimes there are operations like plus that apply to all of these things.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I can add 2 numbers using arithmetic.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I can concatenate 2 strings or I can append together 2 lists.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
They mean almost the same thing but not really.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Arithmetic addition is not really the same as string concatenation.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Similarly, both strings and lists support length.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Here, it's the number of characters; here, it's the number of elements.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Each one of these things, number, string, list, is a type,

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and what we basically want to do is make sure that

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
we're not mistakenly combining elements from various types or unsafely calling non-associated operations.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
For example, 5 divided by 2 makes a lot of sense,

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
but the string hello divided by the string 6, we have no idea what this means.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Division isn't one of the operators for strings even though it is one of the operators for numbers.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let me give you another analogy of this that sort of bares reference to the real world.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The word execute can mean many different things depending on what it's being applied to.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
A computer can execute a program which means to run it or to carry it out.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
There are some governments in the world that will execute their citizens,

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and this means to kill typically in a judicial context.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
These do not mean the same thing, but the word looks otherwise similar,

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and it falls in the same sort of grammatical pattern.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
They're both verbs being applied to objects.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 99:59:59,999
We're going to need to tell the difference.
