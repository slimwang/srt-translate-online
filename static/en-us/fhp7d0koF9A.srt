00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,895
So let's look at our answer
to the UMA/SMP quiz.

2
00:00:05,895 --> 00:00:10,140
We want to have a lot of cores
with this type of architecture,

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,310
so what are the problems
that we'll have to face?

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,920
The memory will need to be large and
slow.

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,518
And that's because having more
cores usually means that we will be

6
00:00:20,518 --> 00:00:23,401
running programs that access more data.

7
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:27,895
And we need to keep the data somewhere,
so we will need to have a large memory.

8
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:29,519
And that makes the memory slow.

9
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,980
Next, that memory will get too
many accesses per second because

10
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:38,590
the cache misses from all of
the cores will be going to memory.

11
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:45,360
If one of the cores generates cache
misses that he memory can survive doing.

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,490
Two of them, it might still survive.

13
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:51,830
But if we have a lot of cores our
memory will probably not be able to

14
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,100
keep up with all of those accesses.

15
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,340
We'll need a lot of small memory
modules, not necessarily.

16
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:04,099
The number of memory modules in
a centralized memory doesn't matter.

17
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,540
What is really needed is
to have enough memory for

18
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,830
all the cores to get
enough data in there and

19
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:13,920
the memory that will keep up with
the bandwidth demands of the cores.

20
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,310
How many modules we have
doesn't really matter.

21
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,360
Caches will have very small block size.

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,560
This is not true either.

23
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,490
All of the caches and all the cores
can have any block size they want.

24
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:30,940
The block size is not
divided among the cores.

25
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,550
Pages for
virtual memory become too small.

26
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,680
Same thing.

27
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,650
We can have any page size we want.

28
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:43,270
Having more or fewer cores doesn't
affect the page size in virtual memory.

29
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,570
So, the only options you should
have selected are the first two.
