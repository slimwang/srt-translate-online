1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The answer is none of these work.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
He couldn't generate them himself because if he generated them himself,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
there's no way Alice could generate these garbled tables.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
He can ask Alice to provide them. That would require him to reveal his input.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And the whole point of this protocol is for him not to have to do that.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This approach wouldn't work either--if Alice gives Bob both of the values for each input,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
then he can evaluate these gates with both of these values,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and he will learn more about Alice's inputs than he should.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The answer is none of these work. We need some other solution.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We need some way to enable Bob to obtain these inputs

11
00:00:35,000 --> 99:59:59,999
without revealing to Alice what Bob's actual values are.
