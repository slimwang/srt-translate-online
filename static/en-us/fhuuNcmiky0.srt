00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,720
So, a famous example of classical conditioning is the Little Albert study. John

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,460
B. Watson, in 1920, wanted to see if we could classically condition a fear or a

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,395
phobia. So, he used a nine month old baby they called Little Albert. He let

4
00:00:13,395 --> 00:00:17,430
Little Albert play with the white rat. And Albert loved this rat. He wasn't

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,966
scared of him at all. But then Watson would hit a steel pipe with a hammer to

6
00:00:20,966 --> 00:00:22,560
create loud bang.

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:22,861
[NOISE]

8
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:25,441
And that would really scare Albert, it would make him cry and feel really

9
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:29,125
fearful. And eventually, after several pairings of this loud bang

10
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:29,455
[NOISE]

11
00:00:29,455 --> 00:00:34,570
while Albert played with the white rat, Albert began to fear the rat. So, the

12
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,622
rat became the conditioned stimulus and the crying and the fear. Albert's

13
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:42,500
experienced was a condition response. So, it's sad that Little Albert no longer

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,961
like the white rat that he used to like. But here's the thing it gets worse,

15
00:00:46,961 --> 00:00:49,950
Albert started to fear things that were similar to the rat, this is called

16
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,262
generalization. Albert generalized his fear to other furry things such as

17
00:00:55,262 --> 00:01:00,942
bunnies, dogs, even Watson himself when he wore a rabbit mask. But the mask was

18
00:01:00,942 --> 00:01:04,840
pretty creepy so I don't blame him. Now, it actually gets worse. Watson never

19
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,049
extinguished his fear so Albert had it throughout his whole life. There's

20
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:12,198
contradictory reports on what actually happened to Albert after the study from

21
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:14,924
he was a well adjusted adult to he died at a young age or he lived his life

22
00:01:14,924 --> 00:01:19,993
with an extreme phobia of all furry things. But we just don't know. So, we

23
00:01:19,993 --> 00:01:22,907
really don't want this to happen to Greg and have him be scared of the bell so

24
00:01:22,907 --> 00:01:25,700
life so we need to extinguish his fear.
