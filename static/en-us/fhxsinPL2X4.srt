00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,560
Consider a toy shop where every worker
knows how to build some specific toy, so

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,240
this is analogous to
the heterogeneous architecture.

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:13,571
In this scenario, if a higher rate
of incoming requests for toy orders

4
00:00:13,571 --> 00:00:19,534
starts arriving, how would you keep this
heterogeneous architecture balanced?

5
00:00:19,534 --> 00:00:22,724
Again, this is an open-ended
quiz that as a hint,

6
00:00:22,724 --> 00:00:26,582
the way you maybe should think
about structuring your answers

7
00:00:26,582 --> 00:00:29,936
would be add more of x, but
what else do you need to do?
