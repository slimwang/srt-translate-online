00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome back. We're down to our final main unit.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This one is on natural language processing--

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
that is, understand natural languages like English or German or French

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and figuring out what to do with them.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Now, this is a very interesting topic for three reasons.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
One is a philosophical one--we as humans have defined ourselves much in terms

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
of our ability to speak with each other and understand each other.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This ability to use language is something that we feel sets us apart

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
from all the other animals and from the other machines.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Second is in terms of applications.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We really would like to be able to talk to our computers and use them for various things.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Sure there are occasions where clicking with a mouse is the right thing to do,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
but talking is natural, and we want to be able to communicate with our machines.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Then third is in terms of learning.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We want out computers to be smarter,

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and much of human knowledge is written down in terms of paragraphs and sentences of text,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and not in terms of formal databases or formal procedures written in code.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's all in text, and if we want our computers to be smart,

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
they'd better be able to read that text and make sense of it.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 99:59:59,999
That's what this lesson is all about.
