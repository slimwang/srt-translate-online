00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,350
So here I'm going to actually look at a specific example.

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,550
Here the goal is, I want to take a small image,

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:08,580
let's say this is a 120 by 240 image of a strawberry, but

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,970
I want to generate from this is something twice as big, so 480 by 240 image.

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:18,130
What I'm going to do is now take this original image of strawberries and

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,350
basically replicate this across the whole region.

7
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,675
Except the intention is now to do this.

8
00:00:23,675 --> 00:00:27,420
And as soon as I replicate one to the other, I also keep on finding

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,990
the seams between them that would allow me to generate a newer, larger image.

10
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,210
So here, basically, I copy the overall image over.

11
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,630
And when I copy it on top, I also find a seam.

12
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,850
Our copies would be overlapping.

13
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,980
But then, of course, basically I do this by randomly putting them in

14
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,160
different regions in this manner, and

15
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,290
now the yellow lines basically show that we have found the best possible seams.

16
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,990
And now this allows us to generate a much bigger, and

17
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:56,160
a larger image which basically has more strawberries.

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,360
This example can be applied to many different ways.

19
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,090
I can use this to generate a larger version of this.

20
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,270
I can generate a larger version of this.

21
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,510
Or even a larger version of this flower image.

22
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,360
I'll talk about this next, in a bit.

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,030
But more importantly, notice what happened here.

24
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,990
I extended the Machu Picchu image, except that when I extended it,

25
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,280
because of a variety of reasons, it actually added a hill, image is smooth.

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,220
Of course this is now no longer the real image,

27
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,010
because the real Machu Picchu scene would not have these three different hills.

28
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,010
But now we actually generate images like this.

29
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,660
So in essence, this method that I just talked about, finding seams,

30
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:32,180
can be used to generate much larger novel images, fake images this way, too.
