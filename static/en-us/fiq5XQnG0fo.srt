1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,170
The process of bootstrapping
is probably different for

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,400
every individual or
business that's trying to do it.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,301
But in essence, I think it breaks
down into a few core phases.

4
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:12,960
One, identification of need.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,457
I need money, or I need this thing.

6
00:00:15,457 --> 00:00:16,758
I need this value.

7
00:00:16,758 --> 00:00:20,167
Once you've identified what that is,
that kind of turns into your goal.

8
00:00:20,167 --> 00:00:23,840
And then it's what do I have that
can help me get that thing that I've

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,204
identified that I need?

10
00:00:25,204 --> 00:00:28,774
So if it's money I maybe
need more customers.

11
00:00:28,774 --> 00:00:30,530
How do I get more customers?

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,170
Well, I have this stuff
that's in my inventory or

13
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,610
I have the skill that I can apply or

14
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:43,020
I have this resource that I can break
down into smaller pieces and sell.

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,900
Something that you have at your
disposal already that you can then

16
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,200
scale its value rapidly.

17
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,475
And then it's the act of actually
doing that and following through and

18
00:00:54,475 --> 00:00:58,410
while doing that figuring out how to
turn it into a sustainable offering so

19
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,790
that way it doesn't
just die out over time.

20
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:04,608
So to summarize it's three phases,
identification of problem,

21
00:01:04,608 --> 00:01:07,609
location and
allocation of immediate resources and

22
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:11,905
the third thing that's important that
kind of encompasses the other two is

23
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:15,337
figuring out the longevity of
whatever it is you've done.

24
00:01:15,337 --> 00:01:19,994
Summary of bootstrapping is
identifying what do you want.

25
00:01:19,994 --> 00:01:20,783
What's your goal?

26
00:01:20,783 --> 00:01:22,911
What is the thing that you
were trying to achieve?

27
00:01:22,911 --> 00:01:26,850
Second thing is looking for
that item or skill or talent or

28
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,884
resource that thing that will
generate the value for you.

29
00:01:30,884 --> 00:01:35,162
And the third thing is identifying how
you can turn that into a sustainable

30
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:38,130
platform to continue that
growth into the future.
