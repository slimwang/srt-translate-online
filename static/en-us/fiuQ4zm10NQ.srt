00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here's my implementation of sense, the measurement model,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
as a function in the class robot.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I produce a vector called Z, which I return in the end, which has 4 bearings.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Then I go through all my landmarks, and you already have the landmarks in your code--

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
--there's 4 of them--and I use the atan2 function,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
which is the mathematical function for computing the angle.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It takes the y value as the first argument, and the x value as the second argument.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This is the local angle of a landmark relative to the robot coordinate.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Because the robot has a global heading direction,

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I need to subtract this to get my bearing value.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
If I were to add noise, which is a flag over here,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
then I just produce a random noise adding variable.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This is something you shouldn't have implemented,

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
but you need later as you implement the noise.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Of course, I make sure that the bearing is normalized between 0 and 2Ï€.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I append them to the list and return it.
