00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,880
So here's a quick little quiz for you.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,451
Suppose our kernel, our filter, the thing we're moving around,

3
00:00:06,451 --> 00:00:08,070
was size M by M, right?

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,420
So maybe it was a five by five or

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,350
a three by three, so M would be three or five in that case.

6
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:16,070
And suppose our picture was N by N, maybe our picture is 100 by 100, or

7
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,180
1000 by 1000.

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,020
How many multiplies would it take to filter the whole image,

9
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,620
with that filter, all right?

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,368
Two M N.

11
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:29,055
M times M times N times 2.

12
00:00:29,055 --> 00:00:30,010
M times N times N.

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,259
M times M times N times N.

14
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,020
Hallelujah singing something.

15
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,580
I donâ€™t know it just seems like it had a rhythm to it there
