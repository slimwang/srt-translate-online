1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,290
The value iteration class,
provides the method, planfromstate,

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,320
which takes the initial
state object of a domain,.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,650
This is the method we need in order to
execute the value iteration procedure.

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:19,598
Therefore, we can fill in the blank with
vi.planfromState(this.initial state)
