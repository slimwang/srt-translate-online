1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now, the introduction of mixed strategy

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
brings us some curious philosophical problems

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
related to the idea of randomness, secrecy, and rationality.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We said that sometimes the rational strategy

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
can be a mixed strategy.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
That is, ones with probability in it.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Probability P, I do action A,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and with probability 1 - P I do action B.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And that suggests that we need some secrecy

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
so that our opponent doesn't know which of these random choices we're making.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The curious thing is that that's only true

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
at the extent of an individual play,

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
not to the extent of the strategy itself.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So, if this is the optimal strategy,

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
a mixed strategy, it's okay for us to reveal

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
that strategy to our opponent because our opponent

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
can also compute that that's our rational strategy,

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and so we won't do any worse by revealing to the opponent

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
exactly what our strategy is.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
However, the actual implementation of that strategy,

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
that is, this is the grand strategy, that in this situation,

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
whenever we're faced with playing this game, this is what we'll do,

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
that part can be revealed, but the actual choice

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
that this time we're going to choose A or we're going to choose B,

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
of course, that has be to kept secret.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
If we reveal that, if our opponent can somehow discover

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
which choice we're going to make based on this random choice,

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
then our opponent can get an advantage over us.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Now, with respect to rationality,

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
we said that a rational agent is one that does the right thing,

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and that's still true.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
However, it turns out that there are games

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
in which you can do better if your opponent believes

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
you are not rational, and that has been said about various politicians

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
throughout history, and I won't pick on one or another.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But sometimes it has been said that they are intentionally

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
cultivating an image of being crazy

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
so that they can gain an advantage

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
when faced with certain games with opponents.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
For example, suppose 1 action available to a leader is to go to war,

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
but both sides realize that the strategy of going to war

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
is dominated by other strategies and thus would be irrational.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So, a leader who is perceived to be rational and makes a threat

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
of "Give me this concession, or I'll go to war against you,"

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
that's not a credible threat.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The leader's threat would be dismissed, and it would have no effect.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
However, if the leader can convince the opponent

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
that he is irrational or crazy, then the threat suddenly becomes credible.

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And so note that being irrational doesn't help,

50
00:02:46,000 --> 99:59:59,999
but appearing irrational can gain you an advantage.
