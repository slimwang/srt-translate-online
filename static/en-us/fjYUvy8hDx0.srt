Well, we said A and B were complimentary angles and if we notice, they sum to 90

2
00:00:04,998 --> 00:00:09,803
degrees or a right angle. You usually draw a box in the corner to indicate a

3
00:00:09,815 --> 00:00:14,288
right angle. If I want to find angle D, I know C and D have to add up to 90

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,011
degrees. I know C is 55 degrees. So, if I just subtract 55 from both sides,

5
00:00:19,282 --> 00:00:24,060
angle D is 35 degrees. We can use the exact same process for angle E and angle

00:00:24,072 --> 00:00:28,900
F. If I subtract 12 degrees from 90, I get 78 degrees. If you figured out what

00:00:28,912 --> 00:00:33,755
complementary meant, nice work. If not, that's okay. Hopefully, you'll learn

00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:34,600
along the way.
