1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,990
In start ups there always seems to
be a tension between two paths.

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,190
Distribution, give it for free and

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:12,145
capture a big chunk of the market, or
earnings, also known as making money.

4
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:13,440
Charge for

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,940
your work but then you limit the
distribution to only paying customers.

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,650
>> However, if you think on
your business plan in advance,

7
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,160
there are many cases where
you can do both from

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,170
the beginning
>> A great strategy

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,570
will be to use the freemium model.

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,760
You allow your users to use
the service for free and

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,180
then convert the power users
to a paying customers.

12
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,250
Take for example a company
that does it very well, Wufoo.

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,830
The free version lets you try
the product and see the value in it.

14
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,670
They show you the benefits right there
on the first step of the registration.

15
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,520
They focus on the most
important benefits.

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,290
If you need to become a heavy user,

17
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:57,960
in their case more than 100 reply
per month, they ask for payment.

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,970
But at this point, you as the user
understand the work they did for

19
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,060
you, and it's valuable and
worth the price.
