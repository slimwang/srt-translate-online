1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,398
Fantasy is certain, certainly a very common thing that everyone engages in. And

2
00:00:05,398 --> 00:00:08,296
when I'm talking about fantasy, it doesn't necessarily have to be erotic or

3
00:00:08,296 --> 00:00:13,564
sexual fantasy. a lot of people daydream or fantasize about multiple things

4
00:00:13,564 --> 00:00:18,862
throughout the day. So, maybe the perfect job they want or maybe like a certain

5
00:00:18,862 --> 00:00:24,680
house or maybe the latest, you know, iPhone or whatever the situation may be.

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,904
And so, its completely natural that people might fantasize about sex or erotic

7
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:34,410
touch or just liking someone and being with them. In fact, in some recent

8
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,970
studies 93% of men and 86% of women reported that they do engage in, in

9
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:44,306
fantasy. It can be really helpful for individuals to be engaging in fan,

10
00:00:44,306 --> 00:00:47,902
fantasy-type thoughts on their own as long as, again, they've got some

11
00:00:47,902 --> 00:00:54,090
cognitive kind of restructuring that they've done. If they have any walls or

12
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,538
blockades around sex or sexuality. so that they aren't kind of beating

13
00:00:58,538 --> 00:01:02,170
themselves up later for fantasizing. So as long as they know that it's okay and

14
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:06,840
they're comfortable doing that, then it's fine. Couples also can engage in

15
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,930
fantasy together. So they can tell each other their fantasies, tell each other

16
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,955
their desires. And it doesn't necessarily mean that they have to act on those

17
00:01:14,955 --> 00:01:21,374
as a couple or as individuals. Fantasy is, in it's definition, a fantasy. which

18
00:01:21,374 --> 00:01:24,713
often times is things we might not do or maybe that we have done and we're just

19
00:01:24,713 --> 00:01:29,904
thinking about in hindsight. and as long as it's done in a way that is healthy

20
00:01:29,904 --> 00:01:35,166
for the individual, healthy for the couple, then absolutely. It's totally

21
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:37,520
natural normal healthy and nothing wrong with it.

22
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,730
>> At what age is it possible for people to reach orgazam, men and women?

23
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:45,992
>> That's a great question. So, I hear this question a lot. you know when, when

24
00:01:45,992 --> 00:01:50,972
can people orgasm, when can they kind of experience sexually, you know,

25
00:01:50,972 --> 00:01:58,636
positive feelings, And so it's really interesting is, there are images of

26
00:01:58,636 --> 00:02:04,758
infants in utero. Particularly male infants or infants with penises we don't

27
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:09,312
really know their gender yet, but there are images of them in utero touching

28
00:02:09,312 --> 00:02:15,406
their penises, fondling themselves. So one of the things that the techs that

29
00:02:15,406 --> 00:02:20,550
look at ultrasounds in the medical field will tell you is that oftentimes. It's

30
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:25,575
hard to identify male infants because their hands are usually between their

31
00:02:25,575 --> 00:02:32,277
legs so much in utero that they never actually are able to see the penis. And

32
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,876
so, although we can't be certain because, certainly there is no way to get

33
00:02:35,876 --> 00:02:41,283
inside the mind of an infant or even really ask them any questions. There's

34
00:02:41,283 --> 00:02:45,236
pretty good literature to support that both babies that happen to be male and

35
00:02:45,236 --> 00:02:49,248
babies that happen to be female are experiencing sexual feelings, orgasmic type

36
00:02:49,248 --> 00:02:55,326
feelings when, when their touching their genitalia. Which is a totally natural

37
00:02:55,326 --> 00:03:00,491
normal thing. Even for small infants and toddlers to engage in. now are we

38
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:07,900
talking about, you know, an orgasm where a male actually like ejaculates. Well,

39
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:13,030
no, certainly not in infancy. that doesn't happen until males tend to be like

40
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:17,508
12, 13 years old. But if we're talking about orgasmic feelings, there's,

41
00:03:17,508 --> 00:03:22,203
there's actually, we don't really know exactly when that starts. It's, it's as

42
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:26,729
young as the person you know, becomes curious about their own body and, and

43
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:29,500
starts exploring, so
