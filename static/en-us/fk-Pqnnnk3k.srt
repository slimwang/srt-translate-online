00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,380
Here's what it should look like. Note that instead of the 25 we use the

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:07,531
constant. Same for the 255 here and now when you look at the whole thing it

3
00:00:07,531 --> 00:00:12,560
reads pretty nicely doesn't it? We take the smaller of the original red plus

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,474
the added red and the maximum. No more magic is involved. You always want to do

5
00:00:17,474 --> 00:00:21,964
that in your programs when you find yourself using numbers. whose meaning is

6
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:24,964
not totally clear, just make them into constants.
