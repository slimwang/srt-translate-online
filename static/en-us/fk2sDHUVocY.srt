1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,325
Now, we're going to try something a little more complicated. For this problem,

2
00:00:03,325 --> 00:00:07,325
you'll want to start by factoring each parts of the fraction. We'll start there

3
00:00:07,325 --> 00:00:10,794
first and check in and then we'll cancel factors after that.
