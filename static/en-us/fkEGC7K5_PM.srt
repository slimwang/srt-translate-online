00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,850
Let's revisit the Color Maker app.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,280
New iOS developers often note
that one typical challenge

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,530
is debugging a project when an action or
outlet is not set correctly.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,420
To expose you to this challenge,

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,840
we've created three broken
versions of the Color Maker app.

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,560
Download Color-Error-1 from
the downloadable section below.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,840
Run the project, and see if you
can find out why it's not working.

00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,650
