00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Thrun] And the answer is as follows.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
No, no, yes, and no.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
B and C in the absence of any other information are dependent through A,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
which is if you learn something about B, you can infer something about A,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and then we'll know more about C.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
If you know D, that doesn't change a thing.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You can just take D out of the pool.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
If you know A, B and C become conditionally independent.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This dependence goes away, and ignorance of D doesn't render B and C dependent.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
However, if we add D back to the mix,

11
00:00:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
then knowledge of D will render B and C dependent by way of the explaining away effect.
