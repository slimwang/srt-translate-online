1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,147
Well this one means that you're squaring each of these values, and then adding

2
00:00:05,147 --> 00:00:10,089
them up. Which isn't what we're doing here. Here we're adding up the squared

3
00:00:10,089 --> 00:00:15,352
deviations. For this one you really have to be careful about having parentheses

4
00:00:15,352 --> 00:00:21,286
or no parentheses. Because this means that we only sum up the values, all of

5
00:00:21,286 --> 00:00:27,840
these, and then we subtract the squared mean, which isn't what we did. Again,

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,825
here parenthesis are important. This means that we sum up all the values, then

7
00:00:34,825 --> 00:00:42,136
we subtract the mean, and then we square the result. That's not what we did.

8
00:00:42,136 --> 00:00:47,686
This one doesn't have a summation sign, which means that we take some arbitrary

9
00:00:47,686 --> 00:00:53,547
value, unspecified. So like $38,801, for example. And then we subtract the mean.

10
00:00:53,547 --> 00:00:59,089
And then we square the results. And that's again, not what we did. But this one

11
00:00:59,089 --> 00:01:04,135
says that you take this, which is each value, minus the mean, to get the

12
00:01:04,135 --> 00:01:09,905
deviation. You square each deviation, and then you add them all up. So this is

13
00:01:09,905 --> 00:01:15,895
the correct formula for adding these up. This is called SS, for sum of squares.
