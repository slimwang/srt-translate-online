1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,570
Okay, the next value algorithm we're going to look at

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,930
is what is called the Tournament Barrier. The barrier

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,210
is organized in the form of the tournament with

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,580
N players and since it's a tournament with N players

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,200
and two players playing as, against each other. In

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,900
every match there are going to be log N rounds, log

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,650
N with a base 2. So here is the

8
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:25,540
setup for with [INAUDIBLE], they're going to be, they're going to be,

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,940
three rounds corresponding to login. And being

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,770
eight we get three rounds. The first round,

11
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,360
second round and the third round. So in

12
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,430
the first round, they're going to be four matches.

13
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,090
P0 and P1 is one match. P2, P3. P4, P5. P6,

14
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:45,270
P7. And the only catch is that we're going to rig this

15
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,540
tournament. In other words what's going to happen is that we're

16
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,270
going to predetermine who is going to be the winner in

17
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,560
this round. And, and particularly, we're going to say P0

18
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,910
is the winner for this match, P2 for this

19
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,360
one, P4 for this one, and P6 for this one.

20
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,019
So in other words, the matches are rigged. In

21
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:08,670
this day and age, when we hear about international scandals

22
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,180
about match fixing. I guess this is not too

23
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:15,600
far fetched. But what is the rational for match fixing?

24
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,220
The key rational is the fact, that if the

25
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,156
processes are executing on a shared memory machine. Then

26
00:01:23,156 --> 00:01:26,538
the winner can basically sit on his bumper and

27
00:01:26,538 --> 00:01:29,208
wait for a process of P1 to come over

28
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:34,993
and let him know that he has won the match, P2 can wait until P3 comes over and

29
00:01:34,993 --> 00:01:37,635
so on and so forth. And what that means

30
00:01:37,635 --> 00:01:40,627
in a shared memory multiprocessor, is that the spin

31
00:01:40,627 --> 00:01:42,871
location where P0 is waiting for P1 to

32
00:01:42,871 --> 00:01:45,387
come and inform him that he's lost the match

33
00:01:45,387 --> 00:01:49,290
is fixed. The static. And, and so this is

34
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,790
the idea behind match fixing, that the, the spin

35
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,920
location for each of these processes, P0, P2,

36
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,260
and P4, and P6, the winners in the first

37
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:03,100
round, is predetermined. And that is very, very useful,

38
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,870
especially if you don't have a cache coherent multiprocessor.

39
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,810
If you have NCC [UNKNOWN] machine, In that

40
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,050
case it is possible to locate the spin location,

41
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:18,700
in the memory that is very to P0 P2 P4 and P si, P 6 respectively. That's

42
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,404
the idea behind this this match fixing. So

43
00:02:21,404 --> 00:02:24,756
the result of matches. Of course P0 will advance

44
00:02:24,756 --> 00:02:27,200
to the next round. P2 will advance to

45
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,777
the, next round. P4 and P6. And once again,

46
00:02:30,777 --> 00:02:35,020
in the second drawing we're going to fix the matches. And the winner is going to

47
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:40,763
be P0 for round 2. P4 for in this bracket for round 2. And so

48
00:02:40,763 --> 00:02:45,747
essentially what that means again, is that P0 and P4 can spin on a

49
00:02:45,747 --> 00:02:51,170
statically determined location. In various processors

50
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:56,310
and P2 and P6 respectively will come over and let

51
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,630
the other guy know that when the match [UNKNOWN] for this

52
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,680
round. So that is the end of the second round. And, and,

53
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,070
and, of course, if you have you know, with N equal

54
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,260
to eight, there are only three rounds but, if, for arbitrary N,

55
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,740
we're going to have more levels in the tree and the and

56
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,340
the, and, and, and [INAUDIBLE] level. We're going to fix the the winners

57
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,400
and, so it'll propagate up this tree in this fashion, in

58
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,520
terms of determining statically, who are going to be the winners for

59
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,140
each round of the tournament. And this will go

60
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,600
on, all the way up to determining who the

61
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,140
tournament champion is. So in this case, P0 is

62
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,640
our luck guy, who wins the tournament and so he's

63
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,000
the champion. And so P0's going to be waiting on

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,390
a statically determined location, where P4 can come and signal

65
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:45,250
that P0 has one determinant. So again, the important

66
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,810
thing that I want you to get out of this

67
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,720
this particular arrangement that I've mentioned is the fact that the

68
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,630
spin location for each of the processors that are waiting on the

69
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,970
other guy are statically determined. At every level. So this the

70
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,680
first round, the second round, and

71
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,030
finally the championship, the championship round.
