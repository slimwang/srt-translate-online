If you got 3 and 3 4ths that's great. I know I have three entire octagons. And

2
00:00:04,987 --> 00:00:08,577
then I need to figure out this fraction. This is actually going to be 3 4ths.

3
00:00:09,612 --> 00:00:13,710
Let's see why. I could have split my octagons into eighths. So I know I have

4
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:18,802
three whole octagons. And then I have 1 8th, 2 8ths, 3 8ths, 4 8ths, 5 8ths, 6

5
00:00:18,802 --> 00:00:24,780
8ths of a hexagon. Remember, I know I can reduce 6 8ths, I know 2 goes into 6

6
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:29,498
and 8. So I can simplify it. And then I have 3 4ths. To find our improper

7
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:34,685
fraction, we just need to count up all the 8ths. If I counted up all the 8ths, I

8
00:00:34,697 --> 00:00:39,678
would find out that I would have 30 over 8, or 30 8ths. Remember I can reduce

9
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,311
this fraction. So I get 15 over 4 or 15 4ths. But this doesn't quite make sense.

10
00:00:44,414 --> 00:00:49,026
My picture has 8ths but my answers have 4ths. Well that means I could actually

11
00:00:49,038 --> 00:00:53,716
have done this a little bit differently. I could have split up my octagons into

12
00:00:53,728 --> 00:00:58,515
fourths. This would be 1 4th of the octagon. Notice when have fourths I can

13
00:00:58,527 --> 00:01:03,584
easily see that I have 3 and 3 4ths. I have 3 whole hexagons, and then I have 3

14
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:08,770
fourths. 1 4th, 2 4ths, 3 4ths of this last hexagon. So 3 and 3 4ths.

15
00:01:08,878 --> 00:01:13,831
Calculating of improper fraction is pretty easy too I can actually just use my

16
00:01:13,843 --> 00:01:18,472
mixed number. Because this mixed number is in 4ths, I can figure out the

17
00:01:18,484 --> 00:01:23,324
improper fraction in 4ths. I can multiply 4 times 3, which is 12. That makes

18
00:01:23,336 --> 00:01:27,892
sense because I have three octagons, and to each of them has four pieces. Then I

19
00:01:27,904 --> 00:00:00,000
have to add three more pieces. So I add 12 plus 3, and I get 15 over 4, 15 4ths.
