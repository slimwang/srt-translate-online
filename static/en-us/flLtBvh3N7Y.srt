00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,520
The first thing we're going to do is carve the problem up into four kinds of

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,890
middleware. And the four kinds are going to be based upon the interaction

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,350
mechanisms between the pieces. In particular we'll look at transactional,

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,950
middleware because it deals with distributive transactions. We'll look

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:20,330
at message oriented middleware in which the interactions are messages,

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:24,240
message passing. We'll look at procedural mid, middleware,

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,210
which has to do with remote procedure calls. And finally we'll look at object or

8
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,970
component middleware in which we're making requests on remote objects.
