1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:02,469
Starting with the first diagram.

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:06,730
We can see that for every one hardware
pixel across, we have one dip across.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,960
So, that's not the right answer.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,840
Here, for every three hardware pixels
across, we have one dip across,

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,450
which would make a device
pixel ratio of three.

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,750
And that's incorrect.

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,550
Over on this one.

8
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,420
Looking across, we've got about one and
two-thirds hardware pixels for

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,870
every dip, so that's not going to
give us the right ratio either.

10
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,160
Which means of course in the last one,
where we have two hardware pixels

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,969
across, for every one dip across, that
gives us a device pixel ratio of two.
