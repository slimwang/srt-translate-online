1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:05,700
This kind of, of approximation or obstruction is typical,

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,112
particularly at the analysis stage, and you should feel comfortable with,

3
00:00:10,112 --> 00:00:16,480
with making these decisions so you can focus on the, the important details and

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,430
avoid getting bogged down in some of the nuances of things.

5
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:28,460
The third part of the class model is the attributes and what we'll do here is,

6
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:34,810
as far as an analysis model is concerned is we are going to try to capture

7
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:40,840
in attributes, those parts of the application which the user can actually see.

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,800
And those are called percepts, and so we're going to try to understand what

9
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,830
all the percepts are, and model each one of those as an attribute. And so in

10
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,680
this case, can you think of, for the viewport, what is, what it's percepts are?
