1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,030
To find the treble clef, I started by
going to the musical symbols section

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,230
because well, that just makes sense.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,760
Looking through all the characters,

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,220
it looks like there is
a treble clef right there.

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:10,920
And, wallah.

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,650
There is its HTML-code,
right here for easy copy and pasting.

7
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,660
I'm testing out the treble clef
by pasting its HTML code here.

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,380
And then observing what happens
on the site over here, and

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,310
notice there's the treble clef.

10
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,830
So, clearly this HTML code is working.

11
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:30,770
By the way, this is just the same koala
website you saw a few minutes ago.

12
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,189
This looks good.

13
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,800
But, I wonder what would happen if
I just simply pasted the treble

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,820
clef itself into the html,
remember it's just a normal character.

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,110
So I will copy it and
I will paste it right here.

16
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,837
Now look, I've got the treble
cleft over here in the the HTML.

17
00:00:48,837 --> 00:00:51,680
And I've got the treble
cleft in the site.

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,940
This is nice because these two match.

19
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,190
In fact,
it's actually recommended to copy and

20
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,930
paste the actual Unicode
character into your HTML.

21
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,490
It's easier to read and maintain.

22
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:06,250
So, the correct answer is,
ampersand pound sign and

23
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,170
then the number that you see here.

24
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,300
That's the HTML code for treble clef.
