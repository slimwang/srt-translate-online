Great job! This is really tough stuff and as long as you understand the

2
00:00:03,812 --> 00:00:08,297
properties of the normal distribution and you understand what we're doing rather

3
00:00:08,297 --> 00:00:12,361
than memorizing it you'll be fine. Below I'll provide a link to an app the

4
00:00:12,361 --> 00:00:17,111
allows you to visualize the area under the curve less than any Z score. So check

5
00:00:17,111 --> 00:00:22,057
it out if you want, and that might help better understand this whole process.

6
00:00:22,057 --> 00:00:26,903
But you'll get better and better at it as we go through this class. Good job!
