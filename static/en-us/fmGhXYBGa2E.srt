00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,658
When we experience different emotions, different parts of our body respond

2
00:00:03,658 --> 00:00:07,900
differently. Many of the bodily systems involve the autonomic nervous system,

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:12,912
which includes a sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. As you may

4
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:17,787
recall from lesson three, the sympathetic nervous system is the arousal system.

5
00:00:17,787 --> 00:00:21,563
It readies the body for action, whereas the parasympathetic nervous system

6
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:26,634
brings the levels of arousal levels down so we can calm down. Basic survival

7
00:00:26,634 --> 00:00:30,587
and protection experiences activate the sympathetic nervous system to either

8
00:00:30,587 --> 00:00:35,400
fight or flight, meaning flee. Different emotions have their own pattern of

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:40,095
arousal. Anger, for instance, increases heart rate and skin temperature,

10
00:00:40,095 --> 00:00:45,490
whereas sadness decreases both. And fear increases heart rate somewhat and

11
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,783
sweating. And positive emotions generally activate the parasympathetic nervous

12
00:00:50,783 --> 00:00:55,009
system, leading to a sense of calm or relaxation.
