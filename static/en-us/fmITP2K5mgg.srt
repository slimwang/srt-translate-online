00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,846
To test whether exactly one of them is a three, you would be interested in two

00:00:02,846 --> 00:00:09,094
cases. One where x is 3, and y is not. And the other where y is 3, and x is

3
00:00:09,094 --> 00:00:13,996
not. If this case is true, or this case is true, then exactly one of them is a

4
00:00:13,996 --> 00:00:21,433
3. In code, that would look like this. We have, x is 3 and y is not or x is not

5
00:00:21,433 --> 00:00:24,893
3 but y is.
