00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,383
The code for this course lives in
a git repository hosted on GitHub.com,

2
00:00:05,383 --> 00:00:08,167
at GitHub.com/udacity/ud406.

3
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:09,459
Let's check it out.

4
00:00:09,459 --> 00:00:10,669
Here we are.

5
00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:14,209
If we scroll down to the bottom,
here we'll find a read me that actually

6
00:00:14,209 --> 00:00:16,923
explains everything you'll
need to do to download and

7
00:00:16,923 --> 00:00:20,150
start loading up the course demos and
exercises.

8
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,750
If you're familiar with git and
GitHub, just go ahead and fork and

9
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,190
clone this repository.

10
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,900
Or, easier,
if you scroll back up to the top,

11
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,140
you can hit this Download Zip
button to grab the code.

12
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,980
If you can't access GitHub at all, you
can also download the code directly from

13
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,580
the downloadable section
in the classroom.

14
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,440
Now that our zip has
finished downloading and

15
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,650
we moved it to the desktop,
we can go ahead and extract it.

16
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,450
And here we are inside the course code.

17
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:49,590
You can see all the demos, exercises,
and exercise solutions for the course.

18
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,450
Go ahead and
grab the course code for yourself.

19
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,620
Check off these boxes as
you complete each task.
