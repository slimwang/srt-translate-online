Your task was to write the average method that computes the average of a bunch

2
00:00:04,192 --> 00:00:09,060
of fuel efficiencies. Now, of course that's almost exactly the same as

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:15,140
computing the average of a bunch of areas. So let's copy and paste this code.

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,409
And there are only two spots where I need to fix it up. Over here instead of

5
00:00:18,409 --> 00:00:23,226
country, it should say car. And over here instead of calling getArea, I should

6
00:00:23,226 --> 00:00:28,678
call getFuelEfficiency. And that's all. This is, of course, intensely boring,

7
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:31,363
and there ought to be a better way.
