1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,270
How do you do background subtraction?

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,210
Not so complicated.

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,100
You have to estimate the background.

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,570
So at some time t, you remember doing x,
image of x, y, and t.

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,770
I have to estimate the background,
and then

6
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,190
I'm going to subtract that background
from whatever the current frame is.

7
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,110
And wherever the difference is,

8
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,270
big enough I'm going to call that
my foreground mask, okay, and

9
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,000
it's an absolute difference because
the background could be brighter than

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,570
the thing that's moving or
it could be darker.

11
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:31,250
Here's an example, sort of notionally,
so here again same image, right.

12
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,530
And this is my estimated background,
we'll talk a little bit later about how

13
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,680
you might get such
a beautiful background.

14
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,920
And the idea would be to
take your current image,

15
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,880
subtract off the background,
take the absolute value,

16
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,990
and anywhere that it's bigger than
the threshold, just output that.

17
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,490
All right, fine.

18
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:51,830
But of course the question is, what's
a good estimate of the background?

19
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,550
There's a form of background
subtraction, which isn't really

20
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:58,610
background subtraction at all, and
it's referred to as frame differencing.

21
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,590
Frame differencing is
exactly what you might think.

22
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,870
I'm going to assume that the background
is whatever was in the picture

23
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,130
just before.

24
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,030
Okay?
I'm just going to compare

25
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,570
the current image to the last image.

26
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:12,268
All right?

27
00:01:12,268 --> 00:01:15,912
And, background subtraction becomes,
then, I of x,y, and

28
00:01:15,912 --> 00:01:18,120
t minus I of x,y and t minus 1.

29
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,810
And if that value is greater
than some threshold,

30
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,310
I'll output that as my foreground mask.

31
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,160
Okay?

32
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,510
So here again, two examples.

33
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,977
So here's I of x, y, t.

34
00:01:28,977 --> 00:01:31,240
Here's this van here.

35
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,610
And van has moved a little bit.

36
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,870
Let's see, which one's easiest to see
that something has actually changed?

37
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,690
Oh, here.
So you see that this car is

38
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:44,050
moving forward that way, and it's now,
it's now moved past this line.

39
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:47,520
But at time t minus 1,
it was even with that line.

40
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,040
Same thing that this
van is moving forward.

41
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,300
In fact, pay attention to
this white van there, okay?

42
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm going to subtract from this
image that background image,

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,110
and then I'm going to take a look
at different thresholds, right?

44
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,850
Even before we look at the results,

45
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,540
you can just think a little bit
about how well will this work.

46
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:07,810
Well, clearly this is going to depend
upon sort of what the objects look like,

47
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:12,570
how fast they're moving, what
the frame rate is the threshold, so,

48
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,600
you know, sometimes this is good.

49
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,205
And then the slide that took,
you know, [LAUGH] it says usually not.

50
00:02:17,205 --> 00:02:19,710
Well, and this can be shown here,
all right?

51
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,950
So if I take different thresholds, so
here's threshold of 25, of 50, of 100,

52
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:29,330
and you can see, you know, for this
illumination, I don't know, somewhere,

53
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:33,660
a threshold somewhere between 50 and
100 seems to be going pretty well.

54
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,740
You remember that white
van that I told you about?

55
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,340
Okay, well that's right there.

56
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,590
Okay, so you can see the front of the
van, you can see the back of the van,

57
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,190
but there's a big hole eaten
out the middle of the van.

58
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,270
What happened there?

59
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:50,900
Well, duh the top of the van is just
white, all right it's just plain white.

60
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,080
So the van tops here and
then in the next frame it's moved there.

61
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,910
So the part where the van was and

62
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:01,270
now you can see the road behind it,
that's a difference.

63
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,860
And the part that was road,
or the windshield, and

64
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,330
now the top of the van there,
you can see that, that's a difference.

65
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,530
But, the middle of the top
of that van is white,

66
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,310
and then if I move it,
what does it stay?

67
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,840
White, so
I don't get much of a difference.

68
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,970
Okay, so this is a problem with,
with frame differencing,

69
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,520
is that large areas even as they move.

70
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,820
They can move relatively quickly,
but if you have large,

71
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:27,830
constant, intensity areas, you know
that's just not going to work very well.

72
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:28,980
So, what's a better idea?
