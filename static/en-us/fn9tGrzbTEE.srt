1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,780
Another way you'll get support in
the Nanodegree is at office hours.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,840
These sessions happen
multiple times each week.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,071
Another perfect place to
deepen your learning and

4
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:10,800
ask your questions to
ask the coach team.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,640
The schedule is listed in
your Nanodegree portal.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,149
Sessions often start out with
coaches talking about common

7
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:20,240
issues students encounter or elaborating
on a particular tricky concept.

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,230
Then we move into an open question and
answer time.

9
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,850
Decisions happen over Google Hangouts on
Air, so you'll need to request to join

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,340
our Google+ community
to participate in them.

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,170
You'll also need a Google+
account to join the community, so

12
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,890
if you don't have that, make one first.

13
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,110
If you can't attend sessions live,
don't worry.

14
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,310
They record it.

15
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,890
You can post your
questions in advance and

16
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,550
then watch the session afterward if
you can't make it to hear our answers.

17
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,000
To learn how to participate
in Hangouts on Air,

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,570
read the doc that's linked
in the instructor notes.
