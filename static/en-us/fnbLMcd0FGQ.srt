00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,430
In database terminology, a column
with a references constraint on it,

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,080
is also called a foreign key.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,570
Now this has always sounded like
a bit of a weird term to me,

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,270
like it was the key to a lock
from far across the sea, but

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,550
a foreign key is just a column or
a set of columns in one table,

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,520
that uniquely identifies
a row in another table.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,280
It's possible for

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:25,200
a table to have two or more foreign
keys, actually that's really common.

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,480
For instance, consider a database of
students grades in various courses.

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,420
Here we've got a table of students
names and their ID numbers.

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,150
And the ID is a primary key
because names aren't unique.

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:41,640
And we have a table of courses, with
course names and course IDs as well.

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,360
And then we have the grades table,

14
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,890
which has foreign keys
into both of those tables.

15
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,040
Here are the same tables,
but this time drawn out.

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:55,270
Usually a foreign key will point to
the primary key of the referenced table.

17
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,770
That's because the whole point of
a foreign key is to uniquely identify

18
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,040
a row in the referenced table, and
the table's primary key does that.

19
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,819
Now here's a quiz.

20
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:05,840
These tables are for

21
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,650
a more complex forum app than
the one you worked on last lesson.

22
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,850
This app allows users to log in and
post comments, and

23
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,180
also vote on other people's posts.

24
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,140
Take a look at these tables, and see if
you can figure out which columns should

25
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,430
be primary keys, and which columns
should be foreign keys referencing them.

26
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,130
In the users table,
we have a username or handle or

27
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,360
alias, and the user's full name.

28
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,090
In this posts table,

29
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:37,940
we have the post content, the author's
username, and an ID number for the post.

30
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,540
And in the votes table,
we have the id number of a post,

31
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,312
the username of somebody who
voted on that post, and a 1 or

32
00:01:45,312 --> 00:01:48,130
minus 1 for whether they liked it or
disliked it.

33
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:52,400
So for each one of these columns, if it
should be a primary key of that table,

34
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,350
put a P in that box.

35
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,400
If it should be a foreign key, put an F.

36
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,480
If it shouldn't be either one,
leave the box empty.

37
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,330
Also, although there's no check boxes
for them, think about if any of

38
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,440
these tables should have primary
keys with more than one column.
