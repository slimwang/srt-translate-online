1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,080
One more little specific
tracking method and

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,400
this comes from the work of tracking
people, particularly their limbs and

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,990
stuff by learning their appearance and
the idea is they build a person model.

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,830
And the person model is made up
of a couple different things.

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,120
It's made up of an appearance,

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,950
we'll talk about what that is
in a minute, plus structure.

7
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,740
plus dynamics, allright?

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:28,170
Now the structure and dynamics are
generic, that is, they are the lengths

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,780
of my body, the dynamics are how
they can move so, you know,

10
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:37,030
what are the speeds people tend to move
and some of the process noise, but

11
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:42,270
the appearance is person specific,
okay, so the idea is

12
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,030
I'm going to learn the appearance,
and then I'm going to do the tracking.

13
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,900
And that's represented in
this picture here, allright?

14
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:54,380
So the idea is given some input
examples, we build the model,

15
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,660
and the model is, like I said,
it's generic structure, but

16
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:03,890
we might learn the colors and, you know,
the textures of these different parts.

17
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,400
And then, using that appearance and

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,510
the structure, we can do the detection
running, on the, on the new frames.

19
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,300
Here's the reference,
Ramanan, Forsyth and

20
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,870
Zisserman, and this is showing you
them tracking those people parts.

21
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,320
And the idea is they use a appearance.

22
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,330
That's all I want to talk
about that specific method.

23
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:27,390
A bit later actually, towards the end of
this course we're going to describe some

24
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,300
recognition methods that use a lower
dimensional space for doing recognition.

25
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,340
We've mentioned piece,
principal component analysis, et cetera.

26
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,850
Once we do that, we can talk about
a couple more one or two more tracking

27
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:44,100
examples that use a PCA-base description
as their appearance model but

28
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,960
until we have that it,
it would be premature to talk about it.
