00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,520
In this last work session,

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,910
you'll build a final version
of your mad libs generator.

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:06,710
Which is the one that you saw Andy and
I play at the beginning of stage two.

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,890
You'll see how your new knowledge of For
loops and

5
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:13,020
lists will allow you to build
a powerful Mad Libs generator.

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,870
Which will be able to not only
replace the words noun and verb.

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,090
But any other replacement word that you
want like place, adjective or name.

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,830
You'll also learn about a new function,

9
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,910
which will let you use user
inputs as substitute words.

10
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,360
Rather than randomly generate ones.

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,860
There will also be a tutorial for
mac and

12
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,170
pc users on how to run
this program locally.
