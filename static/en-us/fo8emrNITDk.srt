00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,685
Focusing in on human evolution, we'll see that modern humans have been around

2
00:00:04,685 --> 00:00:10,612
for only about 200,000 years, but we're still going strong. Other human species

3
00:00:10,612 --> 00:00:14,776
have been alive for a lot longer, but they're now extinct. Homo

4
00:00:14,776 --> 00:00:20,471
neanderthalensis or neanderthals, lived from about 400,000 years ago to about

5
00:00:20,471 --> 00:00:27,179
28,000 years ago. Whereas Homo erectus lived from around 1.8 million years ago

6
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:33,734
to about 300,000 years ago. And Homo habilus lived somewhere around 2.4 to 2.5

7
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:40,386
million years ago until about 1.4 million years ago. Modern humans also share

8
00:00:40,386 --> 00:00:44,570
kinship with other living primates like modern chimpanzees.
