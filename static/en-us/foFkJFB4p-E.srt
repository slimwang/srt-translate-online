1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:06,410
One specific example for the men's side
platform is the Google Display Network.

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:10,820
The Google Display Network GDN is
a collection of over a million websites,

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,350
apps, videos, and
blogs that show AdWords ads.

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,170
Basically these million plus sites are
using Google to help them offer their

5
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,160
page to monetize by
providing advertisers with

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,410
online real estate to advertise on.

7
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:27,190
The Google algorithm will target
the ads to the appropriate audience

8
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,060
by ensuring that the ads
are relevant for the page content.

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,740
Will do this matching based on the
keywords you select and other factors.

10
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,400
This will give you a much wider audience
than just being in search results.

11
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,130
>> With GDN,

12
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,400
you have the opportunity to fine tune
where you want your ads to be seen.

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,290
Beyond selecting audience
based on key words,

14
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,770
you can choose topics to
narrow your audience.

15
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,150
So for Abarkment we can choose to
focus on dog related websites or

16
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,110
pick a specific site like
one that sells pet supplies.

17
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,530
Or we can block our ads from certain
sites that aren't relevant to what we

18
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,970
do, like a site that's dedicated
to hating dogs and loving cats.

19
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:08,452
We can even focus on people who
have been to our site before and

20
00:01:08,452 --> 00:01:10,690
re target them when
they go to other sites.

21
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,280
This is called remarketing and

22
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,320
you can find out more about
that in the instructor notes.

23
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,210
>> It's called a display network.

24
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,650
Because unlike Google search,
where you can use only text ads.

25
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,330
Here you can display all types
of formats like text, image,

26
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,410
interactive, and video ads.

27
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,600
To learn more about this check
out the instructor notes.

28
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:34,930
>> So with AdWords beyond Google search,
we can target the display network.

29
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,150
And specifically for

30
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,920
mobile, you can capture the mobile
Google display network.

31
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,700
So if you have a mobile website,
you can advertise and

32
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,650
with mobile text ads,
or mobile image ads,

33
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:52,680
that capture users that are browsing
different sites on their mobile phone.

34
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,450
And they may see one of your ads and
decide to click on it and

35
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,610
go to your mobile site.

36
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:02,180
So that's our regular mobile GDN,
Google Display Network,

37
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,150
that's more to drive users
to your mobile site.

38
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:10,130
The other opportunity you have
is to drive app installs,

39
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,200
and we recommend setting up a campaign
where you would target apps.

40
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,150
So your ad would actually
show in other apps.

41
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:25,300
So when a user is, for
example, using an app of maybe

42
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:30,120
you want to specify a certain category
in which you want to target users.

43
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,390
So for example let's say,
I like to travel a lot.

44
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,060
As a user, I might be on a lot
of different travel apps.

45
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,300
Hotel apps, flight apps,
whatever it may be.

46
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,960
But it's maybe I also
have a dog at home and

47
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,930
I need to make sure that I have
housing for my dog while I'm gone.

48
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,890
Well then as a dog Airbnb business

49
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:57,670
you can target users
who are in travel apps.

50
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,460
So that would be a type of
targeting you could set up.

51
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,840
Find users who are you know
most likely to travel.

52
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,230
And they're already
probably using travel apps.

53
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:11,270
And then I want to target my
ad to show when they're using

54
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,430
one of those travel apps.

55
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:18,170
So you can think about what's the best
type of targeting to capture that target

56
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,600
audience for you.

57
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,450
So one thing that I'm really
excited about is AdWords just

58
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:26,920
released a new type of,
a new campaign type for

59
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,240
display targeting specifically for
app promotion.

60
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,270
So, it's called
the Universal App Campaign, and

61
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,870
it's one of the easiest
campaigns you can set up.

62
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,079
Which is why [LAUGH] I really like it.

63
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:43,470
All you need to do is link your app to
the campaign and say I want to drive

64
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:49,430
users to install my app and this is
my target and cost for install price.

65
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,910
And then you really just type
up four different lines that

66
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:57,340
could be cycled through for the ad
created and then AdWords does the rest.

67
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,230
They create the Add formats, and

68
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:04,950
then they then add words will
determine all of the targeting.

69
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,080
The great thing about our
universal app campaign

70
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,930
is that it targets all the different
platforms that Google can offer.

71
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,340
So that would include Google search and
Google Play,

72
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,589
but also the Google Display Network.

73
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:24,160
We were talking about it with
target all categories for apps.

74
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,490
So you can have in app ads.

75
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,020
And then, it also targets YouTube.

76
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,930
Now, we haven't talked
about YouTube yet, but

77
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,440
let's say that you have a YouTube
video promoting your business.

78
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,740
So you can drop that video
in this campaign, and

79
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,970
it will also start
targeting users on YouTube.

80
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:42,950
So the great thing is,

81
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,590
it covers all the different bases,
it's a really easy set up.

82
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,960
And it just drives downloads at
your target cost per install.

83
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,950
So, it's a campaign that is easy to
set up and it knows what you want.

84
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,570
Ideally, it's going to deliver that
within a couple weeks of testing.
