1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,820
By now you know how important it is
to create goals and look at metrics.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,970
But other than tracking those goals,
how do you affect them?

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:09,760
Your routine,

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,180
as a marketeer at a startup should
be based on trial and error.

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,620
Experimentation and iteration is
the most important thing for a startup.

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,219
Let's hear what some of our
experts have to say about this.

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,880
>> We did some sort of
behavioral studies of

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,730
what a new user to YouTube,
how they utilize the service.

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,260
And it typically, what we would see

10
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,110
would be the first time they would come
visit this site would be through some

11
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,590
kind of viral marketing that may be they
saw one of their friends share a video.

12
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,510
Maybe it was on Myspace, maybe it
was an email, check out this video,

13
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,010
this was really funny.

14
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,680
But the first time generally it
doesn't really stick with them,

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,240
they don't remember this site,
maybe they'll remember the site.

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,090
They will remember this site, but

17
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,800
they won't remember the site that it
came from, because I think we get that

18
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,020
all of the time where people would
just be sharing the instant messages

19
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,900
through emails, just check this thing
out on the Internet, it's very funny and

20
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,280
you see it, you laugh and
then you close the browser window.

21
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,200
But I think the second time, there
would be another time where somebody

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,890
would share this, another video.

23
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,730
Maybe it'd be somebody else sharing and
then after a few times visiting

24
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,940
the site, it starts kind of, the logo
starts kind of thinking in a bit,

25
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,880
the sort of domain names start
sinking in a little bit.

26
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,700
And what we would see is that people,

27
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,850
they themselves would type in
YouTube.com into the browser and

28
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,610
they would actually go
to the site themselves.

29
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:42,740
And then from there, It's about
sort of uploading their own videos,

30
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,120
finding their own videos and sharing it,
so it kind of spreads out that way.

31
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:51,503
But we've always kind of looked at it
required a lot of sort of effort with

32
00:01:51,503 --> 00:01:57,239
the design of the site to be able to say
within the first five seconds, that's

33
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:02,728
the amount of time window that you have
to be able to really grab the users.

34
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:06,142
And so there was a lot of work that was
done on the related videos on the right

35
00:02:06,142 --> 00:02:09,666
side, because the video that you were
sent may not be interesting at all, or

36
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:12,696
may not be up your sleeve in terms
of what you'd be interested in,

37
00:02:12,696 --> 00:02:14,928
but something on the right
side would grab you.

38
00:02:14,928 --> 00:02:19,062
Same thing on the front page, there
would be ten videos, so we're always any

39
00:02:19,062 --> 00:02:23,148
page on YouTube there was always one
link away from starting another video.

40
00:02:23,148 --> 00:02:26,939
And so in case you got bored,
instead of closing your browser, I think

41
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:30,925
psychologically it's always easier to
kind of spend more time on a site,

42
00:02:30,925 --> 00:02:33,840
rather than closing the browser and
going to do work.

43
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,780
And so there's always something
that's within one click

44
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,520
that can start another video and
if you don't like that, again,

45
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,620
then there's another,
one click away from another video.

46
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,350
One significant

47
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:50,178
part of YouTube is not the first video
viewed but the subsequent video.

48
00:02:50,178 --> 00:02:56,400
That whole experience and so
whether, and we've different

49
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,860
metrics giving us different times, but
it has been as high as something as, or

50
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:04,050
it has been as low as sort of
the average length session of YouTube is

51
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,180
like 12 minutes, but it's been as high
by some metrics as 28 minutes and

52
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,300
that's incredible when you consider
the average length of the videos.

53
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,170
Whatever, 30 seconds to minutes and
so well,

54
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:17,110
one important part of that is and
not the first video.

55
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,760
We're assuming that people
are already getting to the site but

56
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,760
how do you get them to watch and
click on the second video and

57
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,890
then after that how do you get
them to click on another video.

58
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:28,570
And more importantly cause like if
they get disappointed by that second,

59
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,320
third video how do you still get them
to click on the fourth, fifth, sixth,

60
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,040
seventh video.

61
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:39,930
And the solution to that,
partly, is the related videos

62
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,450
on the right side and we always put that
high because that was going to be your

63
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,980
channel to get into more content,
but then the follow-up question.

64
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:53,390
And this is where we had the smartest
engineers at YouTube working on this day

65
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,310
end, day out, which was how do you
populate that related to video?

66
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:03,230
One idea of thinking about
the content on YouTube, is you can

67
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,710
think about it and sort of almost
different islands that are connected.

68
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:10,660
Somehow, but different islands, they're
islands about sort of singers and

69
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,220
the different types of
genres of artists out there.

70
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,959
And then there's islands of sort of
movies, there's islands that related to

71
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,700
fashion and food and there's islands
that's more directed towards kids.

72
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,890
So there's all these different islands,
some of them are bigger,

73
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,590
some of them are continents and
some of them are tiny.

74
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,570
But people are very
passionate about that and

75
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:32,050
they're all interconnected with graphs
and if you can visualize that then it's

76
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:36,370
kind of what if you are watching
a single video on one of these.

77
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,020
Maybe it's a big continent and
maybe it's a small island.

78
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:44,170
What do you populate with all
the other videos on the right side?

79
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,600
And the obvious approach is if you're
watching a content about cooking,

80
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,070
everybody on the right side
is more about cooking and so

81
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,160
it's all within the same island.

82
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,293
But what if by the fifth video they're
just sick of watching cooking videos,

83
00:04:57,293 --> 00:04:59,658
how do you get them to
watch something else?

84
00:04:59,658 --> 00:05:03,423
And so we realized early on, but there
was a lot of testing involved with this,

85
00:05:03,423 --> 00:05:07,258
is, what if we actually start stuffing
in different types of content in there.

86
00:05:07,258 --> 00:05:10,898
So what would be coming back from
search results would be the things that

87
00:05:10,898 --> 00:05:14,380
are most related with this video is
obvious it's going to be cooking.

88
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:19,950
But let's just say artificially we
take out 50%, 75% of this content.

89
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:24,570
We just make it so it's impossible
to show more than 25% related

90
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:28,250
videos is cooking, then you start
actually feeding in this other content.

91
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:33,460
Maybe we find out that people that are
interested in cooking also like soccer.

92
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,280
And so we start actually putting in 10%

93
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,350
of the videos which
are related to soccer.

94
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,510
And started playing around with this and
so

95
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:43,630
maybe people that are interested
in this abstraction of soccer and

96
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,870
sports if they're watching sports
videos maybe they're also interested in

97
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,190
watching football or maybe they're
interested in watching tennis.

98
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,590
And so we started playing
around with this idea,

99
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:56,970
what percentage is tightly related
to the video that you're watching.

100
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:02,600
How much of it is, it's not unrelated
ever, but there was a algorithm

101
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,880
that went behind, how do you actually
create this sort of loose relationship?

102
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,020
They're still related, because we do
know that people that watch this content

103
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,910
also watch this content.

104
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:16,810
But it would be hard to explain if you
didn't look at what the actual watching

105
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,800
sessions and patterns are to be able to

106
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,000
create that connection between
say food and football.

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,200
Well, that's probably
an easy one to create, but so

108
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,470
we started doing a lot of
research along these lines and

109
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:32,800
trying to create algorithms to be able
to better guess as to people that

110
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,310
are watching this video would also be
interested in watching this video.

111
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:42,370
But it took a lot of theories and
testing those theories,

112
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,910
and pushing stuff out live and
seeing what the users would actually do,

113
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,010
and tweaking and
tweaking and tweaking that.
