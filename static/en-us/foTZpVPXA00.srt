00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,126
Now going back to the 3 pricing schemes for the 3 different cleaning solution

2
00:00:04,138 --> 00:00:08,336
companies, we want to figure out how much each of these solutions would cost

3
00:00:08,348 --> 00:00:12,630
Grant's cleaning glasses company if he were to buy them. You're going to want an

4
00:00:12,642 --> 00:00:16,899
equation for each solution option so that he can compare how much he would spend

5
00:00:16,911 --> 00:00:20,814
depending on how many gallons of solution he wants to buy. Let's start by

6
00:00:20,826 --> 00:00:24,890
creating a general word equation that we can use later to create specific

7
00:00:24,902 --> 00:00:29,510
equations for each of these brands. Here are some quantities. Gallons of

8
00:00:29,522 --> 00:00:34,530
solution ordered, price per gallon, shipping time, total cost, rush order fee,

9
00:00:34,637 --> 00:00:39,550
and distance shipped. I'd like you to place the letter corresponding to one of

10
00:00:39,562 --> 00:00:44,325
these quantities in each of these boxes. To create an equation that you think

11
00:00:44,337 --> 00:00:44,702
fits a situation Grant is up against.
