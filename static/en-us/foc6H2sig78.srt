1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So now we're going to see a representation of Boolean formulas

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
in Python that we're going to be using

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
to then write a function is satisfied

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
that checks whether a given Boolean formula

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and a given assignment of true false values

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
to that Boolean formula or rather to the variables

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
in that Boolean formula satisfies it.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So first, we have a variable num_variables,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
which is simply the number of variables that are in the Boolean formula,

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
the number of distinct variables that is.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The Boolean formula itself is represented

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
as a list of lists where each inner list is a clause.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
For example, this inner list is the clause X1 or X2 or not X3,

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and you can see that the variables that are negated are negative.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This clause would be X2 or not X4.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And this clause is not X1 or X3 or X4.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And then of course each individual clause would be anded together.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Assignment is a list of true false assignments to the individual variables.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Note that assignment has one more element in it

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
than the number of variables.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The first one is actually just a place holder.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It doesn't do anything.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We're only concerned with the second element through the end of the list.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Now if we have these individual assignments to the variables

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and then we print is satisfied of these,

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
we can see that it returns true.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
This is a satisfied Boolean formula

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
or rather this Boolean formula is satisfied by this assignment

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
where X1 is true, X2 is true, X3 is true, and X4 true.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And if you run C through this and check,

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
you'll see that that is in fact the case.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Now if we change assignment to true, false, true, true,

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
then we can see that this assignment does not satisfy

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
the Boolean formula and returns false.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So your job is to write the is satisfied function

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
to fill in the body of the function so that it correctly

37
00:02:06,000 --> 99:59:59,999
interprets whether a Boolean formula is satisfied by a given assignment.
