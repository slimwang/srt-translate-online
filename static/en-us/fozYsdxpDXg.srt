1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,880
These two equations can be solved as a system of equations if we know the

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:09,764
values of the area and the perimeter. Throughout this lesson, we'll usually see

3
00:00:09,764 --> 00:00:14,180
the equations written like this. Here A just stands for area, which is usually

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:19,795
a number. And P stands for perimeter, which is also a number. But this equation

5
00:00:19,795 --> 00:00:24,993
is pretty important, it turns out P will usually be an even number. And that

6
00:00:24,993 --> 00:00:29,874
usually happens, since we have two ws and two ls. So if w is odd, or if l is

7
00:00:29,874 --> 00:00:35,486
odd, this number will still wind up being even. So, let's take every number and

8
00:00:35,486 --> 00:00:41,075
divide it by 2, since the perimeter will usually be even. So if we divide p by

9
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:47,196
2, 2l by 2 and 2w by 2, we get this new equation. Now, it may seem like we'll

10
00:00:47,196 --> 00:00:51,430
have to work with fractions here. But keep in mind that P will usually be an

11
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:55,510
even number, so P divided by two will just be an integer.
