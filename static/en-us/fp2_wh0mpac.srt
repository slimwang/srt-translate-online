1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Norvig] 5 factorial to the 5th was 24 billion.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And if we assume we have a 2.4 gigahertz computer, which is fairly typical,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
then if all this could be compiled into 1 computer instruction,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
then it would take 10 seconds.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
But of course that's ridiculous. You can't do all of that in 1 instruction.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
If it was 100 instructions, then that would mean it would be 1000 seconds,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
which is about 16 minutes, but that seems too little.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's probably going to be more like 1000 instructions to make it all the way through

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
doing all this and then checking the constraints,

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and so that would be about 160 minutes.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And so an hour to 3 hours. Maybe we'll say 2 or 3 hours, somewhere in there.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It might be as little as 1 hour. We can't really tell because this is just an estimate.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
But it's definitely going to be in the hour range and not in the minutes or day range.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
In fact, I actually ran this program,

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and we'll come back later and see how well this estimate of somewhere in there worked out.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let me just say because we've learned that this will take somewhere in the range of an hour,

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
don't try to run it here in the browser by hitting the Run button

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
because we timeout the calculations after just a few seconds, so it's not going to work here.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You could type it into your own computer if you have Python running on your own computer,

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
set it going, and see how it works.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But first we have to figure out how to do all the constraints.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So we already did constraint number 1, which was houses = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Now let's do constraint number 2, which is that the Englishman lives in the red house.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We want to write some if statement to check if the Englishman lives in the red house

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and if so, we go on; if not, we give up.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And so how do we check if it's true that the Englishman lives in the red house?

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So if, and then I want you to fill in some expression here.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We'll just say that this is constraint number 2.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Tell me what you could put in here.
