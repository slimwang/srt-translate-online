1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,030
To make sure that the buttons do not appear in the page

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:07,010
until after the animation has run through,

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,900
thus preserving the author driven part of our narrative.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,170
All we need to do is put the same code that I just showed you

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:19,100
that creates the buttons in the conditional statement that clears our interval.

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:24,310
So again, if you remember, we set our interval and once we run out of years,

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:29,220
to show an update, we call clearInterval and exited.

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,190
But in our case, we want to first clear the interval, and now add some buttons.

9
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,350
So let's see what that looks like.
