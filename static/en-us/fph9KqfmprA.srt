Here's a test of your knowledge of shading and illumination models. We have

2
00:00:03,222 --> 00:00:08,154
Phong compared to Gouraud and we have Blinn-Phong compared to Lambertian. Say we

3
00:00:08,154 --> 00:00:12,759
have a scene and try out each of these four combinations. Assume that shading

4
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:17,170
costs in execution time far outweigh the illumination costs. In other words, if

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,082
a fragment shader is used to evaluate illumination. It'll be considerably more

6
00:00:21,082 --> 00:00:25,174
expensive than any vertex spaced shading approach. Assign each combination a

7
00:00:25,174 --> 00:00:29,688
number, rating them from least to most expensive in cost. In other words, 1

8
00:00:29,688 --> 00:00:33,473
means the smallest amount of time needed, 4 means the largest.
