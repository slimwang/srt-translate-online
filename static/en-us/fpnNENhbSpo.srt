00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,332
So this general area of work, is actually started by, I guess,

2
00:00:04,332 --> 00:00:09,110
probably Horn and maybe some others, but I certainly learned about it from back,

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,170
way back in the 70s and continued in the 80s and

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,420
90s quite a bit, it's referred to as shape from shading.

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:19,130
And the idea is, over here you see a picture of a real sphere this time, right,

6
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:23,370
and you can tell this is a sphere, right with the light source over here.

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,420
Likewise, you can tell that from this person that,

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:30,710
that probably this is the front part facing you and that the shape tapers off.

9
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,160
Likewise, you can tell from the shading here something about the texture and

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,390
the shape of the face.

11
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,670
And the, the question is,

12
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:44,290
is how do you use shading as sort of a cue for recovering the shape information?

13
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,390
So in order to talk about shape from shading or,

14
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,710
I'll call it shape from lighting.

15
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,060
Because one of the things that we're going to do in

16
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,470
a little bit called photometric stereo, it's not so

17
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:56,660
much a shading variation as it is from having multiple light sources.

18
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,790
What we have to do is we have to look at the relationship between the intensity

19
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,490
that's seen by the camera and the actual shape of the object.

20
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,080
Now, that means we have to look at that reflectance function.

21
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,390
Remember what we defined I guess two lessons ago about this interaction between

22
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,080
the surface normals and the light direction and the surface itself.

23
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,540
In particular we're going to introduce a mathematical construct.

24
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,380
Refered to as the reflectance map,

25
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,100
and the reflectance map will be the basis of a lot of what we'll be doing today
