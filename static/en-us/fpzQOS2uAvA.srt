00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,450
Here we see an analysis by provider for

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:08,620
the use of lipid lowering drugs for
patients at risk for coronary disease.

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,110
This analysis is intended
to help providers

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:17,090
find patients whose treatment may fall
outside of accepted standards of care.

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,390
Here's a more detailed analysis.

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,230
And an analysis of
the relationship between

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,180
the blood pressure of the patient and
the use of lipid-lowering drugs

8
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,780
illustrating the clinical detail that's
possible when EMR data is made available

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,770
in addition to the typical quality
metrics used in population health.
