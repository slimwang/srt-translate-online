1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,640
Let's talk about permissions.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:07,250
When each APK is installed,
it's given its own unique Linux user ID.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,150
And each app runs within its own
instance of an Android runtime.

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,310
As a result,
each app is completely sandboxed.

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,070
Its files, processes, and

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,774
other resources
are inaccessible to other apps.

7
00:00:18,774 --> 00:00:21,250
This sandboxing approach
is used to ensure that,

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,780
by default,
no app can access sensitive data or

9
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:29,089
perform actions that could adversely
affect other apps, the OS or users.

10
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:32,472
Things like accessing the Internet,
getting the user's location or

11
00:00:32,472 --> 00:00:35,390
reading or
modifying the contacts database.

12
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,750
Rather than asking the user each time an
app tries to access something sensitive,

13
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,939
you declare the permissions you
require in your app's manifest.

14
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:45,719
You can get a list of all the
permissions your app may require here.

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,200
So why not just ask for
all the permissions and

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,980
never worry about it again?

17
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:54,309
Well when users install your app
on older versions of Android,

18
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,500
they are greeted with a dialogue listing
the permissions you've requested,

19
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,020
along with more user
friendly descriptions.

20
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,820
Nothing says this app was built by
hackers who want to steal my data,

21
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,799
rob my house, clear out my bank account,
and take and share nude pictures of me,

22
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,920
like a weather app that wants access
to every permission on my device.

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,379
Since that can be overwhelming to users,
starting with Android 6.0 Marshmallow,

24
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:19,917
many permissions are granted without
the need for the permissions dialog.

25
00:01:19,918 --> 00:01:22,650
Certain sensitive informations
must be acknowledged by the user

26
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,650
when your application is running.

27
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:29,170
The best practice is to request the
absolute minimum number of permissions.

28
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:32,950
Every time you need to request a new
permission, take as a flag to stop and

29
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:37,140
consider if there are other alternatives
that might achieve the same goal.

30
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,629
For example, in Android you can launch
the camera app and ask it to take

31
00:01:40,629 --> 00:01:44,199
a picture on your behalf rather than
having to access the camera directly.
