00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,810
Okay, Michael so I have written out biased on upon your rather impressive way

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,430
of thinking about it. All the possible

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,870
strategies for a. And all the possible strategies

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:15,970
for b. A, can go left, left, left right, right left, right, right. For states

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:21,060
one and four respectively. And b can go Left right, middle right or right right.

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:21,470
>> Right.

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,320
>> Right. In particular, three in stage

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,310
three we can only go R. Which makes me a?

9
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,280
>> Conservative?

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,200
>> A pirate.

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,690
>> Oh. That makes more sense.

12
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,200
>> It does make more sense. Okay. So,

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,680
now why did I write it this way Michael?

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,150
Well, I wrote it this way because if I write it this way with all the choices,

15
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:44,750
all the strategies that b has up here and all the strategies that a have here. I

16
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:51,240
actually form a matrix. And I can put in each of cells of the matrix the value

17
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,000
of taking a particular from a and a

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,680
particular strategy from b. Does that make sense?

19
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,180
>> Yeah, that's very clever.

20
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,150
>> Yes, it is very clever. I'm very happy that I came

21
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:06,900
up with it entirely on my own. Okay, so let's start filling

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,060
in these numbers. Or, instead of filling in the numbers ourselves, we

23
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,160
could ask the students to do it by making it a quiz.

24
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,540
>> Nice, I see.

25
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,970
>> Shall we do that?

26
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:16,510
>> Sure

27
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,350
doesn't seem very hard.

28
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,990
>> Okay, so let's make certain everyone here understands

29
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,570
and what exactly we're asking you to do. We're saying

30
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,510
that if for example A takes this first strategy

31
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,160
go left and stay one and left and stayed four.

32
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,860
And B takes it's first strategy which is go

33
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,760
left and stay two and right and stayed three. What

34
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:39,160
is the value for A that will result? So, let's

35
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,720
actually do the first one as an example and ask

36
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,070
everyone to do the rest of them. That seem fair?

37
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,480
>> Yeah, that's what I was going to suggest too.

38
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,450
>> Okay, good. So let's see. If A chooses to go left in state one, since A

39
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:56,090
goes first, we'll end up in state 2, right? And then in this first strategy. B

40
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:00,230
goes left in state two, which means we will end up going down this path and the

41
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:07,160
value there is plus seven. So seven is in fact the value of this game with

42
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,060
respect to A. Now we know that because this

43
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,770
is a two player zero sum finite deterministic game

44
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,940
of perfect information. That if a gets a value

45
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,640
of seven, b gets a value of minus seven. So

46
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,710
we could write minus seven here, seven comma minus

47
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,010
seven here. But since we know that it's equal

48
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,460
and opposite let's just write down the value for

49
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,870
a. Okay? Just for compactness-sake. That seem fair to you?

50
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,600
>> Yeah.

51
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,190
>> Okay, cool. So with that

52
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,830
in mind, let's see if we can fill out

53
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,410
the rest of this table. Think you can do it?

54
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,060
>> I think so.

55
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,690
>> Okay. Then.

56
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:39,990
>> Can you give me a place to write everything?

57
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,490
>> It will magically appear. Go.
