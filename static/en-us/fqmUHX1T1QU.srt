A rational function is a function that's one polynomial divided by another

2
00:00:03,522 --> 00:00:08,542
polynomial. Rational functions are like rational numbers, except, instead of an

3
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:12,510
integer divided by an integer, such as 3/4's, it's a polynomial divided by

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:18,498
another polynomial. We already saw a simple example earlier, in y equals 1 over

5
00:00:18,498 --> 00:00:22,516
x. But they can get much more complicated, and therefore, much more

6
00:00:22,516 --> 00:00:27,798
interesting. You might even have something like this. Y equals negative 3x

7
00:00:27,798 --> 00:00:34,268
cubed plus 2x squared minus 7, all divided by X to the 4th minus X. Note that

8
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:37,796
actually all of the other choices that I gave you here, also technically are

9
00:00:37,796 --> 00:00:43,014
rational functions. They just all have denominators of 1. Remember that

10
00:00:43,014 --> 00:00:45,974
constants are polynomials, too. Most of the rational functions we'll see

11
00:00:45,974 --> 00:00:48,170
though, look more like these 2.
