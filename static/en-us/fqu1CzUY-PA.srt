00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,170
When you want to use a database
in your application,

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,300
first you need to create
the database and give it a name.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,180
You'll use the create
database thread for this.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,620
The name you give it here,

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,300
is the same name you'll use to connect
to the database from your code.

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,790
The opposite of create in SQL is drop.

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,240
I'm not sure why.

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,130
Maybe database programmers
used to be really clumsy.

9
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:26,220
Anyway, the way to remove a data base,
is drop database.

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,270
And the way to remove
a table is drop table.

11
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,860
All of these commands have options,

12
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,610
you can look up in the documentation
if you ever need them.

13
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,840
When you drop a data base or

14
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,770
a table, there's no confirmation, no
did you really mean to do that warning.

15
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,400
So don't do it,
if you don't really mean it.

16
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,500
Once you've created a database in psql,
you'll want to connect to it.

17
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,870
You can do that using
the backslash C command,

18
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,940
followed by the database's name.

19
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,540
By the way, you can't drop
a database that you're connected to.

20
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,235
Try these commands on your
own in your VM using psql.

21
00:00:57,235 --> 00:01:01,905
First, create a new database called
fishies, or whatever you'd like.

22
00:01:01,905 --> 00:01:02,905
Once you've created it,

23
00:01:02,905 --> 00:01:07,325
switch psql's connection over to
that database, with \c fishies.

24
00:01:07,325 --> 00:01:10,805
Then create a table,
make one of the columns a text column,

25
00:01:10,805 --> 00:01:12,765
one of the columns a serial column.

26
00:01:12,765 --> 00:01:14,985
Then try inserting some values
with the text column and

27
00:01:14,985 --> 00:01:17,120
selecting some rows from the table.

28
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,160
What do you think will
happen in the serial column,

29
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,980
when you insert a row that
doesn't give it a value?

30
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:22,860
Try it in psql.

31
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,020
What was it that actually happened?

32
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,000
Then after that,

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,410
try finding a description of this
behavior in the post SQL documentation.
