00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,050
All right.

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,200
So this is going to be
the 30 second version.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,170
If you want more detail, check out the
next video where I'll be spending seven

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:13,340
or eight minutes really diving into
how I use dev tools to make changes.

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,810
The meta tag looks like this, copy and

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,340
paste this line into the head of
your HTML and you are good to go.

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,050
In order to make everything
display in a single column,

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,370
I needed to make it take
up the full viewport.

9
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:27,460
The basic idea is that I ran
through the CSS looking for

10
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,370
any containers with fixed
widths set smaller than 100%.

11
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,820
Then, I simply made them 100%.

12
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,520
Using a relative width of 100% means
that an element is going to take up as

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,950
much space as it can,

14
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,500
which means that if you've got
a container it'll take up the viewport.

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,870
Tab targets that's easy just
add some padding to all of

16
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:51,167
your a tags I used 1.5em and
after that I tested, and

17
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:56,530
here it is on mobile and
here it is when the screen gets wider,

18
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,100
notice that everything is
taking up the full viewport.

19
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,660
Now if you want the full story of how
this happened watch the next video.
