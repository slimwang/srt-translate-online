00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,850
In the first exercise,
you saw string interpolation.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:06,050
In other words,
inserting the values of variables and

3
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:09,199
expressions directly
into string literals.

4
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:11,559
Let's see it again now
with another example.

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,660
Say we have a statement about
how much food my roommates dog,

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,019
Mia eats per month.

7
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:19,670
If we were to use a variable for

8
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,939
the dog's name instead of just Mia, our
statement becomes much more versatile.

9
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,275
[BLANK_AUDIO]

10
00:00:27,275 --> 00:00:31,756
So here I declare, dogName and
lbsPerMonth, as variables and

11
00:00:31,756 --> 00:00:34,980
we can insert them into
our original string.

12
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,158
And here you can see, this is
the same string as we had earlier.

13
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,628
But now, because we're using
variables and string interpolation.

14
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:49,219
If I want to know how much Zebedee,
the smiling Samoyed, eats per month,

15
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:53,450
we can just switch out the values
of our two variables, and voila.

16
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,429
Now we have Zebedee eats 25
pounds of dog food per month.

17
00:00:58,869 --> 00:01:01,009
We can add expressions as well.

18
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:03,170
Zebedee is a pretty worldly pooch, so

19
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,609
lets say we want to know how much
Zebedee eats in kilos instead of pounds.

20
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:08,549
This expression for

21
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:12,719
kilos which includes the conversion rate
can be evaluated as the string is built.

22
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:18,220
And we'll print it out here
as our metricDoggyDiet.

23
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:22,359
And if we wanted to change this up so
we know how much Mia eats in kilos,

24
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:25,352
we can just plug in her consumption
rate in pounds and we're good to go.
