00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,960
As we've seen, if/else statements
really give you control over your code.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,859
They allow us to write code at
a higher level, by giving us

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,640
the ability to conditionally
execute different blocks of code.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,350
Now that you know about them,
I think you'll find yourself

5
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:14,199
incorporating them into
your everyday life.

6
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:15,809
For example,

7
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,629
if you're ready to learn more,
then continue on to the next lesson.
