1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Remember, we've been talking about pass/fail signals and experiments.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
As you get out of the building and start talking

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
to these potential customers

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
you need to set up some experiments.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
How do I know these are the right customers or the right buyers?

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And so you want to set up a series of experiments

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
to test interest and figure out where do you want to test it

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and what kind of experiments can you run,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and how many do you test?

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
By the way, the how many is a classic question,

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and the answer is it depends.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
In a business to business enterprise sale

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
you might get away with talking to less than 20 customers,

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and that's a great number.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But if you have a mobile or web app

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
you want to talk to hundreds if not thousands of customers.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Now, obviously you can't personally interview all of those

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
like you could in the enterprise, and so you want to get out and reach them virtually,

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
but the number you want to get to really is an order of magnitude different

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
than if you were doing B to B direct sales.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Just a caveat and a warning.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
When you're out of the building trying to talk to hundreds or thousands

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
of potential web or mobile app users

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
you want to be careful that you're not completely dependent on online surveys.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
People simply lie on surveys, and so what you want to have

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
is some sample where you actually bring those people into your building

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
or you go see them, and you watch their pupils dilate

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
as you actually ask them the question and see if that

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
kind of diverges from the data you're getting when they're hitting your website

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
or you're sending them questionnaires, and then you'll have a correlation

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
to be able to figure out is that data valid or not?

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Just keep that in mind when you're trying to reach hundreds or thousands

33
00:01:39,000 --> 99:59:59,999
of people for customer discovery.
