00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In opinion polls, we often report a margin of error.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Something like this margin of error is the same as the confidence interval width.

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Usually, the margin of error in polls is stated at the 95% level.

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Consider two candidates. In our poll, candidate A has 55 supporters.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Candidate B has only 45 supporters.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Please tell me what we would report as the results of the poll.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Percentage of support for candidate A plus or minus the margin of error at 95% confidence.
