It's been cool to see how we can combine functions mathematically, but what do

2
00:00:03,535 --> 00:00:07,530
the results of these combinations really mean? Well, to understand the

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,658
relationship between the original functions and combined functions, I think we

4
00:00:10,658 --> 00:00:14,434
should make some graphs. Starting with something simple sounds like a good

5
00:00:14,434 --> 00:00:19,425
idea. Here I've drawn the graphs of f of x equals 2x plus 1, and g of x equals

6
00:00:19,425 --> 00:00:25,508
3. Now, what if I wanted to add f and g together? Which of these three graphs

7
00:00:25,508 --> 00:00:28,819
do you think is a graph of this new function?
