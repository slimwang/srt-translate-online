1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,899
And this is a very tricky question. The answer is the second one on the left over here.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:13,766
And the reason is we can correspond black pixels just like this, assuming that both of these red pixels are subject to occlusion.

3
00:00:13,767 --> 00:00:17,399
So the penalty is 20 for two occluded pixels.

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,666
Now I should remark, in the initial version of this course, I got this wrong as your instructor,

5
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:28,366
and I checkmarked this box over here, stipulating that a bad match would be better,

6
00:00:28,367 --> 00:00:34,066
but then the penalty is 40 for two bad matches, the R and the R over here.

7
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:39,167
This is clearly the wrong answer, and this is the correct answer.
