Now that we've figured out, what we're using instead of y and z, we just need to

2
00:00:04,556 --> 00:00:09,029
substitute our new values, into the equation up here for the difference of 2

3
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:13,740
cubes. That's going to give us the factored form of x cubed minus 8. So, please

4
