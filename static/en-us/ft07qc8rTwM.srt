1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:04,330
Viewer driven narratives, on the other hand, take a very different approach.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,520
Rather than dictating a specific narrative,

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,220
it allows our user to freely interact with the data, and tell their own story.

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,149
This is the excellent crime-spotting visualization, created by Statement Design.

5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:19,220
Here, there's no specific ordering a particular narrative.

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,650
Instead, the data's presented to the viewer with various filters for

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,720
zoom level, time of day, time of week, and various crimes.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,530
Let's say I live in the Mission, and

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:34,440
I want to look at crime during my walk home from the Bart station everyday.

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,420
Let's go ahead and zoom in there.

11
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,700
I use the 16th Street in Mission Bart.

12
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,670
So, we'll zoom it no this particular area.

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,830
I'm only re, really worried about days of the week where I work, so

14
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,800
I'll select Monday through Friday.

15
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,660
I typically get home between 6 PM and midnight, so let's go ahead and

16
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,290
select that there.

17
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,390
We can see here that there are two thefts,

18
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,150
a narcotics, and simple assault violations in this area.

19
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,980
I can click into each one of these and

20
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,700
get more information about the particular crime.

21
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,790
With a few simple interactions, this visualization allowed me to ask a question

22
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,337
that was important to me, and tell my own story with this particular data set.

23
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,430
Another example of a viewer-driven visualization is Paths to the White House,

24
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,510
also by the New York Times.

25
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,680
Here we're presented with a decision tree that highlights the outcome of

26
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,140
the presidential election,

27
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,090
given how each candidate fares in key swing states like Florida.

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,536
The overarching narrative is presented in the beginning.

29
00:01:34,536 --> 00:01:40,300
That Obama has 84% of the paths to win, while Romney only has 15%.

30
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:45,100
But the viewer is invited to explore various outcomes by mousing over

31
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:45,859
the different paths.

32
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,340
If I'm interested in a particular swing state, such as Ohio,

33
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,700
I could see that if Romney wins Florida and Obama wins Ohio, Obama wins.

34
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,250
This is a great example of a hybrid between an overarching narrative and

35
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,240
a viewer-driven visualization.

36
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,270
This allows the viewer to mouse through and

37
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,729
look at each aspect of the data, and tell their own particular story.
