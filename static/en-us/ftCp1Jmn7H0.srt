1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,770
Okay. So now at this point that we exit from the loop, which means that we

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,857
encounter the sentinel which is the, marks the end of the, of the sentence.

3
00:00:09,857 --> 00:00:11,072
[CROSSTALK]. >> Are we guaranteed to exit?

4
00:00:13,857 --> 00:00:14,363
>> Well-

5
00:00:14,363 --> 00:00:17,062
>> You know, we'll, w'll have to fix the condition that we identified.

6
00:00:17,062 --> 00:00:21,143
>> But assuming that we, we fixed it,

7
00:00:21,143 --> 00:00:27,411
what happens if last character is not a sentinel?

8
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:28,908
>> Well, we tell the user, right,

9
00:00:28,908 --> 00:00:32,500
that he should follow, that he should enter sentence, end it with the period.

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,584
>> That's right, the user are always right.

11
00:00:36,584 --> 00:00:38,637
>> With their responsibility, right?

12
00:00:38,637 --> 00:00:41,460
You have to take care of all the possibilities here.

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,501
>> Well, as you might recall on a keyboard and a computer, the period and

14
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:49,576
the comma are right next to each other, and

15
00:00:49,576 --> 00:00:52,500
frequently people punch the wrong one.

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,066
It's called a slip in, in the cognitive world, and

17
00:00:57,066 --> 00:01:01,360
they put a comma in and then this thing loops forever.

18
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,416
>> I was thinking, in fact, if there was an enda file without a,

19
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:07,446
without a sentinel at the end.

20
00:01:07,446 --> 00:01:09,426
>> Even better.

21
00:01:09,426 --> 00:01:12,593
>> Yeah, I guess then what we'll get, an exception exit, right, and

22
00:01:12,593 --> 00:01:13,922
catching the exceptions, so.

23
00:01:13,922 --> 00:01:15,520
>> Without printing anything out?

24
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,600
>> Well, you know, the, the user will figure out that they did wrong.

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,640
We gave them instructions.

26
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,360
I mean, I don't know.

27
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,010
If we want to account for

28
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,280
all the possible behaviors, sure, I mean, just you know, let's agree to do that.

29
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,370
>> Hey, listen son, this is Aviaonic software we're building here and

30
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,090
that means planes crash if we can't-

31
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,534
>> Sure. >> Characters in a sentence.

32
00:01:31,534 --> 00:01:32,857
>> That's fine.

33
00:01:32,857 --> 00:01:35,067
You've kind of been on my back the whole time, but that's fine.

34
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:38,669
I mean if, if you think we should account for the, for this thing.

35
00:01:38,669 --> 00:01:39,764
We'll, we'll account for that.

36
00:01:39,764 --> 00:01:42,277
Do you want to mark it down as as a problem?

37
00:01:42,277 --> 00:01:42,790
>> We might send-

38
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:45,090
>> Crazy Bob, if you don't mind.

39
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,670
>> Maybe we need to send this guy back to the IT department.

40
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,720
>> I think we have read the point.

41
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,222
I think we have read the point.

42
00:01:50,222 --> 00:01:50,980
Doctor Bug gets the point, right Doctor Bug?

43
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,550
>> Yeah. I, I get the point.

44
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,600
Yeah. There's no need to kind of reiterate every time like three or

45
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,030
four times but, anyways.

46
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,600
Okay so where were, was I
