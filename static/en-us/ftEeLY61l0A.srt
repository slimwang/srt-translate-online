One of Bowlby's students, Mary Ainsworth, decided to test his theory in a lab,

2
00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:07,758
by creating situations of security and separation between infants and

3
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:13,330
caregivers. She called this the Strange Situation Test. Ainsworth would have

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:17,100
the caregiver and the baby come to the lab. The caregiver was often the mother.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,850
And the baby was between six to 12 months old. She would let the two get

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,115
comfortable in the lab and just hang out. Then Ainsworth would have the

7
00:00:24,115 --> 00:00:27,827
caregiver leave the room for a few minutes, then Ainsworth would observe how

8
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:33,722
the baby responds when his or her caregiver is gone. Ainsworth focused on two

9
00:00:33,722 --> 00:00:39,715
things. First, how the baby reacted when the caregiver left. Second, is how the

10
00:00:39,715 --> 00:00:44,676
baby reacted when the caregiver returned. Ainsworth had hundreds of babies and

11
00:00:44,676 --> 00:00:48,980
caregivers go through this strain situation test. What she found was clear

12
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,420
evidence for three distinct kinds of attachment styles.
