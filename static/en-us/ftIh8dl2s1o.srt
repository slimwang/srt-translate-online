If you got 19 inches by 10 inches, great work. If you didn't get that answer,

2
00:00:04,732 --> 00:00:09,580
let's see how we got that answer. First, I know that the width of a rectangle is

3
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:14,465
9 inches less then its length, so we can write the width, w is equal to 9 inches

4
00:00:14,477 --> 00:00:19,442
less then its length. So that's going to be l minus 9. The width is 9 inches

5
00:00:19,454 --> 00:00:24,820
less than its length. We also know that the perimeter is 58 inches. We know the

6
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:30,685
equation for perimeter is 2 times the length plus 2 times the width, or 2l plus

7
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:35,964
2w. If we know that w is l minus 9, we can simply replace w in this equation

8
00:00:35,976 --> 00:00:41,470
with what w equals which is l minus 9. And we know that the perimeter is 58

9
00:00:41,482 --> 00:00:47,305
inches. So, I have 2l plus 2 times w, but w equals l minus 9, and that equals

10
00:00:47,317 --> 00:00:53,295
58. Now, I have an equation that I can solve. First, I need to distribute. So, I

11
00:00:53,307 --> 00:00:59,925
have 2l plus 2l. 2 times negative 9 is negative 18 and that equals 58. Now, I

12
00:00:59,937 --> 00:01:06,974
can combine like terms, 2l plus 2l is 4l, add 18 to both sides, so now, I have

13
00:01:06,986 --> 00:01:13,837
4l equals 58 plus 18, which is 76. So, 4l equals 76. Divide both sides by 4, and

14
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:19,141
I get that l equals 19. So, I have that 4l equals 76, I divide both sides by 4,

15
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:24,588
which gives me, l equals 19. So, here's one of the dimensions of my rectangle.

16
00:01:24,706 --> 00:01:29,694
19 inches is the length. To get the width, I know the width is equal to the

17
00:01:29,706 --> 00:01:34,667
length minus 9. So, the width is equal to the length, which is 19, minus 9 which

18
00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:39,327
gives me 10. So, the dimensions of the rectangle are 19 inches by 10 inches.

19
00:01:39,435 --> 00:01:41,039
Let's try a ratio problem.
