Thanks, Shelly.

2
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:05,679
Now we can see that our computer
player loses in only two branches,

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:08,070
assuming otherwise perfect play.

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,530
All our computer player has to do is
choose any of the other branches and

5
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:12,049
it will win.
