1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,370
The first answer is,

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:06,260
by storing the result of a ko.observableArray() to a variable.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:07,600
And just like observables,

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,280
you have the option of passing in a normal array as the initial state.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,720
And the answer to the second question is, by just calling the array methods,

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,420
like pop() and push(), directly on the observable array.

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,430
The developers of Knockout have made this very easy.

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:27,430
You can treat observable arrays almost the same as you treat normal arrays,

9
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,630
with the primary exception being how you retrieve values.
