00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,711
We can actually use the greatest common factor to factor expressions like this.

2
00:00:04,711 --> 00:00:09,367
This would be factored form. We have one factor multiplied by another factor of

3
00:00:09,367 --> 00:00:13,947
two terms. When we factor a number out of other numbers, we want to think about

4
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:18,616
what would be left, or what's remaining. For example, if we factor out 9 x

5
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:23,573
squared y squared from our first term, we would be left with 5 times y. These

6
00:00:23,573 --> 00:00:28,745
are the left over factors remaining. This should also make sense, because if we

7
00:00:28,745 --> 00:00:33,327
multiply 9 x squared y squared by 5 y, we would wind up with 45 x squared y

8
00:00:33,327 --> 00:00:38,163
cubed. What do you think should go inside this box? What's our second term

9
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,937
inside of our parenthesis?
