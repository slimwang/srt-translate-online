1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Figuring out that by experimentation is quite difficult though.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So let's look at what you might have tried to do to answer that question.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So let's do some experiments, so we'll try making a simple set

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and we'll initialize a to be the result of set 1, 2, 3 and now I can see the value of a,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
it's a set containing those three elements.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The first kind of experiment we might do to figure out that something is mutable is try an assignment.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This is the kind of thing we could do with a list.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
If this was a list, assigning to index 0 would replace this value in the set.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But when we try that with the set, what we do is get an error.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It says that set object does not support item assignment.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
That might suggest that set is immutable and if we think of other things that we've done

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
that don't support assignment when we had a string, we got the same error message

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and we had that error message because the string was immutable.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
But just because it doesn't support item assignment doesn't mean

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
there might not be another way to change it.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Let's think about other ways we might change objects.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If we had a list, we could change it by doing append

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
that mutates the value of a list adding a new element to the end of it.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Can we do that with the set? Well, here's our set again.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Let's try if we can do append to the set and we also get an error message.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It doesn't have a way to do append.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So experiments don't tell us everything that we need to know, at least not these ones.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
From these experiments that looks like set may not be mutable, we haven't found a way to mutate it,

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
but that's certainly not enough to conclude that it's immutable.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So maybe we need to do more than just these experiments

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and let's look at what we can find by doing our search again

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and see if we can learn more about sets.
