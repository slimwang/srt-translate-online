00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,658
The solution is to add the location to the x and y-coordinates being generated.

00:00:04,658 --> 00:00:09,004
Doing so moves all the vertices by this amount. Since all the vertices are

3
00:00:09,004 --> 00:00:13,493
generated relative to the origin, this essentially moves the origin to this new

00:00:13,493 --> 00:00:14,183
location.
