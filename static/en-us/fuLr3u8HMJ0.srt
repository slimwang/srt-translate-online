00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,760
We covered the first two
items in the last video.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,230
Feel free to re-watch those if needed.

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,109
The task to experiment with the code
was a little open ended, so

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,135
these are a couple of
things that we tried.

5
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:12,080
There's no single correct answer for
this one, though.

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,475
If I set the quantity to equal two times
the quantity, then if I hit the plus

7
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:20,695
button, then it will double
the number of coffee cups we have.

8
00:00:20,695 --> 00:00:22,135
When I tried it on a device,

9
00:00:22,135 --> 00:00:25,285
indeed it does double the number
of coffees from two to four.

10
00:00:25,285 --> 00:00:28,645
I can also use the variable name
twice or as many times as I want

11
00:00:28,645 --> 00:00:33,005
in the expression that will be evaluated
to store as a value for quantity.

12
00:00:33,005 --> 00:00:34,870
Let's run this to see what happens.

13
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,623
This is essentially three times
quantity, so if the orignal quantity is

14
00:00:38,623 --> 00:00:42,697
two, then when we hit the plus button,
it should bump up to six cups of coffee.

15
00:00:42,697 --> 00:00:45,240
Even though it doesn't make
sense to update quantity so

16
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,220
many times within the method,
I just added more lines of code so

17
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,170
that you could see what would happen.

18
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:54,460
First I run the app in debug mode,
then I click on the Debug tab, and

19
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,040
I can trigger the breakpoint by
clicking on the plus button.

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,400
First I see that the quantity
variable has been initialized to two.

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:05,069
And then we take that quantity variable
and double it and then add another two.

22
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:08,890
That makes six cups of coffee, which is
the value down here for the variable.

23
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,250
If I click step over again,

24
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,190
we're going to take the current
quantity value and add two.

25
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,198
Since the value was six before,
six plus two equals eight.

26
00:01:17,198 --> 00:01:18,910
Then I'm going to take
the existing quantity,

27
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:24,210
which is eight, multiply it by three
to get 24, and display that on screen.

28
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,611
If I click resume,
then the screen updates to 24.

29
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:29,176
Now let's revert back to
what we had before, so

30
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:30,918
it matches the rest of our code.
