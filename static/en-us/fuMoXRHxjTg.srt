1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And the answer is likely no.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The reason being that these aren't clusters

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
defined by a center of data points,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
but they're clusters define by affinity,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
which means they're defined by the presence of nearby points.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So take for example the area over here, which I'm going to circle,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and ask yourself, what's the best cluster center?

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's likely somewhere over here where I drew the red dot.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This is the cluster center for this cluster,

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and perhaps this is the cluster center for the other cluster.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And these points over here will likely

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
be classified as belonging to the cluster center over here.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So, "EM" will likely do a bad job.
