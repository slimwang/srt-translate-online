00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,960
As you can see the update function is pretty straight forward. Each time is

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,680
called we subtract 0.05 from the life time of this unit, and if time becomes

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:12,070
less than 0, we cal the kill function and then return. It's worth pointing out

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,884
once this unit has killed due to the other code we've aleready written. It is

5
00:00:15,884 --> 00:00:18,782
removed from my larger entity processing loops, so that update no longer be

6
00:00:18,782 --> 00:00:22,624
called in the future. It's also worth noting, at the end of the update

7
00:00:22,624 --> 00:00:26,752
function, we call this dot parent. This will allow the entities update function

8
00:00:26,752 --> 00:00:29,810
to be called, after we've done our local update.
