We just said that for odd functions, f(-x) = -f(x).

2
00:00:06,186 --> 00:00:09,416
So I'm wondering if we can translate that to be a little bit more clear

3
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:13,771
in terms of coordinates of points on the graphs of odd functions.

4
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:18,173
So if we know that a point (x,y) lies on the graph of an odd function,

5
00:00:18,173 --> 00:00:23,423
then what does this rule tell us is another point that lies on the function?
