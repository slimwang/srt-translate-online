1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,540
Now that we've seen an alternative
way of representing polynomials,

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,260
let's turn back to the problem
of multiplying them.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:11,910
Multiplying via the convolution equation
takes order nm time, as we've seen.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,620
If the polynomials are represented as
values, however, we can just multiply

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,390
the corresponding values to
obtain the values of the product.

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,810
Note that I did have to start with
a number of points that was equal to

7
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,670
the order of the product here.

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,130
Not the order of the polynomials
that we were multiplying.

9
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:32,409
The fact that multiplying in the value
representation is so much faster

10
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:36,720
than in the coefficient representation
suggests that it might make sense

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,170
to convert to the value representation,
do the multiplication there, and

12
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:45,150
then interpolate back to
the coefficient representation.

13
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,670
We'll visualize the process like this.

14
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,880
First we convert from
the coefficient representation

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,900
to the value representation.

16
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,900
Then we multiply the corresponding
values to get the values of the product

17
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,450
polynomial, C.

18
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:03,590
And then we interpolate back to get the
coefficients of the product polynomial.
