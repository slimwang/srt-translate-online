00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,333
The all go through the point 1,0, as we can see right here. Each of them has

2
00:00:04,333 --> 00:00:08,452
the same x intercept. It doesn't matter what base we use, whether it's 2, 4,

3
00:00:08,452 --> 00:00:15,822
10, e, or any other number. We will always have log of 1 equals zero. And that

4
00:00:15,822 --> 00:00:21,470
gives us the point, 1,0. This corresponds to the point 0,1 on the exponential

5
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,670
function graph, since as we saw before, a to the 0 is always equal to 1

6
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:33,435
regardless of what a is, unless it's 0, since 0 to the 0 is not defined. Just a

7
00:00:33,435 --> 00:00:38,650
note, whenever the base is e, we don't usually write log base e. Instead, we

8
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:42,270
usually write the letters ln. You should have a button that says this on your

9
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,409
calculator.
