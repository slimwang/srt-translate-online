1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,430
The answer is the first two,
HealthVault, a PHR, Relay Health,

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,000
a patient portal.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,030
PatientsLikeMe is really
a social networking site,

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,380
not a place where patients,

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,780
at least currently, would engage
in the activities required by VDT.
