00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,567
Now, let's make this a little bit more challenging. Sometimes, there might be

2
00:00:03,567 --> 00:00:07,780
two radicals in your equation. If there are two radicals, it's best to separate

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:12,888
them, so one is on each side of this equals sign. We've seen adding numbers and

4
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:16,972
fractions to both sides of an equation. Well, we can do the same with a

5
00:00:16,972 --> 00:00:21,580
radical. We'll just add it on the left, and add it on the right. On the left,

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,760
we'll just have 2 root x. And on the right hand side, we'll have the square

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,589
root of 3x plus 9. Now I definitely think you're at a position to solve this

8
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:32,890
equation. Think about what you could do to both sides of the equation to

9
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:37,387
eliminate the radical symbol. Then when you think you've solved for x, type

10
00:00:37,387 --> 00:00:43,674
your answer here. Again, if there's no solution, I want you to type ns. Good

11
00:00:43,674 --> 00:00:44,420
luck on this one.
