00:00:00,738 --> 00:00:03,040
If you want to get better
at building forms,

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,010
you need to start critiquing forms.

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:10,600
Many forms that look pretty reasonable
are, in reality, not that great.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,020
With that in mind,
I want you to try critiquing this form.

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,680
You could find a link to it
in the instruction notes.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,080
This form is actually part
of the final project for

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,120
this course which is
an event planner app.

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,730
You'll eventually have a chance to
apply everything you've learned in this

9
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:29,130
course, to turn this clunky app
into a high conversion machine.

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,840
And by the way, the version that you'll
see in a few moments might look slightly

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,210
different than this one.

12
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,990
And that's simply because we might
tweak it a bit between now and

13
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,990
when you're actually taking the course.

14
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,700
Overall though,
it should look pretty much the same.

15
00:00:43,925 --> 00:00:47,200
Anyway, play with his form for
a moment and

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,890
when you're done,
I have a question for you.

17
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,820
How would you improve this form?

18
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,160
Would you change the title?

19
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,580
Would you consolidate inputs?

20
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,700
And this means simply taking multiple
inputs and turning them into one.

21
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,819
Would you write better
validation messages?

22
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:07,020
Or would you add more questions?

23
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:07,780
Check all that apply.
