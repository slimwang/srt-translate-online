00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,470
I really liked that last demo where we turned circles into squares.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,520
It really shows the awesome power of style and

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,150
also represents that everything on a webpage is actually a box.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,560
But why is it so important to really understand that concept?

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,220
You might be thinking to yourself, hey, I'm not a square.

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,499
I'm actually a really cool person and I don't like to think about boxes.

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,260
But actually thinking of the things in terms of

8
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,610
boxes makes your life as a front-end web developer a lot easier.

9
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,500
Take an example website here.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,820
We have many different elements, images, text, a header.

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,960
And by thinking of things in terms of boxes we can actually easily rearrange

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,130
things if we decide to give users a different experience.

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,250
Say, for example, we don't want to keep the text up here.

14
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:55,940
We want more pictures of puppies because users like more pictures and

15
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,000
might not want to read the text.

16
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:04,010
So we'll take away the text here, move some cute pictures of puppies up here,

17
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:07,100
and then put the text along the bottom.

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,580
Now readers can read the text if they'd like to or

19
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,480
just look at cute pictures of puppies.

20
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,890
There's also a grid in the background which serves to make sure that

21
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,210
everything is properly aligned.

22
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,919
But we'll talk more about that in lesson two.
