Congratulations, we're at the end of Lesson 2.

00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,050
In this lesson, we looked at the App Engine

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,500
development cycle and how to create an App Engine

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,650
project. We also looked at Cloud Endpoints that allows

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,430
you to build a single backend that can work

6
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:18,370
with many different frontend device technologies. Together with Cloud

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:22,420
Endpoints, we explore the API explorer, that allows you

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,550
to test your backend and also other Google services.

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,420
And finally, we got conference central up and running in

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,960
your App Engine project, which is great, you've got a real

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,660
application running in the Google Cloud now. In Lesson 3

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,150
we have a look at storage. It'll be fun. Join us.
