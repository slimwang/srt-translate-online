1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,240
Why might the metastasis in the patient

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,570
not respond to the drug

00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,340
Select the most likely reason.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,860
Is it because the patient is mutated?

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,970
The cancer started growing
faster than drug could kill it.

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,470
The cancer had mutated.

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,100
Or none of these.
