00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We also have a question on SOAP and when to use it? Why you do use it sometimes?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Just clarifying everything about it.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I thought I was clear about on this lecture but maybe I completely misspoke.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We don't use SOAP ever at Reddit or Hipmunk and--

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Well, I'll just say some of the providers use SOAP for Hipmunk

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
because we integrate with lots of lots of people.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's a nightmare. SOAP is awful. It's a Microsoft technology, so don't use it if you can avoid it.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I think the question was like "Why would you use SOAP over XML or JSON?"

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I don't know. You wouldn't. Use XML or JSON. It's a lot easier.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Everybody can parse it. You don't have to do all these complicated Microsoft stuff.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Don't use SOAP.
