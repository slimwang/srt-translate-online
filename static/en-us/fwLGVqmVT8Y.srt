1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
That's a lot about some kinds of specific things we did on Reddit over the years

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
that I thought you might find interesting, kind of ways to think about problems.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You guys have throughout this course I think learn the major pieces of how web applications fit together--

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
your application servers, your databases, cookies, hashes and how HTTP works

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and with that knowledge, you can build quite a few things.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
There are still a few concepts we haven't really talked about.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
If you're working on your own, that will be good.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
A lot of it revolves around front-end technologies.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
CSS, I have kind of alluded to, and I provided CSS in my examples and things like that.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This is for controlling how your HTML looks.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So it doesn't look kind of ugly and black and white.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It can be complicated, and it's a little bit of an exact science, laying out a webpage,

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
but this is a technology worthunderstanding--as well as JavaScript.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
JavaScript is a programming language that runs in the browser.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The web browser shifts this code to the browser and then the browser actually runs it,

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and this can manipulate your HTML, it can manipulate your JavaScript,

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and it can actually make more requests to your server

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
for small pieces of data and insert those into the page.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Doing that is called AJAX stands for asynchronous JavaScript,

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
basically making HTTP calls in the background to your web server to update the page dynamically,

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and many, many websites use AJAX now.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
A good example on Reddit is the voting--click that vote, it doesn't reload the whole page or submit a form,

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
it just sends that vote to the server and then the server records it.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
These are some technologies that would good for you guys to learn,

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and you can start making your web pages more dynamic, look better, and more interactive.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So, there's one last thing we are going to do in this unit,

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
which is talk to Udacity about how they use Google App Engine in production,

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
so you can get a sense for troubles they've encountered

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and some of the solutions they found running a large production site on Google App Engine.
