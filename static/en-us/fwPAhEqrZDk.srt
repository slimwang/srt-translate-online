00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,140
Now I'd like you to find the locations of the x and y-intercept of the same

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:07,540
rational function. Actually, if you could just give me the x-coordinate of each

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:12,207
x-intercept and the y-coordinate of each y-intercept, I would be very happy.

4
00:00:12,207 --> 00:00:16,730
Just separate your answers by commas if there's more then one in a given box.

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,790
And if there aren't any, write none.
