1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,220
Here's a simple example, okay?

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:02,810
Line fitting.

3
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:07,520
And you might wonder, you know, what's, why might I want to find lines?

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,840
Well, you know, as the example shows here on the left, you might want to

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,410
know that your chips are seated correctly, so you see the lines on the chips.

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,290
Or this is the tower again for the University of Texas, and

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,880
you find the edges, and you might just want to see whether or

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,630
not you might be in the State Legislature, and you want to make sure

9
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,400
the tower at the University of Texas is not leaning to the left.

10
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,060
That's a joke for some of you.

11
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:29,900
But we're going to assume, for

12
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,580
now, that finding lines is something we want to do.

13
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,800
So you might be wondering, well, wait a minute,

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,980
we just spent a long time learning about how to find edges.

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:38,550
Aren't we done?

16
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,570
Can't we just find the edges?

17
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,100
Well, if that were true, I wouldn't be standing here.

18
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,300
So let's talk about the difficulty of line finding.

19
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,920
So here's that same University of Texas tower, again,

20
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,530
courtesy of Christian Gromen, and we've run an edge operator.

21
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,810
And what I've done here is, I've pulled up a part of it just so

22
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,910
we can talk about some of the phenomenon.

23
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:02,290
So problem number one is that there's lots of points here that have nothing to

24
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:02,960
do with the lines.

25
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,530
So all these little edge points down here, these have nothing to do with

26
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,950
the lines, so we have to be able to dealt with them efficiently and rapidly.

27
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,700
Second, only parts of the lines are actually detected.

28
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,850
So for example, here you can see that there's this big gap in the line.

29
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,300
Even though what we'd really like to do is say that we found the entire line.

30
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:29,130
And finally, there's noise and corruption actually where we do find the edge.

31
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,290
So over here, you'll notice that in these lines across here,

32
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,120
there's all this stuff that doesn't exactly lie on the line.

33
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,790
You can see that pixels are jumping around here, as well.

34
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,720
So we have to be able to go from these noisy measurements to

35
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,330
where the edges are in order to find the actual lines.
