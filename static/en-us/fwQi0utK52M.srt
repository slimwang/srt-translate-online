00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
If you're doing more than just watching these lectures, one of the things

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
you're going to be staring at a lot is the Business Model Canvas.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
If you're watching this video, the first thing I suggest is stop, go to businessmodelgeneration.com,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and download the canvas and print out bunch of copies.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Then go get a bunch of yellow stickies and a red pen because that's what

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
you're going to be using for the next couple of weeks.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Now, what we actually do with the Business Model Canvas is in week 1.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You use those yellow stickies to put up all your hypotheses

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and you probably don't have many facts yet but you can make some pretty good guesses about

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
what's a value prop, where the customers are, what your channel is and what your pricing is,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
but what more can they do is really interesting.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's as you come back in with facts, we're going to be marking up the canvas

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and crossing out the things that actually weren't true and replacing them with the things we've learned,

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and we're going to do that week after week until what we end up with

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
is a step of Business Model Canvases, and what you'll find out is at the end of the class,

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
you can actually play back these canvases almost like a filmstrip

17
00:01:06,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and see what you've learned overtime.
