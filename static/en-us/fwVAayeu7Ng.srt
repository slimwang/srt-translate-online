1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,860
The next step is going to be to distribute the 3 to both terms over here on the

2
00:00:03,872 --> 00:00:07,689
left side, and leave the right side the same as it was. And then, I just need to

3
00:00:07,702 --> 00:00:11,445
collect all of my variables on one side and all of my constants on the other

4
00:00:11,457 --> 00:00:15,330
side. And we get a final answer of x equals 22. In all the problems we've done

5
00:00:15,342 --> 00:00:19,135
so far, it just so happened that it was most convenient for us to end up with

6
00:00:19,147 --> 00:00:23,165
variables on the left side and constants on the right side. However, that's not

7
00:00:23,177 --> 00:00:27,025
necessary. I could very easily have decided that I wanted my variables on the

8
00:00:27,037 --> 00:00:30,500
right side, instead of the left side. And started out here by subtracting 3x

9
00:00:30,512 --> 00:00:34,025
from both sides. I would have just had, eventually, to divide by a negative

10
00:00:34,037 --> 00:00:37,675
number. And that's not always my favorite thing to do. But in the future, feel

11
00:00:37,687 --> 00:00:41,075
free to put the constants and the variables on either side of the equation.

12
00:00:41,162 --> 00:00:42,425
Whatever is easiest for you.
