1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,280
Now, I want to cover some basic
properties of the Harris Detector.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:08,050
One of the bigger questions is, can we
actually build these types of detectors,

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,740
the invariant to rotation?

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,325
That basically means is,
let's say, if I have one image and

5
00:00:13,325 --> 00:00:17,560
then I have another image, and
then this image basically,

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,780
let's say I have something
like a plus sign here.

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,750
I want to be able to detect
the features of this even though,

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,740
in this image,
this plus sign might be rotated a bit.

9
00:00:32,915 --> 00:00:34,875
Right.
So being able to deal with rotation

10
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:38,225
invariants is an important part, because
I still want to find the same corners.

11
00:00:38,225 --> 00:00:41,175
I have a simple example like this,
but you can actually see that this can

12
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:43,715
get to be very complicated,
depending on objects.

13
00:00:43,715 --> 00:00:46,007
And of course, I sometimes
want to be able to find objects.

14
00:00:46,007 --> 00:00:50,980
Even with variations across the board,
on lighting and stuff like that.

15
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,560
So that's the next part.

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:58,080
Can we actually also find edges if
there is variance in image intensity?

17
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,700
So again,

18
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,890
I might have two images, and these
could be two pairs next to each other.

19
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,640
This one is much brighter,
and this one is much darker.

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,060
We saw examples of that when we looked
at the image pairs of the toy giraffe,

21
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,620
for example.

22
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,350
Third part that we are actually
be invariant to is Emmet scale.

23
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:20,540
What basically that means is, I have
an image and I have an object that is

24
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,460
here and it is of this scale,
but on the second image

25
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,310
I have the same object but it is,
in this case, much bigger.

26
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,360
So, how do we kind of
deal with the fact that

27
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,010
the same object might be occurring in an
image pair, but appear to be very large?

28
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,970
So, in essence,
now we need to start seeing,

29
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:44,890
does the Harris Detector provide
support for these type of invariances?
