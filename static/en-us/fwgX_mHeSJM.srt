1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,910
So we know permissions are represented
as Rs, Ws and Xs, indicating read,

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:06,600
write and execute.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,880
But when we changed the permissions of
some files earlier we used numbers.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,260
How did the digits we entered
translate to these values?

5
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,330
We can translate these
values as follows.

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,540
Rs are equal to 4.

7
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:25,040
W's are equal to two,
X's are equal to one and

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,200
if we don't want any permissions,
that will be a zero.

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,930
By adding the numbers together,

10
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,970
we end up with a result identifying
the full set of permissions to apply.

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,000
For example,
if we wanted to give read and

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,890
execute permissions,
we'd have values of four and

13
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,640
one, which when added together,
gives us a final value of five.

14
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,030
To represent, read, and

15
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,530
execute permissions,
you would use the number five.

16
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,360
But remember, permissions are done
in sets of three to identify what

17
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,110
permissions are set for the individual
user, the group, and everyone.

18
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:04,209
Let's analyze our student's
.bashrc file once again.

19
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:08,390
And convert its current
permissions into octal form.

20
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,100
The current permissions for
this file are rw dash, r dash dash, and

21
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,440
r dash dash, r is a 4 and write is 2.

22
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,350
So the user value would be 6.

23
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,620
For group, we just have an r.

24
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,730
So the value is 4.

25
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,700
And for everyone we have a value of 4.

26
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:33,824
To represent this permission set in
octal form, we'd use the value 644.
