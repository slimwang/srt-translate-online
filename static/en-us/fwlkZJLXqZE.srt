1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now let's move on, and I want to do just one more example.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Here's this input, and my program came up with "g in or mouse go"--

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
a sequence of common words, but the correct answer was "ginormous ego."

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Again, what do you think could help us get the right answer this time?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
More data? Making the Markov assumption rather than naive Bayes assumption?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Or doing a better job with smoothing. Check all the ones that you think might apply.
