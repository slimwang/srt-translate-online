1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:02,940
General entrepreneur advice?

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,195
>> Yep.
>> My favorite question so far.

3
00:00:05,195 --> 00:00:09,280
[LAUGH] Just be passionate.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,080
Understand what it is you want and
why you're doing this thing.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,710
Because if you don't, if you're chasing
something or following someone else's

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,650
advice, you are living what they want,
not what you want.

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,980
The best way to succeed that
I found is to follow that

8
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:31,150
thing that is important to you and
knowing what's important to you is

9
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,800
actually a big challenge,
a lot of people don't know.

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,522
There's a few other
things I can add to this.

11
00:00:37,522 --> 00:00:42,420
One is, my dream was always
to come to California and

12
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,400
work for one of the largest,
most influential companies in the area.

13
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,610
I've had this dream since I read
Microserf's when I was 12 and

14
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:57,780
it took 20 odd years before that
actually happened but it did happen.

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,660
But through the process of just
always focusing on that's my goal and

16
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,640
everything that I'm going to do
is somehow going to get me there.

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,680
All the businesses that I started,
all the business partners and

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,730
relationships I built and communities
that I was involved in through all

19
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:15,269
the businesses that I ran, I was always
looking to come specifically here.

20
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,520
On the flip side of that,

21
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,320
something I would advise all
entrepreneurs to be aware of especially

22
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,990
in the startup scene, is that
startups are seen as a product now.

23
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,340
They are a commodity in and
out of themselves.

24
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,010
There is an entire
industry that is built up

25
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:34,180
around selling things to startups and
selling the concept of startups.

26
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,380
Don't believe the hype.

27
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,720
Do not waste your time going
to stupid conferences for

28
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,520
silly awards that mean
nothing to your business.

29
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,960
Always focus on your core values and

30
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,400
what your business means to you and
why it's valuable.
