1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,520
Okay, so hopefully that wasn't too difficult.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm looking here at our MainActivity.java and I'm in the onCreate method.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,150
So we've discussed most of the stuff here and we talked a lot in

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,730
particular about these two lines where we get the ContentResolver.

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,630
And we do the actual query.

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,810
Also note that I have a text view up here that I've retrieved.

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,780
So down here is where we start the try, and

8
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,720
we start sort of doing things with the cursor that we got here.

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,370
So I'm going to scroll down.

10
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,970
Okay, so here's the first full part of the try statement.

11
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,330
And the first thing we do is just print out a couple of informational lines at

12
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,340
the top of the app.

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,510
To get the number of words we just use cursor.getCount.

14
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,590
This gets us how many rows are in the table.

15
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:38,770
And because we got all rows in

16
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,600
the table this is going to give us the complete number of words.

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,955
Next, we go ahead and we print out the column names.

18
00:00:43,955 --> 00:00:48,230
UserDictionary.words.id is the of the id column.

19
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,515
UserDictionary.words.frequency is the name of the frequency column.

20
00:00:51,515 --> 00:00:54,460
UserDictionary.words.word is the name of the word column.

21
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,450
I imported user dictionary so that's why I'm not using it up here, but

22
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,290
you can see me using it down here.

23
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:02,230
Speaking of these lines of code, this is where we go ahead and

24
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,379
grab the indices of each of the columns.

25
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,560
We use the cursor.getColumnindex method and we pass in the name of the column.

26
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,090
So I'm passing in the name for ID, getting the index for

27
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,770
the ID column, and so on.

28
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,790
This was another method that we looked at.

29
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:19,740
The cursor.moveToNext, which works really well in a while loop.

30
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,610
So we're using this to iterate through every single row that's stored

31
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:23,630
inside the cursor.

32
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,540
And for each of these rows we're using the indices that we grabbed up

33
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:31,770
here to grab the actual values using the getInt and the getString method.

34
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,570
So again, we have the wordColumn index that we got from up here.

35
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,860
Then we use getString and that gives us the actual word.

36
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,090
And our final step right here is just to append all those values that

37
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,320
we just grabbed for the row to the TextView.

38
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,600
Now I'm going to scroll down a little bit more to look at

39
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,180
this finally statement.

40
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,280
Okay. So this is the last thing that we do and it's just closing the cursor.

41
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,130
Remember, I had that whole rant about how it's important to close

42
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:58,100
cursors because we might leave memory lying around.

43
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,130
In this scenario, if we only run the app once, it's probably not going to crash.

44
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,020
But it's a really good habit to get into having the try statement up here,

45
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,980
followed by the finally statement down here,

46
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,740
where you make absolutely sure that you close your cursor.

47
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,750
And once you're done, your app's going to look a lot like this.

48
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,780
Now, it's going to have your own words here, but

49
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,460
it is going to just be plain text in a text box on the screen.

50
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,930
So, that's pretty much it for this exercise.

51
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,510
I hope it wasn't too difficult.

52
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,400
There's a link to the GitHub repo below, if you want to pull down

53
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,270
the actual code, and play around with it, and take a look at it,.

54
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,110
Otherwise, feel free to go ahead and move on.
