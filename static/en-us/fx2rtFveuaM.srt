1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now the next thing I want you to tell me is the space complexity.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
That was the time complexity.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The space complexity is how much storage do we need to be able to search this tree.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Remember that the value and max value and min value routines that we have defined

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
are doing a depth-first search.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Which of these would correctly represent the amount of storage that we would need--

7
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,999
the space complexity?
