00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,100
To help us investigate scopes,

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,540
let's write a program that helps us build zany sagas full of random words.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,020
Each call that we make to a function in this program,

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,820
should help us string together a new combination of nouns and

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,550
verbs, adding one more sentence in an ongoing saga about a hero.

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,840
Once we start the program,

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,900
all the stories will be about this same hero that was randomly selected for us.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,810
Each saga about this hero will feature a different randomly selected

9
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:26,850
foil character.

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,740
The program will call functions such that we string together a new

11
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:34,130
combination of nouns and verbs, adding one more sentence to this ongoing saga.

12
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,980
And that's it, it's a simple little program,

13
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,200
let's see how we could implement it using the feature of Scopes in JavaScript.
