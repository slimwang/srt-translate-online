1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We get the answer by reading numbers off the conditional probability tables,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
so probability of B being positive is 0.001.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Of E being positive, because we're dealing with the positive case now

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
for the variable E, is 0.002.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The probability of A being positive, because we're dealing with that case,

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
given that B is positive and the case for an E is positive,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
that we can read off here as 0.95.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The probability that J is positive given that A is positive is 0.9.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And finally, the probability that M is positive given that A is positive

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
we read off here as 0.7.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We multiple all those together, it's going to be a small number

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
because we've got the .001 and the .002 here.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Can't quite fit it in the box, but it works out to .000001197.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That seems like a really small number, but remember,

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
we have to normalize by the P(+j,+m) term,

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and this is only 1 of the 4 possibilities.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We have to enumerate over all 4 possibilities for E and A,

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and in the end, it works out that the probability of the burglar alarm being true

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
given that John and Mary calls, is 0.284.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And we get that number because intuitively,

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
it seems that the alarm is fairly reliable.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
John and Mary calling are very reliable,

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
but the prior probability of burglary is low.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And those 2 terms combine together to give us the 0.284 value

25
00:01:54,000 --> 99:59:59,999
when we sum up each of the 4 terms of these products.
