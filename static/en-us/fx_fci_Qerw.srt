00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,380
Welcome to lesson two.

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:05,380
Now, at this point you should
have a list of ideas and

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,640
hopefully you have a preference for
one that you might want to build.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,470
If you don't, that's all right.

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,205
Keep thinking about it,

6
00:00:11,205 --> 00:00:14,585
because we're almost at the point
the point where you've got to choose.

7
00:00:14,585 --> 00:00:19,065
In this lesson, you'll develop a feature
list for each of your app ideas and

8
00:00:19,065 --> 00:00:21,005
then you'll finally choose one.

9
00:00:21,005 --> 00:00:24,570
Once you do, you'll build a paper
prototype, you'll start developing it in

10
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,935
Xcode, you'll find some bugs,
you'll squash those bugs,

11
00:00:28,935 --> 00:00:31,978
then you'll probably find some more
bugs, and then you'll fix those.

12
00:00:31,978 --> 00:00:35,840
But then that'll probably create some
more bugs and then you'll probably just

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,210
want to throw your computer out
the window, because screw it.

14
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,860
But we'll have some tips and

15
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,110
tricks to help get you through that,
when you get to that point.

16
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,560
I'll also still be prompting you
to reflect on your experience and

17
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,260
I hope you keep doing so.

18
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,840
Particularly in the forums, because
both you and your fellow classmates

19
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,830
will probably need a bit of
encouragement in this development stage.

20
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,240
Let's get started
