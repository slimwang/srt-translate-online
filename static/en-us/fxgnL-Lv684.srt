00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,800
The next line of Dimple code we have to replace, is the axis construction code.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,110
In Dimple, this actually happens in two places.

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:14,440
First we added a time axis, corresponding to the year of our data,

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,449
which we made the x axis.

5
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:21,590
We also added a y axis, corresponding to the attendance for that year.

6
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,200
One subtlety of the X axis that we did in Dimple,

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:31,252
was that by specifying the parse format as only the year, Dimple automatically

8
00:00:31,252 --> 00:00:37,154
aggregated all the games for a given year, and summed up their attendances.

9
00:00:37,154 --> 00:00:42,030
D3 won't do this for us, but we actually may not want it to.

10
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,810
As we add more context to our visualization, instead of visualizing a single

11
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:51,940
year and the total attendance for that year, let's try visualizing every game.
