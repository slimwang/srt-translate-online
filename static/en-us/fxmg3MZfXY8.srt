00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,440
So here we're asking,
is the access control that's happening.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:08,360
Is it kind of based on access control
lists or access control entry?

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,030
Or is it being based on a capability?

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,170
A scenario is Alice going to
a theater purchasing a ticket,

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:18,430
presenting the ticket to whoever is
doing admission control at the theater.

6
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:22,140
So the ticket, is it more like
an access control entry, or

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,670
is it more like a capability.

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,430
That's the question.
