00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,110
The people you see on the screen, are

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:05,880
students doing the last design project for this course.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,240
That's what you'll be able to do, as

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,210
well. Creating a useful product using the design principles

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:15,790
of affordances. Conceptual models and signifiers. Plus the

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,450
design skills that you learned in the earlier projects.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,462
Now, here's a brief overview of the course. In

8
00:00:22,462 --> 00:00:25,440
Lesson 1, we'll ask you to go out and

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,920
take some photographs. But we'll also show you

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,940
how to take photographs that tell a story. Sometimes

11
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,040
one will be enough, sometimes it might be four

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,480
or five photographs. And then we'll learn how to

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,710
critique them. Decide whether this is effective. Does it

14
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,970
do a good job? In Lesson 2, time to

15
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,960
construct something. We're going to have you do a surprising

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,990
construction. One that, well, guess what? It'll really be

17
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:55,680
pleasurable and fun. Unexpected. Lesson 3, we're going to put it

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,320
all together. That's the capstone course. So in Lesson 3, you

19
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,750
have a project that's going to put together all of the

20
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:07,220
principles you've learned. And the projects that you've done before. Enjoy.
