1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,820
So when this was first put together
here's an old cast of characters.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,030
And there's two funny things for
me to tell you.

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,420
The first is, you talk about, you know,

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,160
missing a trademarking opportunity,
right?

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,140
So when Matt Turk and
Sandy Panaro were putting this together.

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,410
They had in mind this
notion of mug shot books.

7
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,230
You know, mug shots, where page through
this book of all these face images, and

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,080
you say, aha, that's the person.

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,930
So they were putting together something
that was going to be kind of like

10
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:31,270
a mug shot book, but of faces, and it
was going to be an electronic program.

11
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,290
So what do you think they called
this electronic program that was

12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,290
supposed to be a book of faces?

13
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:37,850
Photo book [LAUGH].

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,950
So, you know, there you go Zuckerberg.

15
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,132
Hope you're happy.

16
00:00:45,132 --> 00:00:47,042
Facebook was invented and
called photo book and so

17
00:00:47,042 --> 00:00:48,610
then Facebook could be Facebook.

18
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,800
So that's humorous story number one.

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,900
Humorous story number two is
actually not humorous at all.

20
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,650
It actually speaks to, sort of,
the productivity of the media lab.

21
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,100
The vision and
modeling group at the time.

22
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,410
This, old cast of characters here,
bunch of these people were students,

23
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,690
in fact almost all of these people
here were students at the time.

24
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,020
Oh, and there's Mike Boe.

25
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,420
He was a research scientist.

26
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,040
But, some of you may
know Astand Sclaroff,

27
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,140
who was chair of,
Boston University Computer Science.

28
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,540
Well, that's him right there.

29
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,330
Some of you, ever heard of G Plus?

30
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:17,130
All right?

31
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,140
So Bradley Horowitz at Google was
instrumental in making that happen.

32
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,590
He's right there.

33
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,170
I think that's him or is that him?

34
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,340
Those two may be the same person.

35
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,150
Okay?

36
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,360
Anybody up in Berkley?

37
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,890
Trevor Darrell?

38
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,480
Computer vision researcher, or

39
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,490
here at Georgia Tech,
there's Professor Irfan Essa.

40
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,200
Neither he nor I look like we used to
look like when we were at the media lab

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,600
at the time but that really is him.

42
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,140
So it just tells you a little bit about

43
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,310
sort of the density of interesting
vision research going on at the time.

44
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:50,290
But basically what they did was produced
a database of eight thousand faces and

45
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,770
it was able to do recognition.
