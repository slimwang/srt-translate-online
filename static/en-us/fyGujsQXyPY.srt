One of the neat things about mobile apps is

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:05,070
they're inherently social. I'm always looking at my phone to

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,170
see who called and texted me, but also for things

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,690
like Facebook posts and to see what popped up in

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:15,500
my notifications. Salesforce has something like Facebook for the enterprise

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,370
called Chatter. Chatter allows you to follow not only people,

7
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,030
but records. You can form groups of people and work

8
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:25,490
on records collaboratively. You can follow bug reports, or you

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:29,620
could follow cases or really just about anything you want that interests you.
