00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,810
Many sites and apps,
especially those built on PHP,

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:09,280
Ruby on Rails, JSP and so
on, assemble the page and

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,266
all of its content as one before
sending it down to the browser.

4
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:18,620
Progressive web apps change this
model by separating the parts that

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:23,910
change often essentially the content
from the parts that don't change often,

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,770
typically called the application shell.

7
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,780
The app shell can download and
display the content and

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:35,150
may even store the content in a local
database so that it can operate on open

9
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:39,410
slow networks or even if there is
no network connection available.

10
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:44,220
The app shell is the minimum HTML,
CSS and

11
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:49,620
JavaScript that is required to power the
user interface of a progressive web app

12
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,650
and is one of the component that
ensures reliably good performance.

13
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,135
Its first load should be extremely
quick and then immediately be cached.

14
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,700
On repeat visits this allows you
to get meaningful pixels on screen

15
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,759
without the network, even if your
content eventually comes from there.

16
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,880
App Shell architecture separates
the core application infrastructure and

17
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,610
the UI from the data.

18
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:23,170
All of the UI and infrastructure is
cached locally using a service worker.

19
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,270
So that on subsequent loads
the progressive web app only needs to

20
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,620
retrieve the necessary data,
instead of having to load everything.

21
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:37,400
Put another way, the app shell
is similar to the bundle of code

22
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,470
that you'd publish to an app
store when building a native app.

23
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,870
It is the core components necessary
to get your app off the ground but

24
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,980
does not likely contain any data.

25
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,450
Using the app shell architecture and

26
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:57,545
caching it's resources using a service
worker allows you to focus on speed,

27
00:01:57,545 --> 00:02:02,900
giving your progressive web app similar
properties to that of native apps.

28
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:08,070
Instant loading, regular updates, and
all without the need of an app store.

29
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:12,510
Service workers are powerful for
offline caching but

30
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:17,600
they also offer significant performance
went in the form of instant loading for

31
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,890
repeat visits for your sites or app.

32
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,310
You can cache your application shell so
that it works offline and

33
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,740
populate it's content using JavaScript.
