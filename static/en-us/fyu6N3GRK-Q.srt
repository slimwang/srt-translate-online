00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,197
If we're thinking of x plus 3 squared minus 6, as being in the form a squared

2
00:00:05,197 --> 00:00:10,382
minus b squared, then in our case a is equal to x plus 3, and b is just equal to

3
00:00:10,382 --> 00:00:15,812
the square root of 6, since the square root of 6 squared is just 6. That means

4
00:00:15,812 --> 00:00:21,089
that to factor this we need to take this minus this times this plus this. So,

5
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:26,948
this is our final answer, y equals the quantity x plus 3 minus the square root

6
00:00:26,948 --> 00:00:31,334
of 6 times the quantity x plus 3 plus the square root of 6.
