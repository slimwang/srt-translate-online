>> Try figuring out what type of system this is. You can solve each equation for

00:00:04,198 --> 00:00:08,162
y and then think about their slopes and the y intercept. If the slopes are

3
00:00:08,162 --> 00:00:12,387
different they intersect, if they're the same they're parallel, or you might

4
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:16,770
just have the same equation, which means you know you're in the last case. Good

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:17,105
luck.
