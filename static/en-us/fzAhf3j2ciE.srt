I want you to take this a step further.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,600
Instead of just removing the class featured from Article 2,

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:12,380
can you also use the .toggle class method to add the class to Article 3 as well?

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,280
There are a few ways to accomplish this, but

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,885
I recommend checking out the .next method to find the next sibling of Article 2.

6
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,040
Check out the documentation for .next and give it a shot.
