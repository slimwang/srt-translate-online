1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,640
So the reason we have to separate and

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:07,160
we couldn't just make the etc password
file readable only for root is that

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,780
actually it included public information
that other programs or utilities used.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,280
So if you turned off information for
that file, in particular

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,510
the etc password file then certain
utilities will not function properly.

6
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,620
So this actually was the reason for
shadow files.
