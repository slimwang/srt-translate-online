1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,400
These are the factored forms. Great work for getting at least half of these

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,342
right. If you really struggled with these, I would go back and review

3
00:00:06,342 --> 00:00:10,220
factoring. Try and get in some more practice before moving on. If you only

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,460
missed one or two, then see if you could find your mistakes by looking at your

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,380
factors. If you can't find your mistakes, then continue watching the solution

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,914
to see where your reasoning went wrong. The greatest common factor for these

7
00:00:20,914 --> 00:00:24,980
three terms is one. So let's use factoring by grouping to get our two factors.

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:30,169
We want factors of negative 30 that sum to negative 1. The factors are negative

9
00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:34,818
6 and positive 5. Then we can use factoring by grouping to get the factors of

10
00:00:34,818 --> 00:00:40,360
3x plus 1 and 5x minus 2, this is our first numerator. For the denominator, we

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,675
want to find factors of negative 20, that's sum deposit of 8. The factors would

12
00:00:44,675 --> 00:00:48,702
be positive 10 and negative 2. We use factoring by grouping to get our

13
00:00:48,702 --> 00:00:53,456
denominator of 2x plus 5 times 2x minus 1, here. Next, we factor this

14
00:00:53,456 --> 00:00:57,676
trinomial. The greatest common factor for each term is one, so we need to find

15
00:00:57,676 --> 00:01:02,454
factors of negative 60 that sum to negative 7. We don't need to factor out a g

16
00:01:02,454 --> 00:01:06,833
c f. These two factors are negative 12 and positive 5. They might have been

17
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:12,150
tough to find. We use factoring by grouping to get 2 x plus 5 times x minus 6.

18
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,600
And this is what we put in our numerator. For our second denominator, we want

19
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,416
to find factors of negative 30 that sum to positive 13. We use factors by

20
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:25,320
grouping to get our factors of x plus 3 and 5x minus 2. And now we're done

21
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,653
factoring, and we're ready to simplify.
