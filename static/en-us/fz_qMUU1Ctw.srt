00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,440
One of the ubiquitous mechanics
of platformers is that when you

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,950
fall off the platforms,
you fall into a bottomless pit.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,990
Up until now, we've had a nice
friendly floor at y equals zero.

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:17,150
Let's remove that so if you a bad job
jumping up platforms, you fall for ever.

5
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:22,000
Remove the floor from GigaGal's update
method to add in some consequences for

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,549
missing a jump.

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,660
And by the way, you'll probably want to
make sure that when Gigagal spawns in to

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,780
the level,
she lands on top of a platform.
