00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,490
Let us do an exercise together.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,680
Once again, we have the four
quadrants shown here, and

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,260
at the top left are four
computation artifacts.

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,175
I'm sure you're familiar
with all four of them.

5
00:00:10,175 --> 00:00:14,380
C-3PO is a fictitious
artifact from Star Wars.

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,940
Can we put these four artifacts in
the quadrants to which they best belong?
