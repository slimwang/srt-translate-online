1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,718
So, this question said data breaches.

2
00:00:02,718 --> 00:00:07,559
Remember a data beach is one that
exfiltrates large amounts of data that

3
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:10,393
was sensitive and stored on some server.

4
00:00:10,393 --> 00:00:14,624
So data breaches violate which of the
following requirements, that we had for

5
00:00:14,624 --> 00:00:16,882
securing information or securing data?

6
00:00:16,882 --> 00:00:20,644
The CIA requirement, one was
confidentiality, other was integrity,

7
00:00:20,644 --> 00:00:22,500
and then last one is availability.
