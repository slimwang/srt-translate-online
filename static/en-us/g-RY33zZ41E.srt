00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,417
You can use the power property to rewrite each of these terms. Log base 3 of x

2
00:00:04,417 --> 00:00:10,906
squared, according to the power property, should be 2 times log base 3 of x. In

3
00:00:10,906 --> 00:00:18,699
the same way log base 3 of y cubed can be written 3 times log base 3 of y.
