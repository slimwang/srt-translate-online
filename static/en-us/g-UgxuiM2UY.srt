00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,760
Now you have probably
used web browsers a lot.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,930
And if you're taking this course as
part of a Udacity Nanodegree program,

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,750
you've set up your own web server for
a previous project.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,620
But what is a server?

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,400
What does a program do
in order to be a server?

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,030
We can investigate
this a bit with Netcat.

7
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:22,440
On your Linux box, bring up the nc
manual page with man nc, and

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,340
skim it for a general idea.

9
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,920
Then read the section
client/server model closely.

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,397
And using that, how would you
get nc to listen on port 3456?

11
00:00:32,397 --> 00:00:34,240
Put the command you'd use here.

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,360
Don't worry about the details of
what listening on a port is yet,

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,140
just take a look at the manual and
see if you can find out how to do it.
