1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,100
So in packet monitoring, a monitor might

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,380
see the full packet contents, or at least

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,420
the packet headers that traverse a particular

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,550
link. Common ways of performing packet monitoring that

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,000
you may have tried yourself include tcpdump,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,770
ethereal, or wireshark. And in some of the

7
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,140
exercises, you'll get a chance to Explore packet

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,370
monitoring with one of these tools. Sometimes packet

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,270
monitoring is performed using expensive hardware that can

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,340
be mounted in servers alongside the router that

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,370
forward traffic through the network. In these cases,

12
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,830
an optical link in the network is sometimes

13
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,440
split So that traffic can be both sent

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,340
along the network and sent to the monitor.

15
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,520
Even though packet monitoring sometimes requires this expensive

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,440
hardware on very high speed links, what you do

17
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,850
when you run tcpdump or wireshark or ethereal

18
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,240
is essentially the same thing. Your machine acts as

19
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,260
a monitor on the local area network. And if

20
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,860
any packets. Hapen to be sent towards your network

21
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:08,000
interface. The network interface records those packets. Now on

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,840
a switch network, you wouldn't see many packets that

23
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,580
weren't destined for your own mac address. But on

24
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,520
a network where there's a lot of traffic being

25
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,670
flooded, you might see quite a bit more

26
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,920
traffic destined for an interface that you're using

27
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,650
to monitor. So the advantages of packet monitoring

28
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,570
is that It provides lots of detail. You can

29
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,680
see timing information and information in the packet

30
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,180
headers. Unfortunately, a disadvantage is that it's fairly high

31
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,610
overhead. It is very hard to keep up

32
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:40,810
with high speed links and often requires a separate

33
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:45,620
monitoring device. Such as the monitoring card that we've shown here.

34
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,860
What if we are happy with a little less detail, then packet

35
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,830
monitoring can provide. But we can't afford its overhead? In that case,

36
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:56,450
there is actually another approach that we can use, called flow monitoring.
