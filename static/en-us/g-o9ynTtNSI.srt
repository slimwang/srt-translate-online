1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,407
These lines are both written in the same form, even though we have different

2
00:00:04,419 --> 00:00:08,917
variable names now than we normally do when we talk about slope intercept form.

3
00:00:09,018 --> 00:00:13,193
These equations are both in the same form as y equals m x plus b. We have a

4
00:00:13,205 --> 00:00:17,561
variable on one side, a constant times a variable, and then a constant term

5
00:00:17,573 --> 00:00:23,170
tacked on to the end. This is true for this equation as well. Becasue they are

6
00:00:23,182 --> 00:00:28,900
in slope intercept form, we can just read off their slopes from the equation

7
00:00:28,912 --> 00:00:34,813
directly. They do not have different slopes, they have the same slope. That's

8
00:00:34,825 --> 00:00:39,175
what being parallel means after all. What changed we moved from the old

9
00:00:39,187 --> 00:00:44,106
situation to the new situation with the surplus solution was the g intercept. We

10
00:00:44,118 --> 00:00:48,629
can find that g intercept need equation in the slide where b normally is in

11
00:00:48,641 --> 00:00:53,492
slope intercept form. If I wanted to graph these pretty informally I may little

12
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:58,095
sketch up here, I would have our first line like this. In the second line,

13
00:00:58,203 --> 00:01:02,613
exactly parallel to it, but just shifted up on the vertical axis. The

14
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:07,745
information we used to create the second equation then, came from us knowing the

15
00:01:07,757 --> 00:01:12,405
slope that this new line should have, and also one point that it should go

16
00:01:12,417 --> 00:01:17,324
through, 0, 20 which we reflected in the g-intercept part of the equation.
