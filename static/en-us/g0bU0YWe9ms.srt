1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,410
Okay we've calculated these weights.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,090
Let's see how they work on
the examples we've been looking at.

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:09,390
So again our weight for
stock A is going to be .66 and for

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,363
stock B is going to be negative .33.

5
00:00:11,363 --> 00:00:15,060
And we're going to look at this
scenario where the market goes up 10%.

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:21,020
We'll pull out our old trusty CAPM and
expand it for these two stocks.

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,760
So for
stock A we have the weight of stock A,

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,740
times its beta times the return on
the market, plus the alpha component.

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,670
So these are the two parts that relate
to the return on the market, and

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,170
we'll bring them together.

11
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,080
So for stock A we have 0.66,
and our beta is 1.0.

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:43,310
And for stock B we've got -0.33 times
2 times the return on the market.

13
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,570
So because of all that work we
did to figure out these values,

14
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,900
we know already that this
is going to become 0.

15
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:54,830
We'll carry down our two alpha
components, so for stock A,

16
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:59,810
our alpha expectation is 1%,
and our weighting is 0.66.

17
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,121
For stock B,
our weighting is negative one third,

18
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:08,290
times -1, our expectation is
just going to go down 1.0%.

19
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:16,960
So combining these two, 0.66 plus
0.33 gives us a 1.0% expected return.

20
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,770
Whichever way the market goes.

21
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,890
Remember, we eliminated
the return on the market.

22
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,040
So, whichever way the market goes,
we can expect to get 1% return.

23
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,590
Now, need to add a lot of caveats here.

24
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:34,930
These betas aren't necessarily fully
guaranteed to continue into the future,

25
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,520
and these alphas aren't guaranteed,
either.

26
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,130
These are just estimates that we
computed based on information we thought

27
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:46,590
we had, so this is not a guaranteed
thing by any means, but

28
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:52,230
it is a way to use long/short investing
to reduce exposure to the market overall

29
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:56,460
and to focus on those alpha components
where we do have information.
