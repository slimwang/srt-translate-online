1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,630
So now you've seen a pretty extensive
tour of the features offered by

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:04,860
Android Wear.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,990
We explained how wearable APKs
are distributed by the Play store.

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,780
You also learned how an Android Wear
device is basically a complete Android

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,950
implementation supporting the same APIs
as what you're already familiar with.

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,620
We have added data items and messages to
allow you to easily send data between

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,220
devices without having to implement
your own network communications.

8
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,840
Simplifying the development
of wearable apps.

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,064
Wearable devices also have different
displays than previously available.

10
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:33,849
So, we learned how to support round and
scroll outs.

11
00:00:33,849 --> 00:00:38,255
And also, how to take advantage of
Android Wear's Always on Display feature

12
00:00:38,255 --> 00:00:42,040
to provide easily glanceable
information at any time.

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,630
Now you know all the important
information necessary

14
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,100
to implement a complete
Android Wear app.

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,800
From designing the initial
layout to packaging it up and

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,320
distributing it to your users.
