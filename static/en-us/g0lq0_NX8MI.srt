00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,590
Sometimes we'll need to perform some extra steps to isolate the square before

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:08,080
taking the square root, like in this equation. We have something next to our

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,955
square. We want to get this square quantity alone, so that way we can take the

4
00:00:11,955 --> 00:00:16,529
square root of both sides of our equation. So what do you think we'll need to

5
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:19,796
do here? When you think you have the solutions for x ,enter them here using

6
00:00:19,796 --> 00:00:24,450
your plus or minus sign. And don't forget to simplify your root if you can.

7
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,890
Good luck.
