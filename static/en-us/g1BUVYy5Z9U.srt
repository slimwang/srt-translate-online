00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,903
So let me, you know, again, just look at the whole concept of feathering.

2
00:00:02,903 --> 00:00:04,810
Here are my two images.

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:08,573
What I can do is, I can take, and of course, we would be doing this at

4
00:00:08,573 --> 00:00:13,215
the frequency spectra for each and every one of the octaves, F1 and F2.

5
00:00:13,215 --> 00:00:15,360
Here I'm showing it in the spatial one.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,500
Imagine if I was to take this signal like this and do a,

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,970
you know, computation as we've done here.

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,990
Before, again, remember these are just step functions of different types.

9
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,170
Of course, you'd see a sharp boundary.

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,720
So, one way to do this would be, is, I can blur this sharp boundary.

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,850
So I can run some sort of a blur kernel on these two band images here.

12
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,150
So this would actually make this area be not just a sharp step but

13
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,220
a ramp between the two.

14
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,510
So that would be the output here.

15
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,040
And if you actually use this just for

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,040
feathering between these two images, that's what the output you would get.

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,950
So now you actually see, there is blending going on, but it's much smoothed out

18
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:58,860
because of the fact that this is no longer a sharp function.

19
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,470
Of course, the important part to remember is, we want to do this at each and

20
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,190
every different octave.

21
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,020
So bottom line is, in doing this process, we basically can

22
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,400
smooth out the images, because in essence doing this blurring and

23
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,000
all the entire process of feathering makes the blend smoother.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,200
So recall again, what I'm really interested is saying is,

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,040
we want to do this feathering, but we want to do this for the corresponding

26
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,500
octave in the Fourier domain, we want to compute the inverse Fourier transform.

27
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,230
And this basically allows us to do this by summing the different types of

28
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:33,060
octave images in frequency domain, and allow us to generate a smooth image.
