00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,450
Android devices come in all shapes and
sizes, and tablets are popular too.

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:09,330
You want to make sure to provide the
best user experience for those users.

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,010
The great thing is, it's easy to do.

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,440
The next time you design and

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,970
implement an Android UI, make sure you
remember to think about adaptive design.

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,360
Think about when.

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,720
At what point does
the UI start to break?

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,240
Think about what?

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,960
What elements should you change and
in what ways?

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,510
And then work on the how.

11
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,409
Implement your adaptive UI
using resource qualifiers and

12
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,480
the techniques we described here.

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,480
