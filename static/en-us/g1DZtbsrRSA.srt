1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,585
So this leads us to the question, what is love? We touch on this briefly in the

2
00:00:04,585 --> 00:00:07,696
lesson on language and thought, when Susan described what are emotional

3
00:00:07,696 --> 00:00:12,050
feelings returned. Remember she was trying to tell Sofia that she was just

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,625
anxious or nervous about flying, when in fact Sophia's stomach was bothering

5
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:20,815
her and she was becoming physically sick. And in that lesson Susan asked what

6
00:00:20,815 --> 00:00:25,723
is love and how do we describe it? One psychologist by the name of Sternberg,

7
00:00:25,723 --> 00:00:31,425
developed the triangular theory of love. He had an idea that love was composed

8
00:00:31,425 --> 00:00:36,560
of three components. They are intimacy, passion, and commitment. And various

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:41,824
combinations of these three components explain all forms of human love. So lets

10
00:00:41,824 --> 00:00:46,168
take a closer look at these in a little more detail. Intimacy refers to feeling

11
00:00:46,168 --> 00:00:51,380
close, connected, and bonded in your loving relationships. Next we have

12
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:56,318
passion. Passion refers to the drive that leads to physical attraction,

13
00:00:56,318 --> 00:01:01,204
romance, and, sexual experiences. And this is accompanied by the physiological

14
00:01:01,204 --> 00:01:06,693
changes in arousal. And finally, we have commitment. With commitment we're

15
00:01:06,693 --> 00:01:10,284
talking about both a decision to love someone, and the decision to commit to

16
00:01:10,284 --> 00:01:15,240
love for the long-term. So for different types of love, these three different

17
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,371
components are present, but they're present in different amounts. For example,

18
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:25,057
with romantic love, we see high levels of intimacy, and passion, but low levels

19
00:01:25,057 --> 00:01:30,920
of commitment. And here we see companionate love. Which are high levels of

20
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,026
intimacy and commitment, but low levels of passion. And here we see fatuous

21
00:01:36,026 --> 00:01:40,058
love, where there's high levels of commitment and passion but low levels of

22
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:45,380
intimacy. Now if you were to just have passion and no intimacy or commitment,

23
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,943
you'd see something like lust or infatuation. And if you just had intimacy but

24
00:01:50,943 --> 00:01:55,363
no commitment or passion, It would just be liking someone, and if you just have

25
00:01:55,363 --> 00:02:02,560
commitment, but no intimacy, and no passion, this would be empty love. Now if

26
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,016
all of these types of love were present in equal proportion, Sternberg would

27
00:02:06,016 --> 00:02:10,681
call this consummate love. So, as I said that any given relationship can have a

28
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:15,602
combination of these three components. Some of your life-long friends you're

29
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:19,276
going to feel commitment with, and intimacy. But not passion. Or your siblings

30
00:02:19,276 --> 00:02:23,615
and family members would be a mixture of intimacy and commitment. Whereas your

31
00:02:23,615 --> 00:02:27,941
romantic partners would be intimacy and passion. And for those who have all

32
00:02:27,941 --> 00:02:31,570
three in the same person, this would be a life-long partner. For example, a

33
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,050
husband or wife or life partner.
