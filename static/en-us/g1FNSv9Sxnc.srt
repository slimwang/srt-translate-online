00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,150
So in this lesson, I just want to add a simple concept to, what we've already

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,570
discussed when we actually covered the whole concept of point processes and

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:13,180
simple arithmetic operations in the pixel values between multiple images.

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,140
I'm also going to showcase a real example of something that you'll witness and

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,030
perhaps are bothered by, as, and something that you know,

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:20,460
hopefully I can explain.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,490
So another title for this lesson could easily be,

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,390
What is with all those weird artifacts in the lecture videos?

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,420
So we are going to cover, and understand those.

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,140
First let me show you the videos that you have been seeing.

11
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,520
Right, when you see these videos you are seeing,

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,870
various kinds of artifacts showing up in my hand, goes over it and

13
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,030
I am writing things down, on diffrent types of things and

14
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,100
you can see all of the effects but, you know, this is because.

15
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,440
These images of these videos that you've seen are actually a result of

16
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,460
combining things from multiple different types of images, and compositing or

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,760
blending them together to showcase things.

18
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,660
So again, I would like to explain to you why you are seeing some of

19
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,100
those artifacts that you are seeing in these videos.

20
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,470
Again, they relate exactly to topic at hand,

21
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,910
of doing pixel arithmetic operations.
