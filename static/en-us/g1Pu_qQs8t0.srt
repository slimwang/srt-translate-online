1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,120
In addition to using the media
attribute on a linked style sheet,

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,000
there are two other ways you
can apply media queries.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,090
You can embed them with an @media tag,
or

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,080
you can embed them with an @import tag.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,980
For performance reasons,
you definitely want to avoid @import.

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,410
It's pretty expensive and perf matters.

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,820
You'll need to weigh the costs
between linked CSS and @media.

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,940
With linked CSS,
you've got many small files, but

9
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,790
many HTTP requests,
where as with @media,

10
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:38,880
you've got fewer requests, but the files
tend to be a little bit bigger.

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,970
Any filter that meets the criteria
of the resulting CSS block,

12
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,600
will be applied using the standard
CSS rules of precedence.

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,030
That means when the viewport
is less than 500 pixels,

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,780
no styles are applied but above 500
pixels my body color becomes orange.

15
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:01,490
And above 800 pixels,
not only do I have the orange text, but

16
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,600
I also have the blue background.

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,970
I'm pretty sure that also means, I've
got some pretty bad taste in colors.
