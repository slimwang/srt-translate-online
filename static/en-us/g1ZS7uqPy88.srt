00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,370
We mentioned this several times,
but the SW in the resource folder name

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,380
stands for smallest width.

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,140
To drive home that point,
let's walk through

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,760
a hypothetical situation.

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,180
Say you have an app
directory structure like this.

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,700
We have some layouts defined
in the base layout folder,

7
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,700
and we override some of those
in the layout-sw600dp folder.

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,370
We also override one of these
in the layout-sw720dp folder.

9
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,170
Let's look at which layouts
would be applied on which device.

10
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,420
Say your app is running on a Nexxus 5.

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,420
The Nexxus 5 has dimensions
360dp x 640dp.

12
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,360
Of the two, the smallest width is 360dp.

13
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,380
So we use this number to compare it 
against the folder names.

14
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,030
360dp is less than 600
and is less than 720,

15
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,470
so all the layouts will come
from the space layout folder.

16
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:50,430
For the Nexus 7 2012 version,
the dimensions are 600dp x 960dp.

17
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,856
Of the two sides
600dp is the smaller width.

18
00:00:53,856 --> 00:00:56,140
So you compare this
against the folder names.

19
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,044
It turns out that the smallest width
is better than or equal to 600dp,

20
00:01:00,044 --> 00:01:03,360
so for the detail and the item layouts, 
we pull it from this folder.

21
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,160
Now the main.<i>xml</i> file
is not declared in this folder,

22
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,190
so we fall back to a less specific folder, 
which turns out to be this one

23
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,578
in the base layout folder.

24
00:01:10,578 --> 00:01:14,590
For the Nexus 10 the dimensions
are 800dp x 1280dp.

25
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,810
Of the two sides, 
800dp is the smallest width.

26
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,190
Now this device satisfies
the categories for all of these

27
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,390
because 800 is greater than 720
and greater than 600.

28
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,400
However, the system chooses 
the most specific folder first.

29
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,200
So it will choose this item layout
over these two.

30
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,050
Since the detail layout 
is not defined here,

31
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,370
it will fall back to a less 
specific folder, which is this one.

32
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,370
Then for the main.<i>xml</i> file, 
it's not declared in either of these,

33
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,220
so it falls back to this one.
