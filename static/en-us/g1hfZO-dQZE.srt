1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,338
So now let's see if we can figure out how

2
00:00:02,338 --> 00:00:05,374
to do an on-chip directory, where we said that we're

3
00:00:05,374 --> 00:00:08,500
going to have a partial directory. The directory has a limited

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,460
number of entries in each slice. We allocate an entry

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,010
only for a block that might have some presence bit

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,240
set at one. But as we request blocks from level

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,250
one caches, we will allocate these entries. Eventually we will

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,375
run out of them. So the question for you is what

9
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:29,720
do we do now? We have run out of directory entries. How do we proceed?
