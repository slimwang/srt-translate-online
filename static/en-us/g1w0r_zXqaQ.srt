00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:05,240
Congratulations, you've made it through
the first hurdle in iOS development.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,520
You have UI elements, and

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,500
you've wired them up to call
your code with IB actions.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,110
And you've reach back to
the UI using IB outlets.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,000
In the second part of this lesson,
you're going to learn how to set up

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,799
multiple views, so that you can go
between two different view controllers.

7
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,820
No more single view applications for
you.

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,790
Most iOS applications you will
be developing will venture

9
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,820
further than a single screen.

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,980
In order to use multiple
view controllers,

11
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,590
you will need another class,
that lets you navigate between them.

12
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,540
There are two common classes to use for

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,090
handling multiple view
controllers in iOS.

14
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,710
UI navigation controller and,
UI tab are controller.

15
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,250
Both of these are covered in depth
when you get to UI kit fundamentals

16
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,920
in the next module.

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,640
For now let's just discuss the basics of
a UINavigation Navigation controller.

18
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,260
The UINavigation Controller is
a class that handles a stack

19
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,050
of multiple view controllers.

20
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,300
Like any other stack in computer science
or real life, you can insert and

21
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,460
remove items from the stack.

22
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,900
In the UINavigation Controller you start
out with a single view controller,

23
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,540
called the rootViewController.

24
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,020
You can add as many of your controllers
on top of it as you'd like.

25
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,300
In pitch perfect we're going to
have just two view controllers.

26
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,950
One for recording, and one for playback.

27
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,890
So our use UINavigationController,
will be just for those two screens.

28
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,250
Before we can run, we need to walk.

29
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,480
Currently our app have the view
controller named ViewController

30
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,910
as a start of the app.

31
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,880
With the main story
board opened selected.

32
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,030
Notice the little gray arrow
here that indicates that

33
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,960
this is the initial view controller.

34
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,160
If you have multiple view controllers,
you can drag this arrow to change

35
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,810
which view controller to storyboard, and
therefore your app, will start with.

36
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,340
This arrow is also
driven by the checkbox

37
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,820
titled is initial view controller
here in the attribute inspector.

38
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,770
If you uncheck this arrow,
the storyboard won't know

39
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:01,870
what view controller to start the app
with and you'll get a runtime crash.

40
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,900
Make sure the is initial
view controller is checked.

41
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,400
With the view controller selected,
the orange circle here in the document

42
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:14,800
outline, go into the editor menu and
select embed in navigation controller.

43
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,980
You can see that x code has
created a UInavigation controller

44
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,520
to start the app, and that our view
controller is the root view controller

45
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,340
of that navigation controller.

46
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,980
Now you're ready to add more view
controllers to pitch perfect.
