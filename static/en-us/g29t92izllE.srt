1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Three of these solutions won't work already for the reason that they would lead

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
to an increase in temperature even though the forest is warmer than the ambient temperature.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
With this solution, the rate of change of our temperature would always be positive.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That doesn't look like heat loss. The same happens here.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
If the temperature of our forest is larger than the ambient temperature,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
we again get a positive rate of change here.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This does not make sense. This is the right one. Think about two compartments.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We have one compartment with temperature capital T

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and another compartment with a temperature of 300 K.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The difference between these two is what controls the decay of the temperature, and of course,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 99:59:59,999
this difference is negative as it needs to be for our temperature to decrease.
