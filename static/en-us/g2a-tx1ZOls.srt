00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,687
Now because this is an intro course, we can't go into depth into operant

2
00:00:03,687 --> 00:00:06,808
conditioning, but I do want you to know that it's used across a variety of

3
00:00:06,808 --> 00:00:11,985
disciplines and subfields. For example, we did see Dr. Zelig use operant

4
00:00:11,985 --> 00:00:16,340
conditioning in her animal training and behavioral modification. We also know

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,784
that operant conditioning is used in treating drug dependence. People in

6
00:00:20,784 --> 00:00:24,547
industrial organizational psychology use the principals of operant conditioning

7
00:00:24,547 --> 00:00:29,390
to increase worker productivity as well as decrease accidents on the job site.
