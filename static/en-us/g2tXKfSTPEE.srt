00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,040
All right,
welcome back to Computer Vision.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,820
Today, we're going to finish our little
tour of the visual system of the I'm

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,850
sorry, the, of the human visual system.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,920
The anatomy of the human system.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,805
So when we last checked
in with our heroes we had

6
00:00:14,805 --> 00:00:16,075
this little model going on here.

7
00:00:16,075 --> 00:00:17,845
Remember, here's our nose over here.

8
00:00:17,845 --> 00:00:21,488
Here's your eye, and it's got
the optic nerve going through the sa,

9
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:22,305
optic chiasm.

10
00:00:22,305 --> 00:00:25,625
And it goes to this first area
called the lateral geniculate.

11
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:29,562
And then from the lateral geniculate
most of the stuff goes to the visual

12
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:33,192
cortex, although some goes to superior
colliculus, which we'll also talk about.

13
00:00:33,192 --> 00:00:34,212
Last time also,

14
00:00:34,212 --> 00:00:37,812
we discussed in some nauseating
detail what goes on in the retina.

15
00:00:37,812 --> 00:00:41,232
So today is going to be sort of what
goes beyond from above the retina.
