00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,852
Now, that we're more familiar with the concept of domain, let's look a little

2
00:00:03,852 --> 00:00:09,030
bit more closely at this graph. Our initial function for the area of Grant's fun

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,422
room as a function of half of its width was A of x equals 4x squared plus 6x.

4
00:00:14,422 --> 00:00:18,568
And we said that our domain is x is greater than 0. Now, what do you think then

5
00:00:18,568 --> 00:00:22,825
the range values will be? We'll write this in inequality notation as well. And

6
00:00:22,825 --> 00:00:27,325
I've already written in A of x for you, so all you need to fill in, in this box

7
00:00:27,325 --> 00:00:30,102
is some sort of inequality sign and a number.
