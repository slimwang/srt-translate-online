1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,050
Now let's think about a light source,

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,970
an illumination source that can be aware
of what things are in front of it so it

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,200
can actually react appropriately to the
obstructions or objects in front of it.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,000
Here you see a subject walking,
and of course,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,490
you saw a little bit of a shadow, but
if you notice, the shadow is not there.

6
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,550
Imagine in this instance if there was
light being shone on this person,

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,020
there should have been a shadow.

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,020
And he's moving around, you kind of see
a little bit of the hands pop up but

9
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:24,659
they vanish.

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,930
Also most projector systems like this,

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,070
if you notice, there must have been,
if the person was there,

12
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,680
a much more thorougher light
source on the person themselves.

13
00:00:37,762 --> 00:00:40,830
So this actually is done by
actually a scenario like this,

14
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:44,010
where basically using a camera
looking down this way,

15
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,570
you can actually track
where the person is.

16
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,570
So once you know where
the tracking of the person is,

17
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,250
you can actually turn off the signal
that actually is on top of them.

18
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,180
Of course,
that's the reason there was a shadow.

19
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,120
If you turn it off there
won't be a shadow.

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,850
And, of course,
there's another projector.

21
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,860
So having a, you know,
two project, projectors here,

22
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:06,330
this one fills in the hole, so now we
get a full image from this one, and

23
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,262
this one of course is no
longer shining lights on it.

24
00:01:08,262 --> 00:01:12,460
So by having two projectors and a camera
tracking a person, in this instance, you

25
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:17,220
can now design a system that will allow
you to get images that are full all

26
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,020
the time and also of course not having
a lot of bright light on the subject.

27
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,710
This just demonstrates that you can
do this in pretty quite, you know,

28
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:29,080
pretty efficient computations, and
it works for videos of this type.

29
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,810
And of course, by having these
projectors, and remember what we learned

30
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,400
about how we can do alignments and stuff
like that, we can align both the images

31
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,030
to be perfect, like we've done for
all forms of image alignment or

32
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,310
camera projection alignment camera
calibration stuff that we looked at.
