1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,210
Andrea, I'm so
glad you reached out to me and

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,410
could come today, because I wanted
to introduce you to Jessica.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,118
She's a course developer at U'dasti and

4
00:00:07,118 --> 00:00:09,320
she's going to helping
us build your app idea.

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,660
>> Catherine's been telling me all about
the app that you'd like to make to help

6
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,510
people learn about the Miwok language.

7
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:14,690
Could you tell us more about that idea?

8
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:15,430
>> Sure, so

9
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:19,580
my family's a part of the Northern
Sierra Miwok tribe in California.

10
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:23,730
And the language isn't being passed down
from generation to generation anymore.

11
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,590
My great grandmother was the last
to speak the language fluently.

12
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,220
>> Wow, I'm sorry to hear that.

13
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,530
>> Yeah, so I'd like to preserve
the language in the family.

14
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,260
So, I had an app idea that could teach
my kids how to pronounce things like

15
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,350
numbers and colors and phrases.

16
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,250
>> Okay, so
that seems pretty straightforward.

17
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,400
So, the app would just
be a list of words and

18
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,690
each word could have an English and
a Miwok translation.

19
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,030
That sounds reasonable for
our student to build, right?

20
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,790
>> Yeah, that's assuming that
they've taken the Android for

21
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,910
Beginners course with you and
Cornell already, right?

22
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:50,530
>> Yeah.
So,

23
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,680
they should already know
how to build a layout and

24
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,870
how to make a simple but
interactive app.

25
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:55,760
>> All right, so, if the student

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,620
watching doesn't feel
comfortable with those concepts.

27
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,090
They should probably go back to that
course, review those topics, and

28
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:00,860
then come back.

29
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,390
>> Yeah and then we'll be building
the Miwok app together with them.

30
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,226
>> Yeah, that sounds doable and
you know,

31
00:01:05,226 --> 00:01:08,420
this app will teach the dialect
of Miwok the tribe speaks.

32
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,410
But our students can take this app and
modify it to teach any language.

33
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,770
>> That's so true, there are so

34
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,570
many different languages that
could be preserved by this.

35
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,820
It's amazing if we could
help other cultures, but

36
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,640
by the way,
how long is this going to take?

37
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,190
>> Well,
I'd estimate about four to six weeks,

38
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,930
if we work alongside the students and
then they pace themselves out.

39
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,010
That sounds reasonable, I can't
wait to show the app to my family.

40
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:31,420
>> Yeah and another reason why I'm so
excited about this app is,

41
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,680
because our student may
feel like a beginner.

42
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,190
You might not be able to
create something that useful.

43
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:39,070
But we're going to show them in this
course, that with their current skill

44
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,230
set they can tackle real
challenges in their community.

45
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,200
>> Yeah that's right,
such that preserving the local culture.

46
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,320
>> Exactly.

47
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,370
>> I completely agree but to be honest,
I've never built an app before.

48
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,710
Where do we even start?

49
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,240
>> That's okay.

50
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,250
I actually have a really great idea.

51
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,700
Let's ask our student for help.

52
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,488
>> All right.
All right, so

53
00:01:54,488 --> 00:01:56,210
if Andrea can provide
us the vocabulary list.

54
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,091
Why don't you help us brainstorm how we
can present this information to a user

55
00:01:59,091 --> 00:01:59,680
within an app.

56
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,630
>> And take some time to think
about this because a lot of people

57
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,610
struggle with translating
an idea into an actual app.

58
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,850
So, this will be good practice for you.
