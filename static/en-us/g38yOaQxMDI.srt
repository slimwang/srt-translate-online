1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,740
Alright. Let's have something more concrete to work

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:07,230
on. If you've organized events, you've probably used sites

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,530
like [UNKNOWN] or eventbrite.com. Well, let's say you wanted

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,670
to create an app to organize conferences. That type

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,720
of application would need to support at least the

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,790
following. A user can register, a user can create

7
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:22,660
conferences. Users can attend conferences. And of course, it

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,720
needs to be accessible both from the browser and

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,425
the mobile device. Well, we're going to create such an

10
00:00:28,425 --> 00:00:31,480
application. And it's going to be called Conference Central. And

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,800
you're tasked to build it. And since it needs

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,550
to support multiple backends, you will use Cloud Endpoints to

13
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,100
create this application. Let's get started with Conference Central,

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,130
by having you download the skeleton code. Now, let's

15
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,600
take a quick tour of the completed Conference Central

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,700
application that you will build. But before we do that,

17
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,710
let's do a quick demo of the finished application. As

18
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,330
you can see, you're presented with a very nice landing

19
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,200
page for Conference Central. And if we scroll down, you

20
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,730
can see options to view conferences. Create conferences and update your

21
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,990
profile. But, before that, let's sign into the application. Sign

22
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,910
in, we'll use Google Plus sign in. Once we are signed

23
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:13,230
into the application, we can start to explore the functionality.

24
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,970
I can, for example, go to my profile where my personal

25
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,640
information is stored. I can also show the registered

26
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,870
conferences. So here you can see the name of the

27
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,090
conference. The city where it will be in. The

28
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,950
start date, organizer, how many people are registered to conference.

29
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,650
And how many tickets are available to the conference.

30
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,970
You can also query for different conferences. For example, the

31
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,100
ones you've created. Or the ones that you will

32
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,120
attend. You can also query by other types of properties.

33
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,650
And you can view the details for a conference. You can also of

34
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,329
course, create new conferences. Well that's an

35
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:50,030
overview of Conference Central. The application that

36
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,660
you will build and run in the Google Cloud. Now it's time for

37
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:58,290
you to do some work and get you started building Conference Central. Good luck.
