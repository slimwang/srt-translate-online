A point light is what it sounds like. You define a position for it in space and

2
00:00:03,819 --> 00:00:07,520
it gives off light in all directions. You can set the color and intensity just

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,124
as you can with directional lights. These lights are different from real world

4
00:00:11,124 --> 00:00:13,464
lights in that by default the distance from the light does not effect its

5
00:00:13,464 --> 00:00:17,544
brightness. Attenuation is not done mostly because it's easier to quickly light

6
00:00:17,544 --> 00:00:21,596
a scene with point lights if there's no drop off with distance. It's entirely

7
00:00:21,596 --> 00:00:24,262
possible to use a different equation for how the light is attenuated by the

8
00:00:24,262 --> 00:00:27,745
distance. For example, you could divide the intensity by the distance or the

9
00:00:27,745 --> 00:00:31,725
distance squared, which is how real lights work, or any other combination. 3JS

10
00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:36,324
supports only one drop-off mode, which is to define a maximum distance. At this

11
00:00:36,324 --> 00:00:39,818
distance, the light goes to zero. This is entirely non-physical, but is useful

12
00:00:39,818 --> 00:00:43,372
for the artistic control of lighting. You can put point lights in a scene and

13
00:00:43,372 --> 00:00:46,102
have each affect a local area without affecting the lighting in other parts of

14
00:00:46,102 --> 00:00:47,560
the scene.
