1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,900
For example, the Google News experience on the desktop

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,160
shows a lot of information, but the mobile experience

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,760
focuses on just the news stories. Pushing all of

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,800
the secondary information out of the way. You'll learn how

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,920
to write code that adapts to different screen sizes

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,960
and also how to make your code work offline.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,030
You'll learn how pointer input works on touch screens

8
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:25,590
and how to unlock the camera GPS and accelerometers sensors

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,460
on mobile devices. Now technically speaking you don't need

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,140
a mobile device in order to take this course or

11
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,590
even to test out most of what you'll learn.

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,660
But you're missing a lot of the experience of mobile

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,030
web development, without a device. Preferably at least one

14
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,920
Android device. You can use Chrome's great mobile debugging tools.

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,780
Which we'll be using in this course. But, the

16
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,740
more devices you have, and the more variety, the better.
