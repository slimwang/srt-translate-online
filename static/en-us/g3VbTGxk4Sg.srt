00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,830
Can you think of a friend who works really long

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:08,000
hours on a computer, programming, writing, researching for hours. By

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,240
the way, that person could be you. This seems to

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,210
be a problem, especially as the number of hours we spend

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,840
on a computer keeps going up. If you could only

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,730
remember to walk away from the computer for a little bit.

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,230
Let's write a program that schedules breaks throughout the day

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,350
reminding that friend who works really long hours on the computer,

9
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,830
to listen to music, get up and dance to their favorite song,

10
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,460
or just walk away from the computer every once in a while.
