00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,059
Property three is where things get interesting. Okay? It states that each

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:09,160
lower level of refinement, must faithfully represent the level above it.

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,660
Okay? But this is going to be a little bit tricky to express, and involves some

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,140
subtleties, we're going to have to get at. It's the most involved of the three

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,880
properties. And, the question one asks is, how exactly can we determine whether

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,220
a level implements the piece that is abstracting it? Before answering that,

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:32,549
let's go back to our example bank account and add a level of, refinement to it.
