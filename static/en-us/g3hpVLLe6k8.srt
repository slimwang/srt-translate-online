00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,698
Let's talk about this.

2
00:00:02,182 --> 00:00:05,743
Honestly, it really depends
on the size of your data.

3
00:00:06,421 --> 00:00:10,757
For small amounts of binary data,
very, very small amounts of binary data,

4
00:00:10,981 --> 00:00:13,771
you could actually put
the raw data in the database.

5
00:00:13,874 --> 00:00:16,967
There are blob types, and those
are supported and work pretty well.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,507
However, as you start putting
larger data into the database,

7
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:22,230
it gets pretty inefficient

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,342
and you end up writing
a lot more code.

9
00:00:24,973 --> 00:00:26,613
Well, as far as storing the files

10
00:00:26,613 --> 00:00:28,844
in a public folder
on the device is concerned,

11
00:00:28,991 --> 00:00:32,214
well, that might work if you
actually wanted to share those files.

12
00:00:32,459 --> 00:00:35,615
But, typically, you don't want to share
those files with other applications,

13
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:39,228
so storing them in a public folder
on the device isn't a very good idea.

14
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:44,442
But the third option is pretty good.
Storing the files in a private folder

15
00:00:44,595 --> 00:00:47,336
and then referencing
the location in the database.

16
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,386
Now, admittedly, you might not even need
to put them into the database at all.

17
00:00:51,616 --> 00:00:55,372
But it's often nice to do this if you need
to do any kind of queries on them.

18
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:59,270
You can store metadata in your database
and store files in a private folder.

19
00:00:59,749 --> 00:01:02,150
This is what Android does in the gallery.
