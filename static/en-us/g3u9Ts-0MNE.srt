1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:04,124
C has 1 entry per edge, so it is E long.

2
00:00:04,124 --> 00:00:08,485
R, on the other hand, has 1 entry per vertex, so it's V long.

3
00:00:08,485 --> 00:00:11,833
Although we're going to put 1 additional element at the end, and we'll see why in a minute.

4
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:14,580
Either V or V+1 is accurate.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:21,686
We're also going to store a depth array, D initialized to -1, that indicates the depth for each node in the graph.
