1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,266
So I'd like you to apply what you just
learned about Arraylist to modify

2
00:00:04,266 --> 00:00:08,283
the NumbersActivity to represent
the list of vocabulary words as an array

3
00:00:08,283 --> 00:00:11,850
list of strings,
rather than array of strings.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,900
Now if I were creating this app
in a professional environment

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,990
either an array list or
array would be valid.

6
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,250
On the other hand, if our app connected
to the Internet and would continue to

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,730
grow with new words over time, then a
list would probably be more appropriate.

8
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,710
So even though our app won't get
new words from the internet,

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,150
within the context of this course I'd
still prefer to use an array list

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,010
because it's easier to add additional
words without worrying about needing

11
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,100
to change the size of the array.

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,000
So for the first part of this exercise,
I'd like you to modify the app so

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,870
we store the words in an array
list instead of an array.

14
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,770
Now the words should stay the same.

15
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,260
It should be the numbers one
through ten spelled out.

16
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,200
And be sure to update
the log messages so

17
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,080
we print out each element of the array
list instead of from the array.

18
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,910
And remember you can always reference
this table that summarizes how the code

19
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,650
is different between an array and
array list.

20
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,820
And when you run the latest
version of the code on your device

21
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,390
there should be any changes
in the appearance of the app.

22
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,760
And remember you can check the logs
to verify that the list was

23
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,840
created properly.

24
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,600
And go ahead and
check these boxes when you're done.
