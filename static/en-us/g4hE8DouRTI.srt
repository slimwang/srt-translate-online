00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,450
You may remember from physics or
somewhere else, that if I've got some

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,340
point that's at a vector R from
the origin, let's say I'm the origin or

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,100
the origin is the middle of the object,
doesn't matter.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,415
If that point is rotating about
the origin with some angular rotational

5
00:00:16,415 --> 00:00:22,990
omega, and it's also translating with
some translational velocity T, okay?

6
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,290
The overall velocity of that point,

7
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:30,980
I hope you remember this from physics,
was V is equal to omega cross R plus T.

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,010
It's just true, you can work it out.

9
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,547
And, here's what that
looks like written out.

10
00:00:35,547 --> 00:00:38,802
You remember we did that crossing
operator could be written as a matrix

11
00:00:38,802 --> 00:00:39,692
multiplication.

12
00:00:39,692 --> 00:00:42,586
We did that for essential and
fundamental matrices,

13
00:00:42,586 --> 00:00:43,880
so that's all this is.

14
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,630
We've just written out
the cross operator as a matrix

15
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:51,470
where these are the components of the,
of rotational velocity, and

16
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,590
these are the components of
the translational velocity.

17
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,330
In fact, that's what it says here,
so VX, V sub X, V sub Y, V sub Z,

18
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,320
are the velocity vectors.

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,890
In the world, in the world,
in the XYZ direction, VTX, VTY,

20
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:10,020
VTZ are the translational components
in the world and omega X, omega Y, and

21
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,180
omega Z are the angular velocity
components in the world, all right?
