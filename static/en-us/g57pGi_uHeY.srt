1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,030
So let's see what is going on with the code over here.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,930
The first thing to do, is to start using something called AVAudioEngine.

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:13,560
Now this library, is packaged within the AVFoundation framework and

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,160
what it does, is it allows us to manipulate audio.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,290
So, as step one in our code,

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,800
what we are going to do, is create an object of AVAudioEngine.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,710
Once we have done that, we will create an instance or

8
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,060
an object of something called AVAudioPlayerNode.

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,990
You can think of this, as the thing that is connect to our mp3 file and

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,360
will actually play the recorded sound.

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,529
Okay, let's create an object of this.

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,720
Once you have done that, I will attach this to the AV audio engine.

13
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,340
Let me do that now.

14
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,190
Like that.

15
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,170
In the next step, we will create something called AVAudioUnitTimePitch.

16
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,190
This is the class that actually allows us to change the pitch of our audio.

17
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,830
So let's do that next.

18
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,972
And then, I will attach this to AVAudioEngine also.

19
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:09,770
Like that.

20
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,727
Then, towards the end, I will connect these two nodes together.

21
00:01:17,966 --> 00:01:19,170
There.

22
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,090
And then, finally, I will connect AVAudioUnitTimePitch,

23
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:26,210
to some sort of an output, like the speakers, let me do that.

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,230
There.

25
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,720
Once all of this is done, we can play the audio.

26
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,690
Oh, by the way, based on the value of the pitch in this effect.

27
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,570
The recorded voice will sound like a chipmunk
