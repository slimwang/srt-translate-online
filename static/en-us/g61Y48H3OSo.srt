Here are each of the answers. Great work if you figured those out. We want to

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,430
make sure that when we multiply, we just multiply the numbers inside of the

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:12,188
radical, and we leave the index alone. So we have the square root of 5 times

4
00:00:12,188 --> 00:00:16,955
the square root of 7, which equals the square root of 35. Here, we just

5
00:00:16,955 --> 00:00:21,824
multiply the radicands of 3 and 12 to get the cubed root of 36. Be sure you

6
00:00:21,824 --> 00:00:25,912
listed the 3 as the index for your radical. For the third one, we have the 5th

7
00:00:25,912 --> 00:00:30,961
root of 100, since 5 times 20 equals 100. And for the last one, we have the 4th

8
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:34,678
root of 21, since 3 times 7 equals 21.
