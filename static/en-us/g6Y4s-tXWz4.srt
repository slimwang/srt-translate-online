00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,620
Let's do a little quiz where you
calculate the communication time of

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,370
the summa algorithm.

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,860
You argued previously that
the running time to do all the flops

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,850
is 2n cubed over P.

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,570
But what about communication?

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,310
Here's my question.

7
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:18,370
Which of the following estimates
are plausible estimates of the overall

8
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,420
communication running time?

9
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,950
For the alpha term,
I want you to choose one of these.

10
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:28,060
For the beta term, I want you to
choose the matching one of these.

11
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,710
Now, I put a big O in front of this so
that you can ignore constants and

12
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,170
just focus on asymptotics.

13
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,310
Now, there may be more than one correct
pairing, so the key is, based on your

14
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,550
choice for one of them choose something
that's plausible for the other one.
