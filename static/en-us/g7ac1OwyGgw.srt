1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,350
Another way that you can consume data is
through a cross-tabulation, or Crosstab.

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:09,870
A Crosstab allows you to take
data within a field, and

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,390
summarize other data to the values
within that field to create a matrix.

4
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,300
Let's look at where we might use this.

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,200
If I have a file of schools in Wyoming,
and

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,420
I'm putting together a data
set at the zip code level,

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,960
then I'll need to summarize the schools'
data at the zip code level.

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,950
I can do simple counts
of school records or

9
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:37,580
sums of enrollment by aggregating, or
summarizing at the zip code level.

10
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,140
However, if I wanted to
create new fields for

11
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:46,310
each value of the level description,
or level desk field,

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,130
and sum up the number of records
in my data set, by zip code,

13
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:56,120
for each of those values,
like other, high, primary, and

14
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,870
so on, then I would need to create
a cross tabulation of this data.

15
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,200
This sort of action can be done
similarly in a pivot table in Excel.
