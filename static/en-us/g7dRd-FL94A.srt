1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,920
Alright, everybody, welcome back. So, let's, let's work through these. Charles,

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,000
what is, what are you thinking for, for this first one.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,090
>> I'm thinking I should write a program, and just

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,650
run it through, 'because that's the easiest thing to do.

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,980
>> So what you're saying is this f function is

6
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:17,390
so kind of wacky that it's hard to imagine actually analyzing

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,510
it, and doing anything with it. But, on the other

8
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,830
hand. The X, the space of X values is very small.

9
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:23,370
>> Right.

10
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,490
>> Good so right so we can

11
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,180
enumerate all the possible values and just

12
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,940
see which one gives the highest output.

13
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,330
>> Yeah that's pretty straight forward if I just wrote

14
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,000
the code, in fact it's like one line of code.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,420
>> So I wrote it for you.

16
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,050
>> Oh good.

17
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,290
>> I'm nice that way.

18
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,600
>> You are nice that way, you optimized our time.

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,670
>> Our did, for what it's worth, this is what

20
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,430
the function looks like. I'm not even sure that's a function.

21
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,620
>> Isn't that beautiful?

22
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,250
>> It's something. It looks DNA gone wrong.

23
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:50,960
>> Yeah,

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,320
totally wrong, there's just mutations everywhere. It's like a bow

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,130
tie that then tried to hide itself in another dimension.

26
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,264
I mean like, you can see there's this interesting up

27
00:01:00,264 --> 00:01:04,129
and down-ness to it like a, like the sine wave part.

28
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:04,160
>> Mm.

29
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,600
>> But they're, they're interdigitated with each

30
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,570
other. It's all, it's just crazy to me.

31
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,410
>> Interdigitated. That is an excellent word.

32
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,970
>> Yeah, it means, it means to put you're fingers together.

33
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:13,370
>> Hm.

34
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,140
>> So,

35
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,270
>> So what happens if you plot that but with,

36
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,060
connecting lines?

37
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,372
>> Oh, oh, hee, hee. Sure. [LAUGH]

38
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:20,460
>> Wow.

39
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,800
>> You get somethin' like that. Wow.

40
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,890
>> This is a kind of unfriendly function.

41
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,270
>> Yeah, this is not the friendliest function I have ever seen.

42
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,870
>> And now it looks a bit like, actually

43
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,930
it looks a bit like an insane bow tie.

44
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,940
>> Nice. Electric bow tie.

45
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,400
>> Yeah.

46
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,940
>> So it turns out that there's two points that

47
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,390
are really really close to the top. There's this one at

48
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,960
11 and there's this one I don't know a little bit after

49
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,880
80 or so. But the 1 and the 11 is actually the largest.

50
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,790
>> Hm. This function goes too loud.

51
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:51,850
>> [LAUGH] It does indeed. So, I'm going to say 11.

52
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,770
I wanted to make a crazy function that was the,

53
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,832
was the first thing that popped into my head. Actually

54
00:01:56,832 --> 00:01:59,560
I did, the second one was a mod three at first.

55
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,600
>> Hm, well, it's an interesting thing,

56
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,100
right because if you tried to reason this

57
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,530
out, it would be very difficult to do. I mean, first off, mod isn't very

58
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,960
nicely you know, it's very easy, it's not very easy to deal

59
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,520
with algebraically in closed form but you can start reasoning and say,

60
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,370
well, the dominating factor is mod seven in the sense that you're

61
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,370
never going to be greater than six and of course the mod six

62
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,450
is never going to be greater than five so the best you

63
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,650
can get there is five and then you minus the sign, which is

64
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,480
going to be some small number so you can kind of pick

65
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,420
all the values that are going to give you something like. Five there,

66
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,460
and then whichever one has the smallest Sine, that's the one

67
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,830
you go for. I wonder if that would get you anywhere close

68
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,350
to the right answer. So, interesting that that's not quite true here

69
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:44,550
because 11 mod six is, no 11 mod six is five, right?

70
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,600
>> Hmm.

71
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,100
>> Squared is 25. Mod seven is four. Is that right?

72
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,070
>> Anyway.

73
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,760
>> Hm, okay.

74
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,530
>> Lets do the second one.

75
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:54,950
>> Okay.

76
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,490
>> Alright so it turns out

77
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,220
that, again, 11 and 80 are really close but 11 is slightly larger and it's just

78
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:06,770
almost five, but not quite. Alright, so for the second problem, now we can't

79
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:13,020
use of enumerating because our X's constitute the entire space of the, reals.

80
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,710
>> So, there's like, 200 of them.

81
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,700
>> More.

82
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:21,340
So we need to do something else. And I think what you were pointing out to me is

83
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,470
that because this is a nice polynomial. We can

84
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:29,240
actually use calculus to figure out where the maximum is.

85
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,570
>> Right, just take the derivative and set it equal to 0.

86
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,200
>> So unfortunately, I made that a little harder

87
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,280
than than probably you'd appreciate. So the derivative would

88
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,970
be this, and setting it equal to 0 would

89
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,140
give us this equation, which unfortunately is a cubic.

90
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:43,710
>> Right.

91
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:46,339
>> So it should have three solutions.

92
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,840
Perhaps, and you could just check each of them.

93
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,670
But solving the cubic is sort of a pain.

94
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,686
>> Mm mm.

95
00:03:54,686 --> 00:03:56,410
>> I guess I could have been a bit nicer.

96
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,280
>> You could have been.

97
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,380
>> Sorry.

98
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,180
>> But it all depends what you're optimizing.

99
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,550
>> So how would you go about solving this now?

100
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,940
>> I would go on Google and I look up how do you solve cubics.

101
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,940
>> [LAUGH] Sure, that's not a bad idea.

102
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,440
Any other things, because it is nice and smooth,

103
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,570
right? So let's, here, let's, let me actually find it for you. So

104
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:20,279
here's the function, and I just plotted a subrange of it, from minus

105
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,940
500 to 1000. You know you could ask, could it be that the

106
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,850
maximum is actually someplace outside this

107
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,400
range. You know how you'd answer that?

108
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,590
>> No. So because it's a fourth order

109
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,400
polynomial, like think of like a, a quadratic,

110
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:34,490
>> Yeah.

111
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,510
>> It's got the one bump in it, a cubic can have as much as you know

112
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:42,770
one up bump and one down bump. And a qua, and a quartic ca, a 4th

113
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,820
degree polynomial can have an up bump, a

114
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,350
down bump, an up bump and then back down.

115
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,035
>> M-hm.

116
00:04:48,035 --> 00:04:49,990
>> So we're actually seeing all the activity here,

117
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,480
outside this range it just plumettes negatively. It, it

118
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,270
can't turn around and come back up again. So

119
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,260
because we can see the two bumps we are good.

120
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:57,860
>> OK.

121
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,730
>> And in this case, it looks like the

122
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,850
bump that we want is somewhere between 500 and

123
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,450
a 1000, somewhere in the 700 kind of zone and well so one thing we could do

124
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,200
because it's really well behaved, we can kind of

125
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,982
zoom in on the function at that range. Mm-hmm.

126
00:05:11,982 --> 00:05:15,730
>> So there we are now zoomed in from between 500 and 1,000. We can see,

127
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,470
okay, well, actually it looks like the peak

128
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,050
is maybe between 600 and 800, you think?

129
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,800
>> I'd say 700 and 800.

130
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,350
>> Between 700 and 800. All right, well let's take a look at that.

131
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,603
>> Ooooo.

132
00:05:26,603 --> 00:05:28,710
>> Nice and

133
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,140
Pointy. Alright. So how bout that?

134
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,670
>> 740. How bout 740 and 760?

135
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,340
>> So we really are kind of getting into

136
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,500
the nitty gritty here. So, so, for the

137
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,750
quiz we'll you know, we accepted anything, between

138
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:45,730
you know, 745 and 755. But in fact we

139
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,090
can keep zooming in and we can use calculus, and we can, we can really hone on

140
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:52,080
what that, the tippy top is there. But

141
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,980
that's not so important right now, we could also

142
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,640
something called Newton's method, you know Newton's method?

143
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,760
>> I remember it.

144
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,370
>> Newton, newton's method said if, you

145
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,780
know, guess a position like you know, 455

146
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:09,260
sorry 755, and use the derivative at that point which is actually really easy to

147
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,420
compute, doesn't involve solving the, the cubic,

148
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,410
it just involves, Writing down the cubic and

149
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,510
evaluating at that point, we can actually you

150
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,380
know, fit with the straight line is here.

151
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,500
And we can take it, take steps in the direction of

152
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,270
that line, it's a, it's a gradient ascend kind of method.

153
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:24,730
>> Yeah.

154
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:27,220
>> And, and that'll allow us to hone in, as we

155
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,410
get closer and closer to the top. The slope is going to flatten

156
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:33,970
out, we're going to take smaller steps And this process converges to

157
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,180
whatever the peak is, I think it's a little bit under 750.

158
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,960
>> That looks about right.
