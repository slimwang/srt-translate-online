00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,639
Now, this time we have a expression that's a bit more complicated than the past

2
00:00:03,651 --> 00:00:07,328
few we've seen. However, if we keep in mind our rules that we know for combining

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,967
like terms, that you can only combine terms that have the same variables with

4
00:00:10,979 --> 00:00:14,759
the same powers, then this actually shouldn't be that much harder than the other

5
00:00:14,771 --> 00:00:18,244
one's we've done. So, just give it a try. Write the simplest version of this

6
00:00:18,256 --> 00:00:19,198
expression that you can in this box over here.
