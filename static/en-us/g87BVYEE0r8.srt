1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,150
Okay, so now that we have our
YAML file set up, let's try and

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,610
deploy our website.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,090
So, we'll select our project and
we'll hit Deploy.

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,390
And you'll see that we have to
sign in our Google account.

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:14,810
So let's do that now.

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:18,380
So you'll see this window
pop up after you sign in.

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,330
And let's take a look at what it says.

8
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:26,180
It says error 401, begin server output,
must authenticate first.

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,050
So, if you're wondering what
this error means, it just means

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,060
that you have to change the security
settings on your Gmail account.

11
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:38,580
So let's switch over to Gmail,
and let's refresh our inbox.

12
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,530
Okay, so we refreshed our inbox and
we received an email from Google.

13
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,580
Let's take a look at what it says.

14
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:50,550
So, it says we recently blocked a
sign-in attempt to your Google account.

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:56,310
So what you need to do here is click
on this link under if this was you.

16
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,020
And I'll take you to this tab.

17
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,030
We'll click on turn on access for
less secure apps.

18
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,560
So once it's updated, we'll switch
back to Google App Engine and

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,490
let's try to deploy again.

20
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,190
Okay, great.

21
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,350
So you'll see this pop-up window.

22
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:15,810
And it has a bunch of status
updates from Google App Engine.

23
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,080
And you can see at the very bottom it
says, you can close this window now.

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,510
So let's close it and
we'll switch back to our web browser.

25
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:27,460
So let's open a new tab and
lets check out our website.

26
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:32,854
So our url is,
ouruniqueprojectid.appspot.com.

27
00:01:32,854 --> 00:01:35,770
And look at that, we have our website.

28
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:36,620
Hello Udacity.
