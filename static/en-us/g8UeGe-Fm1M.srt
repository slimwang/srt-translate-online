00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,469
Virtualization is an old idea.

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:08,162
It originated in the 60s at IBM when
the norm of computing was that there

3
00:00:08,162 --> 00:00:13,070
were a few large mainframe computers
that were shared by many users and

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,960
many business services.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,470
In order to concurrently run a very
diverse workloads on the same physical

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:25,000
hardware, without requiring that
a single operating system be used for

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,816
all of the o- applications for
all of the possible purposes,

8
00:00:28,816 --> 00:00:34,200
it was necessary to come up with a model
where multiple operating systems

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,880
can concurrently be deployed
on the same hardware platform.

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,420
With virtualization,

11
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:45,270
each of the operating systems that are
deployed on the same physical platform

12
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,110
has an illusion that it actually owns
the underlying hardware resources.

13
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,470
Or at least some smaller
portion of them.

14
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,010
For instance,

15
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,080
the operating system may think that
it owns some smaller amount of memory

16
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,500
compared to the memory that's actually
available on the physical machine.

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,210
Each operating system together with its
applications as well as the virtual

18
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:12,170
resources that it pings at us is called
a virtual machine, or VM for short.

19
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,680
This represents a virtual
machine because it is distinct

20
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,170
from the physical machine that is
natively managed by some software stack.

21
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:26,750
Virtual machines are often referred
to as guests such as guest VMs or

22
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,527
also referred to as domains,
like a guest domain for instance.

23
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,320
To support the coexistence of multiple
virtual machines on the same physical

24
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:40,550
machine, require some underlying
functionality in order to deal with

25
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:46,320
the allocation and the management of
the real, physical hardware resources.

26
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:46,980
In addition,

27
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:52,470
it's necessary to provide some
isolation guarantees across these VMs.

28
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,560
This is provided by
the virtualization layer,

29
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,710
that is refered to as virtual
machine monitor or hypervisor, also.

30
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,360
There are multiple ways in
which the functionality,

31
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,470
that's required by the virtualization
layer, can be designed and implemented.

32
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,010
And in this lesson we will describe
some of the key virtualization

33
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:12,720
related techniques.
