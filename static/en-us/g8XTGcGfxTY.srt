00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
To show you how we can encode a single single snap shot on the REM

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,300
as a Boolean formula,

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,020
I'm going to show you a little trick with the Boolean formula.

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,800
So this Boolean formula--

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,660
it looks a bit intimidating, and it doesn't look fun.

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,820
Well I'll just quickly explain it to you and then help you figure out

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,170
the special property that it has.

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,450
So the formula consists of 6 variables:

9
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:26,190
X1, X2, X3 to X6

10
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,090
and it has 7 brackets,

11
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,220
so as you can see, each of those brackets contains

12
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,880
all of the 6 variables: X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6.

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,900
Sometimes they're a bit mixed up,

14
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:42,500
but every bracket here contains the 6 variables exactly once.

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,040
They're all connected with an and here,

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,990
and each one of them looks like this,

17
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,960
so up here you have an or over all of those variables,

18
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,360
and down here,

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,390
each bracket has a very similar structure,

20
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,620
so you have X1

21
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,020
or you have one of the variables

22
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,400
and a not of that variable,

23
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,060
or,

24
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,230
and this is a very big not

25
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,340
over off the other variables,

26
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,230
and those are combined by or.

27
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,810
Now probably it's a bit tough to figure out by yourself

28
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,840
what the purpose of this formula is.

29
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,650
I want you to figure it out,

30
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,490
but I will give you a few choices.

31
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:21,440
So what's special about this Boolean formula?

32
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,530
Does it not have any satisfying assignment?

33
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,940
Does it have several satisfying assignments?

34
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,650
Can it only be satisfied if exactly

35
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,440
one of those 6 variables is set to true,

36
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,270
and finally, if you generalize this,

37
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,520
so not 6 variables but any number n of variables,

38
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,970
and then you do the same structure as you do here.

39
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,630
That's the whole resulting formula,

40
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,280
have size 0 (n squared) for n variables?

41
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,630
So I think by now you're used to more than one of these answers

42
00:01:47,630 --> 99:59:59,999
can be true, so check all of these that are correct.
