00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,085
The answer is this equation right here, which goes with this triangle, a squared

2
00:00:04,097 --> 00:00:07,955
plus b squared equals c squared. These other two right triangles are a special

3
00:00:07,967 --> 00:00:11,990
kinds of right triangles and the equations right here that show the proporions

4
00:00:12,002 --> 00:00:16,079
between their side lengths are particular to them individually and they don't

5
00:00:16,091 --> 00:00:20,988
apply to all right triangles. But, now we do have a super important piece of

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,257
information that we can use, not just to talk about these three right triangles,

7
00:00:25,353 --> 00:00:29,576
but also the one in Grant's situation and any other ones moving forward. This

8
00:00:29,588 --> 00:00:33,845
equation, a squared plus b squared equals c squared, relating the side lengths

9
00:00:33,857 --> 00:00:37,744
of any right triangle together is called the Pythagorean theorem. Julie

10
00:00:37,756 --> 00:00:42,139
mentioned this way back in the very first lesson of this course. So, no big deal

11
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:45,555
if you didn't remember it or its name. We'll keep using it in the future,

12
00:00:45,644 --> 00:00:45,969
though.
