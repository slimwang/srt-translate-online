1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,670
All right. Now so just to kind of reinforce this

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,340
idea and also to let us think about it in

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,460
a slightly different direction, I want you to consider solving

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,810
the following quiz. Here's four payoffs that I've put little

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,880
boxes around. This one at minus 1, minus 1, this

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,890
one at minus 3, 0, and this one at minus

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,120
4, minus 4. And the question is, which of these

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,430
payoffs can be the average payoff for some joint strategy?

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,160
And this is in the repeated game setting, [CROSSTALK]

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,790
okay. So what we're imagining is these two players can

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,917
coordinate in any way they want. We're not talking

12
00:00:33,917 --> 00:00:36,800
about trying to maximize reward or, or, being Nash or

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,240
anything like that. They're just going to execute some,

14
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,720
some pattern of, of strategies over infinite run. We're going to

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,520
average the payoffs that the two players get and we'll

16
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,620
say, you know is it possible for them to adopt

17
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:56,350
a strategy so that the average per time step gets minus 3 for Smooth

18
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:01,532
and 0 for Curly? Yes or no? So check that box if that's possible. Can it be that

19
00:01:01,532 --> 00:01:05,823
they both get minus one on average? If so, check this box. And can it be

20
00:01:05,823 --> 00:01:07,762
that they both get minus 4 on average?

21
00:01:07,762 --> 00:01:10,910
Check this box. Does that, does that make sense?

22
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:11,770
>> It does make sense.

23
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:15,260
>> All right, so I'll give you a chance to think it through and answer it.

24
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:15,650
>> Okay.
