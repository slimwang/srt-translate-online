1
00:00:00,366 --> 00:00:01,642
So letâ€™s now plug this in

2
00:00:01,823 --> 00:00:03,137
and see for the temperature of

3
00:00:03,275 --> 00:00:04,889
36 degrees

4
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:06,721
what our predicted failure is.

5
00:00:06,721 --> 00:00:07,674
The formula now is simple,

6
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,518
36 times b plus a,

7
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:10,457
what do we get?
