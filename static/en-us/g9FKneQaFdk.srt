1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We have one big issue left to resolve,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
which is how do we pick e and d to make this property true?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
For correctness what we need to know is that ed - 1 is equal to Ï†(n),

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and we know since n is the product of the primes p and q

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
that this is equal to (p-1)(q-1).

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The quiz is which one of these should be selected randomly--

7
00:00:25,000 --> 99:59:59,999
either e, d, or it doesn't matter which one?
