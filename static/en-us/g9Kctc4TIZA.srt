The answer is 184, you lose more than a quarter of all output levels when you

2
00:00:03,442 --> 00:00:08,085
gamma correct an 8 bit image. Doing so can lead to what's called banding.

3
00:00:08,085 --> 00:00:11,010
Especially with the lower values where you can see the different levels due to

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,621
the gaps. Here's one solution; it uses the observation that each channel

5
00:00:14,621 --> 00:00:19,260
computed will be either a new one, in which case you want to add it to a count.

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,940
Or it's a previous one that you've already seen. That bit of code was from

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,080
Patrick Cozzi, and frankly, it was better than mine. Patrick, Mauricio, and

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,550
later on Branislav did massive amounts of work on this course's material.

9
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,372
Thanks so much, guys. This course is at least twice as good as it would have

10
00:00:33,372 --> 00:00:34,970
been without their help.
