1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,940
In this application,
you saw the infrastructure for

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,950
how Geo-fences work in Android.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,540
You saw how easy it is to set up
Geo-fences, and how you can use

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,970
an intent service to handle
the transitions between Geo-fences.

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,750
In this case,
we hard coded several locations but

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,080
there's no reason why you couldn't put
your Geo-fence data into the cloud and

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,270
have your phone dynamically update
the number of Geo-fences that it tracks.

8
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,130
So for example, if you wanted
to have a virtual treasure hunt

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,280
with locations that change every day,
you could do so and

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,375
have your app update them
whenever it launches.

11
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:34,760
There's just so
much that you can do with Geo-fencing.

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,400
Particularly, now,

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,120
that the users carry these powerful
mobile devices with them all the time.

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,400
We scratched the surface
of what you can do.

15
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,130
But in doing so,

16
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,520
we've built a powerful scaffolding
that you can use in your future apps.
