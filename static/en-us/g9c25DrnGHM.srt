00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,889
>> Since your first midterm exam is coming up, let's talk about how to review

2
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:07,893
the topics we've covered this far. >> Our journey with Grant began way back with

3
00:00:07,893 --> 00:00:11,688
talking about variables and expressions which we then combined into equations to

4
00:00:11,688 --> 00:00:15,328
help him start figuring out a plan for this glasses wiper business. First, he

5
00:00:15,328 --> 00:00:19,080
dealt with linear equations and inequalities, how to graph them and how to solve

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,912
them. Once we encountered situations where Grant needed parabolas and their

7
00:00:22,912 --> 00:00:26,910
corresponding quadratic equations, we figured out how to handle those as well.

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,814
Along the way, we've worked with every category of real number that we talked

9
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:34,413
about at the very start of the course, as well as a new classification of

10
00:00:34,413 --> 00:00:38,793
number, complex numbers, which have both real and imaginary components. You've

11
00:00:38,793 --> 00:00:42,825
learned a ton about algebra in the course so far, and you may be wondering, how

12
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:46,924
do I study for all of this material? And how do I take a test on the Udacity

13
00:00:46,924 --> 00:00:51,600
site? Well, we've come up with a few tips to help you out. >> Go back and look

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,360
at practice questions and problem sets for Lessons 1 through 16. I also

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,849
recommend watching my review sessions and redoing the problems that come after

16
00:00:59,849 --> 00:01:03,280
them. >> Make sure that you're comfortable using MathQuill, since you'll have to

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,524
input some answers in the test using it. You can look at the MathQuill overview

18
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:09,989
page on the wiki and you can go back to quizzes in the units that use MathQuill

19
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:13,711
and practice typing things in there. >> Also, make sure you're comfortable

20
00:01:13,711 --> 00:01:17,401
working things out on paper, as well as typing them. Best of luck, we know

21
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:21,254
you're going to do great. >> After this first midterm, we'll be moving on to a

22
00:01:21,254 --> 00:01:24,520
second case study, a new context for learning about Algebra. We're sad that our

23
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,992
time with Grant is over, but he's going to be just fine handling his glasses

24
00:01:27,992 --> 00:01:31,532
wiper business now that we've taught him so much about math. And now, we get to

25
00:01:31,532 --> 00:01:35,768
study something new and exciting, architecture. This is going to help us learn

26
00:01:35,768 --> 00:01:39,984
about functions, specifically higher order polynomial functions and rational

27
00:01:39,984 --> 00:01:43,518
functions and give us a lot of pretty things to look at and understand

28
00:01:43,518 --> 00:01:44,530
mathematically.
