You have your x variable, your predictor. And then you get the outcome, which

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:11,403
is the y variable. X explains the response. Finally, x is independent and y

3
00:00:11,403 --> 00:00:17,162
depends on the value of x. These other two aren't used in statistics jargon.

4
00:00:17,162 --> 00:00:24,170
But if anything, they probably describe the x variable. Since X kind of

5
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:29,530
determines what Y will be, what we can predict Y to be. In stand-alone, I don't

6
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,680
know. I just made that up.
