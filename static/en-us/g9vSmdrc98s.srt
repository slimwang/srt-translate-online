00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,282
In this assignment, discuss how you'd use case-based reasoning to

2
00:00:03,282 --> 00:00:06,516
develop an agent that can answer Raven's Progressive Matrices. Make sure to

3
00:00:06,516 --> 00:00:10,040
describe how this is different from learning by recording cases alone. Where is

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,040
your adaptation phase? How are you adapting past solutions to the new problem?

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,910
What is evaluation in this context? How are you evaluating the strength of your

6
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,870
answer? Are you going to record the cases that your agent encounters as they're

7
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,930
solving the test, or are you going to equip them with past cases beforehand for

8
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:23,740
them to use to solve new problems?
