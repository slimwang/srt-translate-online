00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'd like to talk a little bit more about correspondence.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Specifically, we've learned that searching for correspondence means

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
we search along a single scan line,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
but I'd like to ask the question whether it's optimal to correspond individual patches

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
which are independent of each other.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Would it make sense to look at the context of an entire scan line?

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's look at the following situation.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We have a background that's black.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We have a foreground that's red,

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and we have sides of the object that are both blue.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In a left image, we might see black, black,

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and then there is this blue element that is only visible from the left camera,

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
a couple of reds--3 of them--and then we see more blacks.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
From the right imager we might see black, black.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We won't see the blue over here, because it's occluded,

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
but we'll see a couple of reds followed by the blue over here,

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
which is only visible from the right camera, followed by more blacks.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
When we look at the entire situation,

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
the question is whether we can correspond red pixels to each other

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
irrespective of context or whether it makes sense to look at context.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Specifically, take the mid red pixel over here--this guy over here--

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and let me ask you does it correspond to the left red, the center red, or the right red?

23
00:01:29,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Please check the corresponding box.
