00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,675
Now our suburban scene was quaint, but it was rather static. Let's add a second

2
00:00:04,675 --> 00:00:09,500
interface to add some motion. The moveable interface has a method move, and we

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:15,800
give the number of seconds for the simulated motion. Now, cars are moveable,

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:21,410
our car class implements two interfaces, drawable, and movable. Lets see how

5
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,573
that start. The car class now needs to implement the methods of both the

6
00:00:25,573 --> 00:00:30,921
drawable and the movable interface. Here is the draw method that we've always

7
00:00:30,921 --> 00:00:35,145
had, here is the move method we'll arbitrarily say that these cars moves at 10

8
00:00:35,145 --> 00:00:40,625
pixel per second. And each of the components of the car is moved by that

9
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:46,617
amount. What's it look like? When you run the program, you can see this car

10
00:00:46,617 --> 00:00:52,415
here moving. Later, we'll move the other cars as well, but for now please go

11
00:00:52,415 --> 00:00:56,053
ahead and move Fido as well.
