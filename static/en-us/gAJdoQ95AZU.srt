00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,990
Let's check out to what it takes
to create a walking animation.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,029
The animation constructor expects
an array of texture regions.

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:10,550
Now what is a texture region
as opposed to a texture?

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,110
We'll actually talk about that in
the next node, so hold on a second.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,890
We have three frames in our walkLoop.

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,910
So we load up the texture,
convert it into a TextureRegion, and

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:23,130
add it into our array, then we pass
them to the constructor how long we want

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,200
each frame to last, the textures
to display, and then the PlayMode.

9
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,130
Also note that when we create
our application listener

10
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,660
we save off the time
at which it's created

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,970
that way we can get the appropriate
frame from the animation later.

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,130
Then down in the render callback we
figure out how many seconds have elapsed

13
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,720
since we started displaying the
animation using this bit of math here,

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,760
and then we ask the walkLoop for

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,810
the key frame that we should
be displaying right now.

16
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:53,700
That's the texture we want to display
given the elapsedTime since we started

17
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,600
displaying the animation.

18
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,430
There's also a whole lot more detail in

19
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,320
here about how to draw the cool
explosions we're about to see.

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,540
I'll let you look into that on your own.

21
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,720
So here's the result.

22
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,350
The animation has three frames, one
where GigaGal's left foot is forward,

23
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,920
one where her right foot is forward,
and one where her feet are about even.

24
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,550
Since we put this in ping pong mode that
means we go left foot forward, even,

25
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,840
right foot forward, even, and so on.

26
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,640
Also GigaGal appears to
be in a bit of trouble.

27
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,200
Hope she runs through
all the explosions okay.

28
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,570
Dig into the to do's in the course
code to set up GigaGal's walk loop and

29
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:29,590
the explosion animation.
