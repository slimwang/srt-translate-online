00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,241
Well the answer would be zero. This one was tough. So don't worry if you didn't

2
00:00:04,241 --> 00:00:09,046
get it right on your first try. We can see that one of the factors is x minus x.

3
00:00:09,046 --> 00:00:13,015
Well, we know x minus x would equal zero, so I have a bunch of other numbers,

4
00:00:13,015 --> 00:00:18,529
times zero, times a bunch of other numbers. Anything times zero is just zero. I

5
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:22,807
think it's pretty amazing how one number can have such a unique property in

6
00:00:22,807 --> 00:00:27,463
math. This one zero makes this whole entire multiplication zero.
