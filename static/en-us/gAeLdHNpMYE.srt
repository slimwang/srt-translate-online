1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
And I think 2 of these answers here are true.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,670
First of all, if you had perfect formal criteria for malware,

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,740
the whole thing would fall under Rice's Theorem.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,570
Malware would be a functional property

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,100
and we know that functional properties are not decidable,

6
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,790
which in turn means that since the problem is undecidable

7
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,270
that malware detection can never be perfect.

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,230
It's not really clear what kind of error you will be making,

9
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,410
so if you will be classifying good software as bad

10
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,980
or bad software as good,

11
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,110
but it can not be perfect,

12
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,150
because if it were perfect, then that would violate Rice's Theorem.

13
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,690
Now NP completeness of course; that is not true for several reasons,

14
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,080
so first of all, running time is

15
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,890
something something that we just can see here,

16
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,600
and secondly, as you've learned,

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,200
there are problems that are much worse than problems that lie in NP

18
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,080
so it can also be that malware detection is actually

19
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,130
worse than NP complete.

20
00:00:49,130 --> 99:59:59,999
We just don't know, so this is not a correct answer here.
