1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,480
As more mentioned, you can also focus
your segmentation on a Persona.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,080
Personas are fictional characters
created to represent different user

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,370
types then they're going to use
your product in very similar way.

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,030
So, the best practice is to define
three to five different personas and

5
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,000
describe them as if they're real people,
so with a name,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,970
a job, values whatever hobbies and maybe
even a quote that the user might say.

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,630
We'll use these to create an actual
profile for each persona.

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,580
Let's take you to kids for example.

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,830
This is Art, he's a dad,

10
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:35,390
and as much as he'd love to expose his
son to all different content music he

11
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,160
really wants to make sure that his son
only consumes age appropriate content.

12
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,130
And this is Finn, his son,
he's 3 years old.

13
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,510
He wants to watch YouTube all day long.

14
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,380
And he wants to do
everything by himself.

15
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,360
He needs an interface that's going to
allow him to do it himself, and

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,960
be easy to navigate.

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,770
These are two personas: Art
is our decision maker, so

18
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,870
as a company YouTube needs Art to
trust in their product with his son.

19
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,990
And Finn needs an app that
he actually enjoys using.

20
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,540
So, a persona for a could be a Dalia,

21
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,420
a 29-year old finance executive who
frequently travels for business.

22
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,630
When she's not working,
she loves the outdoors,

23
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:14,070
trying new upscale restaurants,
cooking, and

24
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,760
of course spending time with her Golden
doodle, who she considers a child.

25
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,360
In a business to business example,

26
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,040
creating a persona can be
a little bit more complex.

27
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,640
You really have to understand
the business you're targeting and

28
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,110
the individual constraints of
each user and decision maker.

29
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,760
So, the user could be a marketing
person or an engineer, but

30
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,870
the decision maker could be someone
more senior level like the CEO or CFO.
