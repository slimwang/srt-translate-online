Welcome back. As we mentioned at the conclusion of the previous lesson module,

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:13,460
the drive for extensibility in operating system services led to innovations in

3
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,650
the internal structure of operating systems

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,810
and dynamic loading of operating system

5
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:25,740
modules in modern operating systems. And do not stop there. In this lesson,

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:31,700
we will see how the concept of virtualization has taken the vision

7
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,270
of extensibility to a whole new

8
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:39,690
level. Namely, allowing the simultaneous co-existence of

9
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:45,220
entire operating systems on top of the same hardware platform. Strap your

10
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:50,800
seatbelts and get ready for an exciting ride. Before we look deep into

11
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,610
the nuts and bolts of virtualization, let's cover some basics.
