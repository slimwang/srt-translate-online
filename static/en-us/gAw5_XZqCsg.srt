Hello and welcome to Lesson 6. We're going to talk about loops. But more

2
00:00:04,591 --> 00:00:08,090
importantly, you're going to learn something that you probably want to know.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,818
Namely, how you can become a millionaire, even though if you think about it

4
00:00:10,818 --> 00:00:15,258
right now, interest rates. Rates are very low. Get a measly 1% on your bank

5
00:00:15,258 --> 00:00:19,520
account. And I don't know about you, but I don't have a lot of money right now.

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,300
All I have to invest is $100. But, I have a plan. Here's my plan. I'm going to

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,702
set my time machine to that specific point when my bank account has a million

8
00:00:28,702 --> 00:00:33,080
dollars in it. Or maybe if I can't find my time machine, I'll just let myself

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,650
be chronologically frozen and tell them to wake me up at that moment. All I

10
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,456
need to know now is to which date in the future to set my time machine. So,

11
00:00:41,456 --> 00:00:44,186
that's what we're going to be writing a program for and that program's going to

12
00:00:44,186 --> 00:00:48,057
be using loops. Because it has to keep on adding that interest to the bank

13
00:00:48,057 --> 00:00:52,205
account until it reaches $1 million. How long do you think it's going to take?

14
00:00:52,205 --> 00:00:58,090
100 years, 1,000 years, 10,000 years, or almost a million years? Let's take a guess.
