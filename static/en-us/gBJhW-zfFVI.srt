00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,410
Let's talk a bit more about the flow
of who calls what with Android Auto

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:04,590
media playback.

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:08,320
You can see that Android Auto
initiates the process by calling

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,660
onGetRoot of your application.

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,450
This returns back a route note ID,
and also a session token.

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,510
Next, Android Auto calls onLoadChildren

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,920
to get the complete hierarchy of the
media available from your application.

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,440
This allows browsing, but
also voice search overall with songs.

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,950
When the user is ready,
they get to pick a song,

10
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,840
which is then cast as an argument
to the media session dot call back.

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,210
Your app then takes action,
such as selecting a song, play, pause,

12
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,700
next track, et cetera.

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,150
After taking action,
your app communicates changes in the UI

14
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,580
by changing the metadata or
the playback state
