1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,100
In this scenario,
you're developing a self-publishing,

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:07,250
mobile photojournalism site which
will have single use photos.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,070
This site is designed for big events,
and people will be creating

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,480
unique sites where they'll post a single
image alongside some description of it.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,240
Should you convert them
to vector graphics or

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,630
just keep the photos as .jpgs?

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,210
And should you inline the images or

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,230
should you set their
srcs to external files?

9
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,090
Pick the best answer for
these two questions.
