00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,810
There are a couple of answers that I think you could make arguments for, for

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,250
what might be the correct answer for this quiz.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,890
One of the things you might say is that the right one is doing a better job

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:14,060
because it's fitting so many more data points, that it's easier to

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,770
describe the pattern in the data, because you just have more data and so

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,670
you're a little bit more certain that, for example, if you kept collecting data,

7
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,760
something weird wouldn't happen that would mess up your fit.

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,570
So that's one argument you could make.

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:27,970
Another argument you could make,

10
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,800
which I think is perfectly valid, is that they're about the same.

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,479
That, considering how much data you have for

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,010
each one, each one's doing a pretty reasonable job of fitting.

13
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,230
And look, the data's pretty comparable between the two of them.

14
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,100
It's just that the one on the right happens to have more data.

15
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,020
But then if the trend continued on the left,

16
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,730
then you would probably have the same fit.

17
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,270
The point is though that there isn't a huge difference between these two fits.

18
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,970
That they're both generally describing the patterns and the data appropriately.
