1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,160
So one of the most crucial things that you have to do in this class is you

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,500
have to get hands-on experience with playing around with images.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,420
And for that purpose, I would like to now introduce to you several tools we

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,180
will be using in this class.

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,940
Again, it's essential that you learn how to interact with images,

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,470
because we are going to be doing a lot of processing and

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:26,160
computation on images to take us towards path of doing competition photography.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,490
To facilitate this,

9
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,840
first thing we will pair on with is something referred to as OpenCV.

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,242
An an interface to OpenCV that's available through Python.

11
00:00:35,242 --> 00:00:36,574
Now, [INAUDIBLE] or

12
00:00:36,574 --> 00:00:42,190
Daniel, the head TA, is the instructional designer for this class.

13
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,460
We'll provide you the various suggestions on how to get setup on this kind of

14
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,430
stuff either on and stuff like that.

15
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,160
But the goal of this just brief introduction here is to

16
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,290
introduce to you these tools.

17
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:58,425
OpenCV has become a predominant standard of doing any kind of computer vision or

18
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:00,560
computational photography.

19
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,970
It's a toolkit that actually started off from Intel many, many years ago,

20
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,180
but it's become an open standard.

21
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,740
And basically its available to anybody who can download it and

22
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,240
basically write code in C++.

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,930
And now with availability for Python wrap around it, even in Python.

24
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,140
Again, please look at these sites and

25
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,550
look at how we can actually interact with this.

26
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:26,750
What we are going to provide in this class is both an interactive browser, and

27
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,840
I'll show you that in a bit, and also ability for you to download and

28
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,230
actually set this up to do various types of processing of images for

29
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,860
computational photography.

30
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,070
Several of the assignments are going to rely on you to do this kind of coding in

31
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,190
this environment.

32
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:46,230
And share with us as part of different metrics of success of how

33
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,030
we can actually accomplish these goals in this class.

34
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:53,690
The next toolkit and again is a much more widely available as matlab.

35
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:58,300
This is a predominant tool for doing processing of matrices, but and

36
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,760
of course you know images can be represented as matrices and

37
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,610
it becomes actually a very widely used tool for image processing.

38
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:10,750
So if you get matlab you can actually also get the image processing toolkit, and

39
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,710
allows you to do a lot of different types of things.

40
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,770
I'll showcase that in a bit.

41
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,940
For educational purposes it's available at a student discount.

42
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,360
again, you can get that from the MathWorks website.

43
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,530
Again, I am not getting any financial rewards for recommending this.

44
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,470
It's up to you to do so.

45
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,170
Of course there is a public version that is

46
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:32,440
somewhat similar to Matlab also available called Octave.

47
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,110
Of course my hope is that you will interact and

48
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:39,730
play around with these tools to kind of help you create the building blocks that

49
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,150
create the machinery for doing computational photography.

50
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,880
Another toolkit that's become widely used these days is called Processing.

51
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,230
We will not be using much of this in this class, but

52
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,770
I just wanted to introduce this to you a little bit.

53
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,140
And so again a Java based setup that lets you actually play

54
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,790
around with images and manipulate images and videos and stuff like that.

55
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,130
Let's look at all three of these very briefly first.

56
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,970
So this just showcases an example of what we can do in a browser using OpenCV.

57
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:11,840
But of course you can use this extensively on your own workstations after you've

58
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,910
downloaded both OpenCV and Python on your workstations and

59
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,960
got them installed correctly.

60
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,080
Again just by doing simple coding like this we were able to run and

61
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,470
do processing on images.

62
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,950
I've just showed you, you know, smoothing an image, grayscale, edges, and

63
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:26,670
cropping an image.

64
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,620
And all that kind of stuff after I did the test run.

65
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,539
Showed all of the examples on the browser.

66
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,280
When you run this the first time it will be a little slow, and you'll get,

67
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,320
get better as you use it, but

68
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,370
of course really doing more complicated things that we do in this class will be

69
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,580
much better if you do it on your own computer, not on this browser-based stuff.

70
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,600
And you'll be able to actually, you know, save your work and

71
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,730
all that kind of stuff, and in track with the code that you develop.

72
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,590
So this will become a,

73
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,760
you know, tool that I'd like for all of us to use in this class.

74
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,680
And this the primary tool that you'll be doing your assignments and stuff.

75
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,770
I'm here now showing you just a screenshot from MathWorks Matlab.

76
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,030
Again this is a tool that you can also use for

77
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,410
doing a variety of things and it becomes a very interactive tool for

78
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,210
being able to kind of just load images and manipulate images.

79
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,250
For example.

80
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,490
So here I'm basically typing in that I want to assign to the variable buzz

81
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,240
image content from the file buzz3.jpg.

82
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,520
Once it's there I can actually show this image.

83
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,010
Which is basically right here.

84
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:32,340
So just by interactively doing these types of things I can now generate or see

85
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,730
images and of course then I can run various types of processing on these images.

86
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,540
One of the beautiful things about having it in Matlab is that you also can do

87
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,910
variety of things by just you know, using the mouse on it and stuff like that.

88
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,230
Very handy tool.

89
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:49,890
Again, Octave provides very similar facilities and

90
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,180
I encourage you to look at both the MathWorks site and the Octave sites.

91
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,810
Again, I do want you to make sure that you're picking up on

92
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,108
these concepts on your own.

93
00:04:57,108 --> 00:05:01,290
We will not be getting into a lot of these details in the class.

94
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,540
again, these are introductory materials which, and there's lots of

95
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,650
material out there on the web for you to get familiar with these things.

96
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,610
Finally, this is processing.

97
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,390
I, I'm just showing you again the main console window for this one.

98
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,590
I've just inputted in a simple code.

99
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,670
Most of the time you'll have two different types of things.

100
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,550
One, do us a little bit of a setup.

101
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,410
Here are basically says the size of the file.

102
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:26,370
I'm actually loading in this file, and then basically displaying this image.

103
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:30,380
And of course we can just run this and it displays the image.

104
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,687
Again, we can now do a variety of regular processes on this image because what,

105
00:05:34,687 --> 00:05:38,820
in essence, we know is how to display an image which also mean now we

106
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,370
have the entire image in our code to do a variety of things with.

107
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,340
And once we have code we can interact with this code to do a variety of things.

108
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,120
For example, here I am just going to now change this code, run it again.

109
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,680
And if you notice what I basically have done,

110
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,470
put half of the image of buzz here at this point here, so.

111
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,000
Simple processing like this can be done, and again,

112
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,330
in this one we'd be actually leveraging Java style code.

113
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,320
Three simple tools for you to play around with images.

114
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:09,140
Again, I want to emphasize that we will be using one of them more extensively.

115
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,080
So I just briefly showcased three different tools.

116
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:18,520
again, I want to emphasize, this is a tool that you can use in the browser, and

117
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,420
also interact with on your own computer by installing the tools.

118
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,940
Please look at the OpenCV and

119
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,900
the Python sites and get familiar with these things.

120
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,920
We will provide with various types of recommendations how you

121
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,370
can get set up on this.

122
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:36,270
Welcome to use and get access to MatLab and Octave if as, as much as you want.

123
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,370
Those of you interested in doing these kind of things with processing,

124
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,890
you can feel free to do this.

125
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,520
I do want to remind everybody that most of the assignments and

126
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,490
stuff that we will be providing would be actually in this domain and

127
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,940
we'll also be providing some sample code to get you started.
