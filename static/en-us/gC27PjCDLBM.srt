1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,147
We first took the number and decreased it by 7, so a minus 7. We multiplied that

2
00:00:05,159 --> 00:00:10,027
result by 3, so I say 3 times the quantity a minus 7. Finally, we divide the

3
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:14,784
amount by 2. Notice I put the entire quantity over the number 2. I need to

4
00:00:14,796 --> 00:00:19,931
divide this entire number by 2. You chose the last one, nice work. We know it's

5
00:00:19,943 --> 00:00:24,968
not the first one because we know a minus 7 times 3 is really a minus 21. And I

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:30,145
didn't subtract 21 from my original number, so this one's out. Here I would have

7
00:00:30,157 --> 00:00:35,156
multiplied by 3 first. which we didn't do. so this one's out as well. the same

8
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:36,818
is true for the third case.
