1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,550
Now, everything is set for
the execution of the experiment.

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,970
The new candy product is shipped
to the treatment stores, and

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,590
the experiment is run for one month.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,420
At the end of the month,
the results are in,

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,910
and it's now time to
dig into the results.

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:19,390
If you remember lesson two,
when analyzing a completely randomized

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:23,129
design, we used a T-test to test
the difference between the two groups.

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,520
We're going to do something similar for
a matched pair design, but

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,930
since we're comparing each treatment
to one or more control units,

10
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,700
on a unit by unit basis,
we'll use a slightly different T-test.

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,260
In the randomized experiment,
the T-test compared the mean and

12
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,310
variance of the treatment observations,
to the mean and

13
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,000
variance of the control observations.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,527
In matched pair design,
the T-test looks at the mean and

15
00:00:48,527 --> 00:00:51,420
variance of the difference
between each matched pair,

16
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,880
to see if it's significantly
different than zero.

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,680
This methodology is used inside of
the A/B analysis tool in Alteryx.

18
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,970
We'll walk through an example next, and
discuss how to interpret the results.
