1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,110
Well these are the answers, of course the main step,

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,780
first step is the illumination where we control the light.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,280
Optics where we take the light, the rays of light, into a manageable medium.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,040
Sensor which converts it into digital information.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,390
Processing where we take this digital information and do something with it.

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,590
Display is to how we share the information and

7
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,780
the user can do a variety of things with it.

8
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:20,770
So the six elements, and

9
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,350
again we'll be referring to that extensively in this class.
