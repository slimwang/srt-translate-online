00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:04,512
So here's the answer. Initially we create a restaurant object and we see that it

2
00:00:04,512 --> 00:00:08,578
has the is yummy method we defined that always returns false. But is yummy is

3
00:00:08,578 --> 00:00:12,551
just an attribute we can assign that to something else. So let's create a new

4
00:00:12,551 --> 00:00:17,280
function we'll call it real yummy that always returns true. And just to test it

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,643
really yummy returns true. So now what we really want to do is replace. The

6
00:00:21,643 --> 00:00:28,580
value of the is yummy attribute of chez bananas with really yummy. And now when

7
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,734
we call this procedure well we're just calling the really yummy procedure

8
00:00:32,734 --> 00:00:36,845
redefined. It always returns true. Note that there is a difference here. The is

9
00:00:36,845 --> 00:00:42,081
yummy is a method and that implicitly is bound to this chez bananas object. The

10
00:00:42,081 --> 00:00:47,163
really yummy takes no parameters, it's not a method, it's just a procedure that

11
00:00:47,163 --> 00:00:51,180
always returns true. And I should have a very clear warning. Although we can do

12
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,788
this, it's really confusing. So please don't do this, don't reassign methods to

13
00:00:55,788 --> 00:01:00,415
new values unless you've got a really, really good reason. And if you've got a

14
00:01:00,415 --> 00:01:03,895
really good reason for wanting to do this kind of change, post it on the

15
00:01:03,895 --> 00:01:07,615
discussion forums, and make sure that people agree that it's a really good

16
00:01:07,615 --> 00:01:09,273
reason. There probably isn't one.
