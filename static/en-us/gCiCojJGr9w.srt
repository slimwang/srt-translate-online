1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,400
The media queries used most often for

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,890
responsive web design are,
min-width, and max-width.

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,810
Max-width rules are applied
any time the viewport width,

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,138
is less than the value specified.

5
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:18,075
For example, max-width 500 pixels
is matched when the viewport is

6
00:00:18,075 --> 00:00:20,370
500 pixels or less.

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,720
It's also possible to create queries
based on min device width, or

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,480
max device width, but
this is strongly discouraged.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,740
The difference is subtle,
but very important.

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,250
Min width, is based on the size
of the browser window.

11
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,610
Where as min device width,
is based on the size of the screen.

12
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:43,470
In addition, using device width,
can prevent content from

13
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:49,370
adapting on desktops or other desktops
that allow the windows to be resized.

14
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:54,450
Because the query is based on the actual
device size, not the browser window.

15
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,910
The other reason, some browsers, [COUGH],

16
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,170
the Legacy Android browser,
may report the wrong value.
