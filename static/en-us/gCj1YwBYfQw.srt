00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,570
Let me illustrate the use of signifiers. How

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,244
do you start and stop this video? Feel

3
00:00:06,244 --> 00:00:10,418
free to experiment. See that right pointing triangle,

4
00:00:10,418 --> 00:00:14,850
down there? That's a pretty universal symbol, to

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,430
mean play. Click on me to play the video. And when you click on it, it

6
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:23,180
changes to two vertical bars. Again, pretty universal

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,920
symbol for pause. Click on me to stop

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,850
the video. Now, how would you know that, before you ever experienced

9
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:37,280
it? Usually you have to be told. Or sometimes they label it, play and pause.

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,766
But once you've learned it, it's the same all over. So that simplifies things.

11
00:00:40,766 --> 00:00:51,310
But hey, there's more. Click any place on the screen, it stops the video.

12
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:56,250
Click again, it starts it. Pretty neat, huh? But no visible signifier.

13
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,370
How would you ever learn that? You just have to know. Oh, and while you're at

14
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:06,360
it Double-click. What happens? Hm. So what

15
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,290
do you think? These invisible signifiers that

16
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:13,990
make it easier to do the thing. Is that good design, or bad design?
