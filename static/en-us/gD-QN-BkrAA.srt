00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Question 2 tests that you understand procedures as well as the if construct.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The question is "Which of the following have exactly the same behavior as the procedure below?"

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
For two procedures to have exactly the same behavior, that means

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
that no matter what the inputs are, the caller couldn't tell

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
the difference between the two procedures, so it produces the same output.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
They both have the same side effects.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
In this case, we've defined a procedure here.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It uses the procedure "test"--we haven't shown you how test is defined.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You should assume that test is a procedure that takes a number

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
as its input and outputs a Boolean.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But you shouldn't assume anything else about test.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Your goal is no matter what the procedure test does to figure out

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
if the choice has exactly the same behavior as the procedure showing here.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Here are the choices--check all the choices that have

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
that have the same behavior as the procedure defined here.
