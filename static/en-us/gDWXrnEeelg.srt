00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,310
My name is Azad Balabanian.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,029
&gt;&gt; Dioselin Gonzalez
&gt;&gt; Andrey Doronichev and

3
00:00:05,029 --> 00:00:07,380
I'm a group project manager at Google.

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,320
&gt;&gt; I'm the creative lead at Upload.

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,410
&gt;&gt; Virtual reality principal
engineer at Unity Labs.

6
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,110
&gt;&gt; I changed my career to virtual
reality because I firmly believe that

7
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:20,500
VR is the future of computing and media
&gt;&gt; I was doing computer engineering.

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,250
We had a class on virtual reality, and
they were telling us about this brand

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,250
new virtual reality technology
that was invented by a Venezuelan.

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,910
Hearing about her story really inspired
me to get into virtual reality.

11
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,110
&gt;&gt; I changed my career to
virtual reality because

12
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,950
this is the playing grounds for
what's coming.

13
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,576
And to get your feet wet this
early is really important from

14
00:00:41,576 --> 00:00:43,059
a design perspective.

15
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:43,708
&gt;&gt; In the past,

16
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:47,619
elements of digital world were always
constrained by a screen, big or small.

17
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:50,900
And then for the first time,
we got this rare,

18
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,240
amazing opportunity to
step into the video.

19
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,750
To step into the world of computing and
be surrounded by digital elements.

20
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,640
Move around,
interact with them naturally.

21
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,710
&gt;&gt; Virtual reality is
the mix of different senses.

22
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:09,700
So create a truly multi sensory system

23
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,090
is one thing that is
a huge opportunity today.

24
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,980
&gt;&gt; And that changes the way
you design software.

25
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,800
It changes the way you build it and
optimize it.

26
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,320
&gt;&gt; Virtual reality is honestly just
the step in the next direction of where

27
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,460
computing is going.

28
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,940
It's a very open field for
anyone to jump into and

29
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,570
actually make a name for themselves.

30
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:30,810
&gt;&gt; So for me it was a way to help
defining the future of computing.

31
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,570
And learn critical skills that will
make me relevant to this industry for

32
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,820
the next decade.

33
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:41,260
&gt;&gt; I'm Christian Plageman, co-founder of
Google's VR team and curriculum lead for

34
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,798
VR here at Udacity.

35
00:01:42,798 --> 00:01:45,910
In this nanodegree program,
we bring you an amazing curriculum

36
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,650
to jump start your career
as a VR developer.

37
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,970
Here you will build a portfolio of
projects to showcase your new skills.

38
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:55,620
Each of these projects will
be reviewed for you and

39
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,440
you'll receive personal
detailed feedback.

40
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,150
You will learn the foundations
of VR as we cover 3D scenes,

41
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,990
script programming, a little bit
of science, a little math and

42
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,585
a whole lot about how to create
great reality from scratch.

43
00:02:09,585 --> 00:02:13,150
By paying extra attention to VR design,
we'll explore what makes a VR

44
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:17,820
experience compelling, comfortable,
easy to use and immersive.

45
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,090
Now is the time to learn the skills
needed to make high quality

46
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,490
VR experiences yourself.
