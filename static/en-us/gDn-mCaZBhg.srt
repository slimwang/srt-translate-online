00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,476
Let's pretend again, for a minute, that's Grant's interest is compounded just

2
00:00:03,476 --> 00:00:08,468
one time a year. If you invest that same $10,000 at that same 3% annual rate,

3
00:00:08,468 --> 00:00:15,030
then after four years, he'll have this amount of money, as we saw before. Let's

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,545
talk about what this means, this expression here. $10,000 represents the

5
00:00:20,545 --> 00:00:25,540
principle. This initial amount of money he invested and it goes right here.

6
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:31,136
Point o three here is the interest rate written as a decimal. Three percent

7
00:00:31,136 --> 00:00:37,336
becomes point o three. Then last but not least we have our exponet four. This

8
00:00:37,336 --> 00:00:41,270
represents the number of years that the money has been invested in the account.

9
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,420
Now this worked fine for compounding just one time a year, but it's not going

10
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,194
to work as well for compounding twice a year. If we switch the compounding to

11
00:00:49,194 --> 00:00:53,034
twice a year instead of once a year, then this is the expression we came up

12
00:00:53,034 --> 00:00:59,160
with. So what can we say about comparing these two expressions we've just seen?

13
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,500
I'd like you to tell me that by filling in this sentence. When we switch from

14
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,050
compounding interest once a year to twice a year, what happens to the interest

15
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:12,354
rate and what happens to the exponent here?
