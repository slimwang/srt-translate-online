1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,570
All right so I just written
out our equation for Q' and

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,570
substituted in the definitions
that we think are true.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,870
What the new Q' is in
terms of the old Q and

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:14,440
what the new rewards are in
terms of the old rewards.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,810
And so if this works.

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,040
If we can do a bunch of if and only ifs
that actually bring us to something that

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,450
we know is true then we should be good.

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:23,740
>> Okay.
>> So

9
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,180
>> All right how can we,

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,810
we do have an equation for Q.

11
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:30,920
We don't have an equation for
Q minus psi of s.

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,330
But maybe we can cancel some things?

13
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,590
>> Oh,
I can see two things we can cancel.

14
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:35,270
>> All right.

15
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,020
>> Okay, so the first psi of s on
the left side of the equals sign?

16
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:38,590
>> Yep.

17
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,190
>> That matches up with the first
psi of s right next to r.

18
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,200
Yes, right there.

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,940
>> Yeah, because we're summing this
over all next states, all next S'.

20
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,380
And this sums up to 1,
it's a convex combination.

21
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,430
>> Right, so that means,
effectively you could take it out.

22
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,820
It doesn't depend on S' anyway.

23
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,810
And they go away.

24
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:59,050
Good, so now we got Q(s,a) on one side.

25
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,840
And then you can actually
handle the next one.

26
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,860
If you look at the next psi of S'.

27
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,670
The gamma of psi S'.

28
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,670
Well that matches with
the minus gamma of S'

29
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,470
inside the max because that
max is multiplied by a gamma.

30
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,100
>> Good.
Right.

31
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,680
Right, right, right.

32
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,810
Yeah, so it's interesting.

33
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,870
And the max itself is not impacted
by this quantity because it doesn't

34
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,060
depend on a prime.

35
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,100
It is in fact a constant.

36
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,420
>> So
we can actually take out this constant.

37
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,910
And it actually cancels this one.

38
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,080
And look what we're left with.

39
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,130
>> The original equation.

40
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:30,760
>> Ta da.

41
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,250
We're left with the original Q equation,
which we know is true and

42
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,830
so this is true if and
only if the original thing is true.

43
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,280
This is an actual solution
to the Q equation.

44
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,920
The Bellman equation and so, right,
this is what happens to the q function.

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,330
It's the old q function shifted
down by the potential function.

46
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,891
>> Right.
And at no point do we divide by zero, so

47
00:01:48,891 --> 00:01:49,676
everything is great.

48
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:50,440
>> Right.

49
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,840
And how do we know that we still
have the same optimal policy?

50
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,890
>> In which case?

51
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,880
So we know we have some optimal
policy for this Q function.

52
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,510
This new Q function Q prime
has an optimal policy.

53
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,480
How do we know it's the same?

54
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,320
>> Well because it's just
the original Q function and

55
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,180
you're just being shifted
around by a constant and so

56
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,700
it doesn't change the max and therefore
it doesn't change the optimal policy.

57
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,278
>> Exactly.

58
00:02:12,278 --> 00:02:14,640
Awesome.
All right, so this now gives us

59
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,400
three total different ways of
messing around with rewards

60
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,940
to give us new q functions that
don't actually change the policy.

61
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,600
>> That's really nice.
So, I have a question.

62
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,240
>> Sure.
>> You didn't

63
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,590
write anything down here about any
restrictions on the potential function.

64
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,640
>> That's right.
>> Does there have to be any

65
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,630
restrictions on the potential functions?

66
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,260
Maybe potential
restrictions potentially?

67
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,630
>> [LAUGH] I'm going to say no because
it is all going to end up being okay and

68
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,540
cancelling out.

69
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,140
So, there is a sense that
you've actually not changed

70
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,570
anything by throwing in one of these
additional potential functions.

71
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,770
Maybe it can help us learn faster?

72
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,620
Here, lets look at an example
where this might matter.

73
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,120
>> Okay.
