1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,090
Clients and servers can be most
simply understood as computers

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,900
communicating across the Internet.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,750
We define the client as the computer
that wants information, and the server

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,160
as the computer that has information
that can be shared with clients.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,600
This means that a client has to initiate
communication to request information,

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,690
while the server constantly stays
listening for any clients to communicate

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,130
with it, and responds with the data
that the client requested.

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,190
Let's briefly discuss some of the
important concepts in order to better

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,500
understand how this actually happens.

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,540
So we know that clients and servers
can communicate with each other, but

11
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,880
how do we know that they're all
speaking the same language?

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,660
Well, protocols are like the grammatical
rules that we use to make sure all

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,700
machines on the Internet
are communicating in the same way.

14
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,720
There are several protocols that
computers on the Internet adhere to.

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,390
The most common three
are the Transmission Protocol, or TCP,

16
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:52,780
the Internet Protocol, IP, and
the HyperText Transfer Protocol or HTTP.

17
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,410
The Transmission Control Protocol or
TCP enables information

18
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,100
to be broken into small packets and
sent between clients and servers.

19
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,570
If a packet is lost somewhere along the
way the sender and receiver have a way

20
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,842
of figuring out which of the packets is
missing and request that they be resent.

21
00:01:07,842 --> 00:01:12,690
The counterpart to TCP is UDP, User
Datagram Protocol, which is good for

22
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,140
streaming content like music or video.

23
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,220
Similar to postal addresses, IP
addresses allow messages to be properly

24
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,310
routed to all participants
on the Internet.

25
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,540
For simplicity's sake, we can assume
that every device on the Internet gets

26
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,520
an IP address that is
either statically or

27
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,480
dynamically assigned by
the Internet service provider.

28
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,600
Here's the IP address of my laptop,
and here is the IP address for Google.

29
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,380
When I type google.com into my browser,
my computer first figures out the IP

30
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,120
address of Google by looking it up
in a Domain Name Server, or DNS.

31
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:47,510
Think of DNS as a big online phonebook
that finds theIP address of web URLs.

32
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:51,410
Once DNS gives my computer the IP
address, it uses that address to

33
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,530
initiate communication with
the server for Google.

34
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,030
Since multiple applications using
the Internet can run on one machine,

35
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,280
operating systems use ports to
designate channels of communication

36
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,880
on the same IP address.

37
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,590
Placing a colon after an IP address,
with another number indicates that we

38
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:11,200
want to communicate on a specific port
on the device using that IP address.

39
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,609
On most machines,
port numbers can range from 0 to 65,536.

40
00:02:16,609 --> 00:02:20,641
The first 10,000 ports are often times
reserved by the operating system for

41
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,050
a specific use.

42
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,640
Port 80 is the most common port for
web servers.

43
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,780
So most websites we use every day
are hitting port 80 when they

44
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,370
reach a server.

45
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,090
8080 is also a common port for
web communications.

46
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,170
When client and server applications
are on the same machine

47
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,800
we indicate this with
the term localhost.

48
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,629
Localhost also has a special
IP address of 127.0.0.1.

49
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:47,195
Whenever we type localhost, or this
special IP address into a browser or

50
00:02:47,195 --> 00:02:50,000
web application,
the operating system knows to look for

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,640
this resource locally and
not go out to the Internet.
