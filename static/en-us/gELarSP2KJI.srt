1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now we're going to take a really quick quiz,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
and the question is would you consider it likely

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
that the timing of inputs is important for testing:

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
a, software under test that interacts directly with hardware devices,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
b, software under test that interfaces with other machines on the internet,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
c, software under test that is multi-threaded,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
or d, software under test that prints time values into a log file.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Go ahead and write all of the answers that you think are good ones

9
00:00:30,000 --> 99:59:59,999
into the text box here.
