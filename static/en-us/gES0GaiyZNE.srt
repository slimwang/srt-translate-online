1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,240
In some sense you might think that the visual system is making a mistake, right,

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,750
I mean after all these two squares have the same amount of

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,140
photons hitting your eye and

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,960
yet your brain says, no that one is made out of darker stuff than this one.

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,750
But of course what's actually happening is your brain is sort of decomposing

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,130
this problem into the amount of illumination and the underlying reflectants.

7
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,880
Let's use this example to frame the problem a bit.

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,950
First of all we're going to assume that we have a Lambertian surface.

9
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,870
And what we mean by a lambertian surface you remember is just the,

10
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,400
the lightness that will, will come back to the camera.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,380
I'm just going to use the term lightness.

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,550
I'm not going to use radiance or irradiance, etc,

13
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,680
because I'm, I don't want to worry too much about that particular physics.

14
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,070
Basically I just want to talk about the lightness that the camera sees as,

15
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,790
is being a function of just three things.

16
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:53,575
The I is just the power of the illuminate, the strength of the light.

17
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:58,350
Rho is the albedo and then there's this theta angle and

18
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,730
the cosine of the theta determines the brightness of it.

19
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,616
And it's just the angle between the illuminate and the,

20
00:01:04,616 --> 00:01:09,570
the normal, sometimes called the incident angle because it's the incident angle.

21
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,870
The problem is, we have this ambiguity, all right?

22
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,730
Let's combine both the angle and

23
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:20,000
the strength of the illuminate into a single term E.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,590
Just think of that as energy or something like that, right?

25
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,760
It's the amount of energy incident on this,

26
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,740
we've already taken into account the cosine angle.

27
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,030
And then we also have some reflectance function maybe it's just the albedo R.

28
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,620
So the brightness at any point of time is equal to

29
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:40,660
this product of the reflectance times the energy, R times E.

30
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,190
So L is equal to R times E.

31
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,820
So, we can think of it this way, right?

32
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,670
E is the amount, is the sort of the appearance of a white piece of

33
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,250
paper with the given aluminant, right.

34
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,084
So if you were reflecting everything everywhere,

35
00:01:54,084 --> 00:01:58,500
E would just be what it would look like if I had a white piece of paper.

36
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,190
Likewise, R, the reflectance, if I just had a constant white light,

37
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,340
all right, we're not worrying about color, but just constant light.

38
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,030
It's sort of the plainer patch, that's,

39
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,000
that's what the, the, the reflectance is.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,070
And L is what we see.

41
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,940
All right.

42
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:18,950
And the problem is, if we measure L and we want to recover R,

43
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:23,680
the question is how is this possible because we might not know E, right.

44
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,020
So E can vary, right?

45
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,510
It can fall off, you know, because of the shadow, etc.

46
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,080
So the question is, how can we do this?

47
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,400
And the answer to do this is we have to make some additional assumptions.
