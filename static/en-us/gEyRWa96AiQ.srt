1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,440
First, let's look at the quantity covariance.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,820
First we take the expectation value of x minus the mean of x and

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,650
y minus the mean of y multiplied together.

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:21,860
This quantity is the covariance between the variables x and the variable y.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,130
The Pearson's correlation coefficient, is given as the ratio between

6
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:35,400
the covariance and the standard deviations of x and y multiplied together.

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,680
Scipy happens to have a built in library called pearsonr,

8
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:48,260
that calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient between two variables.

9
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:53,390
In our case, we want to calculate the relation coefficient between f1 and f2.

10
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,470
Let's run this code.

11
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,980
We get the values of 0.99.

12
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,480
This shows a direct

13
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,800
linear correlation between the variables f1 and the variable f2.

14
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,300
This sort of makes sense.

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,370
What that means, is that the average MediCare payment amount,

16
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:23,560
is directly proportional to the average MediCare allowed amounts.

17
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,900
You can also use the core plot method from c born to

18
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:34,550
quickly give you a correlation matrix of all your variables.

19
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,950
Let's run this code.

20
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,830
Upon running you will see a matrix like this.

21
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,860
It calculates the correlation between two variables that can be

22
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,430
calculated as they need to be numerical values.

23
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,340
In this case, we have a heat map that denotes all

24
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:59,180
the correlations between the different variables in our data set.

25
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:05,060
This is a nice little tool, to look at all the variables in their data set,

26
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,690
and see how they are correlated with each other.

27
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:13,060
If you want to learn more details on correlation coefficients,

28
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,280
please look in the referenced book in the instructor's notes.
