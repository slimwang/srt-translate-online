1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,910
So let's see if we know how to use multiple predictors and

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:07,060
combine their decisions. Suppose that we have a program in

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:12,960
which a 2-bit predictor works just fine for 95% of our instructions.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,670
A PSHARE predictor works just fine for the same 95% of the instructions,

5
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:24,320
plus it also works fine for 2%. That this 2-bit predictor doesn't cover.

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,880
So, overall, it works fine for 97% of full instructions, but the 95% here and

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,800
here overlap. A GSHARE predictor, again, works just fine for

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,500
the same 95% that all the other predictors are just fine for.

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,400
Plus it works fine for the other 3%. So overall, it's 98% accurate.

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:52,170
95 of those are the same as the 2-bit predictor. But the three that

11
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,930
it covers in addition to that are not the same. But the three that it covers in

12
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:02,750
addition to that are different from the 2% that the PSHARE predictor covers.

13
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:08,110
So together, these three predictors should be able to correctly predict

14
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:13,160
all instructions. So the question for you is how do we combine them.

15
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:18,450
So the overall predictor that we will use is a, what kind of predictor.

16
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,410
That chooses between a what kind of predictor and what kind of predictor. And

17
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:28,620
this last predictor here, itself, will choose between what kind, and

18
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:34,910
what kind of predictor. Instead of writing in the names of the predictors.

19
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:40,000
Just select among the following. So for each of them say if it's A, B, C, D or

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,242
E. A is the 2-bit predictor. B is the PSHARE predictor.

21
00:01:45,242 --> 00:01:50,090
C is the GSHARE predictor. D is the Tournament predictor.

22
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:55,836
E is a Hierarchical predictor. And F, is the Return Address Stack.

23
00:01:55,836 --> 00:02:01,579
So again, for each of these five boxes, put which letter corresponds,

24
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:06,110
to the predictor, that is the right answer for that box.
