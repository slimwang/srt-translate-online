1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:05,490
So when it said somebody didn't respond
well to an adverse thing that happened.

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:11,080
Reasonable people of course can have
different answers and agree to disagree.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,875
They did a number of things
that were kind of right.

4
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:16,735
They actually discovered it themselves.

5
00:00:16,735 --> 00:00:19,010
It wasn't in the newspapers [INAUDIBLE].

6
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:23,195
They fairly quickly actually
reached out to law enforcement,

7
00:00:23,195 --> 00:00:24,735
also customers and so on.

8
00:00:24,735 --> 00:00:27,845
So a number of people feel that
they actually did a good job,

9
00:00:27,845 --> 00:00:33,355
there were some things that they
didn't do as well according to others.

10
00:00:33,355 --> 00:00:37,020
One was that since they
responded fairly quickly,

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,170
they didn't know all the details
of the response was kind of weird.

12
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:46,310
Others said, well, they didn't
inform other key stake holders,

13
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,210
or people that they had business with,
and things like that.

14
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:53,400
But overall, I think tone was positive,
so I'm going to pick a yes here.

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,260
If you read more about it and
you have a different opinion and

16
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,340
you have a good justification for
it, here it's okay to choose a no.
