00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,190
Okay, so here we are on our browser. I'm going to

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,060
open up those developer tools again, which in Chrome that's just

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,680
an, an option. And I think Firefox has fairly similar options.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,740
I don't know about Internet Explorer. When I get this little

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,500
JavaScript console, and we don't have to know JavaScript but I

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,344
am going to show you one thing we can do. I say

7
00:00:15,344 --> 00:00:19,070
document.cookies, cookie. I can actually get a list of all the

8
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:24,930
cookies in JavaScript. And then I can actually say document.cookie equals,

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,820
visits equals one. There are ten thousand and one. Okay, now I've

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,920
just set that cookie. Trust me. And when I reload this page.

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,650
Thank you web server. You are the best ever. Pretty

12
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:43,660
neat huh? We just cheated. So, let's say we actually want to

13
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,029
implement this feature, and we didn't want people to cheat.

14
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,370
Let's talk about how we might prevent people from doing that.
