00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,225
Alright. So, let's see how we can add 1/3 of strawberry icing and 1/2 of vanilla

2
00:00:05,237 --> 00:00:10,125
icing together. I need a way to compare 1/3 and 1/2 of the cake. If I cut the

3
00:00:10,137 --> 00:00:14,725
cake into equal size pieces for both of them, then I could add the parts

4
00:00:14,737 --> 00:00:19,659
together. Let's split up our cake into sixths. I'm going to split every third

5
00:00:19,671 --> 00:00:24,896
into to two equal parts. Doing that, I can see I get 2/6 of the cake is covered

6
00:00:24,908 --> 00:00:30,437
in strawberry icing. So, how did I get from 1/3 to 2/3? We doubled the number of

7
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:35,552
pieces we had altogether, I went from 3 pieces to 6. So, I know I needed to

8
00:00:35,564 --> 00:00:40,930
multiply the denominator by 2. I also doubled the number of pieces I had. I had

9
00:00:40,942 --> 00:00:46,100
1 out of 3 and now, I have 2 out of 6. Notice I'm multiplying by the number 1, 2

10
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:50,735
divided by 2 is still 1. I'm just changing what this fraction looks like, I'm

11
00:00:50,747 --> 00:00:56,220
not changing its value. We can still see 1/3 is 2/6. I'm going to use the same

12
00:00:56,232 --> 00:01:01,489
approach to make 1/2 into sixths. I'm going to split up this cake into 6. To

13
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:06,413
change from halves to sixths, I need to multiply by 3 over 3. I know 2 times 3

14
00:01:06,425 --> 00:01:11,610
gives me 6. And then for the numerator, 1 times 3 is 3. Visually, I can see that

15
00:01:11,622 --> 00:01:16,045
1/2 of the cake frosted in vanilla icing is the same as 3/6 of the cake also

16
00:01:16,057 --> 00:01:20,370
frosted in vanilla icing. I multiplied by 1 here, so I'm not changing the value

17
00:01:20,382 --> 00:01:24,660
of this fraction, I'm just changing what it looks like. Now that I have my cake

18
00:01:24,672 --> 00:01:28,880
split up into sixths, I have 2/6 of it frosted in strawberry, and 3/6 of it

19
00:01:28,892 --> 00:01:32,845
frosted in vanilla icing. Now, I can just add my sixths together. I have the

20
00:01:32,857 --> 00:01:37,515
same sized pieces, so I can just count them up. I can see that 2/6 and 3/6,

21
00:01:37,527 --> 00:01:43,509
altogether, makes 5/6. And here's what it would look like on one cake. I have

22
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:49,428
half of it covered in vanilla icing and 1/3 of it covered in strawberry icing.

23
00:01:49,553 --> 00:01:55,130
This would be 1/6 of the cake, 2/6 of the cake, 3/6 of the cake, 4/6 of the

24
00:01:55,142 --> 00:02:00,082
cake, and 5/6 of the cake. So, when my fractions were just 1/3 and 1/2, I

25
00:02:00,094 --> 00:02:04,980
couldn't add them together. I had to get a common denominator first. I had to

26
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:09,902
get them into the same size pieces. So, how do I add fract ions together once I

27
00:02:09,914 --> 00:02:13,302
have a common denominator? Let's try this with a quiz.
