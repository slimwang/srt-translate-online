1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,430
So let's talk a little bit about stereovision.

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,970
How do humans do it?

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:05,550
And at the very,

4
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,990
very end of the course we'll talk about the physiology of the human system.

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,830
But today I just want to talk about the computation.

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,930
If you think about it,

7
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,690
you can imagine that stereo is done a couple of different ways.

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,720
One way might be that you sort of find some regions in one image and

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,880
then you find those regions in the other image and your brain compares them and

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,390
sees how they've shifted relative to each other and

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,790
then somehow find, figure out the depth.

12
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,610
Another possibility is that maybe you just process the very

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,320
low level images doing some sort of a comparison and get the depth.

14
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:48,480
So you do fusion first, and then you do recognition.

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,880
So if theres a question of whether you do monocular recognition and

16
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,730
then fuse, or you fuse the images and

17
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,910
then do binocular, that is given the fused images to the recognition.

18
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,970
So back in the 60s a psychophysicist named Bela Julesz wanted to

19
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,620
look at this question.

20
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:07,680
So to test this he made a pair of synthetic images which were

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,540
obtained by essentially spraying black dots on white objects.

22
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,220
All right?

23
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,535
So here's a notional description comes from the Forsyth and Ponce book.

24
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:20,230
Of sort of putting imagine that those are white and you sprinkled pepper or

25
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,730
you sprinkled black dots all over the whole thing.

26
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,620
And you took one picture from this side and another picture from that side.

27
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,520
What you'd get are these two images.

28
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,200
Okay?

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,420
Now, when you look at those two images you don't see anything in there.

30
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,080
But if I showed them to you in stereo, which is very difficult for

31
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:44,140
me to do here you would actually see that block raised.

32
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:44,900
All right.

33
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,760
So what we can do is we can animate those we can

34
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,830
animate random dot stereograms in the same way that we animated the swimmer.

35
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:59,420
I don't have animations of this one, but I do have animations here of this well,

36
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,160
if you look at this for a little while I hope you'll see a shark.

37
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,970
So everybody see the shark?

38
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,050
Okay. So this is the, the heads sort of sticking out.

39
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,820
Then it bends around and then the tail sticks out again.

40
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,970
So you'll notice, notice I just drew that tail.

41
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,060
Okay.

42
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,610
But of course the tail is not in any individual picture.

43
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,490
It's only in understanding the difference between them.

44
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,380
Now this was actually done from what's called an autostereogram website.

45
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,390
You can go take a look.

46
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,860
There are ways of making these so

47
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,000
that if you just, you can use the same picture, cross your eyes, or,

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,570
or stare at them differently that you'll get different images in the two eyes.

49
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:42,630
But I think you get the idea that from these two images, you can see the depth.

50
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,000
And what's interesting is if I present one to one eye and

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,850
one to the other, you see that depth.

52
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:52,040
So the answer to Ullage's question was whether you process the image first

53
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,630
finding these regions and then line them up to do the stereo.

54
00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:01,430
Or you first line up the sort of little, local pixel area in order to do the,

55
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,090
the stereo, it's clear that you do that first.

56
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,240
You don't have, you, that you do the stereo first.

57
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,960
You don't have to have any specific objects or region.

58
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,060
Sort of a clean way of saying it is that human binocular fusion,

59
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,749
fusing the two together, is not based upon matching large-scale structures.

60
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:23,550
Or any individual process of the image is actually based on

61
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:27,450
a low-level process that directly fuses the two images.
