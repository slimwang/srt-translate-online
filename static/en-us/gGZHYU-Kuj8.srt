00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,130
When we finished our last lesson,

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,860
our networking code was beginning
to look bloated and clunky.

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,590
This was the result of us throwing
together code without considering

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,030
sound design.

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,290
In this lesson, we are going to fix
that problem by adhering model, view,

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,690
controller paradigm.

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,830
We're going to do this while we
build the Movie Manager app.

8
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,960
Before we dive in,
let's go back to Travis and

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,032
hear his thoughts on building great
apps that use the Movie Database.
