1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,980
So lets dig a little deeper into

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,450
what we mean by the Happened Before Relationship.

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,270
I'm going to denote the Happened Before Relationship

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:12,500
with this arrow. A happened before B. That's

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,660
what this notation means. What this notation is implying is one of two things,

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:25,370
either A and B are events in the same process which means given a belief that

7
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,750
a process is sequential A must have happened before

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,570
B. If it was a textual order A is here

9
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,560
and B is here then A must have happened

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,680
before B and that's one possibility. Or if you're asserting

11
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,640
that A happened before B and A and B are not events on the same process but A is

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,280
an event in one process, B is an event in

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,706
a different process. Then there must be a communication event

14
00:00:50,706 --> 00:00:55,360
that connects A and B. In other words, if A is a communication event of a

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,710
message, and B is a receipt of that

16
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,800
same message. Then, A happened before B, where

17
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,660
A is the sender of the message and B is the receiver of the message. So,

18
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:11,210
this is the implication of saying that an

19
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:16,150
event in a distributed system A happened before B,

20
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,860
and these events can be anywhere in the system.

21
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,000
Anywhere in the system an event could be happening

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,750
A, and another event could be happening B, and

23
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,450
if we are asserting that A happened before B, what

24
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,640
we are implying is one of these two possibilities.

25
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,550
One is that A and B are events in the

26
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,850
same process or A is the act of a

27
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:41,160
sending a message and B is the act of receiving

28
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,640
a mess, the same message on a different

29
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,450
node of the distributed system. The other property

30
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,560
of the happened before relationship is that it

31
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,290
is transitive. What I mean by that is,

32
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:54,040
if we're asserting that there is an event

33
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,300
A that happened before B. And this event

34
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,970
B happened before C. The implication is this

35
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:06,080
relationship is transitive ad therefore A happened before C.

36
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,990
So that's the transitivity of the

37
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,710
Happened Before Relationship. Now that I introduced

38
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:14,410
to you the Happened Before Relationship it is time for another fun quiz.
