What you just learned is called a "P-controller" where P stands for proportional.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Here is a really trick question by which I want to test your intuition--

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
one that doesn't have a unique answer, but it has a best answer.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Suppose you do what I just said. You steer in proportion to the crosstrack error.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That is, your steering angle is proportional by some factor of tau to the crosstrack error.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What will happen with the car?

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It never quite reaches the reference trajectory? It overshoots?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 99:59:59,999
Or either can happen?
