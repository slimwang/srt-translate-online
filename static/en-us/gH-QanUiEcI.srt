00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's take a look at the answers together,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It's going to turn out that we'll be able to compute this, fairly systematically,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
just by remembering the rule for how to compute the closure.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We have a dot in front of the nonterminal E,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
so I go over to our grammar

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and find all of the rules that start with nonterminal E.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And there are 3 of them, and I'm going to add all of them to chart[2]

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
with a red dot right at the beginning and a from2--

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
because that's where we currently are--1, 2--

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
as they are little provenance information off here, to the right.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So one of our rules is:

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
(E --> int)

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
so we will definitely add (E --> dot int from2).

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Again, the from2 is because we brought in

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
or we computed the closure, starting in state[2].

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Another possible rule is:

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
E --> (F).

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So (E --> dot (F), coming from position 2)

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
is a valid prediction we might make.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We might see parentheses right after seeing a minus sign; that's valid for this language.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Now our third rule is: (E --> E - E)

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
so this option may look very tempting.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's got the (E - E).

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's got the dot in the front, but it has the wrong (from) state information.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's included from0 instead of from2.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We need to remember these 2 tokens we've seen previously--the (E) and the (-).

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We need to know which state we were in

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
when we decided to take the closure.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
This one is not correct.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Over here we see one that's very similar:

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
(E --> E - E, with a dot in front).

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That's very good; it's a rule that starts with (E),

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and we need to start with (E) because the dot is before the (E).

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And this one correctly has from2.

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We computed the closure in chart[2].

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And finally, this one's a bit of a ringer--

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
it has (F --> dot string from2).

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Well, the from2 looks pretty good; the dot at the beginning looks very good.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But our rule is: since this dot was before an (E),

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
we take all the grammar rules that start with (E)

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
on the left-hand side, and that's it.

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So (F --> string)--that's out of place.

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm not going to predict seeing a string

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
until I've seen an open parenthesis.

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
If you think about this grammar,

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
the only way to get to string is after an open parenthesis.

47
00:02:11,000 --> 99:59:59,999
I haven't seen one of those, so this is a bad prediction.
