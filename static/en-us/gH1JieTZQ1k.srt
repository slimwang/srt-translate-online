1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,840
Take a look at these columns of text.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,880
Some of you may be able to read
all of the columns and for

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,640
some of you, it might be a little
difficult or frustrating,

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,700
especially as we get further
over to the right here.

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,420
And what you're looking at is
a range of of contrasts and

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,750
above each column, I've placed a
contrast ratio which is the relationship

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,440
between the foreground color and the
background color in terms of luminance.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,885
When the colors are very similar,
we have a low contrast ratio.

9
00:00:26,885 --> 00:00:29,523
When the colors are very different
we get a high contrast ratio.

10
00:00:29,523 --> 00:00:34,416
In section 1.4.3 the web link
checklist recommends a minimum

11
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:38,795
contrast ratio of 4.5 to 1 for
all body text and images.

12
00:00:39,825 --> 00:00:43,582
An exception is made for
a larger text text that's about 120 or

13
00:00:43,582 --> 00:00:46,192
150% larger than the default body copy.

14
00:00:46,192 --> 00:00:49,270
For that larger text the ratio
can go down to 3 to 1.

15
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,650
And the contrast ratio of 4.5
to 1 was chosen as a minimum,

16
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,095
because it compensates for
the loss in contrast sensitivity,

17
00:00:56,095 --> 00:01:00,905
usually experienced by users with 20/40
vision and 20/40 vision is commonly

18
00:01:00,905 --> 00:01:05,209
reported as the typical visual acuity
for someone of around 80 years of age.

19
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,260
So, looking at our columns of text,
we can see that really only these

20
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,260
first two columns would pass for
acceptable body copy.

21
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,040
The third one here is just a little
too low on the contrast scale, and

22
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,615
this last one is far too light.

23
00:01:19,675 --> 00:01:22,015
Now I mention that these
are contrast minimums.

24
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,045
So while they might work well for

25
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:27,425
someone who has lost a bit of vision as
they age they will not necessarily work

26
00:01:27,425 --> 00:01:31,236
well for all users, especially those who
suffer from a low vision impairment.

27
00:01:32,415 --> 00:01:35,745
For users with low vision impairments,
or color vision deficiencies

28
00:01:35,745 --> 00:01:38,815
we can increase the contrast
up to a ratio of 7 to 1 for

29
00:01:38,815 --> 00:01:42,400
body copy and 4.5 to 1 for larger text.

30
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,120
Looking again at our
columns we can see that,

31
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,670
really only this first column
would meet that criteria.

32
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,740
Now since most modern web sites
use a range of type sizes and

33
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,880
colors, you're going to need a way
to quickly audit your page to

34
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,240
verify that you're meeting
these contrasts requirements.

35
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,600
To do this we can use the Chrome
accessibility dev tools extension.

36
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,790
So what I want to do is audit this page,
I'm going to open my dev tools,

37
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,830
I'm going to go to the Audits panel and
I'll run an accessibility audit.

38
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,700
And I can see that the extension is
reporting a number of accessibility

39
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,150
errors all related to my anchor tags.

40
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,270
So let me go inspect one of those anchor
tags right now, click on this one

41
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:24,820
right over I'll bump the font size up
a little bit so this is easier to read.

42
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,670
And when I go and
look at the accessibility properties for

43
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,310
this item I'm presented with
a number of options here.

44
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,470
First I see a warning indicating
that my contrast is just too low.

45
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,959
And then I see options for
minimum and enhanced contrast.

46
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,230
Now the nice thing is that
the hex values are right here so

47
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,160
I can just copy these into
my style sheet if I want.

48
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,900
But one really cool feature of
the dev tools extension is that I can

49
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,970
click on the swatches and see
the anchor tags update in the document.

50
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:58,820
So I can see here for instance that that
is what the enhanced colors would look

51
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,620
like in my application.

52
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,420
Now, in the next lesson,

53
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,410
I'm going to have you audit
a page using the same extension.

54
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,620
So that way,
you can fix up any errors that you find.
