1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,980
Even though two variables might appear to have a relationship if we look at the

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,922
sample data, this could just be due to chance. And you've learned this before,

3
00:00:08,922 --> 00:00:12,282
when we take a sample and we get that the sample mean is really far from the

4
00:00:12,282 --> 00:00:18,546
population mean, this could have just been due to chance. Similarly, just

5
00:00:18,546 --> 00:00:23,504
because our sample data works like it has a relationship, the actual population

6
00:00:23,504 --> 00:00:29,072
of people might not or vice versa. Our sample data might not have a

7
00:00:29,072 --> 00:00:33,889
relationship but the population actually does. Things like this naturally

8
00:00:33,889 --> 00:00:38,127
happen with sampling error as you've seen before. And we are more sure as the

9
00:00:38,127 --> 00:00:43,628
sample size increases. The question is, how much variation due to sampling

10
00:00:43,628 --> 00:00:49,320
error is allowable before we decide that our results are not due to chance?

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,479
Again, we do Hypothesis Testing. Now, r is the correlation we get from our

12
00:00:54,479 --> 00:01:00,659
sample data. Rho, which looks like a p, is the true correlation for the

13
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:06,250
population. Given this what do you think the null and alternative hypothesis

14
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,070
are
