00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So we've learned about two of the three Ms:

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
the mean, the median, but not the third,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
so let's focus on the third, the mode.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I will use as an example a children's birthday party.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If you've ever been to one of those,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
there's usually kids and some of their parents.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This one happens to have 5 kids and 4 parents,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
or 9 people in total.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let me write down the ages of the kids and their parents:

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
4, 3, 32, 33, 4 again, 32 again, 3, 38, and 4.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So one of the things we can compute for this is the mean age

12
00:00:38,000 --> 99:59:59,999
of all the people at the party.
