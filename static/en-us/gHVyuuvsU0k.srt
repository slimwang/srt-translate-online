00:00:04,445 --> 00:00:08,960
So one of the most powerful things about
Kaggle is that anyone can sign up and

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,070
participate in the majority of our
competitions and interesting use cases.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,819
Previously, these use cases were only
exposed to a small number of people in

5
00:00:17,819 --> 00:00:20,701
the world who are considered
the experts in that problem.

6
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:24,861
But whether the really interesting
things that we've noticed as we've

7
00:00:24,861 --> 00:00:29,157
watched patterns over who participates
and who wins in the competitions,

8
00:00:29,157 --> 00:00:33,318
is there's basically no correlation
whatsoever between expertise and

9
00:00:33,318 --> 00:00:35,520
who wins competitions.

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,640
We have the occasional competition
that was targeting astronomy and

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,810
run by astronomer.

12
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,800
But for every one like that we
have ten where an English major

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,030
will run bioinformatics competition or
a physicists write

14
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:54,010
a brain signal processing competition or
components along those lines.

15
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,280
So we think it's really powerful
to expose certain to use case for

16
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,980
madness domain to a large
community around the world.

17
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,843
That includes hedge fund traders and
clients, to electrical engineers and

18
00:01:05,843 --> 00:01:09,585
computer engineers, to mathematicians
and physicists, to history and

19
00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:12,442
English majors that all share
common passion for data.

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,843
One of the really fascinating
competitions that we've hosted is what

22
00:01:19,843 --> 00:01:23,280
are molecular activity
production with Mark.

23
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,830
We're at a set of 15 problems
that took different features.

24
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:32,690
Describing the structure or molecule for
each of the problems range in between

25
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,710
a couple hundred and
a couple thousand molecules.

26
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,960
And to many thousands of numerical
descriptors on the molecule or

27
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,090
properties.

28
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,450
And then, targeted different
things in the via like whether or

29
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,700
not the molecular to respond.

30
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,210
This target would respond to
the molecule in the body whether or

31
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:50,540
not the molecule would be likely toxic.

32
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,890
And it foment or
things along those lines.

33
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,640
And that was our first
time that we had to

34
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,510
serve techniques called deep learning
when non-computer vision competition.

35
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:06,471
So it's really fascinating to see the
approach that the top team in that which

36
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:11,203
was one of Jeff Hinton's PhD students
used to when it was something called

37
00:02:11,203 --> 00:02:15,632
a multi task deep technical network
where the same neural network was

38
00:02:15,632 --> 00:02:18,186
trained across the 15 sub problems.

39
00:02:18,186 --> 00:02:20,872
So it leveraged information
from one sub problem

40
00:02:20,872 --> 00:02:23,623
to improve the results on
the other sub problem and

41
00:02:23,623 --> 00:02:27,898
that enabled it to do better than all
the other solutions in the competition.

42
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:31,109
[BLANK_AUDIO]

43
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:35,254
Yes, usually during a competition
itself that top people in our community

44
00:02:35,254 --> 00:02:39,596
are incredibly competitive but after the
competition so over it swaps to a very

45
00:02:39,596 --> 00:02:43,876
collaborative environment where in
most cases there's a winning interview

46
00:02:43,876 --> 00:02:48,250
published with the top teams where
they describe the solution in depth.

47
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,220
In many cases,
we actually release code for

48
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,570
the winning solution as well, all
the competitions we host for research

49
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,270
require the top three participants
to open source their solutions.
