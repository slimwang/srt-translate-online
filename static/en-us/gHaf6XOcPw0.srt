1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,490
That's right, even such a small change,

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,770
causes a slightly more than one percent drop

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,930
in user engagement, and realized income. Now

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:10,040
that may seem tiny, but one percent of

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,300
your income is probably pretty significant when

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,990
it's such a small performance change. If the

7
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:20,490
perf delay is a second, revenue drops by more than double. It's not even linear.
