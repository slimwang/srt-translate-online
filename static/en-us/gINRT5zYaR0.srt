1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,360
The solution of the previous quiz 
said that we had to define

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,660
the wide detail fragment layout
in two places:

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,260
the layout-land 
and the layout-sw600dp folder.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,363
To avoid having 
multiple copies of this file,

5
00:00:11,363 --> 00:00:13,406
we should use layout aliasing.

6
00:00:13,406 --> 00:00:15,900
We can check the documentation
for layout aliases

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,449
to see an example.

8
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:20,018
Saw we have a main layout file
that's for one pane UI.

9
00:00:20,018 --> 00:00:22,617
In the layout-large 
and layout-sw600dp folders,

10
00:00:22,617 --> 00:00:25,190
we want a multi-pane layout.

11
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,273
In case you're wondering, 
layout-large

12
00:00:27,273 --> 00:00:29,596
is for backward compatibilty
purposes for large devices

13
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:31,810
prior to Android 3.2.

14
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,283
That's when the SW qualifiers 
were introduced.

15
00:00:34,283 --> 00:00:35,896
So back to the point.

16
00:00:35,896 --> 00:00:38,290
To avoid code duplication, 
we can define the two pane layout

17
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,483
in the base layout folder.

18
00:00:40,483 --> 00:00:43,076
Then, in the values-large
and values-sw600dp folders,

19
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:45,450
we can create a reference 
so that the main layout

20
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,100
actually maps to the two pane layout.

21
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,822
In the Java code, you can
reference it as r.layout.main,

22
00:00:50,822 --> 00:00:53,640
but it's actually referencing 
the two pane layout.

23
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,100
This is what the detail fragment 
should look like afterwards.

24
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,780
And this is what the phone
landscape view looks like.

25
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,340
If you rotate the device,

26
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,460
the phone portrait view 
should be different.

27
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,610
In the next coding task, 
we're going to make

28
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,040
the today list item 
look more like the other items

29
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,980
in the list for the tablet.
