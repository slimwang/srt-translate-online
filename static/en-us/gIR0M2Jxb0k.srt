00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,471
Now the next thing we're going to do is calculate this standard deviation. But

2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:09,164
this time, since we're trying to estimate population parameters, you're going to

3
00:00:09,164 --> 00:00:13,609
use the formula for the sample standard deviation. Remember that this is just

4
00:00:13,609 --> 00:00:18,078
like the population standard deviation except we divide by n minus 1. This is

5
00:00:18,078 --> 00:00:22,566
Becel's correction to make the standard deviation a little bit bigger, since the

6
00:00:22,566 --> 00:00:27,119
standard deviation of the sample tends to underestimate the variability. So go

7
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,465
ahead and try and calculate the sample standard deviation. And this will be a

8
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:32,659
good review for you.
