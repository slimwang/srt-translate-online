Wow, we've discussed a lot of stuff here. We know what the slope looks like,

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,774
it's the steepness. We know what it means for slope to be positive, negative,

3
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:11,762
zero, or even undefined. We can calculate the slope between two points using a

4
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:15,602
fancy equation, and we've learned how to read an equation in slope intercept

5
00:00:15,602 --> 00:00:20,573
form, and a little bit in standard form. That's a ton of material. I know that

6
00:00:20,573 --> 00:00:30,713
we've covered a lot, so you make sure you take some time to practice these

7
00:00:30,713 --> 00:00:37,204
skills, and then come back when youre ready.
