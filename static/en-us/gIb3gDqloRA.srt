00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,556
So an initial plugging in of these numbers gives us this right here, which I'm

2
00:00:04,556 --> 00:00:09,162
not going to read out because as you know, I'm pretty lazy. Anyway, now I'll go

3
00:00:09,162 --> 00:00:13,502
through and simplify within each of these spots to figure out what numbers

4
00:00:13,502 --> 00:00:18,336
belong there. I'll leave that negative 5 out front. Under the radical we'll have

5
00:00:18,336 --> 00:00:22,345
25 minus 24, which is just 1 and the denominator becomes 2. Awesome.
