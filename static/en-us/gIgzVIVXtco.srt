1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,560
Jay, how did you implement this?

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,080
>> Well, it went a little like this.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,710
We can see the problem building up.

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,470
I already have over 60
photos cashed to solve this.

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,310
I'm going to start by creating a ray
of images that I want to keep,

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,980
then I'll create a transaction.

7
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,220
To look at the witches objects store.

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,930
Then I'll get the object store and
get all the messages.

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,590
Now we can take a peek
into the database.

10
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,590
For each message, I'll look to
see if it has a photo property.

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,750
This contains the photo URL, but
without the width bit at the end.

12
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,200
So I'll add those to the array
of images that I want to keep.

13
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,290
Then I'll open the images cache and

14
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:42,980
get all the requests that
are stored in it using cache.keys.

15
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,760
Now, the URLs on request
objects are absolute.

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,850
So they'll include the local
host port 8080 bit,

17
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:53,050
whereas the URLs was storing
an index Db, they don't have that.

18
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,920
So for
each request I'm going to pass as URL.

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,350
So now if the path name of the URL
isn't in our array of images needed,

20
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,870
I'll pass a request to cache.delete.

21
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,180
So now with force update enabled,
I'll refresh the page.

22
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,260
And I've only got seven images cached.

23
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:09,760
Job done!

24
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,740
We're caching photos now,
we're so very nearly there.

25
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,890
The last thing we need
to deal with is avatars.

26
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,140
One more chapter before we
achieve total offline first.
