00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,287
>> Instead of choosing those two points, I'm going to choose two other points.

2
00:00:04,287 --> 00:00:08,640
We can see that to go from this point to the second point, we need to rise three

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,038
units up and run six units to the right. Because we went up vertically three

4
00:00:13,038 --> 00:00:17,508
units, we know that this is a positive 3. And since we traveled six units to the

5
00:00:17,508 --> 00:00:22,270
right, we know that the run is really positive 6 in the positive direction. When

6
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:26,558
we find the slope, or the m, we're really finding the ratio of the rise divided

7
00:00:26,558 --> 00:00:31,320
by the run. We already know that 3 6ths is really the same thing as 1 half. This

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,691
is great, we got the same slope as from before. We can see that the slope of 3

9
00:00:35,691 --> 00:00:40,227
6ths is the same thing as 1 half. It always puts us on our line. But remember we

10
00:00:40,227 --> 00:00:44,457
can also read slope in other directions. I don't have to start from this point

11
00:00:44,457 --> 00:00:49,164
and go to this point, I could go in the reverse direction. If I started from

12
00:00:49,164 --> 00:00:53,868
this point, 6, 6. I would travel down three units, and then left six units. So

13
00:00:53,868 --> 00:00:58,982
here, the vertical distance is really a drop. It's a 3 unit distance down. So

14
00:00:58,982 --> 00:01:03,926
the rise would be negative 3. We move three units down in a negative direction.

15
00:01:03,926 --> 00:01:08,964
And 6 units left in a negative direction. Since both of these directions are

16
00:01:08,964 --> 00:01:14,312
negative, we know the rise is really negative 3. And the run is really negative

17
00:01:14,312 --> 00:01:19,148
6. A negative divided by a negative makes a positive so we are left with 3 6ths,

18
00:01:19,148 --> 00:01:23,889
or 1 half. That's pretty cool. Any way we try and find the slope, we always get

19
00:01:23,889 --> 00:01:28,776
the same ratio. We just need to be careful about our directions and our negative

20
00:01:28,776 --> 00:01:29,257
signs.
