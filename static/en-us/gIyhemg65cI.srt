1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,840
Let's take a bird's eye view of the process we just went through in transforming

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,658
this equation. Since we were aiming for having a perfect square at the end, on

3
00:00:07,658 --> 00:00:11,552
the right-hand side of the equation involving x and a constant, we knew that the

4
00:00:11,552 --> 00:00:15,269
initial constant we started out with couldn't be right, since right now, we

5
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:18,997
can't factor x squared minus 8 x plus 15 to be in this form. That means, we need

6
00:00:18,997 --> 00:00:22,701
a different constant attached to the two terms with x in them. So, the first

7
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:26,413
step was to get rid of the initial constant we had so that we could have a

8
00:00:26,413 --> 00:00:30,679
different constant, on the end of the x squared minus 8x. You've figured out the

9
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:34,640
constant that belonged at the end of those two terms was 16. When we add 16 to

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,758
this, we get the perfect square of a binomial. This process is called completing

11
00:00:38,758 --> 00:00:42,058
the square, since the constant that we add on over here ends up giving us a

12
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:45,700
squared expression as our answer. Now, we don't' technically have to move the 15

13
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,210
away from the right-hand side to do this. But I think that it makes dealing with

14
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,666
these two terms on their own a little bit easier, since we don't have anything

15
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:56,125
else to look at on the right side. So, completing a square is a crucial part of

16
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:59,676
transforming equations of parabolas from standard form, into the form where we

17
00:00:59,676 --> 00:01:03,620
can see the vertex. Now that we understand how to complete this square and the

18
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,484
importance of that technique in transforming equations from one form to another,

19
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:10,900
I'd like you to rewrite the equation y equals x squared plus 5x plus 6 in the

20
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,677
form that we've been talking about. Now, if your numbers get a little bit messy

21
00:01:14,677 --> 00:01:18,239
in here, don't worry. That doesn't mean you're doing the problem wrong, that

22
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,672
often happens in math. So, just go with it and then at the end, you can always

23
00:01:21,672 --> 00:01:25,247
check your answer by plugging in points to the equation that you start with and

24
00:01:25,247 --> 00:01:28,345
the equation that you end with to make sure that they're the same.
