1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,129
All of these but one are correct. We saw in the problem we did for Grant that we

2
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:08,092
have to change both sides of an equation in the same way to make sure that we

3
00:00:08,103 --> 00:00:12,378
maintain equality. So this last choice down here is correct. The answer we ended

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,233
up with also was a way of expressing an unknown quantity in terms of other

5
00:00:16,442 --> 00:00:20,925
information that we had, which is this third choice. When we found that c equals

6
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:25,357
6.5, we could plug that number back into our original equation to make it a true

7
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:29,789
equation. So, this first answer works as well. We could not, however, change one

8
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:34,158
side of our equation. We could not, however, change one side of our equation in

9
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,087
a different way than the other side. And we also didn't have in mind, in

10
00:00:38,099 --> 00:00:41,810
advance, what number we wanted the variable to equal. So, this answer right

11
00:00:41,822 --> 00:00:44,860
here, the second one, is not something that we want to select.
