1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, linear filters can also be applied

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
to very different matrices.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This is what's called a Gaussian kernel.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You can see it over here.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's a matrix whose value is maximum

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
at the center of the matrix and whose value falls

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
exponentially to the side of this matrix.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's a Gaussian in 2D, as you can see over here.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So, what happens if we convolve an image

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
with a Gaussian kernel?

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Let me ask your intuition on the following quiz,

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and it's completely okay if you get this wrong.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
If you convolve an image with a Gaussian kernel, what do we get?

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
An edge detector, a corner detector,

15
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,999
a blurred image, or none of the above?
