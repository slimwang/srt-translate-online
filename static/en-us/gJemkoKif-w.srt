00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,140
The answer is that neither language is
recognizable or at least it isn't clear.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,770
We can't just simulate every input
because no matter how long we run

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:09,840
the simulation.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,000
Even with dovetailing, there will be
some input that we haven't checked yet.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,960
Now consider the confident language,

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,460
those Turing machines that
don't halt on some input.

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,940
Well I could try simulating all inputs
until I find one it does not halt on.

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,540
But how would I tell
that it doesn't halt?

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,110
It's unclear for now and we will see
how actually we can't tell in general.
