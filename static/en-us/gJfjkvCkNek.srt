00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,480
A lot of the important work on neural
networks happened in the 80's and

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,260
in the 90's but back then computers
were slow and datasets very tiny.

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,050
The research didn't really find many
applications in the real world.

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,480
As a result, in the first decade of
the 21st century neural networks have

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,685
completely disappeared from
the world of machine learning.

6
00:00:20,685 --> 00:00:23,890
Working on neural networks
was definitely fringe.

7
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,910
It's only in the last few years, first
seeing speech recognition around 2009,

8
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,900
and then in computer vision around 2012,

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,770
that neural networks
made a big comeback.

10
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,160
What changed?

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,740
Lots of data and cheap and fast GPU's.

12
00:00:38,825 --> 00:00:40,635
Today, neural networks are everywhere.

13
00:00:40,635 --> 00:00:43,445
So if you're doing anything with data,
analytics or

14
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:47,165
prediction, they're definitely something
that you want to get familiar with.

15
00:00:47,165 --> 00:00:47,925
So let's get started.
