1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,996
Here was the expression we agreed upon for the last two books of stamps. I'm

2
00:00:04,008 --> 00:00:07,959
going to show you two ways of doing this and then we're going to figure out

3
00:00:07,971 --> 00:00:11,698
which way is correct based on our diagram. For this first one, I'm going to

4
00:00:11,851 --> 00:00:15,893
start in the parentheses. I know I need to simplify containers first. When I

5
00:00:15,905 --> 00:00:19,284
look at this two, I can choose between the exponent or I can choose

6
00:00:19,296 --> 00:00:23,396
multiplication. I'm going to choose the exponent first, so I'll get 2 times 5

7
00:00:23,408 --> 00:00:27,916
times 4. I know 2 squared is 4. Right here, I have multiplication. Remember that

8
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:32,073
whenever you have a number outside of a parentheses, we just have multiplication

9
00:00:32,086 --> 00:00:36,158
in front. 5 times 4 is 20 and I finish simplifying my parenthesis. Now, I can do

10
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,024
2 times 20, which is 40. This time for this second one, I'm still going to start

11
00:00:40,036 --> 00:00:43,871
in parentheses, but for this two, I'm going to choose the, the multiplication

12
00:00:43,883 --> 00:00:48,020
over the exponent. So I'm going to do 5 times 2 first, so I have 2 times 10

13
00:00:48,032 --> 00:00:52,921
squared. I know 10 squared is 100, so I have 2 times 100 and I get 200. Okay.

14
00:00:52,923 --> 00:00:57,801
One of these answers is correct. I know that in one book of stamps, I have 20

15
00:00:57,813 --> 00:01:00,728
stamps, so in two books, I must have 40 stamps.

16
00:01:00,735 --> 00:01:04,318
So here are two books of stamps and I can see that I should have 40 stamps

17
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:08,173
altogether. So I know that this method was correct. So, let's go back and look.

18
00:01:08,262 --> 00:01:11,356
Here is where I made the choice. The two could have been paired with

19
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:15,136
multiplication or with exponents. I know that the two should be paired with the

20
00:01:15,148 --> 00:01:18,675
exponent. The exponent takes priority over multiplication.

21
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:22,300
So with our order of operations, we know that we need to add in another

22
00:01:22,312 --> 00:01:26,130
priority. Okay,. So when faced with the decision between an exponent and

23
00:01:26,142 --> 00:01:30,159
multiplication, I know that the exponent or the power should come first. So

24
00:01:30,171 --> 00:01:34,420
powers take the highest priority in our order of operations. When doing my order

25
00:01:34,432 --> 00:01:38,585
of operations, I know power should come first, multiplication and division

26
00:01:38,597 --> 00:01:42,631
should come second, and then addition and subtraction should come third. So you

27
00:01:42,643 --> 00:01:46,646
might be wondering where parentheses fit on our order of operations. Well, we

28
00:01:46,658 --> 00:01:50,742
just need to make sure we do the order of operations within each parentheses. We

29
00:01:50,754 --> 00:01:54,875
need to simplify any parentheses or brackets before we do any outside operations

30
00:01:54,887 --> 00:01:55,261
on them.
