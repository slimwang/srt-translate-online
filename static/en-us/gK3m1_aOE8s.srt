00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:06,200
As far as the scroll bar is concerned, scroll bars are one graphical way of

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:11,430
supplying numbers to other parts of an application. Were going to use

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:17,650
a traditional scroll bar in which there's it's going to be a vertical

4
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:22,870
scroll bar and it's going to have a movable part of it. That is the user

5
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:27,890
can move a part called the handle which sits in a tray. So you can move up and

6
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:33,170
down, and we when we use the terms handle and tray to indicate that we can set,

7
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:39,250
the user can set the position in the file by by moving this handle up and

8
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,460
down on the tray. The handle position denotes that part of the file that

9
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,600
should be displayed in the view port. So when you move it all the way up,

10
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,540
you get the start of the file, and when you move it all the way down,

11
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,780
you get the end of the file. Also, the size of the handle in proportion to

12
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,300
the size of the tray denotes the portion of the file that is visible. So

13
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:05,170
if all of the file contents fit into the viewport, you'd expect the tray to be,

14
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:10,710
filled up. And if we have a gigantic file, that in a very small window,

15
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,180
we'd expect just a thin handle to appear in the scroll bar.
