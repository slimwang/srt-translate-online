00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,055
In general, we like the ratio between texels and pixels to be around one to

2
00:00:03,055 --> 00:00:07,092
one. If the texels cover too many pixels, we'll get blurring as we saw in the

3
00:00:07,092 --> 00:00:11,504
previous lesson. This isn't so bad for real textures, so erring a bit on the

4
00:00:11,504 --> 00:00:15,486
side of smaller textures is not the worst crime that you can commit. If a pixel

5
00:00:15,486 --> 00:00:21,050
covers too many texels, we get minification which leads to different problems.

6
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,200
For a high resolution checker texture, it simply causes the edges to become

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,350
sharp. However, the problem is much worse than this under normal viewing

8
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:32,384
conditions. Changing the texture resolution does not help. When a pixel covers

9
00:00:32,384 --> 00:00:35,802
more than one texel, minification occurs. This is what's happening in the

10
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:40,014
distance. There's a separate filter on the texture for this situation. The

11
00:00:40,014 --> 00:00:43,158
reason it's separate is that this problem has a different solution. Currently,

12
00:00:43,158 --> 00:00:46,650
this minification filter is set to be nearest neighbor. As we saw for

13
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,806
magnification, this is usually a bad choice. Let's turn on bilinear

14
00:00:50,806 --> 00:00:54,334
interpolation for the minification filter, too. This helps a little bit towards

15
00:00:54,334 --> 00:00:58,050
the middle of the image, but not much. The problem is that each pixel in the

16
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,196
distance covers a few texels. As we get closer and closer to the horizon, the

17
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:06,018
number of texels per pixel increases. When the fragment shader looks up what's

18
00:01:06,018 --> 00:01:08,791
in the texture, it gets whatever texel happens to be at the center of the

19
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:13,801
pixel. At the horizon, this selection is almost random, so we get noise as we

20
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:18,810
vary between white and black texels. Even with bilinear interpolation on, it's

21
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,600
still just noise. With magnification we found that too many pixels covering one

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,848
texel caused blurring. Getting this ratio closer to one to one made things just

23
00:01:27,848 --> 00:01:32,376
right. Here we have too many texels in one pixel. One solution is to go in the

24
00:01:32,376 --> 00:01:36,136
opposite direction than we went for magnification. Instead of making our

25
00:01:36,136 --> 00:01:39,191
checkerboard have a larger and larger resolution, we'd like it if the distant

26
00:01:39,191 --> 00:01:44,452
pixels used a lower resolution texture. This would bring the ratio of texels to

27
00:01:44,452 --> 00:01:48,894
pixels about back to one to one. I can show this by lowering the resolution of

28
00:01:48,894 --> 00:01:52,102
the texture. I'll say it again, the video may not show much difference as these

29
00:01:52,102 --> 00:01:56,134
videos are heavily compressed so that they're quicker to download. Your best

30
00:01:56,134 --> 00:02:00,184
bet is to try this demo out for yourself. It follows this lesson. Anyway,

31
00:02:00,184 --> 00:02:02,788
changing the resolution helps a bit towards the middle of the image, since

32
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:06,815
these pixels have more and more texels as we move to the horizon. Blurriness is

33
00:02:06,815 --> 00:02:10,253
much better than noisiness, especially when moving the view around. Things

34
00:02:10,253 --> 00:02:13,390
still look terrible on the horizon because every pixel in that area covers so

35
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:17,624
many texels that even our two by two texel image fails. If we go to a one by

36
00:02:17,624 --> 00:02:22,394
one checkerboard pattern, that might help a bit. What in the world is a one by

37
00:02:22,394 --> 00:02:26,020
one checker board? Well, its just a single checker square, a single texel.

38
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:30,810
Since I can't put both black and white in this texel, I make this texel grey.

39
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,093
Choosing this texture is like the nuclear option, the horizon looks better than

40
00:02:34,093 --> 00:02:38,382
noise but now everything is grey. To sum up, at some point near the horizon,

41
00:02:38,382 --> 00:02:43,577
there are just too many texels to pixels. So to avoid noise we go to grey. Try

42
00:02:43,577 --> 00:02:47,294
the demo yourself at this point and see how changing the texel to pixel ratio

43
00:02:47,294 --> 00:02:49,330
affects the image.
