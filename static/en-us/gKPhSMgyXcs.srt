00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,060
So, do all genes have this dominant and one recessive component?

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:10,182
>> It's a great question and the simple answer is no. Genetics is complicated. And

3
00:00:10,182 --> 00:00:13,915
we just covered a very basic example of dominance. Complete dominance over

4
00:00:13,915 --> 00:00:17,178
another allele. But there are examples where you have semi-dominance and

5
00:00:17,178 --> 00:00:21,354
co-dominance. And all kinds of other different factors are important in

6
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:26,701
determining this. But, there are many cases where this simple dominance does

7
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:27,910
hold true.
