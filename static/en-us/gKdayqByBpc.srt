1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,710
So here's the idea of using SIFT for

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:08,119
doing things like alignment or recognition of objects.

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:11,270
And the idea is this, you're going to say that your image content,

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:16,079
whatever your image is, you're going to transform that into a representation.

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,370
The word I like to use is a constellation, I'll show you one in a minute.

6
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:24,800
A constellation of local features and that those feature descriptors will be

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,630
invariant to translation, rotation, scale and other sorts of imaging parameters.

8
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,800
So if I take the object and I move it over and I get closer to it and

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,820
I change the lighting, I would get the same descriptors.

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:41,180
And so here's an example of shift descriptors, so you see we've got a truck here

11
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,710
and it might take you a little while to really and in fact here I'll show you.

12
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,550
These are these little neighborhoods.

13
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,440
All right. And these little arrows are just showing you

14
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,420
these little neighborhoods.

15
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,210
Okay. So we've got ones by the tires, and

16
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,570
by this thing, and back here by the logo.

17
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:55,940
What might be a little harder for

18
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:01,000
you to see, is that we have the same truck right here.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,580
All right.

20
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,710
And the point here is, is that a bunch of the same descriptors.

21
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,520
So here's one, and here's another.

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,889
They were both found in the two images.

23
00:01:11,889 --> 00:01:12,880
All right?

24
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,100
And if I can find enough matches, then I can figure out oh,

25
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,544
this image has an object and that object is also in this objec,

26
00:01:21,544 --> 00:01:26,020
in this image,it's just has been rotated, translated a little bit, maybe scaled.

27
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,640
And that's the idea about using SIFT for doing the recognition.

28
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,940
So if your descriptors were robust with respect to these transformations,

29
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,090
you could find them from one image to the next.

30
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,080
By the way, here's another description of the problem.

31
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,010
This one also comes I think directly from the original paper or,

32
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,370
or the second paper.

33
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,840
And suppose you want to find this box of crisp almond cookies,

34
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,230
because we always want to find boxes of crisp almond cookies, in this basket.

35
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:51,770
And what's really interesting about this grocery basket is it has basmati rice,

36
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,390
crisp almond cookies, and the computer vision textbook,

37
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,580
because when you go to Publix, you always buy a computer vision textbook.

38
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:04,670
Anyway, the idea is, can you find this box that's actually over here?

39
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,320
All right?

40
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,990
And the picture that's shown in the original paper which is kind of cool,

41
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,330
looks like this.

42
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:16,130
Although cyan lines are the connection between SIFT descriptors found here and

43
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,800
SIFT descriptors found here.

44
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,500
This is the original image.

45
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,490
This is the box located in the basket of groceries.

46
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,740
So because it could find all those features it was able to say

47
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,600
this object is really right over here.

48
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,250
This was very impressive at the time, in fact continues to be sort of

49
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,180
a strong way of doing certain types of computer vision recognition
