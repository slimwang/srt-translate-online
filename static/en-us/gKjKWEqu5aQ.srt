00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,764
One last thing Lauren said that we're going to discuss, is the idea of

2
00:00:03,764 --> 00:00:08,584
language, thought and culture together. So what happens when we learn our

3
00:00:08,584 --> 00:00:11,062
native language and then we're exposed to people who speak a different

4
00:00:11,062 --> 00:00:15,136
language? Will we be able to understand concepts that they have in their

5
00:00:15,136 --> 00:00:19,506
language, if we don't have those in ours? Well, the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis

6
00:00:19,506 --> 00:00:25,241
states that language creates thought as much as thought creates language. And

7
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:28,202
the idea here is that if we're speaking different languages, we don't have a

8
00:00:28,202 --> 00:00:32,530
common foundation. Therefore, it would be difficult to communicate and

9
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:37,242
translate ideas from one language to the other. Now the linguistic

10
00:00:37,242 --> 00:00:40,882
determination hypothesis, suggest that our language actually determines our way

11
00:00:40,882 --> 00:00:46,386
of thinking and our perceptions of the world. Basically, what they're saying is

12
00:00:46,386 --> 00:00:49,680
that, we don't have a word for an idea or a concept in our language, it's not

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,288
possible to think about that idea or that concept. Now, one very interesting

14
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:59,182
example that seems to support this hypothesis comes from a small tribe of about

15
00:00:59,182 --> 00:01:04,670
200 people who live in the Amazon area of Brazil. Now these individuals have no

16
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:09,592
words for numbers that are higher than two. Therefore it's almost impossible

17
00:01:09,592 --> 00:01:13,597
for them to understand the concepts of nine and ten. And they even have

18
00:01:13,597 --> 00:01:18,543
difficulty with an operation 3 plus 1. Now this is not because these people are

19
00:01:18,543 --> 00:01:22,786
not intelligent. It is because they don't have words for numbers higher than

20
00:01:22,786 --> 00:01:28,723
two. Now let's go back to Lauren for a recap of this section on language.
